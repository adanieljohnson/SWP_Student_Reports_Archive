Report Grading,Rpt_Grade,"The initial grade given for the report, ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 being full credit. This grade was given through a bins-based grading model, using nineteen criteria. 

There are 5 basica criteria which must be satisfied in order to meet the standard for acceptability or else receive a failing grade. Theses are the presence of a clear hypothesis; organization of the report into the format of a scientific paper with appropriate sections (intro, methods, results, discussion); clear data summarized into tables or figures; interpretation of results, including stating whether the hypothesis was supported; and finally, the presence of citations in the appropriate format.

Beyond the basic criteria, graders were instructed to look for technical and writing flaws. Technical flaws include reporting raw data or making errors in figures, not supporting claims with evidence, using statistics incorrectly, not referring to figures or tables, misusing citations, and not connecting claims to evidence. Writing flaws include unclear wording or syntax, lack of clear thought process, lack of precision of language, wordiness, improper diction (should be technical so use of ""emotional language"" or slang should be avoided), or distracting elements that prevent readers from clearly understanding outcomes.

The binned scores range from 0 to 4, with 4 being full credit. A score of 0 means there was no report turned in or the report was plagiarized. A score of 1 means that the report did not meet at least one of the basic criteria. A score of 2 indicates the presence of both technical and writing flaws. A score of 3 indicates the presence of either technical or writing flaws. A score of 4 represents a report that meets basic criteria and has no major technical or writing flaws.","Integer, 0-4"

Quizzes,NOTE: Quizzes,"The last part of our dataframe contains information from quizzes. These quizzes are generally aimed at conceptually preparing the student for an upcoming lab assignment. Many quizzes are simple multiple-choice exercises, while some contain free response questions. All quizzes will contain a _Duration and a _score entry. The _Duration entry contains the time in seconds taken to complete the quiz from the initiation of the quiz. The _score entry contains the integer score for the quiz. These variables are the basis for our “AvgQuizDuration” and “AvgQuizScore” variables provided earlier on in the dataset. Any quiz _FRQ variables contain free response questions that are intended as writing samples for analysis. Not every quiz response will be in the biological report writing style as our lab reports, as some are meant to be more general comments or reflection on reading or labwork. However, as potentially valuable student writing samples, we elected to include all of these free responses in a supplementary file",
