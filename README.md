# SWP_Student_Reports_Archive

This repository contains >4400 student lab reports written for introductory biology courses, plus detailed metadata for each report. A separate codebook describes how the metadata are organized.

All reports were collected as part of a research study conducted at Wake Forest University under supervision of the Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol #00022693, approved January 2017). Only reports from students who provided written informed consent (signatures on file) are available from the archive. 

Reports have been de-identified, and both author and grader names replaced with randomized IDs. All report files have been converted to plain text (.txt) format.
