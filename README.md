# SWP Student Reports Archive

This repository contains >4400 student lab reports written for introductory biology courses, plus detailed metadata for each report. A separate codebook describes how the metadata are organized.

All reports were collected as part of a research study conducted at Wake Forest University under supervision of the Institutional Review Board (IRB Protocol #00022693, approved January 2017). Only reports from students who provided written informed consent (signatures on file) are available from the archive. 

Reports have been de-identified, and both author and grader names replaced with randomized IDs. All report files have been converted to plain text (.txt) format. Examples of BaSH scripts used to strip identifying names and extraneous information are provided in a separate folder.

This archive is intended to be a research resource. The terms of the Creative Commons license allow reports to be used for research and assessment purposes, but __does not allow commercial use in any form__. 

The license also __explicitly states that users must attribute the original source__ when using these documents. These terms mean students are not permitted to submit or use these reports (in whole or in part) in any way that suggests they are the original author of the text.
