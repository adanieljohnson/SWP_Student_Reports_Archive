Title: Betta Fish: Are Male Betta Fish Always Aggressive? 

Abstract:
Betta fish have a long history of being domesticated for contests and enjoyment by their owners. The study of betta fish in particular is critical to gain understanding about the protection of fish and the best environments to put them in. Two male betta fish were placed in small, medium, and large tanks to measure their level of aggressive behavior. The fish did not show more aggressive behavior when placed in the smaller tank and did not show less aggressive behavior when placed in the larger tank. The lack of behavior from each fish is most likely due to the presence of another male betta and the absence of females. 


Introduction:
Studying the behavior of animals is critical to get better understandings of their environments. Fish are commonly placed in tanks and brought into homes. It is crucial that scientists research the behavioral ecology of different species of fish to gain understanding about how to best take care of them as pets. Betta fish, a popular domesticated fish, are known for their aggressive behavior if two males are placed in the same environment. Historically, these fish were domesticated in Thailand for contests (Britannica 2013). By studying their aggressive behavior in different tank environments, we can gain insight about the best ways to keep them safe in a tank at home. In the book Animal Behavior Monographs, the behavior of betta fish in particular is crucial to understanding aggressive behavior across many species of fish (Simpson 1968). As mentioned in a lab done by Manhattanville College, little studies have been done exclusively on the aggressive behavior of males without the presence of females; therefore, our lab is a critical step toward better understanding the behavior of males specifically (Todd 2010). In a lab published in Aquaculture, researchers looked at the relationship between density of tilapia and behavior. Although not betta fish, their study reveals that it is important to not only study the aggressive behavior of fish, but also their environments and allocated space (Gall 1999). This research, suggesting that there is a relationship between space and behavior, helped form our hypothesis. We hypothesized that when two males are placed in a smaller tank together, they will show more aggressive behavior; therefore, when two males are placed in a larger tank together, they will show a less aggressive behavior. Our null hypothesis is that tank size has no effect on behavior. To study their aggressive behavior, we looked to the Bette's operculum. The operculum is a key part of the betta fish that is used to protect the its fragile gills. Crucially, when the male betta fish feels threatened, they will flare out their operculum as an act of intimidating their competitor (Betta Fish.org 2010).  


Materials and Methods:
Two male Betta splendens with different colors were collected and placed separately in a medium sized, 2400 cm3 tank as shown in Fig. 1. A larger 14175 cm3 tank and a smaller 1080 cm3 tank size were also collected. First, the fish were placed together in the control, medium sized tank for 5 minutes. We gave them 5 minutes of rest to avoid habituation. Next, the fish were placed in the smaller tank and larger tanks represented in Fig. 2. We repeated the same steps for 5 minutes together and 5 minutes separate three times for each tank size giving us a total of 9 trials. To measure aggressive behavior we focused on the amount of time the betta fish’s operculum was flared. We had two timers going so each fish’s length of behavior could be calculated.  An ANOVA test was used to comparing the mean amount of aggressive behavior between the small, control, and large tank sizes. 


Results:
Betta 1 is the blue betta fish and betta 2 is the teal colored fish as shown in Fig. 1. When both betta males were placed in the control tank size, Betta 1 showed little to no response to Betta 2. Betta 1 seemed to be hiding and trying to escape by fleeing to opposite ends of the tank. Betta 2, unlike betta 1, showed active responses and aggressive behavior. This held constant for all three trials. The small tank revealed similar results but betta 1 seemed to move around more but did not display a lot of aggressive behavior. The large tank suggested that betta 1 was still static and did not react a lot to betta 2. The ANOVA test revealed that there is no significant difference in the mean amount of aggressive behavior between groups  (df = 17, P = 0.331). The Tukey-Kramer test to compare means between two specific groups was not needed since our p value was insignificant. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the mean time of aggressive behavior in the control sized tank versus the mean time in the small tank. Fig. 4 compares the same thing except with the larger tank size. 


Discussion:
Since our calculated p-value (0.331) is less than 0.05, we do not have enough evidence to reject our null hypothesis; therefore, we cannot conclude that tank size has an impact on behavior of the betta fish and  we can conclude there is no significant difference between the three groups. As mentioned, the lab published in Aquaculture focused on the relationship between behavior and density. We know from previous research that betta fish are historically aggressive but our fish did not reveal this behavior as much as we expected in a smaller tank. They hypothesized and concluded that with an increase in density, and when fish are placed in closer environments, they would exhibit less agnostic behavior since the fish would become more comfortable, less stressed, and exhibit schooling patterns from a decrease in a “persistent dominant hierarchy” (Gall 1999). Although our lab only had two fish, this insight might provide a reason for the betta’s less aggressive behavior. Perhaps Betta 1, who barely reacted, felt somewhat comforted by having another member of his species with him and felt that in a smaller environment he was forced to be complacent. Another lab published in Behavioral Ecology suggests that without an audience, that is, without the presence of females, there is little reason for the males to show aggressive behavior. They concluded that without the presence of females, the male fish had little to no significant change in their behavior (Doutrelant 2001). This research could explain perhaps why one of our males did not exhibit aggressive behavior: there was no reason to. It is important to consider that the betta fished used in this experiment were also used in previous experiments earlier in the week with other labs. This would be the best explanation for why betta 1 in particular was so un-aggressive. Most likely, he had been through so much stress earlier in the week he did not even react to betta 2. This is a huge source of error in our experiment. It would be advantageous, if this lab is performed again, to use fish that were not previously used and in less distress. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to do this lab again with even more betta fish to study the effects of behavior with more than two betta fish and even in the presence of females. Our lab is important for the protection of domesticated betta fish. As a popular pet, it is crucial we gain understanding about the best environments and best tank sizes to place the fish in.
