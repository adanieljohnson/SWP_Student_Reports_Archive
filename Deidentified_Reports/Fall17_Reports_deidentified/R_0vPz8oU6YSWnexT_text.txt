Title: Effect of Calcium Channel Activator 100mM A23187 on the Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rana pipiens 

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to test the effect of calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 on the length of contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens. We hypothesized that injecting calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 in the gastrocnemius muscle would increase the length of contraction. Of the three legs tested, there were three control groups and three groups that were injected with calcium channel activator 100mM A23187. All groups were stimulated to contract by shocking the sciatic nerve with five consecutive pulses at 0.2V. The control group had an average contractile period of 112.4 ms, which decreased to 101.5 ms in the experimental group [t-value: 0.948, df: 2, p-value: 0.443]. The average total time of contraction of the control group was 579.7 ms. and increased to 607.2 ms in the experimental group [t-value: 0.259, df: 2, p-value: 0.8197]. Despite the increase in total contraction length in the experimental group, a paired t-test shows that the results were not statistically significant because the p-value was not below 0.05. This experiment found that the calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 did not significantly increase the length of contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to respond to their internal and external environments. Skeletal muscles in vertebrates and invertebrates are made up of thousands of myofibrils, which are bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups. Within the skeletal muscles, individual myofibrils are innervated by motor neurons to form a neuromuscular junction. Nerve impulses cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter, from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh then binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane which causes sodium channels to change shape and open. Sodium moves down its concentration gradient, depolarizes the post-synaptic cell, and generates an action potential. This depolarization causes calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where it was stored. Within muscle fibers there are two types of filaments: myosin and actin. The three main structures that compose an actin filament are actin monomers, tropomyosin, and troponin. When calcium reaches the actin filament, it binds with troponin. When this happens, the structure changes shape and moves tropomyosin which the myosin binding sites. Now myosin can bind with actin and carry out the rest of the muscle contraction. This process shows that calcium plays a crucial role in muscle contraction, without it contraction would not be possible.
	In an experiment by JPL. Daher, his team tests whether the vanilloid family of transient receptor potential channels (TPRV1), which are essentially a large group of ion channels compromising the vanilloid family, underlie the Ca2+ influx pathway after the depolarization of the postsynaptic vesicle. They already knew that caffeine-induced transients in ganglion neurons are produced by two mechanisms. The first is due to the release from ryanodine receptors. The second is due to activation of an unknown receptor. In this experiment, they measured changes in intracellular Ca2+ to test whether the TPRV1 is the unknown receptor responsible for the Ca2+ influx pathway. Their results found that caffeine is capable of inducing Ca2+ by activating TRPV1 channels [Daher, 2009]. These findings led us to question what would happen if there was an excess calcium influx.
	This experiment will study the effects of calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 on the opening of calcium channels, and consequently on the muscle response in Rana pipiens, also known as the Northern leopard frog. Based on the Daher study, we believe that calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 will prolong muscle contractions because if caffeine can induce calcium by activating TRPV1 channels, this increase of calcium channel activator should allow more release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after depolarization, which would in turn be able to prolong. We hypothesize that the introduction of calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 to the gastrocnemius muscle in the leg of a Rana pipiens will cause the same number of muscle contractions as the control, however the muscle contractions will last longer.


Materials and Methods:
We start our experiment with three freshly prepared Rana pipiens legs, provided by the Wake Forest University Biology Department. This organism is ideal for this experiment because the gastrocnemius muscle is large, contractions are easily visible, and the sciatic nerve is easily accessible. Each leg acts as both a control and an experimental group (resulting in 6 total groups). The control group receives no treatment and is maintained under constant conditions. The experimental group is injected with 1.0 mL of calcium channel activator 100mM A23187. 
The skin is removed from the leg and the thigh muscle is dissected to reveal the sciatic nerve. A string is tied tightly around the bone at the inferior end of the gastrocnemius muscle, and the other end of the string is attached to the force transducer adjuster. Then, a light load is applied to the muscle by raising the force transducer adjuster to create tension. The sciatic nerve is attached to a stimulator which records the contractions on a computer, using a system called LabScribe.
	The threshold stimulus of the nerve is found by stimulating the nerve directly with single pulses of constant duration. The amplitude starts a 0.0 V and it’s increased incrementally by 0.1V until it reaches 0.5. Next, the amplitude is increased to 1.0V and then increased by 1.0V increments until it reaches 5.0V. The threshold stimulus is the first stimulus that resulted in a strong contraction and recording.
	Once the threshold is determined, stimulation of the control begins. Five consecutive pulses are recorded at the voltage that was predetermined as the threshold. For each peak, the contractile period (ms) and total time of contraction (ms) is recorded. Then the gastrocnemius muscle is injected with 1.0 mL of calcium channel activator 100mM A23187. By injecting the control leg with the experimental variable, calcium channel activator 100mM A23187, the control group becomes the experimental group. After 30 seconds, the leg is stimulated under the same conditions as the control group, five consecutive pulses at the voltage that was determined to be the threshold. Again, each contractile period and total time of contraction is recorded. The same process is repeated for each trial. In this experiment, we tested three legs.


Results:
The control group had an average contractile period of about 112.4 ms which decreased to 101.5 ms in the experimental group [t-value: 0.948, df: 2, p-value: 0.443]. This data shows that the control group had a longer average contractile period than the experimental group and a statistical one-tailed paired t-test shows that the results are not statistically significant because the p-value is not below 0.05.
The average total contraction time for the control groups was 579.7 ms and increased to 607.2 ms in the experimental group [t-value: 0.259, df: 2, p-value: 0.8197]. Although the experimental group had a longer total contraction period than the control group a statistical one-tailed paired t-test shows that the results are not statistically significant because the p-value is not below 0.05.

Discussion:
We hypothesized that the introduction of calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 to the gastrocnemius muscle in the leg of a Rana pipiens will cause the same number of muscle contractions as the control, however the muscle contractions will last longer. Our results did not support this hypothesis. The average contractile period of the control group was actually longer than the experimental group [t-value: 0.948, df: 2, p-value: 0.443], and although the total contraction time of the experimental group was longer than the control [t-value: 0.259, df: 2, p-value: 0.8197], it was not a significant enough difference to support the hypothesis. 
Our null hypothesis was that the calcium channel activator would have no influence or effect on the length of the muscle contraction. From the results of this experiment, we cannot reject the null hypothesis because the change in length of the contractile period and total contraction time was not found to be significant. 
The results of this experiment differed from that of the previous study done by Daher and his team. Their study showed that caffeine did have a significant effect on the release of calcium in muscle contractions. However, in our experiment calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 did not have a significant effect on the release of calcium in muscle contractions. Biologically, we expected the calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 to prolong the amount of time that the calcium channels were open which would increase the amount of calcium leaving the sarcoplasmic reticulum. There would have been more calcium present to bind to troponin for a longer period of time and as a result would have continued to lengthen muscle contractions. The results of our experiment may have been due to the amount of calcium channel activator 100mM A23187 that was used. In our data there was a slight, but consistent, increase in the total time for the experimental group. If more calcium channel activator were injected into the gastrocnemius muscle, a larger and more significant difference may be observed. It would be interesting to explore this hypothesis in a further study.
