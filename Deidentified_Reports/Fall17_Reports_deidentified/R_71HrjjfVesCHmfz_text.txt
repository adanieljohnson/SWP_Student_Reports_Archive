Title: Effect of salinity on the photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
The global food chain and agriculture system relies on productive plant growth to meet the demands of an ever-growing society. In past studies salinity has been shown to be detrimental to plants, both at the whole-plant level or through reduced productivity [Asish et al.: 2005]. In this experiment we wanted to test this principle on a micro level through chloroplast extraction from spinach leaves, Spinacia oleraca. Four treatment groups were set up to do this: dark, light + detergent, light and light + salt. We hypothesized that if the extracted chloroplasts are exposed to high levels of salinity for a period of 30 minutes, then we will see a decrease in photosynthetic activity. We found there to be a statistically significent difference in the percent change in absorption between the light and light + salt groups at all 3 time intervals tested. Overall, we saw this result align with other scientific literature on the topic and believe it is a reason to further study this phenomenon in order to avoid plant inefficiency in the future, protecting against unnecessary loss in farming revenue and to improve plant health in urban, populated areas. 


Introduction:
Chloroplast are essential to the energy production of plants across the world. Through chloroplasts, plants are able to run photosynthesis and produce energy for numerous daily functions. We are interested in testing the effect of salt, in this case NaCl, on the rate of photosynthesis in isolated spinach chloroplast due to the high density of chloroplast they contain in their leaves. Specifically, we are interested in how Na+ and Cl- ions might interact with electron transport in chloroplast membranes. It was found in a previous study done on the same topic that salt stress affects plant physiology at whole-plant and cellular levels through ionic and osmotic stress [Sudhir et al.: 2004]. We know that the use of charged ions is the basic driver of the Hill reaction in chloroplast, so introducing other charged ions to the environment can possible create disruption. DCPIP, a compound used as a redox dye, will be used to visually show changes in photosynthetic activity. When reduced DCPIP changes from its original blue color to colorless, allowing a spectrophotometer to read such color changes. Our hypothesis was that if chloroplasts are exposed to elevated levels of salinity in solution, our independent variable, then the absorbance of the solutions at certain time intervals throughout our experiment, the dependent variable, would show a decrease in photosynthetic activity. 


Materials and Method:
To extract chloroplasts from the spinach leaves they were first crushed using a mortar and pestle and grinding buffer. The paste was then strained and 200Ml of the filtered solution was centrifuged at 200xG for 3 min at 4oC. The first centrifuged solution was dumped into another centrifuge tube, extracting 50Ml to set aside. The solution was centrifuged again at 1000xG for 10min at 4oC. The resulting supernatant was transferred to another tube. The remaining chloroplast was used in the rest of the experiment. There were 4 treatment groups in the experimental design: Dark, light + detergent, light and light + salt. Both the dark and light + detergent groups act as the negative controllls with light acting as the positive controlll. The light + salt group is the experimental treatment. Three test tubes were replicated for each treatment group to ensure quality data collection was obtained. A blank was created for use in the spectrophotometer containing just water and 100mM phosphate reaction buffer. The dark group contained water, 130mM DCPIP, and the reaction buffer. The light + detergent group contained water, DCPIP, reaction buffer and detergent (Triton X-100). The light group contained water, DCPIP and reaction buffer. Finally, the light + salt group contained DCPIP, reaction buffer and 1.4M saline. The absorbance for the solutions was measured using a spectrophotometer set to 600nm. Once each test tube contained all reagents needed, each tube’s absorbance was measured (time zero) and then immediately placed into its treatment condition. The absorbance’s were read again at 10, 20 and 30 minute intervals, being placed back into the treatment conditions after each reading. The percent change in absorbance for each treatment group was calculated and one tailed unpaired t_tests were run on each. A q-test was also run on the light + detergent treatment group to determine if there was an outlier in the data.


Results:
The mean percent change in absorbance for our light group was 18.36±5.2 compared to 2.53±0.31 for our experimental group, light + salt. A one tailed unpaired t_test was run for the percent change in absorbance between the light and light + salt treatment groups for 10, 20 and 30 min intervals. The statistical tests run were done so at a 95% confidence interval, each with d.f.=4. At 10 min, p=0.0085 (t=4.82), showing the difference to be statistically significent with p<0.05. At the 20 min interval, p=0.0073 (t=5.04) showing the difference to be statistically significent with p<0.05. Finally, at the 30 min interval, p=0.0086 (t=4.81) also showing the difference to be statistically significent with p<0.05. A q-test was run at each time interval for the light + detergent group as visual inspection of the data showed a possible outlier. For each time interval, Qexperimental>Qcritical (1.0>0.97), showing that there was in fact an outlier in test tube 5. You can see this graphically in Figure 1 as the bars for the light detergent group are significently higher than they should be.  


Discussion:
Our overall goal in performing this experiment was to evaluate the effects of salinity on the process of photosynthesis. We were curious to see if electron transport in the thylakoid membranes would be interrupted or stopped due to the presence of Na+ and Cl- ions in solution. This interruption, we hypothesized, could have possibly fatal effects on the plant as a whole. In our experiment we found this principal to be true. Through statistical tests we were able to observe a very statistically significent difference between our positive controlll, light, and our experimental group of light + salt. This points to the conclusion that there is in fact a negative effect of salt on the process of photosynthesis. In fact, in a previous study it was found that salt stress led to an accumulation of NaCl in the chloroplast of plants. This accumulation was found to be associated with a decrease in the photosynthetic electron transport activity in photosynthesis [Sudhir et al.: 2004]. This can be seen graphically in Figure 1. While most of our collected data was consistent among the different treatment groups, our light + detergent group showed some significent variation. A q-test was run to statistically determine whether or not an outlier was present. It did in fact show an outlier in our second test tube for light + detergent at all three time intervals. This most likely occurred from an error in the measurement of our solution components. Specifically, there was most likely excess chloroplasts added to the tube. This would result in the abnormally high percent change in absorbance that we observed. In future experiments, a study in a more macro system like a full plant or small group of plants would be logical to see if similar results can be seen when a full plant is exposed to elevated salinity levels. Also acting as a comparative study, testing plants with mutations that make them resistant to NaCl buildup should be done. The everyday implications of elevated soil salinity are far reaching although not always obvious. In fact, a 2000 study found that salinity is the major environmental factor limiting plant growth and productivity [Allakhverdiev et al.: 2000]. Simple activities like salt spreading in winter conditions to more complex systems of pollution can all have an equally expensive and meaningful impact on their environments. This calls for more investigation into solutions for this problem that has the potential to affect agriculture systems across the globe.
