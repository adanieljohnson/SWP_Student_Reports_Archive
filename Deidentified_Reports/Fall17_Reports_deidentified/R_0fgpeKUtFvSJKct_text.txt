Title: The effect of different colored lights on the rate photosynthesis of spinach (Spinach oleraca)

Abstract:
	The main objective of this study is to determine if different colored lights will influence the photosynthetic rate of spinach (Spinacia oleraca) when compared to white light. The experiment heavily relies on the isolation of chloroplast through a series of suspension. Because photosynthesis uses light as the source of energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, the light absorbed is a variable that can either increase or decrease the rate of photosynthesis. The Hill Reaction is utilized to track the transfer of electron in the chloroplast, which is then calculated to photosynthetic activity. 13 solutions were prepared for the experiment with a set of 3 tubes treated under blue, red, or green light. The 3 remaining tubes are treated under either no light, white light, or no chloroplast (blank). A hypothesis was made that blue light will yield the highest rate of photosynthesis in comparison with the other lights. ANOVA was used to statistically analyze the data in which the p_value was found to be 0.125 meaning the data had no statistical significance.         


Introduction:
 In this experiment, the rate of photosynthesis, a dependent variable, in spinach (Spinacia oleraca) is being determined under white, blue, red, and green light, independent variables; in order to establish if the color of light can affect the rate of photosynthesis. Spinach (Spinacia oleraca) was chosen to be the test subject in this experiment because it is easily accessible during any time of the year. Moreover, it is cheap and contains plenty of chloroplast that can be easily extracted for the study. Plants carry out photosynthesis in order to obtain energy from the sun. The energy is derived from water and carbon dioxide through the process. Specifically, in green-colored plants, chlorophyll is the main mechanism involved in producing energy. Photosynthesis is broken down into two processes, light dependent and light independent. The light dependent process is a chain of reactions where the light absorbed is used to produce ATP and NADH. Consequently, light independent process utilizes the produced energy to convert carbon into glucose. Despite the fact that ATP production is difficult to determine, the Hill Reaction can be used to measure the transfer of electrons in isolated chloroplast. Light is the most crucial component of photosynthesis. Without light, there is no energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Light is made up of different length of wavelengths, either short or long, and the combination of all the wavelength creates natural light, which is what all plants naturally absorb. However, plants appear to be green because green light is reflected by plants. Hence why green light is believed to only be absorbed by the chlorophyll in a small amount (Johkan M.-2012). Further, a previous study has been done demonstrating that plants grow taller when given blue light (Hernandez R.-2016). For this reason, we hypothesize that blue light will result in the highest rates of photosynthesis when compared with the other colored lights.    

Materials and Method:
In order to perform this experiment, the highest concentration of chloroplast must be isolated from spinach via suspension. Small pieces of spinach must be place in a chilled motar with 10 Ml of grinding solution. Using a chilled pestle, grind the spinach until it becomes a thick paste with no large pieces. Add another 10 Ml of grinding solution to make the paste less think for suspension. Strain the paste using a cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Transfer all the green paste into a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “A” and spin it at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 Celsius. After the suspension period, remove the rest of the green liquid, leaving the green residue at the bottom behind, into another centrifuge tube labeled “B”. Repeat the suspension process however, change the speed to 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 Celsius. Next, label 13 test tubes in preparation of solutions for the assay. All solution contains different ratios of water, 130 mM DCPIP, and reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). However, the first tube is the blank (1 tube) which is the only solution that does not contain any DCPIP because photosynthesis cannot occur. The positive controlll (1 tube) will be treated with white light. Negative controlll (1 tube) will be treated with no light. The remaining 9 test tubes will be broken down into 3 different conditions. Each three replicates will be treated with either blue, red, or green light. After the solution has been prepared, add 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts prepared earlier in the experiment. Mix well then transfer each solution into cuvettes, and immediately blank the spectrophotometer that is set to read the absorbance at 420 nm. After taking the initial absorbance of all samples, treat each cuvette under different, assigned conditions (white light, no light, blue light, red light, and green light) for 10 minutes. Record all the absorbance into an organized table. Repeat the process again by treating the samples under their respective conditions for another 10 minutes. Repeat until 30 minutes has gone by. After collecting all the data needed, a statistical t_test must be administered in order to determine the significance of the data. In this particular case, ANOVA is used to determine the significance of each data set in comparison with one another and the p_value was determined.

Results:
After inputting the raw data into ANOVA, a one-way analysis variance, the p_value was calculated to be 0.125. In addition, the Tukey-Kramer test was performed on all combinations of samples, resulting in no significance in the data.   


Discussion:
Based on the results, there were no statistical significance in the results when comparing the absorbance of blue, green, and red light to white light due to the p_value being 0.125, which is significently above 0.05. This means that there was no substantial effect in treating the chloroplast with different colored lights because the change in photosynthetic activity of all samples was very minuscule, which was our null hypothesis. However, one trend that is worth highlighting highlighted is exhibited in the blue sample. The average percent change in the blue sample was calculated to be 184%, which is the closest to the average percent change of positive controlll, white light, with an average percent change of 128%. This is worth pointing out because a previous study conducted on spinach, lettuce, wheat, and radish demonstrated that blue light is the most favorable for plant growth besides white, natural light because of its effect on chlorophyll formation and therefore, the photosynthetic activity, stomata opening, which overall increases the photo-morphogenetic response in the plants (Urbonavičiūt A.- 2007). Because there was no statistical significance in the result, some errors could have occurred during the experiment which may have altered the outcome of the experimental design. There could have been a technical error in the spectrophotometer, which can greatly affect the absorbances read. When treating each cuvette under a certain color light, the surrounding light in the room could have interfere with the light directly shining on the cuvettes. Consequently, to improve the results of the data in the next experiment, the set up for each condition should be set in a dark room with each corner being a color where there is no outside light that could interfere with the rate of photosynthesis. An alternate, future study could be observing the effect of plants when treated with a combination of both red and blue light because a pass study has proven that the combination of both red and blue light facilitated more efficient lettuce growth and photosynthesis (Wang J.- 2016). Food scarcity is increasingly becoming an issue with not only the drastic increase of the world’s population, but also climate change. These phenomenon increases our awareness that food production needs to be advanced in a way that will help provide for the masses (Darko E.- 2014). For this reason, the study of the effect of different colored lights on photosynthesis could reveal something greater that can catalyze the process of food production.
