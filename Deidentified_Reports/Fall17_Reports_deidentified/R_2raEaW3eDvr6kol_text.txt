Title: Conspecific Versus Non-conspecific Aggression in Male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Male Betta splendins are well-known for their aggressive behavior when confronted with another male betta fish. In this experiment, we will put one male betta fish in a tank with a transparent separation so it can see an orange male betta fish. We will observe the first male betta’s behavior. Then we will observe the same male betta’s behavior when a gold.f.ish is on the other side of the transparent separator. We will quantify the original male betta’s use of tail beating and pelvic fin flickering. Our studies found that the male betta fish on average displayed more aggressive behaviors toward the orange male betta than the gold.f.ish. These results show that Betta splendins more often display conspecific aggression rather than non-conspecific.


Introduction:
Communication between animals is a behavior used by animals everyday, and it is often used as an aggressive behavior. An example of this is the Siamese fighting fish otherwise known as a Betta splendins which is a type of anabantid from southeast Asia. This species has many aggressive behavior displays that are often used to defend their territory. [Oliveira 1998] These behaviors include gill flaring, pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, intensifying color, and enlarging its caudal fin. [Miley 1977] When male bettas are confronted by another betta fish they exhibit intraspecific behavior, of which there are two types: broadside movements and facing movements. When the fish exhibits behaviors sideways it is called broadside movements and these include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Pelvic fin flickering is when the fish will move its pelvic fin vertically and tail beating is when the betta makes rapid movements with its caudal fin toward the opposing fish. [Johnson]  Male betta fish often display these behaviors in the presence in another male betta and research has shown that they also display them when presented with a mirror image of themselves. This spawns the question of whether or not male betta fish display aggressive behaviors to other species of fish. Studies have shown that male betta fish do exhibit some aggressive behaviors towards other species of fish, but their behaviors vary depending on the behaviors of the opponent. Some opponents are more aggressive than others, for example the shy giant gourami fish (Colisa fasciata) would not reciprocate the aggressive behaviors while the paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis), who is more aggressive, would. The more aggressive behaviors displayed towards the betta the more the betta will exhibit aggressive behaviors. Studies also found that the betta fish exhibit aggressive behaviors less frequently to other fish species than to other male betta fish. [Miley 1977] Male aggression is specific to males of the same species and is important for male competition for mating. The observed betta will show a different amount of broadside aggressive behaviors towards another betta than towards a gold.f.ish fish (Carassius auratus).


Materials and Method:
In order to test this hypothesis, we found three male Betta splendins to use as the ‘aggressor’ that we would study the behavior of in the presence of one male betta fish that is orange and one gold.f.ish. We began with fish 1 and removed the divider so the fish 1 and the orange betta could see each other, but not be in the same tank. We observed the behavior of fish 1 for five minutes then put the divider back and the let the fish rest for five minutes. Then we removed the divider between fish 1 and the gold.f.ish and observed fish 1’s behavior towards the gold.f.ish. This was repeated with fish 2 and 3 both acting as the ‘aggressors’ toward the orange betta fish and the gold.f.ish. Each time allowing five minute rest periods in between. We observed the amount of times the aggressor fish exhibited broadside behaviors such as tail beating and how long they exhibited pelvic fin flashing. We averaged the average pelvic fin flashing time of the betta in the presence of another betta. Then we averaged the pelvic fin flashing time of the betta in the presence of a gold.f.ish. The same was done for the tail beating. We used a two-sample 2-tailed t_test. 

Results:
The results of this experiment show that male betta fish show more aggressive behaviors towards and orange betta fish than a gold.f.ish. For Figure 1 p=0.161  and for Figure 2 p=0.094


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did support our hypothesis. The three betta fish seen as the ‘aggressors’ on average displayed more aggressive behaviors toward the orange betta fish than to the orange gold.f.ish. This demonstrates that betta fish display more conspecific aggression than non-conspecific aggression. Oftentimes the betta fish would notice the gold.f.ish and begin doing some aggressive behaviors, however once the betta did not see any reciprocation of aggressive behaviors the betta fish would turn around and stop displaying aggressive behaviors. These results lead to further questions of whether the reciprocation of aggressive behaviors play a role in the betta fish continually displaying aggressive behaviors. One possible error that our experiment faced was that a lot of the betta fish experienced habituation. Research has shown that when betta fish are presented with other betta fish or even a mirror image of themselves they will initially exhibit aggressive behavior but eventually they will stop this behavior because they have become habituated. [Clayton 1967]  Even though we allotted five minutes after each encounter for each betta to rest, some of the betta fish were resistant to show aggressive behavior because they had been used in experiments throughout two weeks and were possibly experiencing habituation. Overall, our results showed that male betta fish show more aggressive behaviors to male betta fish than gold.f.ish.
