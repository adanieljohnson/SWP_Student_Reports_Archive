Title: The Effects of Light and Darkness on the Specific Metabolic Rate of the Procambris sp.

Abstract:
Consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide are indirect indicators of energy production due to reactions that occurs in metabolism. The electrons given off in the formation of CO2 from glucose ultimately allows the Electron Transport System to from ADP to ATP, providing large amounts of energy. This experiment will place three Procambris sp. into light and dark environments to test a difference in specific metabolic rate. Metabolic rate has been shown to increase in light when the animal is diurnal, however, because this animal’s genus is unknown, it can be diurnal or nocturnal. Therefore, I hypothesize that the crayfish will experience a change in specific metabolic rate when placed in light then in darkness. After conducting the experiment, there was a significent change in metabolic rate as the P-value calculated from a two-tailed t_test expresses a value of 0.008181. The standard deviation for the controlll was 0.00043378 and for darkness it was 0.0004353. The results highlight that the crayfish was diurnal as metabolic rates are higher in the day. In the day, crayfish are at risk of being pray or are attempting to find pray, therefore, their body needs more energy than at night sleeping.

Introduction:
Consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide are indirect indicators of energy production. This is due to the reactions that occurs in metabolism. An organism will convert glucose into energy (ATP). NAD+ and FAD molecules will then capture the higher energy electrons released in the formation of the CO2. The Electron Transport System (ETS) will give up the electrons to convert them from ADP to ATP, providing a high quantity of energy. For this to continue, the chain of electrons must be removed from the mitochondria by transferring them to the molecule O2. Oxygen moves fluidly throughout the body by the respiratory system and the addition of electrons to oxygen allows it to form water, H2O. After the excess electrons are used to form water, it can then be excreted as waste [Johnson: 2017]. 
	Crayfish will be the organism studied (Procambris sp.). The specific genus is unknown. 
This was an appropriate species to use because of its small size making it easily maneuverable. Also, the specific probe used to measure O2 concentration is used in aquatic environments rather than for terrestrial animals. Crayfish are ectotherms; therefore, a researcher can alter their body temperature and metabolism through environmental temperature changes. Light and darkness can also alter their metabolic rate. In a previous experiment it has been shown that metabolic rates of the diurnal marine animals will strongly decrease with darkness as it is deeper in the water and will increase with more light in shallow waters due to predation [Seibel, Drazen: 2007]. However, there are many different species of crayfish which some are diurnal while others are nocturnal [Musil, et all: 2010]. I hypothesize that the crayfish will experience a change in specific metabolic rate when placed in light then in darkness. Three crayfish will be tested for their O2 consumption in light and in darkness to determine their specific metabolic rate in either environment. Each crawfish will be its own controlll. The dependent variables are the specific metabolic rates while the independent variable is the light vs. dark environment. 

Materials and Method:
Half fill a medium sized tub with 22-degree water. Fill a mason jar with 22-degree Celsius water so the water will over fill when later closing the lid. Then place it in the middle of the half-filled tub. This will allow the temperature of the water to stay consistent. Tear the scale with a sandwich container and leave it there to later weigh the crayfish. Place a second sandwich container under the small tube of the crawfish container allowing the displaced water when reaching for the crayfish to fill the second container than spilling onto the table. Grab the crayfish from its container by pitching it on either side of its body directly behind the main front claws. Place the crawfish in the container on the scale. After weighing the crayfish gently slide it into the filled mason jar, allowing excess water to overflow. Wait two minutes for the crayfish to acclimate. Then tightly screw on the oxygen probe that is attached to the lid onto the mason jar. Record the amount of O2 present within the jar every five minutes for twenty minutes. While waiting for the five minutes, wrap aluminum foil around a second mason jar so no light may enter and fill it with the same temperature water. Once the twenty minutes are up, carefully poor the water into a large graduated cylinder to record the volume of O2. Poor out the water back into the original container where originally obtained the 22-degree Celsius water. Grab the crayfish and place him in the dark mason jar, again allowing two minutes for acclimation prior to closing the lid. Place aluminum foil around the rim of the lid to further assure no light enters. Again, record the results of oxygen every five minutes for twenty minutes and the quantity of water measured in the graduated cylinder. Repeat the same procedure for the following two crayfish. 

Results:
When the crayfish were picked up, most of the time, they began to frantically move around to try and escape. When the first crayfish was weighed, he tried escaping multiple time from the container by trying to back out and crawl over. However, after a little time after they were placed in the mason jar they began to relax and not move as much. It was also difficult to truly see the movements of the crayfish while in the mason jar because of the reflection of the water, the lid and when there was aluminum foil around it. 
	The average value for the specific metabolic rate with light was 0.0010495 mg O2/g * min, however, the value decreased in the dark environment with an average of 0.0005593 mg O2/g * min. The average difference is -0.00049023. The standard deviations are 0.00043378 for the light and for the dark it is 0.0004354. The calculated two tailed t-value is 10.987899 which helps calculate a P-value of 0.008181. 

Discussion:
The alternative hypothesis was supported due to the significent change in specific metabolic rate when the Procambris sp. were placed in the dark. The change was significent due to the p_value of 0.008181 being lower than the alpha value of 0.05 when a two-tailed t_test was calculated. A low p_value expresses that there was a very low possibility that the results occurred by chance. Although the crayfish experienced a significent change in metabolic rate, more specifically, the change was directed in the negative direction as the crayfish metabolic rate decreased when placed in darkness. Due to these results, the crayfish was most likely diurnal.  This conclusion can be drawn as Seibel and Drazen expresses how diurnal animals will have a higher metabolic rate in light than in darkness [Seibel, Dazen: 2017]. The crayfish most likely has a higher metabolic rate in light than in darkness because of predation. Crayfish exert more energy when stressed in the presence of predators and or when searching for pray than when sleeping. When an animal is stressed, the heart rate rises, causing more O2 intake, therefore, it increases metabolic rate. When it is dark, it causes the hormone melatonin to be released. This hormone causes drowsiness; therefore, the body is preparing to sleep by lowering its heart rate and by doing so, lowering its oxygen intake and lowering its metabolic rate [Tilden, et all: 2003]. In this lab, potential errors could have occurred by the excessive stress of the crayfish when being handled causing a higher metabolic rate than in nature. Also, the oxygen probe is not 100% guaranteed to be exactly accurate, there is always room for uncertainty. When weighing the crayfish, they are also not dry, therefore, influencing their weight. For future study, it would be interesting to test different species of crayfish which are diurnal and nocturnal to compare if they have the same metabolic rate in their proper hour in which they are awake. As the animals are exothermic, the water during the day may be slightly warmer causing a higher metabolic rate for the crayfish who are diurnal rather than nocturnal. This would further be interesting to see if there are benefits from being diurnal over nocturnal or vice versa.
