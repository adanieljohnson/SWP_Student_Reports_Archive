Title: The Effect of Aggression on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus Sp. 

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine how the presence of a large Procambarus Sp. affects the oxygen consumption of a small Procambarus Sp. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy an organism expends and can be used to find the specific metabolic rate of an organism. We examined the effect of aggression/ stress on the oxygen consumption of a small Procambarus Sp. We were able to measure the oxygen consumption with a dissolved oxygen probe. We hypothesize that the oxygen consumption of the small Procambarus Sp. will be affected if it sees a large Procambarus Sp. near it. Our data showed that the oxygen consumption of small Procambarus Sp. increases in the presence of a larger Procambarus Sp. however, our results were statistically insignificant and no significant conclusion can be made (p=0.251080). 

Introduction:
The metabolic rate of an organism refers to the amount of energy used to maintain all of the body’s physiological processes [Johnson AD: 2017]. One way to measure an organism’s specific metabolic rate is to examine oxygen consumption. During the cellular respiration process, glucose is converted to energy. As a part of these reactions, ATP is converted from low to high energy. In order for this process to occur, electrons are transferred from the electron transport chain to the molecular oxygen we inhale, thereby converting the oxygen into water [Johnson AD: 2017]. The relationship between oxygen and energy production shows that the amount of oxygen consumed is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended. During this experiment, we will examine how aggression from a large Procambarus Sp. affects the specific metabolic rate of a small Procambarus Sp. In general, the trend shows that dominance is directly proportional to size; the larger crayfish tends to dominate, the smaller, more submissive crayfish [Bouvbjerg:1956]. Additionally, aggression expressed by cichlid fish caused an increase in the oxygen consumption [Ros:2006]. This means specific metabolic rate increased in the presence of aggression. Based on this information, we hypothesize that the presence of a large Procambarus Sp. will have an effect on the oxygen consumption of the small Procambarus Sp. 

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, we chose three small crayfish (each serving as its own control) and 1 large crayfish to act as the aggressor. We then weighed each of the small crayfish, placed one of the small crayfish in the glass chamber, and then filled the chamber with room temperature water. After this we placed the filled chamber in a pan with more room temperature water and inserted the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber. Then we proceeded to measure the oxygen consumption every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. Once we finished measuring the oxygen concentration, we recorded the volume of water that was in the chamber and calculated the specific metabolic rate. We then repeated this process with the same crayfish but this time put the larger crayfish inside the pan that the chamber sat in, to antagonize the smaller crayfish. We then determined the specific metabolic rate once again. We repeated this process with the other two small crayfish as well. After collecting all the data, we performed a paired two-tailed T-test to further analyze our data. 
Specific Metabolic Rate= [∆O₂ (mg/L)x volume H₂O (L)] / Time (min) x  weight (g)


Results:
The general trend of our data showed that the oxygen consumption of Procambarus Sp. increased in the presence of a larger crayfish.  The average SMR before the physiological stimulus was applied was 0.00111533 mg O₂ * g⁻¹ * min⁻¹, while the average SMR after the physiological stimulus was applied was 0.00156667 mg O₂ * g⁻¹ * min⁻¹ (Figure 1). The standard deviation of the control group was 0.000338851 while the standard deviation of the experimental group was 0.00051316 (Figure 1). The p-value was 0.25108, meaning our data is statistically insignificant because the p-value is higher than 0.05. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported because our data proved to be statistically insignificant. However, our data did show that presence of a large Procambarus Sp. affects the specific metabolic rate of a small Procambarus Sp. Similar to our experiment, another study examined how the agonistic behavior of Siamese fighting fish affects oxygen consumption. When the fish expressed aggressive behavior towards their mirror image, the rate of oxygen consumption significantly increased. Even male fish who did not have direct contact with another fish showed signs of an increased metabolic rate [Castro: 2006]. Another experiment found energy expenditure to increase in submissive cichlid fish in the presence of an antagonist fish. This is likely due to prevention of attacks and injury [Grantner: 1998].  Although the small and large Procambarus Sp. did not directly come in contact with each the other, it’s likely that just the presence of the large Procambarus Sp. caused the small Procambarus Sp. to perceive a threat and experience stress. The presence of the perceived threat caused the small Procambarus Sp. to increase oxygen consumption and thereby increase its specific metabolic rate. In order to improve the experiment in the future, we could increase the number of small Procambarus Sp. that are exposed to an aggressor. Additionally, we could examine how the oxygen consumption of a large Procambarus Sp. is affected in the presence of another large Procambarus Sp. The results of this experiment can be used to examine the energy costs of submissive behavior in the presence of an aggressor.
