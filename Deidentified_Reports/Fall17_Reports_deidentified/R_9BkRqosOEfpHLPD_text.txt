Title: The Effect of Extreme Temperatures on the Photosynthetic Rate of Chloroplasts in Kale and Basil Leaves.

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the extent to which varying temperatures affect absorbance in chloroplasts. To examine this, we measured the percent change of chloroplast solution in 0˚C, 23˚C and 50 ˚C of basil and kale leaves. We measured the change in absorbance at 600nm at the cold, room temperature and hot temperatures over 30 minutes taking readings at the baseline time zero and subsequently every ten minutes after. If the chloroplast solution is placed in extreme cold or extreme hot temperatures, the absorbency in the spectrophotometer will increase determining that there is less chloroplast activity in the solution altered. Chloroplasts are important in the ability for the organism to utilize the energy around it in the form of light and carbon dioxide and effectively convert it into glucose. When the two plants were in extreme temperature conditions, the heat in the kale sample was the only trial to effectively and significently alter the chloroplast absorbency. There was no significent difference between the room temperature and cold/hot temperature trials in the basil leaves. The extreme temperatures acting upon chloroplasts thus determine that in certain plants, the chloroplasts can only maintain optimal function within an appropriate temperature range.

Introduction:
In the cells of plants, there exist chloroplasts which enable the organism to perform photosynthesis and harvest the energy of light to perform the necessary functions. The process by which the chloroplast performs photosynthesis depends on reactions that operate at certain temperature parameters. In specifically green and leafy plants, photosynthesis occurs by reducing and fixing carbon from carbon dioxide and converting it into usable energy [Jensen & Bassham: 1966]. Therefore, any stimulus that negatively effects the rate of this system are cause for study. Chloroplasts have been shown to be denatured based on temperature [Wells & Sager: 1971]. However, this study also demonstrated that the denaturing is not permanent and that the chloroplast function can return to normal. Another key aspect when considering this experiment is the concept of chilling-sensitive and chilling-resistant plants. In a study conducted by the American Society of Plant Biologists, some plants lose the optimal rate at much lower temperatures than other plants [Murala & Yumaya: 1984]. Hence, each plant exhibits different characteristics depending on the temperature. Some chloroplasts are able to withstand fluctuations, and this was the central focus of the experiment. This experiment will study the effect on photosynthesis via chloroplast activity based on extreme temperature in kale and basil leaves. For the experiment, the dependent variable, which is what is being observed, will be the absorbance at 600nm having been subjected to varying hot and cold temperatures. For the experiment, we hypothesize that if the plants are placed in extreme conditions, they will exhibit a significent decrease in chloroplast activity, which will be demonstrated by an increase in the absorbance. Because of the nature of chloroplasts becoming denatured, it is predicted that there will be a decrease in chloroplast activity but not a total stop. To successfully carry out this experiment, it is necessary to understand the basis of photosynthetic processes as well as the effect temperature has on enzymatic processes. These results of absorbance and percent change will give comparable data to the experimental outcome.

Materials and Method:
Obtain three leaves each of basil and kale to conduct the two temperature trials. Remove the major veins from the leaves and pack the kale into a chilled mortar and pestle to begin the first trial. Add 10Ml of 400mM sucrose in Tricene buffer pH 8 and grind into a pulp with no major pieces of kale. Add another 10Ml of solution and then strain through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Then 200μL of this solution should be transferred to a micro-tube labeled Sample A-Kale. The remaining liquid should be transferred to a 50Ml centrifuge tube labeled A-Kale and spun at 200 x G for three minutes at 4˚C making sure to balance the centrifuge. Next, the supernatant should be poured into a centrifuge labeled B-Kale. After removing 200 μL of this and labeling it Sample B-Kale, place this tube on ice. Centrifuge the tube at 1000 x G for ten minutes at 4˚C. Pour this, into a 50 Ml tube marked C-Kale. Add 20Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by gently stirring with the transfer pipet. Next, 200 μL of this should be placed into a tube marked Sample of B Pellet-Kale. Remove 200 μL from C-Kale and mark it as Sample C-Kale. Repeat this exact same procedure with Basil and label using “Basil” on the tubes in the place of “Kale” After, 22 tubes must be labeled 0-22 and 22 cuvettes must be labeled 0-22. Tube 0 is designated as the tube to blank the spectrometer containing 8Ml of water and 2Ml of reaction buffer 100mM phosphate, pH 6.5. Note that all of the tubes should be prepared first before taking the absorbance. Tubes 1-22 should receive 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP and 100mM phosphate, pH 6.5 reaction buffer. Next, add 100 μL kale chloroplasts to tubes numbered 4-12 and 100 μL basil chloroplasts to 13-22. Immediately blank with tube 0 and 600nm. Find the absorbance of all of the tubes and mark as times zero. Place tubes 0-6 and 13-15 in room temperature conditions, 7-9 and 17-19 on ice (0˚C), and 10-12 and 20-22 in heat conditions (50˚C). After 10 minutes, reblank and retest the absorbance. Return the tubes to their conditions and repeat this process again after twenty minutes since time zero and thirty minutes since time zero. Record all of the absorbance. This data will give the rate of photosynthesis based on the chloroplast functionality. The statistical tests used was a one-way Anova statistical test to test the significance of the results as well as the standard deviation of the means of the chloroplast absorbance.


Results:
During the experiment, the kale exhibited more change in absorbance between the temperatures than the basil chloroplast trials. When measuring the percent change of the kale chloroplast compared to the “no chloroplast” solution (Fig. 1), the controlll maintained about the same in absorbance whereas the there was a significent percent change in the hot temperature trial (.003). This means that there was an inhibition in the amount of chloroplast activity. When comparing the data on the controlll to the basil leaves (Fig. 2), the results did not demonstrate a significent difference across the trials as the temperature was changed (.067). The general trends demonstrated by the data is that with a change in temperature in the kale leaves, there will be no change unless the temperature is increased. In terms of the basil leaves, temperature does not affect chloroplast activity significently.


Discussion:
	It can be observed that the hot temperature had a direct impact on the absorbance of the kale leaves. There was a statistical difference in the heat trial of the kale leaves. The absorbance increased by 32.9% after 30 minutes had passed. The basil leaves, however had no significent difference in any of the temperature trials. This mainly supports the hypothesis that when extreme temperatures are applied to chloroplasts or plants in general, there will be a decrease in rate of chloroplast activity. As seen in the results, however, the only plant that had the significent difference is the kale leaves. This could be due to the chilling-sensitive phenomenon. This relates to the pre-existing data such as the study on photosynthetic cyanobacteria where the bacteria were impacted by temperature change [Robarts & Zohary: 1987]. This study showed that in the lakes where the bacteria were located, when the temperature was lowered below 15˚C, the bacteria were no longer able to carry out the same functions as at higher temperatures. This demonstrates the preference and necessity for organisms to be in temperatures relevant to their specific needs. When examining optimal growing conditions, while kale can grow in moist environments, the plant flourishes in 21˚C and will become tough and bitter and then die if growing in too hot of temperatures [Rutherford-Fortunati: 2012]. Again, this illustrates that plants need to grow in certain temperatures.
	Examining the basil experiments, there were no significent changes across the time in the multiple trials. The basil leaf was either resistant to temperature changes or it had not reached a temperature at which the chloroplasts would denature. In the first case, studies have shown that certain plants undergo thermotropic phase transitions [Murata & Yamaya: 1984]. The plants are able to change the state at which the processes occur allowing to account for the wide ranges of temperatures. Additionally, the study performed by Hew, Kortkov and Canvin proved that there are two processes by which photosynthesis can occur [Hew “et al.”: 1969]. One, which is usually associated with evolve carbon dioxide when shining light on the system, is not usually affected by temperature. The other process does not involve evolving carbon dioxide usually is impacted by changes in temperature. This is pertinent for further studies.
In the latter option, it is possible the basil has a wider range of temperatures at which the chloroplasts can function relative to the kale leaves. 
If this experiment were run again, it would be intriguing to examine the effect of temperature and light on the chloroplast rate. Photosynthesis heavily relies on the energy from photons of light to produce usable energy for the organism. The next step with the information gathered from the experiment would be to run more specific experiments. For example, it would be important to consider how light and temperature are related. This could have lasting and significent implications for the farmers storing the cultivated crops [Korus: 2011]. By understanding the ideal temperatures at which each chloroplast functions, the farmer can grow the optimal crop. Temperature may prove to effect multiple processes in addition to rate of chloroplasts. In the context of the larger concept, the understanding that emerges through this study is imperative as it demonstrates the properties required for chloroplasts to accomplish photosynthesis.
