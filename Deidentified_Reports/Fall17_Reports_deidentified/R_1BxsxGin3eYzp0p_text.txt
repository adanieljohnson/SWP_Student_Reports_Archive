Title: Inconsistent Correlation Between Male Bettas Aggressive Behaviors Towards Different Colored Male Bettas

Abstract:
Male Betta splendins are known for exhibiting aggressive behavior when in the presence of other males from their species, therefore leading to them becoming highly studied in animal behavior experiments. Three male betta fish were exposed first to a neutral colored male betta, and then a bright red colored betta, for periods of five minutes. The amount of time within those five minutes that each betta spent performing an aggressive behavior was recorded. The results of the study were not statistically significent, with the bettas not consistently reacting more to one colored fish over the other. This suggests that habituation levels and previous behavioral experiences had a greater effect upon our experiment than anticipated.

Introduction:
While studying animal behavior, the primary interest of the investigator is the stimulus and response of the organism to varying conditions. Betta splendins, or betta fish, are a common household pet, yet are well-known for their high levels of aggression in response to other members of their species, making them a prime candidate for the study of animal behavior [Johnson: 2017]. 
    Betta fish exhibit “fighting colors” when in the presence of other male betta fish, during which their natural colors may change to an intense and bright red or dark blue [Johnson: 2017]. These “fighting colors” have prompted many scientists to study what effect they have on bettas already aggressive interactions with one another. 
In addition, scientific studies have tested whether different colored betta fish are cause other betta fish to react different. For example, a study by American Zoologist determined that exposure to red betta fish instigated the most aggressive response among three test betta fish in comparison to green and blue betta fish [Thompson: 1966]. In addition, The American Biology Teacher tests reactions of male betta fish to their mirror images, during which many of the betta fish reacted aggressively to their vibrant colors [Abramson: 1999]. These previous studies predict a strong, aggressive reaction in response to being visually exposed to brightly colored, while a less, aggressive reaction may be the response to neutral colored betta fish. 
    Given what is known about betta fish behavior trends, if betta fish tail flashes or red manes for a longer period of time when exposed to a colored betta than a neutral colored betta, it can be determined that bright or “fighting” colors instigate aggression among betta fish to a higher degree. 


Materials and Method:
Three male betta fish were visually exposed to a red betta fish and a neutral betta fish, one at a time. Each replicate male betta was placed in the center compartment of a fish tank, with the red betta on one side and the neutral betta on the other side. See Figure 1 for a reference photo of the setup. The three fish in the tank were separated and visually separated until removing the opaque barrier allowing them to see each other. Each replicate betta was given five minutes of visual exposure to the neutral fish, then five minutes of rest time, then five minutes of visual exposure to the red betta. After being exposed to both fish, the male betta was replaced with the second and third replicate betta fish, and the process repeated.

While visually exposed to the other bettas, the replicate betta behaviors were quantified by timing the duration of aggressive actions by each replicate betta during the period of five minutes. Once the betta began red-maning or tail flashing, the stopwatch began, and once the betta ceased aggressive action, the stopwatch was paused until aggressive actions began again. 

A one-tail t_test was used to compare the relationship of color of the male betta to response aggression level. 


Results:
The duration of aggression from each of the three male bettas was not consistently different, as summarized by Figure 2 below.

The levels of aggression of each betta were not consistent as a whole. 

After performing the one-tail test comparing the data from exposure to the neutral and red betta, the data was confirmed not statistically significent. With two degrees of freedom, the t-value was 0.23 and a p_value was 0.42. 

Discussion:
There was no apparent or significent correlation between aggression levels of the male betta fish and the color of the male bettas they were exposed to. This did not support our hypothesis that male betta fish would react more aggressively to being visually exposed to brightly colored betta fish. 

Since this experiment tests animal behavior, it is important to note that while we tested only one species, each betta fish may not necessarily react in the same manner consistently. This could explain why there were significent differences in each betta’s reaction to the neutral and red bettas. Each betta could be a different age, could have been used by the Wake Forest Biology Department before, and could have had different previous interactions with other bettas prior to our experiment. Even though we were consistent in using male betta fish that had not been used in an experiment earlier that day, there are many other factors and variables specific to each fish’s genetic makeup and life experiences that could explain the differences in reactions to the neutral and red betta fish. 

    In addition, a recent study by the Journal of Ichthyology determined that male betta fish respond similarly to familiar and stranger male betta fish due to the fact that a male betta can always be an opposing threat and would, therefore, instigate equally aggressive responses [Alyan: 2010]. Also, a study by the University of California and Laboratory of Psychobiology determined that an important factor in studying the stimulation of male betta fish is their level of habituation. Male bettas would react differently to other male bettas depending on previous exposure time to them [Peeke, 1970]. This is a factor that had been considered the day of our experiment, however, the betta fish had also been used by other lab groups earlier in the week, therefore, some of the male bettas could have habituated to different levels than others. 

The next step for this study would be to repeat the experiment with more awareness of prior variability of the betta fish and more replicates. For example, the experimental method could begin with buying the betta fish at the pet store and ensuring they are all experiencing similar environmental conditions and exposure levels to one another, decreasing variables down to their innate behavior. In addition, since animal behavior is being studied, increasing the replicate size would provide more data and ensure that the gathered data was not by chance. 

Overall, this experiment raises more questions than answers, however, goes to show that animal behavior per species has high variability. It can be studied, but every organism is different, therefore animal behavior studies should be as precise and comprehensive as possible.
