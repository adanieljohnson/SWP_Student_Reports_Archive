Title: Light wavelength has a decreasing effect on root to shoot ratio of Pisum sativum and Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
Pisum sativum (field peas) and Raphanus raphanistrum (radishes) are common crops in the United States and are ideal in a laboratory setting to do studies on phenotypic plasticity because of their availability and fast growth rates. Based on varying environmental conditions, such as light, plants allocate more of their resources to root growth, shoot growth, or gamete production. Under shade conditions, it would be expected that plants would allocate more resources for shoot growth in order to capture enough light to do sufficient photosynthesis. We predicted that exposing field peas and radishes to green light would cause a greater decrease in the root to shoot (R:S) ratio of the radishes than that of the field peas. We planted both species of plants under both a control condition (white light) and an experimental condition (green light) for a total of 600 seeds divided evenly into 12 planters. By measuring the root length and shoot length of a randomized sample of all four groups at the end of two weeks, we obtained data for statistical analysis. While the experimental R:S ratios were smaller than the control ones, the difference was not statistically significant, and our hypothesis was not supported. 


Introduction:
Both across species and within species, plants can have varying phenotypic variation, or phenotypic plasticity, that is dependent on a number of biotic and abiotic environmental factors such as light, moisture, and nutrients. Since there is a finite amount of virtually all resources, plants must allocate energy for the obtainment of some resources over others. Two plants of the same species in sunny versus shady conditions, for example, may allocate more energy toward root growth versus shoot growth, respectively. Furthermore, a plant may allocate more energy to root and/or shoot growth than to gamete production. Thus, there are trade-offs, or resource allocation, involved during each stage of a plant’s life. Shoots are important for all components of photosynthesis such as light and carbon capture, while roots are important in the collection of water and nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous. Dividing the biomass or length of the root of a plant by the biomass or length of its shoot results in a root to shoot ratio that can be useful in examining resource allocation. Under differing environmental conditions, such as canopy light versus understory light, plants may allocate more resources for shoot growth over root growth, or vice versa. (Johnson: 2017) 

Light in the understory of a forest is lower in both energy intensity and quality, with the greatest proportion of that light being green (Shirley: 1929). Two plant species, field peas (P. sativum) and radishes (R. raphanistrum), are useful in experimental studies because they are easily obtainable and they grow quickly. Field peas naturally grow in high light exposure environments while radishes have grown naturally in the understory. However, both plants are commonly grown as crops in the United States and other parts of the world. Field peas are annual plants of the Fabaceae family and are not native to the United States. Radishes are annual plants of the Brassicaceae family that were also introduced to the United States to be grown as a common crop (Pearse: 2014). 

We predicted that exposing field peas and radishes to green light would cause a greater decrease in the R:S ratio of the radishes than that of the field peas because field peas have evolved under full light over time while radishes are naturally an understory plant, thus receiving green light that is largely reflected off of the leaves of other plants and theoretically having phenotypic advantages to respond beneficially under those conditions. 


Materials and Methods:
We planted 50 seeds in each of twelve total planters. The first tray contained six planters, three of which had 150 total field pea seeds and three of which had 150 total radish seeds. The first tray was under a clear cellophane teepee to mimic the wavelength of light that would reach plants in open sunlight. This tray represented the control group. The second tray contained six planters, three of which had 150 total field pea seeds and three of which had 150 total radish seeds. The second tray was under a green cellophane teepee to mimic the wavelength of light that would reach plants in the understory. This tray represented the experimental group. Each planter was given 50 mL of miracle-gro on the first day and was watered daily for the remaining 14 days. Data was collected at the end of two weeks. Ten plants were selected at random from each of the twelves planters and their shoot length and root length in centimeters were measured to calculate the R:S ratio. A one-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine statistical significance of the difference in average R:S ratio between field peas and radishes in this experiment. (Johnson: 2017)


Results:
With a cut-off level of 0.05, the one-tailed two sample t-test revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the decrease in the R:S ratio of field peas versus radishes (p= 0.285). Average results show that there is a slight decrease in R:S ratio from control conditions (white light) to experimental conditions (green light) for both species. Overall, the R:S ratio was greater for radishes. The difference between the control group and experimental group was wider for field peas than for radishes. Figure 1 reveals this decrease in R:S ratio between control and experimental groups for each species. Figure 2 provides a visual representation of our data. 


Discussion:
Based on our results, our hypothesis was not supported. There is no statistically significant difference between the decrease in the R:S of the radishes and that of the field peas. 

Given that green light is of lower energy (Shirley: 1929), it was expected that the plants under green cellophane, especially the radishes since they are naturally an understory plant, would have allocated more resources toward shoot growth in order to capture sufficient light for photosynthesis. Furthermore, one study shows that exposure to green light, which mimics shade, causes an increase in stem elongation rates while exposure to other wavelengths of light does not create a similar result (Folta: 2004). Such a find makes sense because of the fact that plants need to grow higher to reach light when they are under low light conditions. However, these predictions were not supported by our experimental data. One reason this could be the case is that while radishes have naturally evolved in an understory environment, they have been grown in full sun exposure as crops for hundreds of years (Anderson: 1967) and may have lost any evolutionary advantage they had to react beneficially under low light conditions. Our experiment could have been improved by determining a more randomized way of selecting individuals to measure from each pot. Future studies might examine the phenotypic differences between root growth and shoot growth among many more different species under green light. Longer growth period, larger sample sizes, and a greater number of species being tested would allow more conclusions to be drawn about the effect of green light on R:S ratios in plants. Exploring this question would yield a greater understanding of phenotypic plasticity as a broad subject. That knowledge could be used in agriculture since differing portions of the light spectrum likely have impacts on processes like plant germination and reproduction. Furthermore, as human activity continues to alter natural environments, learning how organisms react to changing conditions remains an important endeavor.
