Title: The Effect of Exercise on the Specific Metabolic Rate of a Procambris sp.

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to find out the effects that exercise would have on the specific metabolic rate of three Pocambarus sp., a species of crayfish. During metabolism, oxygen, or O2, plays a critical role in receiving electrons at the end of an electron transport chain. These electrons are then transported down the chain where they give off energy to convert low-energy ADP to high-energy ATP. Because the usage of oxygen is directly related to the organism’s energy consumption, it would result in the uptake of O2 to increase. As a result, we hypothesized that when there is an increase in exercise, O2 levels would rise and directly increase the specific metabolic rate of the Pocambarus sp. This hypothesis was tested on three different Pocambarus sp., of similar size and weight, for 20 minutes long. The test was comparing non-exercised Pocambarus sp. and exercised Pocambarus sp. The results showed that exercise did not have a statistically significent, p_value was 0.235, effect on specific metabolic rate in contrast to non-exercised.

Introduction:
Exercise is a physical activity that is planned and/or structured for the reason of training any part of the body. Exercise has been shown to help prevent and/or treat coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, obesity, depression and many other diseases. Exercise raises metabolic rate due to the fact that during physical exercise, there is a higher need for oxygen, raising RMR or resting metabolic rate, which in turns raises metabolic rate.
   
   Metabolic rate refers to the amount of energy being used by all physiologic process at any given time, with any organism. Metabolic rate can also be described as the entire process of balancing energy capture, conversion of energy and transfer of energy within cells or an organism. It helps with growth and reproduction, maintaining structures and responding to an environment. Metabolic rate is the rate of energy expended in a given period. Metabolic reaction takes place, mainly, in the mitochondria of the organism’s cell. An organism receives glucose from food, and splits into two molecules of pyruvate, which contain carbon and oxygen atoms. They are then converted to acetate, and then to carbon dioxide (CO2 gas) through many long reactions. This reaction releases high-energy electrons that are picked up by NAD+ and FAD. NAD+ and FAD transfer the two high-energy electrons to the electron transport system, where they give up energy to convert low-energy ADP to high-energy ATP. When the mitochondria do not need any more high-energy electrons, the mitochondria will stop removing the electrons from the electron transport chain. This removal process happens by transferring them to O2 because adding an electron to O2 will turn it into H2O which is then joined by body fluids or excreted if necessary. The amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose during physiologic activities is directly proportional to the sum of oxygen consumed, or to the sum of carbon dioxide excreted [Johnson: 2016].
   
   Preceding studies have shown that by increasing exercise for an extended period of time, metabolic rate would remain elevated for an extended period of time [Osterberg & Melby: 2000]. The purpose of this experiment was to test the direct effect of exercise on the specific metabolic rate of a Procambris sp., using an oxygen meter. The independent variable will be exercising and non-exercising which is discrete and the dependent variable will be specific metabolic rate which is continuous. We used Procambris sp., the crayfish being tested, because it is an ectotherm, so its metabolic rate can easily be altered and measured. [Johnson: 2016]. Due to the fact that during exercise there is a higher need for oxygen, we hypothesize that O2 consumption and specific metabolic rate will be increased after exercise in three different Procambris sp.

Materials and Method:
Starting this experiment, we used three different Procambris sp. and weighed and recorded each one of their masses in grams. Taking one Procambris sp., we placed it into a screw-top glass chamber and filled it with room temperature water. The test chamber was then placed into a dishpan of room temperature water so the temperature of the water could be maintained. A dissolved oxygen probe was put into the top of the chamber so that some water would overflow into the dishpan. The probe was then turned on and allowed the readings to stabilize and once finished, a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration was recorded. Every five minutes, over the next twenty minutes, the readings of the dissolved oxygen concentration were recorded. After the twenty minutes were finished, the water of the test chamber was poured into a graduated cylinder and the volume was recorded in liters. Using the same crayfish, we put it back into its “condo” and began exercising the Procambris sp. by using a straw and moving it around its “condo” for 10 minutes. After ten minutes, we placed the Procambris sp. back into the screw-top glass chamber and recorded baseline reading; as well as, the readings of every five minutes over the next 20 minutes of dissolved oxygen concentration. Repeat this process with two more Procambris sp. The data collected when the Procambris sp. was not exercised was the controlll while the data obtained when the Procambris s. was exercised was the experimental data. The following equation was used to calculate metabolic rate: ,(∆O2 (mg/L)× vol of H2O (L))/(time (min.)× weight (g)) where ∆O2 is the change of starting O2 (mg/L) and the final O2 (mg/L). We used a paired, one-tailed t_test, due to the fact that we were comparing three different Procambris s., one being the experimental while also being the controlll.

Results:
The specific metabolic rate of the non-exercised metabolic rate in crayfish one was 0.01406 O2*g-1*min-1, in crayfish two was 1.89 X 10-2 O2*g-1*min-1, in crayfish three was 1.54 X 10-2 O2*g-1*min-1. The specific metabolic rate of the exercised metabolic rate in crayfish one was 2.29 X 10-2 O2*g-1*min-1, in crayfish two was 0.0164 O2*g-1*min-1, in crayfish three was 1.55 X 10-2  O2*g-1*min-1. The mean metabolic rate of the non-exercised Procambris s. in room temperature water over the 20 minutes of experimentation was 1.61 X 10-2  +/- 0.0025 O2*g-1*min1, while the exercised Procambris s. in room temperature water over the 20 minutes of experimentation was 1.82 X 10-2  +/- 0.0040 O2*g-1*min-1. The general trend of crayfish 1 was the non-exercised metabolic rate was lower than the exercised metabolic rate. In crayfish 2 the non-exercised metabolic rate was higher than the exercised metabolic rate. Lastly, in crayfish 3 the non-exercised metabolic rate was barely higher than the exercised metabolic rate (Figure 1). The paired, one-tail t_test that compared metabolic rate from exercise and non-exercised, yielded a p_value of 0.235.
   The physical observations that were seen immediately after the exercising of the Procambris s. during the 10 minutes was that the crayfish did not seem any less tired and/or less physical activity. While in the screw-top glass chamber, each crayfish, after exercise, were still moving.

Discussion:
The t_test yield a p_value of 0.235, which is much greater than 0.05, the alpha value, and it can be concluded that the results attained from the experiment were not statistically significent. This proves that exercising for 10 minutes does not have any effect on metabolic rate, which supports our hypothesis, that exercising Procambris s. would raise the metabolic rate, incorrect. Previous studies have attained similar results, exhibiting that metabolic rate does not increase immediately after exercise. It was shown that there was no significent difference between the pre-and post exercise-trained groups after 11 hours. This was due to the fact that the low intensity of the exercise training program that the rats were given did not have to expend a lot of energy during it, leading to less oxygen uptake and less energy output [Gleeson et al.: 1981]. Based on this previous study, this would explain why exercising Procambris s. for 10 minutes was not a sufficient amount of time to raise dissolved oxygen. In terms of how specific metabolic works, there needs to be enough energy expelled to raise dissolved oxygen rate. Because we inflicted minor and short-term exercise on the Procambris s., there was not enough energy produced, showing the 10 minutes of exercise before running the experiment did not have an effect on the species.  Since energy is directly proportional to the sum of oxygen consumed, it would prove correct that there was not enough energy needed [Johnson: 2016]. A possible step to enhance this study would be to have a longer exercise period, in which the Procambris s. exercise constantly, and/ or having a better way of exercising the Procambris s. This will allow for a difference in dissolved oxygen and specific metabolic rate between non-exercised and exercised.
   
   Proving that specific metabolic rate is changed only when exercise is repetitive and/or over a very long period of time is important in the scientific world because exercise is a physical activity many people engage in and understanding such a common activity can lead to more resources available for people. Also proving that oxygen consumption during moderate exercise barely rises can allow for additional research to prove at which time specific metabolic rate rises during exercise. These finding will allow for a better workout program for a specific person and their metabolic rate.
