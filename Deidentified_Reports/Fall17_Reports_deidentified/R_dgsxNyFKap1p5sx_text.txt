Title: Determining the intraspecific and interspecific Aggression of Betta splendins 

Abstract:
Understanding the aggression of Betta splendins is important to understand intraspecific interactions.   In this experiment, one male Betta splendins (Siamese fighting fish) was allowed to view three different Betta splendins and also three gold.f.ish (Carassius auratus).  The male Siamese fighting fish was allowed to see the other fish for only five minutes.  During these five minutes we tracked how many times the Betta splendins inflated its red mane and flicked its tail.  We attributed the inflations of the red mane to a point value of 2 (the most aggressive behavior), and the tail flicking to a point value of 1.  We recorded every time the Betta splendins displayed those two behaviors and we calculated a score of aggressiveness for every trial.  In this experiment, we found that Betta splendins do indeed display more aggression towards its own species because there was a significent difference between the two treatment groups.

Introduction:
Competition, or the battle for scarce resources, is one of the driving forces of natural selection and consequently evolution.  Organisms compete with other species to for finite resources (interspecific competition), and species also fight within their own species (intraspecific competition) [Johnson: 2017]. One species that exhibits intraspecific competition is Betta splendins.  Male Betta splendins show aggressive behaviors when they are in contact with other Siamese fighting fish [Nídia: 2006].  During confrontation, the two fish exchange information about their readiness and their ability to fight [Nidia: 2006].  Betta splendins will fight each other aggressively and the conflict might end with a fish severely hurt.  On the other hand, Betta splendins show a drastically different type of behaviors with species other than their own.  Siamese fighting fish seem to show a neglect to participate or interact with other species fish, which shows that they tend to shy away from interspecific competition [Johnson: 1973].    The aim of this study was to test if Betta splendins displayed the same amount of aggression towards Carassius auratus (gold.f.ish). To accomplish this, our group allowed Betta splendins to see one another and we also allowed the Betta splendins to see gold fish.  Our hypothesis for the experiment was that Betta splendins would display a difference in the aggressive behaviors between the intraspecific aggression and the interspecific aggression.  

Materials and Method:
	Before doing anything in the lab, we created point scale that would quantify the aggressive behaviors of the Betta splendins.  The point scale that we decided on was from 1-2, with two being more aggressive.  We attributed the score of 1 (least aggressive) to a tail flick and a score of 2 (most aggressive) to the inflation of the red mane.  For this experiment there was a total of four Betta splendins, which were labeled 1,2, 3and 4, and three gold fish, which were labeled 1,2 and 3.  All the gold fish and all the betta fish were placed in their own separate tanks with opaque and clear dividers.  For the first trial, the opaque divider that separated Betta splendins #1 and Betta splendins #2 was lifted but the clear divider was still in place, so that each fish could see each other.  A timer was started for five minutes and we recorded how many times Betta splendins #1 inflated its red mane and flicked its tail.  After the five minutes were over, we put the divider back and allowed the fish to rest for five minutes.  This process was repeated so that Betta splendins #1 could interact and see all the other Betta splendins (3-4) and all the gold.f.ish (1-3).  The maximum time that was set for the interaction between the two Betta splendins was 5 minutes, but if it seemed that the Siamese fighting fish became uninterested, or habituated to the other fish, the trial stopped, and a total time was recorded for the length of interactions.  A sum of the total points was calculated for each trial and a rate of points per minute was also calculated, since not every trial lasted the same length of time.  A table was created with the data collected and two graphs were created.  One for the point total, and one for the rate of points per minute.  A statistical test, a two-tailed, two-sample t_test was used to verify the significance of the results.

Results:
There was a drastic difference in the aggressiveness scores and rates between the intraspecies interactions and the interspecies interactions.  Figure 1 shows that the average the average aggressiveness score for the intraspecies interactions to be 48±6.4points while Figure 2 shows 10.34±1.7 points per minute.  The interspescies point totals and rates were lower with an average of 8.667±6.0 points and a rate of 2.933±0.4 points per minute.  The total points of aggressiveness (t_stat = 6.45 , d.f. = 4, P = 0.004).  and their rates (t_stat = 6.07, d.f. = 4, P = 0.003).  were significently different.  

Discussion:
	The hypothesis that Betta splendins would show less aggression towards gold.f.ish was supported by the data that was collected.  This result was also replicated in another study where Betta splendins were subjected to different stimulus to invoke the aggressive behaviors.  In the experiment, the betta fish had a higher frequency to minute show of aggression towards the antagnostic stimulus than the neutral stimulus [Nidia: 2006].  This clear separation between intraspecific and interspecific aggression was replicated in another study with Betta splendins and catfish.  In one study, it was shown that Siamese fighting fish indeed were able to distinguish the catfish from its own species and fail to display the same amount of aggression [Johnson: 1973].  Within the same study, it was noted that Betta splendins did indeed attack the catfish but since the catfish did not reciprocate the aggression, the betta fish stopped the aggression [Johnson: 1973].
	There are many reasons why Betta splendins display this aggressive intraspecific behavior.  One of these root causes of this behavior is territoriality [Begon: 2015].  Territory and its habitats and resources within the territory are finite, so it is rational to believe that Betta splendins exert energy to protect their limited resources.  By protecting their territory, they can survive and meet their metabolic requirements which will ultimately allow them to reproduce and increase their fitness [Begon: 2015].  Within this experiment, only male Betta splendins were used and there was a sizeable amount of aggression towards the other males.   The aggression shown towards other males within the same species may also be attributed to the competition for mates, with the “strongest” or most aggressive fish being the one who is able mate with the females.
	Energy conservation is one reason why Betta splendins show variable levels of aggression with other species other than its own.  Siamese fighting fish spend a lot of energy engaging in these fights to show superiority [Nidia: 2006].  To help conserve energy, Siamese fighting fish use display actions first, before engaging in contact, which is much more energetically costly [Nidia: 2006].  To “win”, betta fish usually have to expend more energy than its opponent [Nidia: 2006].  Since other species of fish are not competing for the same mates, it would be unreasonable for a Betta splendins to expend a lot of energy, since it would be a lost cause.
	There were inherent issues within our experiment that need to be addressed.  Even though we took great lengths to quantify the aggression of the Betta splendins, ultimately, there was still some subjectivity to the allocation of points.  Sometimes it was uncertain if the fish had inflated its red mane or if it had flicked its tail.  Also, there were only 2 characteristics that were observed, which might have skewed the data in either direction.  To improve this experiment, I would implement a more sophisticated manner of collecting data.  I believe tracking oxygen consumption of the Betta splendins in intra and interspecific interaction would be able to more accurately quantify aggression, since a higher oxygen consumption rate would correlate to a higher metabolic rate and consequently more aggression.  
Intraspecific interactions are not exclusive to Betta splendins.  It is a natural phenomenon, which like what was stated before, might help an individual increase their fitness.  There is another aspect that this study raises up.  There is a question if this aggressive behavior in the Siamese fighting fish is genetic or if it is a learned trait.  With continued studies of Betta splendins it might be able to weigh in on this question of “nature vs nurture” in regard to their aggressive behavior.  Through more studies better explain the evolution of intraspecific competition and how it has affected the dynamics of not only the Betta splendins populations, but also every other species that displays intraspecific competition.
