Title: The Affects of Color on Betta Fish Red Mane Displays

Abstract:
When it comes to Betta splendins most people will think of bright colorful fish that are often kept as pets. However, B. splendins were initially brown or greenish and were used to fertilize rice patties and did not exist in these vibrant colors until selective breeding was done. B. splendins are some of the most aggressive fish that we know of, and will fight one another when in the same areas. One warning sign of an upcoming attack is called a "red mane". Red mane exposure time is different for every B. splenden, and time of "red mane" exposure can be an excellent way in which to classify the extent of aggression a B. splenden will show. In this lab, we attempted to understand if coloration differences between B. splendins would have a significent effect on aggression shown. Blue and red B. splendins were used in this experiment, and nine 5 minute trials were recorded. The results of this experiment were not significent, pointing to the conclusion that differences in coloration have no effect on aggression behavior of B. splendins.
Key words: selective breeding, red mane

Introduction:
Betta splendins are more commonly know as betta fish, and are from Thailand and other Southern regions in Asia. Naturally, they are usually green or brown, however, human selective breeding has led to bright vibrant blues, reds, and other colors(Figures 1 and 2). While these colors are not naturally occurring, the wide range of hues are interesting to observe. Male B. splendins are generally larger than the females, have larger fins, and are brighter colors(Clotfelter, Curren, Murphy). The males also tend to be more aggressive than the females(Matos, McGregor).

B. splendins are known to be very aggressive towards one another, and show multiple levels of aggression. The first sign of aggression is a warning in which they face sideways, this is called a broadside display. They then flicker their pelvic fins and beat their tails. They then face the other B. splendins and will puff up their branchiostegal membrane, using large amounts of oxygen, from underneath their operculum(gill covers) to reveal a red "fin". This display is called a red mane display. This is the last warning signal before a B. splendins will attack(Johnson). Looking at the length of time of a red mane display is a very good judgement of aggression for this reason.

The combination of having such a wide variety of existing colors and with such a strong drive to "fight" one another, we began to wonder if aggression correlated to color in any way. We predicted that color correlates with aggression, and that B. splendins will show more aggression(a longer length of red mane displaying) towards B. splendins of colors other than their own. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment we began by acquiring  three male Betta splendins whose main body color was blue, and three male B. splendins whose main body color was red. These fish were then placed into two tanks, each tank containing three compartments divided by a glass wall and an opaque plastic sheet. These opaque plastic sheets were then put into place so that the B. splendins could not see one another. Then, three stop watches were used to time the trials as well as how long a red mane was shown for each fish. The first trial done was two red B. splendins in compartments next to one another, the opaque plastic was removed and a timer was set for five minutes. Each time that the fish displayed a red mane, a second timer was started and paused when the response stopped. One of these timers was kept for each of the fish being observed and results were recorded. At the end of the five minutes, the opaque plastic was put back in place so that the fish could not see each other. The fish were then given a five minute rest period. This process was then repeated for three trials with two red B. splendins, three trials with two blue B. splendins and three trials with one red B. splendins and one blue B. splendins. A mean number of seconds, and a standard deviation was then found for the three red on red trials, the three blue on blue trials, the red fish from the blue on red trials, and the blue fish from the blue on red trials. Finally, the data were analyzed for significance using an ANOVA test.


Results:
In the red variety of Betta splendins when shown to one another, the average time a red mane display was show was 172.83 seconds and had a standard deviations of ±90.83 seconds.

In the blue variety of B. splendins when shown to one another, the average time a red mane display was show was 143.33 seconds and had a standard deviations of ±61.94 seconds.

In the red variety of B. splendins when shown to a blue B. splendins, the average time a red mane display was show was 115 seconds and had a standard deviations of ±62.55 seconds.

In the blue variety of B. splendins when shown to a red B. splendins, the average time a red mane display was show was 91.66 seconds and had a standard deviations of ±121.9 seconds.

When the results of whether B. splendins red mane displays were affected by body colors other than their own, an ANOVA test was used. The results were not significent in any trial. The P value for this test was .549. This means that coloration differences don't have a direct correlation on length of a red mane display.


Discussion:
When it came to our experiment results we found that for B. splendins coloration had no significent effect on aggression behavior. The results for seconds that the red mane display was displayed were very similar between our controlll groups and our experimental group for B. splendins  of the same coloration. However, this could have been attributed to error. For instance, B. splendins, much like people, have different levels of aggression. With a sample size of only nine 5 minute trials and only 6 fish used it is entirely possible that some fish were simply more aggressive or less aggressive than the typical B. splendins of their coloration. Another possible source of error is human error. Since multiple people were timing the B. splendins it is possible that one person may have considered a response to be worthy of timing while another person may not have considered the same response to be worth timing. This human error could have contributed to results for coloration aggressions to be similar when they may not necessarily have been. A final source of error could have come from unintentional  choosing of a female fish instead of a male fish. Due to the fact that female fish are less aggressive than males, if one female fish was accidentally picked instead of a male, aggression of coloration results could have been skewed. Finally, the standard deviation for the results were extremely large. This points to the fact that habituation could have in fact been occurring, and B. splendins began to show less aggression as experiments continued. 
Coloration differences however can have major implications for fish and animals of all types. When it comes to sexual selection coloration is extremely important. Certain pigments cost more energy to produce than others(Clotfelt, Ardia, McGraw). For this reason, species of all kinds will choose partners with more of this coloration due to the fact that this symbolizes the highest fitness. This sexual selection can be seen well in chiclid fish(Seehausen, Alphen, Witte). Another implication of coloration differences in B. splendins could be aggression shown by other species of fish. Species that exist in specific color tones will likely show more aggression to B. splendins of similar colorations.
