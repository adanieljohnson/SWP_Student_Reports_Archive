Title: The Effect of Diuron, Hydrogen Peroxide, and Clove oil, as Herbicides on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
In response to the growing environmental problems stemming from chemical herbicides, the agricultural industry has experienced a push towards organic farming. This study examines the effectiveness of a chemical herbicide, diuron, an organic herbicide, clove oil, and hydrogen peroxide which has the potential to be used as an herbicide, on photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca. It was predicted that all three would inhibit photosynthesis, but diuron would be most effective, followed by hydrogen peroxide, followed by clove oil due to their toxicity levels and how they disrupt the photosynthetic process. With p_values of 4.98E-05 and 0.0084, diuron and hydrogen peroxide were determined to be significent in inhibiting photosynthesis and supported the original hypothesis, but clove oil with a p_value of 0.1394 was not significent and did not support the hypothesis. It was concluded that this organic herbicide, in particular, was not effective, but other organic less harmful substances like hydrogen peroxide should be explored as alternatives to synthetic chemical herbicides to reduce environmental damage. 

Introduction:
Plants utilize light from the sun as an external energy source. The extraction of energy from light occurs in plant chlorophyll through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in three stages. The first two phases, photosystem I and photosystem II, are responsible for photosynthetic phosphorylation, ATP synthesis. The ATP produced by these two systems serves as the plant's energy source to grow [Allen: 2002]. Agricultural practices, to ensure optimal crop controlll and production, involve an extensive use of herbicides, which target one these two photosynthetic systems to inhibit or stop plant growth. Diuron, one of the herbicides used in this experiment, targets photosystem II and inhibits the transfer of light excited electrons which prevents ATP synthesis. While diuron is a widely used very effective herbicide, it is toxic to aquatic animals and has brought about other environmental concerns, and has been suggested as a possible carcinogen [Nihal: 2008]. In today’s farming industry, there has been a big push for organically grown products grown without toxic substances as apprehension towards the use of chemicals in farming continues to grow as studies have shown a “spillover” relationship between agricultural practices involving chemicals to environmental ruin [Horowitz: 1993].  Therefore, organic, naturally occurring substances have been proposed as an alternative. Clove oil, an organic essential oil, has been used as a combative tool in weed prevention as it not toxic and it has shown previous success in controlllling the growth of broad-leaved plants [Boyd: 2006]. On contact, clove oil, rather than stopping the flow of electrons like diuron, leads to cell death resulting from electrolyte leakage [Tworkoski: 2002]. Although organic substances are more environmentally beneficial they are typically costly and difficult to administer [Boyd:2006]. While not currently used in the agriculture industry, hydrogen peroxide has been used as an oxidant to bleach cellulose, a major component in a plant cell, and because of this bleaching capability could potentially be used as an herbicide, as plants depend on their green pigment to capture light. Hydrogen peroxide is not only more toxic and costs less than organic options, its only waste product is water which makes it much less threatening to the environment than other chemical alternatives [Strukul: 1992]. Spinach, a commercial crop whose production involves the use of herbicides, has grown in popularity and has subsequently experienced an increase in agricultural production within the last few decades [Lucier: 2004]. This experiment seeks to study the difference in chloroplast inhibition in spinach, Spinacia oleraca to draw conclusions on the possible benefits of an organic approach to weed prevention with clove oil compared to the toxic synthetic alternative diuron, as well as the possible intermediary approach of hydrogen peroxide.  It is hypothesized that diuron will have the most success in inhibiting photosynthesis in spinach, measured by light absorption, then clove oil because diuron has been synthetically designed to stop the flow of electrons which is key to photosynthesis, whereas clove oil is a naturally occurring substance that results in the slow leakage and eventual death of a plant, and hydrogen peroxide because of its in-between toxicity levels and tendency to bleach cellulose will be second to diuron in inhibiting photosynthesis when comparing all three.  

Materials and Method:
In a chilled mortar and pestle, 10-Ml of cold grinding solution, 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0,  was used to grind 6 leaves of de-veined spinach. Once a thick paste was formed 10 more Ml of cold grinding solution was added until a uniform texture was made. This solution was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a clean chilled beaker. The strained solution was then placed into a 50-Ml centrifuge tube. The tube was spun at 200 x G for three minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then poured into a new clean centrifuge tube and spun at 1,000 x G for ten minutes at 4°C. The supernatant collected with this round of centrifuging was discarded and the remaining pellet was resuspended with  20-Ml of grinding buffer. This solution was then placed on ice while 13 test tubes were prepared. The blank solution for the spectrophotometer was prepared with 8-Ml of water and 2-Ml of 130 mM DCPIP and labeled tube zero. Tubes 1-3, the controlll of the experiment, were prepared with 6-Ml of water, 2-Ml of 100 mM phosphate with a pH of 6.5, which served as a reaction buffer, and 2-Ml of DCPIP. Tubes 4-6 were prepared with 5-Ml of water, 2-Ml of both DCPIP and reaction buffer and 1-Ml of 100% clove oil. Tubes 7-9 were prepared with 5-Ml of water, 2-Ml of both DCPIP and reaction buffer, and 1-Ml of 3% store bought hydrogen peroxide. Tubes 10-12 were prepared with 5-Ml of water, 2-Ml of both DCPIP and reaction buffer and 1-Ml of 40% diuron. Once all the tubes were prepared 100 microliters of the chloroplast solution were added to tubes 1-12. After the addition, each tube was immediately mixed and transferred into a cuvette. The spectrophotometer, set to 600 nm, was immediately blanked and immediately after, the remaining 12 absorbances were recorded to obtain time zero absorbance readings. The thirteen cuvettes were then placed directly under a lamp and remained there for 10 minutes. After 10-minutes the spectrophotometer was re-blanked and the absorbances of the 12 tubes were measured again. The cuvettes were then placed back under the lamp for 10 more minutes. Again, after ten minutes the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbances of all twelve cuvettes were measured. The cuvettes were placed back under the lamp for a final 10-minutes and afterward, the spectrophotometer was blanked and the final absorbances of the cuvettes were measured. Data was then analyzed using a one-tailed t_test because the directionality was known.     

Results:
Both hydrogen peroxide and diuron reported significent differences in absorption when compared to the controlll, reporting p-vales of 0.0084 and 4.98E-05 respectively. Clove oil was the only herbicide to report an insignificent difference in absorbance with a p_value of 0.1394. Figure 1 illustrates the differences in the percent change of absorption rates of all three herbicides as well as the controlll, and it can be noted that both hydrogen peroxide and diuron had positive percentage changes in abortion over 30 minutes while clove oil and the controlll both had negative percent changes in absorption values. 

Discussion:
The results obtained from this experiment partially support our hypothesis. Diuron, as predicted, with the greatest reported p_value, had the greatest effect on abortion. Because of diuron’s ability to interfere with the electron transport chain involved in photosynthesis, DCPIP, an alternate electron acceptor was unable to accept electrons and therefore remained in its blue form and reported higher absorption values [Nihal: 2002]. Hydrogen peroxide, in accordance with our hypothesis, was the second most effective herbicide, reporting a significent p_value as well. However, unlike diuron whose absorption rates were relatively stable, as seen in figure 1, hydrogen peroxide experienced a large peak in absorption percent change that quickly declined. This trend may be explained by hydrogen peroxide breaking down into oxygen and water. Over time as the hydrogen peroxide decomposed into water the water levels in the cuvette would increase, making the overall solution in the cuvette clearer, lowering the absorbances. Clove oil was the only substance that did not support our hypothesis, rather than acting like an herbicide, it reported the highest negative percent change in absorption values, indicating high levels of photosynthesis. These results could be the result of the oil droplets that formed in the cuvettes. The clove oil did not mix well with the other fluids in the cuvettes and this may have had an impact of the spectrophotometer readings. The tendency for the clove oil to not mix may have also disallowed any reaction to happen between the chloroplasts and the oil. Another explanation of this data may be that clove oil because it functions as an herbicide through electrolyte leakage upon contact with the surface of leaves [Tworkowski: 2002], had no effect on the isolated chloroplasts in the solution. To better evaluate clove oil or essential oils as herbicides, studies should be carried out with living plants and the herbicide should be applied directly to the leaves to allow the contact needed for electrolyte leakage. Although this study had the most success in inhibiting photosynthesis with the use of a synthetic chemical herbicide, alternative more environmentally friendly substances should continue to be explored.  Chemical herbicides are the most popular form of pesticide, in relation to how much is used and in relation to the areas treated, and these high volumes of chemicals, some with a half-life of a year, remain in the environment to cause damage for an extended amount of time [Freemark: 1995]. As agricultural production increases, as in the case of spinach, chemical herbicides popularity increases simultaneously, which in turn results in greater environmental damage. As there is no apparent decrease of agricultural industry, to avoid further environmental damage, chemical herbicides need to be replaced with less harmful organic alternatives.
