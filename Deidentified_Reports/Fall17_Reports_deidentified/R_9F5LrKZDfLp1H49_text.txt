Title: The effects of Nicotinic ACh receptor agonist on the Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius muscle amplitude

Abstract:
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a key player in the neuromuscular system. It instigates a muscles contractile process by binding to the postsynaptic membrane of muscle fiber. When it binds, it depolarizes the fiber, which leads to the release of calcium ions, who are responsible for initiating the actual contraction of a muscle. Moreover, it can be predicted that an ACh agonists will enhance the effects of ACh, thus increase muscle performance. In this experiment, the nicotine ACh (nACh) agonists will be tested on a Rana Pipien’s gastrocnemius and its effects on it muscular amplitude. Due to the nature of ACh in the muscular system, it is hypothesized that the nACh agonist will cause the muscle amplitude of the Rana Pipien’s gastrocnemius to increase. To test this hypothesis, three Rana Pipien’s legs gastrocnemius will be tested, each leg having two trials. The first trial is the control, where the threshold stimulus will set the first muscle amplitude, and the second is the experimental, where the threshold stimulus will be tested, but with the nACh injected into the leg. The results will them be tested with a paired t-test. Ultimately, the results provide sufficient evidence illustrating the increase in muscle amplitude caused by nACh. 

Introduction:
The contracting process of a muscle is begun by the release of acetylcholine (ACh). To be more specific, the motor neuron must depolarize to generate an action potential. This depolarization is caused by the influx of sodium ions to the neuron’s axon terminal. Once it is depolarized, the voltage-gated calcium channels open and the calcium ions trigger the fusion of ACh filled vesicles to the presynaptic membrane. The release of ACh from the presynaptic membrane of a motor neuron then depolarize the postsynaptic cell, in this case being the muscle fiber. The depolarization then instigates the release of calcium in the muscle fiber, which initiates the actual shortening of the muscle [Sadava: 2017]. This information provides us with an understanding of muscle function, which ultimately helps us respond to the question behind our experiment: How does an ACh agonist affect the muscle amplitude of a Rana Pipien’s gastrocnemius? And in turn, how can this be applicable to a human? 
To respond to these questions, we will be testing how the addition of the Nicotine ACh agonist (nACh) on the Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius will affect the muscle amplitude. Because Nicotine is an ACh agonist, it should act the same as ACh does. Also, our use of the Rana Pipien fits to answer our questions on nACh’s possible effects on human bodies, this is because it’s neuromuscular junction is similar to that of humans. To respond to these questions, we will test three Rana Pipien legs and isolate the gastrocnemius. With each leg, we then intend to find the muscle amplitude at the threshold stimulus of the muscle. Then, on the same leg, test the muscle amplitude at the same stimulus voltage as the threshold, but this time with the addition of nACh. 
Moreover, it has been shown through previous studies that nACh also has a high calcium permeability that can lead to a higher concentration of ACh being released. Furthermore, nACh has such a high permeability of calcium that it could also instigate exocytosis itself. [Wonnacott: 1997].  Therefore, my group and I hypothesize that the nACh receptor will cause the muscle amplitude of the Rana Pipien’s gastrocnemius to increase. 


Materials and Methods:
To begin, we had to have a dissecting pan, a pair of forceps, dissecting probes, dissecting needles, Ringer’s solution, a syringe, container with 1.2 mL of nACh (only 0.1 mL will be injected into the muscle), a syringe, a transducer apparatus, and an electronic stimulator with the BNC connector (the one with pin electrodes). The next step is getting the three Rana Pipien legs. 
Now to set up the experiment, with our hands, we gently removed the skin from the legs, starting from the top and removing it like a sleeve towards the foot. Once this is done, we separated the gastrocnemius from the bone, without detaching it from the knee joint. Again, without detaching it from the knee joint, we cut through the Achilles tendon, separating the end towards the foot completely from the bone. With a piece of string, folded in half, we tied a knot at the end of the cut off Achilles tendon. Leaving the side of the string with the loop intact, we cut off the excess string to facilitate the experimental testing. Then, we hung the muscle by the string onto the transducer apparatus. We also pinned the rest of the leg down onto the dissecting pan with the dissecting needles, making sure that the needles did not disturb the muscle but are in between the muscle and the bone. After this, we placed the pin electrodes to the muscle, the black one going at the top (towards the remaining Achilles tendon), and the red one at the bottom. We then connected the electrode wire to the electronic stimulator, which is controlled through LabScribe’s toolbar in our laptop. Through the labscribe, we are able to measure the muscle amplitude through the myogram drawn. Throughout this process, the leg should be kept moist with the Ringer’s solution. We repeated this procedure with every leg. 
Now, for each leg we did a control trial and an experimental trial. In the control trial we began by stimulating the leg (in volts) at 0 v but increased the voltage by 0.1 until we found the threshold stimulus. The threshold stimulus is when the muscle contracts and you get a muscle amplitude. For our first leg, the threshold stimulus was 0.4 volts. Once we have the threshold stimulus, we repeat the stimulus at that voltage another three times, this was also done in the experimental trial. After finding the threshold stimulus, utilizing the same leg, we can move onto the experimental trial. To keep the data consistent and easily comparable, we initiated the stimulus voltage at the threshold established in the control trial. Moreover, to find the difference in amplitude more easily, you begin stimulating the muscle before the injection of the nACh. In each experimental trial 0.1 mL are injected directly into the muscle while it was being recorded and stimulated. The myogram then illustrate the original muscle amplitude in addition to the muscle amplitude after the nACh is injected. By this, not only are we able to measure the difference in amplitude, but we are also able to see how the nACh effects the muscle’s contraction amplitude. Again, this experimental was repeated with all three legs. 
To test our hypothesis, we utilized a paired two tailed t-test. This t-test would be done three times, one test for each leg. We chose to do this type of test because it allowed us to compare two means, the control trial to the experimental trial, from the same leg, as well as tell us whether nACh increased or decreased the muscle amplitude. Thus, this t-test would be the most accurate in testing our hypothesis. 


Results:
Overall, in each of our t-test, there was a low standard deviation, and a P-value lower than 0.5 and positive. Which, convey that there was a strong significant difference.  
In our first leg, we obtained an average difference of approximately 0.08567. The t-value was at 23.079, and the P-value was at 0.00187. Because the P-value is below 0.5, we can say that the muscle amplitude between the control trial and the experimental trial is strongly significantly different, thus illustrating that there was a clear increase in muscle amplitude following the injection of nACh. Through the graph of leg #1, the difference in average muscle amplitudes can be seen. Clearly, the average muscle amplitude of the experimental trial is much higher than that of the control. Moreover, the standard deviation bars are very small, conveying a successful testing of our hypothesis because there are no outliers. Overall, this first t-test provides us with evidence that can support our hypothesis because it illustrates that the muscle amplitude of the Rana Pipien’s gastrocnemius does increase when injected with nACh. 
In the second leg we tested, there was also a strong significant difference between the control trial and the experimental trial, with an average difference of 0.3367. The t-value was 190.872, and the P-value was 2.74E-5. This again illustrate that there is a clear increase in muscle amplitude with the injection of nACh on the leg. To further this, through the graph of leg #2, it can be shown that there was a greater difference in average than there was in the first leg. Along with that, the standard deviation bars are small, which convey that there we no outliers in our data. Thus, through this leg, we can also conclude that the muscle amplitude of the Rana Pipien’s gastrocnemius increases with the addition of nACh, proving our hypothesis. 
Lastly, in our third and final leg, our results seemed to follow suit with the two previous legs. The P-value of this leg was 4.70E-5, which is very low, and conveys that the muscle amplitude averages between the control and experimental trials are strongly significantly different. Moreover, the average difference was approximately 0.12867, and the t-value was 145.894. This data, as did the data of the other two legs, also shows that there was a great difference between the average muscle amplitude of control trial and the experimental trial. In the graph of leg #3, the standard deviation bars are very small. These standard deviation bars are the smallest of the three graphs, thus illustrating that this leg had the greatest muscle amplitude average difference of the three, and the smallest P-value. The size of the standard deviation bars further validates our findings and the results of the t-test, providing us with strong supporting evidence to prove our hypothesis. 
Overall, the result of this final t-test can lead us to conclude that there is indeed a strong significant statistical difference between the muscle amplitude without the nACh injection to the muscle amplitude after the nACh was injected. 


Discussion:
The results of our two-tailed paired t-test illustrate that our hypothesis was correct, the nACh receptor does cause the muscle amplitude of the Rana Pipien’s gastrocnemius to increase. To elaborate, the low P-value’s in all three of our test, as well as the small standard deviation bars in each of our graphs serve to support our hypothesis because they illustrate that there is a strong significant statistical difference between the control and the experimental trials average muscle amplitude. The smallness of the standard deviation bars further validates our data by illustrating that there were no outliers, or exceptions, in our data, thus meaning that it was all consistent. Ultimately, the statistical test we took prove our hypothesis, while also validating our data. 
Through the results of our experiment, it can be concluded that nACh did indeed increase the effect of ACh on the muscle fiber. This can be explained by nACh’s high calcium permeability. Because calcium does allow the release of ACh through the presynaptic membrane, by placing nACh, it can be concluded that it increases the amount of calcium that goes into the vesicles, and causing more ACh to be released. Thus, nACh increases the muscular amplitude of the muscle by causing a chemically induced contraction, as it can be inferred through the results of the experiment. 
Although our experiment did successfully prove our hypothesis, to further validate our findings, we could have tested more Rana Pipien gastrocnemius muscles. We could have also better portrayed the difference in muscular amplitude had we utilized the muscle nerve to stimulate the muscle instead of directly stimulating the muscle. This could have provided us with better data because we would have evaded the risk of the wire disrupting the chemical processes occurring at the time of muscle contraction. However, this was not possible due to the nerve muscle of our legs being too short. In the end, our data results provided strong evidence that proved our hypothesis. 
This experiment could be further studied to compare the difference between neuronal nACh receptors (nAChRs) and muscular nACh receptors and their difference effects on the human body. In a study that touches on the concept of neuronal nAChRs and muscular nAChRs, it concludes that neuronal nAChRs have a higher calcium permeability than do the muscular nAChRs. [Vernino: 1992]. This can lead us to conclude that nACh has a greater effect in the efficiency of processes in the central nervous system rather than the muscular nervous system. However, it does not pertain to nACh’s effect on the human body. Another question that could be addressed in future studies is the long-term effects nicotine can have on the body. For example, a study could question the efficiency of nACh when it was first injected in to an organism in comparison to its effects after a few days, weeks, or months. A real-life example is smoking, with which nicotine is often negatively associated with. This is addressed in a study regarding the cognitive effects of nicotine. In the study it is found that nicotine improves cognitive performance, which can be explained by the high calcium permeability in neural nAChRs [Rezvani: 2001]. This study too, however, fails to address long-term effects of nicotine in the human body.
