Title: Exercise and its effect on Specific Metabolic rate in the Procambris spp.

Abstract:
Metabolic functions occur in animals in order to maintain homeostasis. When an animal achieves homeostatic imbalances metabolic functions fire in order to return to baseline. Respiration is the homeostatic function we are observing in the Procambris spp. When the crayfish are placed in stressful situations it has to find another way to produce energy or increase its metabolic function. It was hypothesized that the addition of exercise would cause an increase in specific metabolic rate (SMR) for the crayfish when compared to the controlll situation. This prediction is based on what is known about homeostatic regulation. To test the hypothesis three crayfish were used and at first, they were tested as a controlll. After controlll testing, they were forced to exercise for two minutes and then placed back in the testing chamber. The hypothesis was rejected after testing due to a high P-value of 0.578602. After testing was concluded it was observed that exercise did not produce a statistically significent effect on the specific metabolic rate. After researching we feel that these results showed no significent difference in the oxygen consumption rate due to the crayfish most likely using glycolysis when in the stressful condition.

Introduction:
In this lab, we will be testing the effects on respiration rate when exercise is done and its effects on the metabolic rate in the crayfish. Metabolic processes are those in which energy is transferred directly and can be measured as such. [Johnson: 2017] Metabolic rate is described as the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass per unit of time. In our experimentation we are using the process of glycolysis as an alternative method for overall metabolic rate. This anaerobic respiration called glycolysis is the conversion of glucose into energy. Many species similar to the Procambris spp. are able to respire anaerobically when placed in stressful conditions which turns out to be very helpful to analyzing our results. [Newell: 1973] Unlike a Human, a Crayfish, also called the Procambris spp., is an ectotherm. Being an ectotherm means that they use less food during respiration and that they can go long periods of time without eating. We are using the Procambris spp. because it is easy to measure their oxygen consumption, easy to visually observe, and they are easy to force to exercise. In our experiment, we will be testing the rate at which a crayfish metabolizes when it is forced to exercise versus when it is at resting rate and at a constant temperature. Using that data, we will be able to calculate change in oxygen consumption under the exercise as well as the controlll group and in turn calculate the crayfish’s specific metabolic rate (SMR). We hypothesize that when forcing the crayfish to exercise we will see an increase in respiration rates and in turn an increase in metabolic rate.

Materials and Method:
In the beginning of the experiment, we received three Procambris spp. from their respective holding tanks. We began by weighing each of them and preparing them for testing. To prepare we first had to saturate the water in which we are using with a respirator so that the water is fully oxygenated. We then filled our testing tank with the saturated water that was held at a constant temperature. The first crayfish was then placed in the tank and sealed off with the oxygen saturation testing probe to begin the controlll experiment. Once sealed inside the tank we started a timer for twenty minutes and recorded the oxygen saturation level at the start time, after five, ten, fifteen, and twenty minutes. Once the twenty minutes has elapsed the crayfish is removed from the container, the water volume used is measured, and then we place the crayfish in the exercise testing container. To begin the exercise condition, we prodded the crayfish for a total of two minutes and forced it to run around the container until visible exhaustion has occurred. Once tired the crayfish goes back into the oxygen saturation testing container with freshly saturated water. Again, the crayfish’s oxygen consumption is marked at the start and the same increments as in the controlll condition. Crayfish numbers two and three also go through the same testing as did crayfish one. With our results, we used the paired T-test, which is most useful for us because we are comparing two conditions from the same population.   


Results:
The three Procambris spp.’s showed no significent difference on whether or not exercise caused a change in respiration rate. Crayfish one showed an SMR value of 0.0051 which is a 0.00341 mgO2/gmin  increase from the controlll rate. Crayfish two showed the opposite effect with the controlll achieving a higher SMR value than the exercise treatment by 0.00044. Crayfish 3 also had a higher controlll SMR value by 0.00044 mgO2/gmin than its test with the exercise treatment. The paired t_test in our experiment showed a p_value of 0.578602, a t-value of 0.657143, 2 degrees of freedom, and a pooled variance of 0.002835476. If you look below figure 1 displays our findings. 

Discussion:
In our experiment, we did not have statistically significent results between the controlll and the exercise treatment. Our P-value of 0.578602, small degrees of freedom and the overlap in the error bars confirmed that we had results that were not statistically significent. Having results that were not statistically significent fails to reject our null hypothesis and therefore proves that the alternative hypothesis was rejected. The three-controlll crayfish we tested had an average SMR value of 0.00451mgO2/gmin. Post-exercise we can see an inconsistent increase in the mean by a mere 0.000843333 mgO2/gmin. [figure 2] When we added the exercise component to the crayfish it appears that crayfish number two and three resulted to anaerobic respiration which has been documented by the Oxford academic article [Newell: 1973]. On the other hand, it appears crayfish number one stuck with increasing respiration rate instead of resulting to anaerobic respiration or glycolysis. This would explain why crayfish number one had a much higher SMR than that of numbers two and three. Another reason for number two and three to not have had an increased SMR value was that during parts of their exercise time they decided to try to fight off our prodding device and resulted in them not being as exhausted as number one who ran the entirety of his experimentation time. I believe that this experiment needs more testing with a higher test population of all about the same size and weight. Since this is a paired samples t_test we automatically have higher internal validity than that of an independent samples t_test, but with the larger population, it can cause an increase in effect size as well as a smaller p_value. [Zimmerman: 1973] With our testing, again we failed to reject the null and therefore have to state that our experimental mean is not statistically significent enough to say it had an effect on SMR values.
