Title: The Effects of Different Beats per Minute on the Aggressive Behavior of Betta Splendens 

Abstract:
	This study aims to determine the effect of music tempo on the aggressive behavior of male Betta Splendens through a song’s beats per minute (BPM). BPM is a measurement of music tempo. Betta fish naturally show agnostic, or aggressive, behaviors toward one another and we are curious to see how different BPMs (fast tempo or slow tempo) will change their intrinsic behavior patterns. We are interested in this study as it serves as a model to show that sound may affect the behavior of animals. We assigned the betta fish aggression scores in order to quantify their behavior. Our control group consists of the betta fish placed in a separate tank without music for three minutes and the betta fish placed together for three minutes without music. We hypothesized that the betta fish would become more aggressive when the tempo (BPM) increased and that the fish would change their behavior according to different sounds. Our hypothesis that the separated betta fish will be more aggressive when the BPM is higher was not supported as evident by the paired t test. 


Introduction:
	Betta fish are simply a model to study the larger concept of the effects of sound on aquatic animals. We are curious to see how different noises will affect the behavior of aquatic animals as a whole. Tradeoffs in terms of aggressiveness for animals include the cost of energy to fight and providing one’s dominance, which is shown over the course of evolution. Siamese fighting fish, or betta fish, are territorial fish that express aggressive behaviors toward one another. When two males are placed together, they will most likely fight to death. Betta fish therefore exhibit agnostic behaviors and should not be placed in the same tank for a long period of time. Male betta fish usually fight to show superiority, claim their territory, or to attract a mate. Normally, betta fish do not recognize themselves in the mirror and will portray aggressive behaviors when placed infant of one. One study found that in the presence of a female, male betta fish will increase the intensity of their conspicuous displays and decrease their highly aggressive behavior delays directed towards the other males [Doutrelant: 2001]. Betta fish therefore are cognizant of their environment and adjust their behavior accordingly. We are interested to see if betta fish will change their behavior based on the tempo (BPM) played. This can be related to a biologically relevant stimulus, such as noise disturbance. Beats per minute (BPM) is the tempo or speed of a song. The purpose of this experiment is to observe how music tempo (in terms of BPM) affects the aggressive behavior of betta fish. We are using betta fish since they naturally portray aggressive behaviors and we want to manipulate their environment to quantify their behavior. We hypothesize that increased music tempo will increase the aggressiveness of the betta fish.


Materials and Methods:
	The general experimental set-up is described in the BioCore Resource Guide. We switched the fish out after every few rounds so that we could reduce the risk of habituation. Infraspecific behaviors of betters entail broadside movements (when the fish turns its side towards the opponent) and facing movements. Before observing the fish, we made an aggression scale for both broadside movements and facing movements. Their aggressive behavior usually can entail pelvic flickering, tail beating, and showing of the red mane which will all be visibly evident. Pelvic flickering includes the movement of the pelvic fin vertically opposite the opponent; tail beating includes sudden movements with its caudal fin toward the opponent. When a betta fish shows its red mane, it is protruding its branchiostegal membranes and is threatening the other fish.  In terms of broadside movements, pelvic fin flickering represented score 1, tail beating represented score 2, and tail flashing represented score 3 (most aggressive). In terms of facing movements, having a pectoral fin erect represented score 1, the spreading of the gills represented score 2, and the protrusion of the red mane represented score 3 (most aggressive). First, we observed the behavior of two males that were not visible to one another for three minutes with no music playing. We then placed the two males together in the same tank without music. These were the control groups. We allowed the fish to rest after each trial for about five minutes. Then, we observed the two males when they were visible to one another, but with classical music this time with a BPM of 66-76. We repeated the last step, but with the fast tempo with a BPM of 152. We also placed two males together with classical music and two males together with rap music in two separate trials. All together, we ran 6 trials. At the end of the experiment, we performed three paired t tests with an alpha level of 0.05 to compare before and after observations on the same subjects but with different variables. 


Results:
	After running a paired t test, it is evident that the three groups are not statistically significant (1.5356, 1, 0.3675). The separated males treated with the slow tempo treatment (66-76 BPM) had an aggression score of 3.67 ±4.9., but an aggression score of 8±4.9 when treated with the fast tempo music (152 BPM). These groups can be compared to the control group with an aggression score of 7.67±4.9. A general trend that we saw in the data was that the betta fish became slightly more aggressive as the tempo increased, but only by a very small amount. Therefore, the data is insignificant and most likely due to chance and their innate aggressiveness towards one another. 


Discussion:
	Our hypothesis was not supported. This statistical insignificance could be the result of error in the lab or simply be due to the idea that fish might not noticeably change their behavior in response to sound as a result of adaptation to their environment. The betta fish did receive a slightly higher aggression score when the BPM increased, but this was most likely due to chance events. The data was insignificant and therefore our hypothesis was not supported. 
	 In terms of the larger purpose of this study, scientists are not exactly sure how and to what extent sound effects aquatic animals. One study was concerned with the effect of human-generated sound on fish. The study suggested that sound might result in temporary behavior shifts, however, it is impossible to extrapolate these results to all fish species. The data suggested that  many of the lower frequency (under 1,000 Hz) sounds are also likely to affect fish [Popper, 2003]. This is similar to our study in that it represents how sound causes a shift in the behavior of fish. Sound was found to shift behavior and sound disturbance should effect most behaviors similarly. Another study researched the effects of loud noises on human behavior through the physical parameters of the sound and the psychological characteristics of a situation [Cohen: 1981]. This study suggested that there is some relationship between noise and behavior, as noise is thought to affect the nervous system. Both of the previously mentioned studies are applicable to our study in that they focus on the relationship between noise and behavior. The prevalence of human-related disturbances can be related to this study as a whole. We do not definitely know the effect of loud noises on aquatic animals. Hunting boats in the Atlantic ocean are most likely encroaching upon the habitats of the aquatic animals and changing their behaviors as a result. Sources of error could have included our personal reactions to the fish. Our excitement could have caused the fish to change their behaviors. Likewise, our excitement could have scared the fish and caused their behavior to change as a result. Experimental error also occurred when we put the two betta fish together. We did not consider this in our results.
