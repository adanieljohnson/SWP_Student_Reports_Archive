Title: Effect of Lidocaine of Twitch Threshold of Northern Leopard Frog Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
Lidocaine is an anesthetic that blocks sodium channels, preventing action potentials and nerve-signaling. Northern leopard frog legs were used to determine the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle before and after the administration of lidocaine using electrodes and a force transducer. It was hypothesized that lidocaine would raise the voltage needed to reach the twitch threshold.The legs were shown to have a significant increase in twitch threshold when lidocaine was administered to the gastrocnemius muscle and stimulated via the sciatic nerve (P-value=0.0424). Lidocaine has been shown to block both sensory and motor neurons. Lidocaine has been shown to block both sensory and motor neurons, and brings the potential dangers of its use on ventricular arrhythmias and on other more delicate autonomic nerve/muscle functions to our attention.


Introduction:
Lidocaine is one of the most popular anesthetics for outpatient use, and is commonly used in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias [Hasan: 2017]. A class 1 B antiarrhythmic agent, lidocaine prevents action-potentials from nerve cells by binding to voltage-gated sodium channels [Lidocaine: 2017]. In this study, the effects of lidocaine on the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle via the sciatic nerve of the Northern leopard frog, or Rana pipiens, were studied. As lidocaine prevents action potentials, it is hypothesized that the twitch threshold will be higher for subjects when lidocaine is introduced with the independent variable being the administration of lidocaine and the dependent variable being the voltage required to induce a twitch in the gastrocnemius muscle.


Materials and Methods:
Three freshly deceased and severed frog legs from lab-raised subjects were placed in a dissecting pan, de-gloved/skinned, and coated lightly in frog Ringer’s solution to keep it moist. The muscles of the inner thigh were separated to expose the sciatic nerve, and the Achilles tendon at the base of the gastrocnemius muscle was severed, and tied with string to a force transducer, making sure that the subject was centered and vertical where it was suspended and that there was tension in the string. The upper thigh was secured with pins, avoiding touching the sciatic nerve with metal. The nerve was then cuffed with an electrode sleeve. Then, the subjects were subjected to electric pulses starting at 0.1 V and increasing in increasing in 0.1 V increments until a visible and transducer-detectable twitch was recorded. A 25 mM solution of lidocaine was prepared by dissolving 0.6 grams of lidocaine in 100 mL of Ringer’s solution. 0.2 mL of the lidocaine solution was injected into the gastrocnemius muscles of each leg, and the legs were given 5 minutes to rest before the twitch threshold was found again, starting at 0.1 V and increasing by 0.1 V until a visible twitch was detected. The results were analyzed with a paired t-test.


Results:
There was a significant difference between control and lidocaine twitch thresholds (P-value=0.0424; t-value=15; degrees of freedom=1). Figure 1 demonstrates the difference in mean twitch thresholds of the subject before and after lidocaine was introduced. Two of the subjects required an increase in voltage to induce a twitch after lidocaine was administered. One frog leg was not included in statistical analysis, because its twitch threshold after lidocaine was unable to be determined.


Discussion:
The results demonstrate that lidocaine does indeed raise the twitch threshold of motor neurons like the sciatic nerve of the Northern leopard frog. As lidocaine prevented efficient transmission of action potentials to the gastrocnemius muscle, the voltage required to induce a twitch was much greater. These are not unprecedented results, and in fact has been shown in rats as well as frogs [Gokin: 2001]. In fact, the study with rats found that lidocaine’s effect on neurons did not follow the “size principle,” and smaller nerves are not always the first to be blocked. Perhaps this could be explored in subsequent experiments, using differently sized nerves to gauge the order in which they are affected. Another useful addition to future experiments would be a much larger group of specimens. As one leg failed to demonstrate any twitch after lidocaine was administered, the results are less concrete. Possible explanations for this malfunction include allergic reactions to lidocaine, damage to the sciatic nerve, disruption of the transducer’s string tension, and early onset rigor mortis. The ability of lidocaine to partially prevent muscle movement raises concerns about its effect on significant autonomous muscle functions, such as the heart. While this very characteristic makes lidocaine beneficial in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, the possibility of overdoses or improper use is a subject for further study.
