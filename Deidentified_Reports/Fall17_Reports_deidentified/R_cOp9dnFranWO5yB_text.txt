Title: Temperature Change Not Significant in Relation to the Rate of Photosynthesis in “Brassica oleraca” 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is an important biological mechanism that allows plants to create their own energy. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the rate of photosynthesis and the temperature in the “Brassica oleraca.” This relationship is becoming extremely important as the Earth is enduring climate change as plants have to adapt to these different environments to function optimally. It was hypothesized that the photosynthesis activity will be the highest in the room temperature (25 ℃) and will have a lower rate at the extreme high and low temperatures of 45℃ and 0 ℃. In the experiment, chloroplasts were isolated from the "B. oleraca" and added to test tubes containing DCPIP. A centrifuge was used to separate the chloroplasts and then a spectrometer was used to measure the absorbance levels of each test tube every ten minutes for thirty minutes. The results of photosynthetic rates were found to be insignificent between controlll and experimental groups using a one-way ANOVA test. 


Introduction:
In general, energy for cellular processes comes from three major sources: chemical energy, energy stored as an oxidation-reduction potential, or electrical/chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer. Plants directly and indirectly extract energy from these sources through photosynthesis and particularly convert light energy into more efficient chemical energy [Moldenhauer: 2017]. The equation for photosynthesis is: 6 CO2 + 12 H2O C6H12O6 + 6 H2O + 6 O2.  In summary, chloroplasts in plants absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll which excites electrons and triggers chemical reactions. Water is cleaved to release electrons to replace others and to generate a proton gradient. The electrons are eventually used to synthesize glucose, which characterizes plants as autotrophs because they can produce their own food source. Throughout the reaction, NADPH and a proton gradient are created to drive ATP synthesis and eventually molecules combine to produce glucose. Sugar in plants has been proved to additionally stimulate plant growth, causing a feedback loop in the plant and maintaining or even increasing the photosynthetic rates [Lembrechts: 2017]. In this experiment, the organism under investigation is the "Brassica oleraca," commonly known as kale. It is easily obtainable, observable, and simple plant to investigate.  In general, temperature does not affect the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis, but it does affect the light independent mechanisms. At temperatures that are both too high and too low for optimal photosynthesis in the "B. oleraca," the key enzymes are not able to work or catalyze efficiently, which decreases the photosynthetic rate. At high temperatures, some enzymes become denatured and cannot function properly. In Thomas Sharkey’s experiment with heat stress and photosynthesis, he found that only “photosystem I and cytochrome complex reactions” are substantially affected by heat. In addition, photosystem II was not affected by the heat treatments and the “rubisco [enzyme] normally deactivates at these moderately stressful temperatures” [Sharkey: 2005]. These results coincide with Johnson’s claim that light independent reactions are affected by stressful heat. The three temperature conditions in the experiment for “B. oleraca” are 0 ℃ in an ice bath, 25 ℃ in room temperature, and 45 ℃ in a hot water bath. Based on these changed conditions, the photosynthetic rate will be measured and compared against each other. This biological question of temperature and optimal photosynthetic rate is being explored in order to grow "B. oleraca" during the right time of year and temperatures. In addition, with the looming concern of global warming and climate change, this experiment may give insight for the future photosynthesis efficiency if the Earth’s climate continuously heats up. The hypothesis is that there will be a significent decrease in photosynthesis activity at both low and high temperatures because the plant will not be working at its optimal temperature and therefore will not be working efficiently.


Materials and Method:
Part I:
	First, cool the mortar and pestle on ice while removing the central veins from four kale leaves. Rinse the remains of the leaves with water and rid the extra moisture. Add the kale leaves to the mortar and pestle and add 10 Ml of cold 400 mM sucrose in Tricine grinding buffer with a pH of 8. Grind until it has a thick consistency. Add an extra 10 Ml of the grinding buffer and then strain the mixture through three cheese cloth layers and into a beaker. Pour the liquid into a centrifuge tube labeled “A.” Spin it at 200 X G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm) for three minutes at 4 ℃. Collect the supernatant, no debris, and pour it into the tube marked “B.” Centrifuge this at 1,000 X G (2800 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 ℃. Once complete, pour the supernatant out into tube “C” and then suspend the pellet in tube “B” by adding 20 Ml of the same grinding buffer and mixing it with a pipette. 
Part II:
	Label sixteen large test tubes in a tube rack. There are five replicates of each of the reaction mixes. Only one blank tube is needed. Add 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of the 100 mM phosphate reaction buffer of 6.5 pH at room temperature to the blank tube. The rest of the test tubes all need 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 uM DCPIP, and 2 Ml of 100 mM reaction buffer. Number sixteen spectrophotometer cuvettes, 0-15. Once everything is prepared, add 100 uL of the enriched chloroplasts previously prepared to every tube. Mix the tubes and transfer the mixes to the corresponding spectrophotometer cuvettes. Blank the spectrophotometer at 600 nm with the blank cuvette. Measure the absorbance of each tube; this will be Time Zero. Place samples 0 and 1-5 on the tube rack and leave it in room temperature (25 ℃). Samples 6-10 go in the ice (0 ℃). Samples 11-15 go into the heat bath (45 ℃). After 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer with sample 0 and then record the absorbance of every sample at 600 nm. Be sure to put the samples back in the correct temperature environment. After 10 more minutes (20 total minutes), blank the spectrophotometer and re-measure the samples. Wait 10 more minutes (30 total minutes) and record the last measurements.
In order to measure electron transfer reactions and the rate of photosynthetic reduction in chloroplasts, the Hill reaction is used: 2 H2O + 2 DCPIP (blue)  2 DCPIPH2 (colorless) + O2.  A one-way ANOVA test was used for this experiment because the experiment only involved one independent variable and involved three different temperature conditions to compare.


Results:
In general, the controlll group’s photosynthetic rate in 25℃ increased steadily at the highest rate of about 11-12% over the course of 30 minutes. The controlll and cold temperature groups showed similar decreases in absorbance (increase in photosynthesis due to more DCPIP turning colorless) over the 30-minute time period as observed in the comparative Figure 1. All three groups had consistent standard errors.  A one-way ANOVA test was used for this experiment to compare the three different temperatures. Results of the ANOVA test can be viewed in Figures 2 and 3. There was no significent difference (p = 0.483) in the average absorbance at 30 minutes of the three different temperature conditions. The alternative hypothesis was not supported.


Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis, and the statistical ANOVA test did not prove the results to be significent. Reasons for this lack of significance between the controlll and the experimental groups may be results of the temperatures not being extreme enough or the duration of the experiment not being long enough.  In terms of the experiment, the larger the decrease in the absorbance, the higher the rate of photosynthesis. As the DCPIP blue is reduced by the electrons from photosynthesis, the DCPIP turns colorless and is therefore unable to absorb as much light as before. This is due to the chemical change from an aromatic ring in the DCPIP chemical structure to conjugated C=C bonds.  The 45 ℃ condition yielded the smallest photosynthetic rate in the experimental groups, foreshadowing the inefficient energy production for plants in a world where global climate change escalated and heated the Earth to temperature that is too hot for plants to thrive.  For both cold and hot extreme temperatures, the mechanisms of photosynthesis involving the enzymes and reactions will not occur as efficiently. In the case of extreme heat, the enzymes denature and lose their shape and functionality.  In Booth’s experiment investigating global warming related to the carbon cycle, he projected the mean temperature change all the way until the year 2100. The graph displays an increasing curve and comments on the uncertainties of how plants will function in the predicted heat in the future climate. He stresses the urgency to understand photosynthetic responses to high temperature and the “potential role of plant acclimation” [Booth: 2012]. On the other hand, Pearce explored the relationship between temperature, environment, and water in comparison to the growth rate in tomatoes. He discovered that water had a larger impact on the growth rate than the minor differences in photosynthetic rates [Pearce: 2017]. Based off of the results from the experiment and other completed experiments, a future biological question to be answered could relate to age of leaves and their resilience to heat stress or simply how age relates to photosynthetic rate in the same condition.
