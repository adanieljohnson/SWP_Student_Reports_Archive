Title: Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, increases voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle in the Rana pipiens to contract

Abstract:
In this experiment, we examined the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, in order to further understand the basic properties of neuromuscular control. We used lidocaine to study its effect on the voltage needed for the frog leg to contract and eventually to reach tetany. We predicted the lidocaine will increase the voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle to contract. Four different exercises were performed on the skinned and dissected frog leg to help us determine the threshold voltage and the point at which the muscle fatigues. The experimental values were much higher than the control values for twitch threshold, demonstrating that the “voltage out” that the muscles produced was much higher in the experimental muscles. A higher strength was produced from the experimental muscles. The paired t- test found that the mean voltage of the experimental group was significantly greater than the mean voltage of the control group; these results were found to be significant. The experimental values were higher than the control values, proving that the injection of the lidocaine caused the calcium channels to be blocked, thus hindering the contraction of the muscles. The muscles needed more voltage to cause them to contract than the control groups needed.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system, composed of nerves and muscles, allows for organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments. Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads, stimulating the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of calcium activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten [Johnson: 2017]. Sodium channel blockers, like lidocaine, block the sodium channels by binding to the channel. Voltage-gated sodium channels initiate and propagate the nerve, skeletal muscle, and cardiac action potentials [Wood et al.: 2004]. We will use lidocaine to study its effect on the voltage needed for the frog leg to contract and eventually to reach tetany and we predict that the voltage needed to contract and to reach tetany will increase once lidocaine is injected. Lidocaine decreases membrane excitability by blocking the sodium channels [Hoang et al.: 2006]. We studied the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, in order to further understand the basic properties of neuromuscular control. The Rana pipiens is a good model organism because it is very good at jumping high. It has good muscle power in its legs from a larger gastrocnemius muscle. The sciatic nerve was also easy to isolate. Lidocaine is the independent variable and tetany is the dependent variable. We predict the lidocaine will increase the voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle to contract. 



Materials and Methods:
First, our lab group was given a frog leg that was prepped before experimentation. The frog leg is then placed on the dissecting pan. We then grasped the skin at the top of the leg and pulled the skin down towards the foot using a pair of forceps. We then laid the skinned leg in the dissecting pan and moistened it with Ringer’s solution. Then, the sciatic nerve needed to be freed. Using a dissecting probe, we separated the inner thigh muscles, revealing the sciatic nerve. We freed the nerve from its attaching connective tissue using dissecting needle and forceps. Once we have prepped the leg for experimentation we are able to perform various experiments on the leg. 
In exercise one, we determined the threshold voltage of the muscle when it is stimulated directly with single pulses of constant duration. Using LabScribe, the stimulus voltage is increased in 0.1 V increments until we determined the threshold voltage for direct muscle stimulation. In exercise two, we stimulated the muscle by action potentials generated in the nerve attached to the muscle. The nerve will be stimulated by single pulses of constant duration. We connected the BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes to the stimulator output of the IWX/214. We then determined the threshold voltage for nerve stimulation by increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1V increments. In exercise three, we stimulated the muscle by action potentials generated in the nerve attached to the muscle. The nerve was stimulated for short periods at different stimulus frequencies. We left the BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes attached to the BNC- banana adaptor on the stimulator output of the IWX/ 214. We set the stimulus frequency to 2 Hz, the number of pulses to zero, the pulse width at 5 ms, and the pulse amplitude to the lowest value that still gave strong contractions from exercise two. Then we changed the stimulus frequency to 4 Hz. We recorded the stimulus frequencies of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 Hz. 
In exercise four, we tested at what stimulus frequency the muscles fatigues. We disconnected the sleeve electrodes from the stimulator output, and connected the pin electrodes to the stimulator. We set the stimulus frequency to 4 Hz, the number of pulses to 0, the pulse amplitude to a value that produced a contractile response. We then stimulated the nerve at 4 Hz. After stimulating the muscle at 4 Hz, we switched the sleeve electrodes. Then, we stimulated the nerve at 4 Hz. Then we changed the stimulus frequency to 50 Hz. Then we stimulated the nerve until the force of the muscle contraction drops to an amplitude that is only 25% of the maximum force at the beginning of this tetanic contraction. We continued to record after the contraction force of the muscle has dropped below 25% of maximum. We then disconnected the BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes form stimulator and reconnected the BNC connector of the pin electrodes to the stimulator. We stimulated the muscle directly for three seconds with the same voltage, duration and frequency that was used to fatigue the muscle. We continued to record after the direct stimulation of the muscle. We then quickly disconnected the BNC connector of the pin electrodes form the stimulator and reconnected the BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes to the stimulator. We applied the same stimulus used to the nerve for a period of three seconds. We then repeated these exercises once we injected the gastrocnemius muscle with a sodium channel blocker, Na- 25mM lidocaine that was dissolved 0.6 g in 100 mL Ringer’s solution. The hypothesis was tested because the contractions of the muscle before the injection of lidocaine were compared with the contractions of the muscle after the lidocaine was injected. We ran a paired t-test with two degrees of freedom. 


Results:
Figure 1 demonstrates that experimental values were significantly higher than the control values for twitch threshold. The experimental values are 2.5, 3 and 3; the control values are 0.5, 0.2, and 0.2. This information demonstrates that the “voltage out” that the muscles produced was much higher in the experimental muscles. A higher strength was produced from the experimental muscles. We used a paired t-test for our results as shown in Figure 2. The mean voltage of the experimental group was significantly greater than the mean voltage of the control group (t stat = 9.5, df = 2, P = 0.0109). We found this data to be significant. 

Discussion:
Because our experimental values were significantly higher than our control values, this demonstrates that the injection of the lidocaine caused the calcium channels to be blocked, thus hindering the contraction of the muscles. The muscles needed a much larger amount of voltage to cause them to contract and eventually to reach tetany than the control groups needed. Our results support our hypothesis because we predicted the injection of lidocaine would cause the voltage needed to be much higher for the experimental groups than the control groups. In this experiment, lidocaine was used to block the sodium channels. Lidocaine has many other uses in than the one that we observed in lab. Lidocaine can be used to prevent seizures that are caused by glutamate and for treating asthma [Hoang et al.: 2006]. I think that it would be an interesting experiment to safely explore the benefits of utilizing lidocaine to treat asthma. Asthma is especially prevalent in children and can lead to hospitalization. I personally have asthma so helping those who also have asthma would be an experiment that is appealing to me. Sources of error could have been if we typed the wrong values in to the LabScribe program or inserted the electrodes incorrectly. We were unable to conduct a tetany test, because we did not have values for all the experimental groups. The lidocaine had such a powerful numbing effect on the gastrocnemius muscle that the muscles were not able to reach tetany.  Though this was a source of error, it still supported the hypothesis that the lidocaine would have a dramatic impact on the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens.
