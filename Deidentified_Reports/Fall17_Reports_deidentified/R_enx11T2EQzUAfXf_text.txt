Title: The Effects of Substrate Conditions on Root to Shoot Ratio

Abstract:
Plants can grow in a variety of environments and are able to use resource allocation to successfully grow and reproduce. Our plant type, oats, can grow in many environments and changes how it allocates its resources depending on the substrate it grows in. Our hypothesis is that the oats that grow in sandy environments will, on average, have larger root: shoot ratios than those that grow in soil conditions. In our study, we used three groups: soil, sand, and a mix of both; and using an ANOVA test, we are looking to see if there is any significance between the substrate and growth. After our study, the results included an increase in root: shoot ratio as the concentration of sand in the substrate increased. Overall, our results supported our hypothesis and reinforces the idea that substrate plays a large role in the growth and development of root systems in plants.

Introduction:
Environments differ greatly around the world and contain a variety of plant and animal life. Even with these variable conditions, plants adapt and thrive. Through the study of ecology, the relationships between plants and their environments can become better understood. Scientists continue to compare ecology to physiology; by looking at each individual part, then the whole system, the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship begin to come forth (Cowles 1899). Plants rely on the environment as much as the environment relies on plants. The substrate conditions play a large role in terms of plant growth and life in the environment. Many plants allocate resources differently to compete in their respective environments; some grow taller than others to absorb more sunlight, while others grow large root systems to obtain water and nutrients more easily. Plants that typically grow in sandy conditions tend to have large root systems to prevent their movement and to obtain larger amounts of needed water (Gemma and Koske 1997). Similarly, plants that grow in topsoil conditions tend to have root systems that inhibit movement and promote water collection, however, they have much smaller root systems than plants in sandy soil due to water absorbing better in soil than sand. (Stuart 1948). 
While certain species of plants often adapt to grow in a variety of environments, they tend to fair better in certain environments over others. In sand-like conditions, species like Hydrocotyle, tend to dominate the land-area due to their adaptations to that give them advantage over other species (Bazzaz 1991). These species tend to cover large swathes of land with broad leaves and vines to increase surface area dramatically to absorb sunlight and crowd out other competition more efficiently. While in topsoil conditions, species like Zea Mays L., tend to have large advantages in environments that have more abundance of topsoil than other particles (Blackman and Davies 1985). The ability of Zea Mays L. to quickly grow vertically allows it to crowd out other competitors. Our study looks at a species of oats which can grow well in both conditions, and we used the species to better understand the relationship between root-shoot ratio and the substrate conditions. Our hypothesis is that the oats that grow in sandy environments will, on average, have larger root-shoot ratios than those that grow in soil environments.


Materials and Method:
Our experiment used three different groups, two experimental and one controlll, and each group contained three replicates. Each of the replicates contained roughly 15-20 oat seeds. The seeds were slightly soaked before being placed in their select conditions, one which was 100% soil, 50/50% soil/sand, and 100% sand. These groups should be given a small amount of miracle-gro, to better promote growth. We used two cups of the substrate for the 100% groups, and 1 cup of each for the 50/50% group. We then watered them for a period of two weeks once per day. At the end of the two-week period, we selected three individuals from each of the replicants. Using those individuals, we measured the root length and shoot length in mm and calculated a root-shoot ratio. The root length should be measured from the longest root to the bottom of the seed and the shoot length should be measured from the longest shoot to the top of the seed. Those measurements were averaged then used in an ANOVA test to see if there was any significance between the groups. 

Results:
Some general trends that we can observe from the data and figure is that the sand had the largest standard deviation and mean, which is what we predicted. Another trend was that both the soil and mix groups had very similar means and standard deviations. The Tukey-Kramer tests show there is a significent difference between sand/mix substrate and the sand/soil substrate. According to our ANOVA experiment, the p_value among the groups was 0.007792, which implies that our data was statistically significent. We found for our groups there to be slight variance in the means and standard deviations: the sand substrate had a mean of 1.146152 and a standard deviation of 0.429669, the mixed substrate had a mean of 0.765997 and a standard deviation of 0.252876, and the soil substrate had a mean of 0.663909 and a standard deviation of 0.20702 (Figure 1).

Discussion:
Our results support our hypothesis that oats that grow in sand conditions will on average have longer root to shoot ratios than those in the other substrate conditions. The oats that were planted in the sand conditions had larger root-shoot ratios than those in the other two conditions due to the ability of the substrates to retain water. Soils retain water much better than sands, therefore for the plants to obtain their needed water for growth, they need the roots to collect water. Since sands don’t retain water well, the oats that grew in the sand conditions had larger root sizes to compensate for the decreased water retainability. A study done by the University of Chicago looked at the role of plants in the sand dunes of Lake Michigan and discussed their importance in preserving the nature of the sand dunes (Cowles 1899). They found that these plants often had large root systems both for rigidity and for water retention. Overall, our study has supported our hypothesis on the relationship between substrate conditions and root: shoot ratio. Overall, if we were to change anything for this experiment, it would be best to increase our sample size more than anything because 27 individuals is not a large enough of a sample size to formulate the best results. The ability of oats to easily grow in many environments helps us better understand how each plant individually allocates resources to best compete and survive, through growing large complex root systems to aid in water retention in sandy environments or limiting root systems in soil environments to minimize water loss. Resource allocation can help us better understand each plant’s individual role in the ecological community.
