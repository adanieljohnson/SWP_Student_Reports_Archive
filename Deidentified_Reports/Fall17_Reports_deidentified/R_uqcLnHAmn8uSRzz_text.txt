Title: Gravotaxis has a Negating Effect on Physarum’s Chemotaxis Responses

Abstract:
It is commonly known that for a cell to survive, it must be able to integrate both conflicting and supporting extracellular signals to produce the appropriate  response.  Our group wanted to examine how a slime cell, Physarum Polycephalum, would interact with conflicting chemotaxis and gravitaxis signals.  We hypothesized that, although chemotaxis signals would be stronger, gravitaxis would act as a significent deterrent to upward movement during the integration of the two signals. This experiment compared how Physarum grew with chemotaxis signals in both horizontal and vertical positions to compare the effects of gravity, with glucose and acetic acid acting as negative and positive stimuli. Our results were inconclusive, with the glucose Physarum samples providing significent data for the effects of gravitaxis and the acetic acid samples showing insignificent effects of gravity. Although these results can conclude the significance of gravitaxis, they provide evidence that harmful substances such as acetic acid may be more heavily prioritized  for cell movement compared to nutrition sources such as glucose. 

Introduction:
Physarum Polycephalum is different from most mold organism s as it is a multinucleate syncytium, with multiple nuclei held within a singular plasma membrane allowing the Physarum to behave as a giant, single-celled organism.  As a giant cell, it is an excellent model organism to study how individual cells react to extracellular signals. As a species, they are  incredibly intelligent for how simple-celled they are. For example, they have  shown the ability to complete tasks as complex as memorize maze patterns based on previous feeding experiments [Reid, 2012.] This experiment set out to examine how Physarum would respond to chemotaxis and gravitaxis respectively, even if they provided conflicting signals. Chemotaxis is the cell’s response to extracellular molecules, whether that be a nutrition source such as glucose or a substance that could potentially damage the cell. Gravitaxis is the cell’s response to gravity, as Physarum knows to search for water downstream [Hock, 2006.]  Both Physarum’s orientation in respect to gravity and their proximity to positive or harmful substances will activate calcium pathways that signal growth. In the cell, primary messengers bind with extracellular receptor, these receptors trigger a pathway that ultimately leads to an influx of calcium in the cell. The amount of calcium brought in dictates both the direction and the strength of the response, in this case, growth. Knowing that the cell will naturally grow downward when oriented on a vertical plane, our group hypothesized that a strong chemotaxis signal would override this signal. We hypothesized that a strong positive stimulus such as glucose located above Physarum, or a strong negative stimulus such as citric acid below, would cause the organism to grow up in contrast to gravitational signals. However, we believe that gravitaxis will still have a significent effect during the integration of chemical signaling compared to the cell responding solely to a chemical signal.   

Materials and Method:
This experiment requires 9 water agar plates, 6 PDA plates, Glucose for 6 half plates, 1 tube of concentrated acetic acid, and a stock plate of Physarum in a water agra plate. The acetic acid was diluted into 20Ml of water before pouring it into a water agar plate to allow for it to soak. The first two PDA plates were setup with just the Physarum sample in the middle of the plate with nothing else present . This is done by cutting out blocks of the PDA using sterilized tools (dipped in ethanol and then burned), these square holes measure 1cm on each side. In these holes, blocks of Physarum or the chemotaxis signals can be placed. One of these “blank plates” is set down horizontally while the other is suspended vertically. With the 6 PDA plates, the Physarum sample is set in the middle of the plate and the 3 blocks of the acetic acid agar are placed together on the perimeter of the plates interior. 3 of these plates are set horizontally, while the other three are suspended vertically with the acetic acid blocks towards the bottom of the dish. Finally, in the six remaining water Agar plates, one block of Physarum is placed in the center with a glucose block placed on the perimeter of  inside the plate. Three of these plates are set horizontally, while the other three are suspended vertically, with the glucose blocks towards the top of the plate. These 15 plates are left in an incubator according to their various orientations and left to colonize for 24 hours. After 24 hours, remove plates and measure the length of the longest strand and in what direction it grew using a ruler (cm) (towards the glucose, up, down, etc.) 

Results:
 A trend was seen in our data as Physarum growth appeared to be more closely correlated with either the negative or positive chemotaxis stimulus rather than the gravitaxis signaling it was also receiving. For the blank samples, we saw growth in both samples, with downward growth in the vertical sample and regular growth in the horizontal sample. In the Glucose samples, we saw a 50% decrease in growth from the horizontal to vertical samples, with a significent P-value of .01 (alpha value .05) In the horizontal sample the average length of the longest strand was 4.5 cm towards the glucose, while in the vertical samples the longest strand averaged 2.36cm towards the glucose. For the acetic acid sample, we saw a 18% decrease in growth from the horizontal to vertical samples, with an insignificent P-value of .6268. In the horizontal sample, the average length of the longest strand was 2.133cm away from the acetic acid, while in the vertical samples the average longest strand was 1.733 cm away from the acetic acid. 

Discussion:
Our results partially supported our hypothesis. In the Glucose samples, the results correlated with our hypothesis. The Physarum in the vertically oriented plates grew up as predicted in direct opposition to the gravitational signals, however the effect of gravitaxis was evident as growth was significently less than in samples where Physarum was able to grow towards glucose on an unhindered, horizontal plane. Meanwhile, our hypothesis was not supported in the acetic acid plates. Although the samples did grow up as predicted, the difference between the horizontal and vertical samples was negligible. It is possible that this shows the hierarchy of signal strengths within the cell, prioritizing getting away from something harmful such as acetic acid than to rapidly work towards a food source like glucose . It is well documented that slime molds are an intelligent species [Jabr, 2012.]  It would make sense that an intelligent species would prioritize, in the short term, safety over nutrition, especially if the path to that nutrition was entirely unhindered. It also could be a result of the food source we used, glucose. In a 2009 study, Dr. Tanya Latty proved that Physarum prioritizes better food sources in their movement patterns and searches [Latty, 2009.]  This would suggest it is possible that the glucose-prepared agar cubes were not sufficient enough stimulant to encourage great movement from the Physarum sample in a short, 24-hour period. If repeated, the study could be improved in a variety of ways. Ideally, there would be more controlll groups to compare the effects of gravitaxis on more than simply two types of gravitaxis, as the conflicting results allow for no real conclusions to be drawn. Secondly, a more glucose rich block could have been used to potentially better encourage our Physarum sample to move. Additional studies such as this with Physarum can teach us a lot about how cells prioritize different signals and ultimately integrate them into a singular, unified response.
