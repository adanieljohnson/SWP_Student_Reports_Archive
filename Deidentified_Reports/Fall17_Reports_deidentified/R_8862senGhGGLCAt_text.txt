Title: The Effect of a Calcium Channel Blocker on the Threshold and Amplitude of the Gastrocnemius in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
In order for muscles to contract, calcium ions must enter the presynaptic neuron as a signaling molecule to signal the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, which eventually results in a muscle contraction. Certain calcium channel blockers may serve to prevent the calcium ions from entering the cell, however, thus decreasing the responsiveness of the muscle. We studied the effect of lanthanum chloride on the responsiveness of the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens, the northern leopard frog, by measuring the threshold required for the muscle to contract and the amplitude of contraction both before and after applying a treatment of lanthanum chloride. The muscle was stimulated through stimulation of the sciatic nerve with the FT-302 force transducer. We hypothesized that responsiveness would decrease with the addition of the treatment, so threshold would increase and amplitude would decrease. Our results were inconclusive because essentially half of the data supported our hypothesis while half of the data refuted it. This shows that lanthanum chloride may have the ability to be an effective calcium channel blocker, however more testing and observations are required in order to arrive at a definitive conclusion.

Introduction:
Frogs are vertebrates, and all vertebrates have skeletal muscle, also known as striated muscle. Skeletal muscle is the type of muscle that is used in making voluntary motions and is made up of many individual muscle fibers that are made up of many individual myofibrils, which are long stacks of contractile proteins. Within each myofibril are many sarcomeres, which are the actual contractile portions of muscles. Muscles respond to motor neurons that originate in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The motor neurons innervate the muscle with axons that split off into individual myofibers. The points at which the axons meet the muscle are called neuromuscular junctions. The threshold of muscular stimulation is the minimum amount of stimulation required for a response, and the amplitude is the response to a given stimulus. Muscle stimulation begins at the cell body of the neuron, where a stimulus is received by the dendrites, which are input receiving offshoots of neurons, and is then turned into an electrical stimulus. This stimulus travels to the axon of the neuron, at which point some sodium channels open up, stimulating all sodium channels to open up and allowing positive sodium ions to rush into the cell and cause depolarization, which in turn causes an action potential. This action potential follows this pattern and moves down the axon of the neuron until it reaches the neuromuscular junction, at which point the influx of positive sodium ions triggers the opening of calcium channels in the axon terminal, which is the end of presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction. As positive calcium ions rush in, vesicles that contain acetylcholine are signaled to join up with the plasma membrane and release the neurotransmitter into the synapse. The acetylcholine then attaches to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic muscle cell, which opens up channels for positively charged sodium ions to rush in and cause the depolarization and subsequent creation of an action potential within the muscle cell. This action potential then travels along the cell and down T-tubules that lead down into the cell. The action potential changes the shape of DHP receptors that then change the shape of ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, within the cell. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that holds many positively charged calcium ions, and when the ryanodine receptors are opened, calcium is allowed to rush out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
	Within individual sarcomeres are structures called actin and myosin. Actin is also known as the thin filament, and is also made up of tropomyosin, which covers up myosin binding sites, and troponin, which is attached to the actin, tropomyosin, and has a calcium ion binding site. Myosin is known as the thick filament and is the structure that does the “pulling” of actin to cause contraction of the sarcomere, and in turn contraction of the muscle. When calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, they attach to the binding site on troponin, which changes the conformation of troponin and pulls the tropomyosin off of the myosin binding sites on actin. This allows the myosin heads to bind to the actin and release a phosphate, which will initiate the power stroke. The actin is then pulled towards the center of the sarcomere, an ATP molecule attaches to the myosin, releasing it from the actin, and then is hydrolyzed to prepare the myosin to pull the actin once again if calcium ions are still available. When many sarcomeres contract in succession, muscle contraction is achieved.
	The activation or contraction of a muscle may be hindered or prevented if a calcium channel blocker is present. Without proper release of calcium ions, the acetylcholine may not be able to be released to begin the process of creating an action potential on the muscle cell or the tropomyosin may remain in a position that blocks the myosin binding sites on actin. A prior study found that at normal human neuromuscular junctions, certain calcium channel blockers prevent the muscle from having an action potential, thus preventing the muscle from firing [Protti:1996]. This means that the calcium channel blockers must have affected the calcium channels on the presynaptic nerve cell, so the calcium channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum did not even come into play in this experiment.
The experiment performed will be carried out by testing the responsiveness of the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens, also known as the northern leopard frog. The Rana pipiens was a good organism to use for this experiment because it was easy to isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve for testing. The muscle will be tested under nerve stimulation both with and without a calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride. This will test the strength of the response of the gastrocnemius muscle both before and after the treatment. The hypothesis is that the gastrocnemius muscles will be less responsive with the treatment of lanthanum chloride with the threshold of the treated being higher and the amplitude being less than the untreated leg.

Materials and Methods:
Preparation of the Leg
Begin with four frog legs. Starting with the first, the leg should be skinned and the gastrocnemius muscle should be exposed. Next, the sciatic nerve should be exposed, however, no metal should be able to touch the nerve. The achilles tendon should then be cut, and string should be tied to the end of the gastrocnemius muscle. Tie the other end of the string to the stand so that the gastrocnemius muscle is perpendicular to the table. Use pins to make sure that the leg will not move, allowing for a little tension in the string so that contraction will be noticeable. Once the leg is prepared, the measurement tools should be set up.  Use the LabScribe application on a computer, and connect the computer to the FT-302 iWorx force transducer using the appropriate cables. The force transducer should then be attached to the sciatic nerve. Take the nerve and lay it across the sleeve electrode, covering it with the plastic covering once it passes across both metal bands. The other end of the sleeve electrode is then plugged into the appropriate place on the force transducer. Make sure that the leg is occasionally sprayed with frog ringer's solution.  Complete the same preparation process for each leg.
Determination of the Threshold and Amplitude over five pulses of the Leg
Once the leg is fully prepared and the force transducer is set up, the correct parameters for the LabScribe program must be set. The number of pulses should be one, the frequency should be one, the pulse width should be five ms, and the pulse amplitude should initially be zero. First, the threshold voltage will be found. Set the pulse amplitude to 0.1V and stimulate the muscle. If contraction is observed, decrease the stimulus voltage in 0.01V intervals until no contraction can be observed. The lowest value at which a contraction was observed will be the threshold. If no contraction is observed at a pulse amplitude of 0.1V, increase the stimulus voltage until the threshold is found to two decimal places. Once the threshold for the leg is determined, the amplitude over five pulses will be determined. The pulse amplitude should be set to a voltage that will give a strong response, therefore it should be above the threshold, and the number of pulses should be set to five. Stimulate the muscle and record the amplitude at each pulse to find the average voltage over the five pulses. Complete this process for each frog leg.
Addition of Lanthanum Chloride solution
After the control values of the leg have been determined, the same tests will be done to the leg, however, it will have the addition of a lanthanum chloride solution. About 2 mL 0.1mM lanthanum chloride solution will be injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. The leg should then be allowed to sit for at least 10 minutes so that the injection can take effect. Once 10 minutes have passed, the same procedure that was done to find the threshold of the leg without the treatment will be done to the leg. Once the threshold is found, the amplitude over five pulses will be determined again as well. The pulse amplitude should be set to the same value that it was set at prior to the treatment, and the number of pulses should be set to five. The muscle will be stimulated and the amplitude recorded at each pulse to find the average voltage over the five pulses. The lanthanum chloride treatment should be done on each leg after it has been initially tested without any addition treatment.
Statistical Tests
The threshold and average amplitude over five pulses are both analyzed using paired t-tests that compared the responsiveness of each test before and after treatment of the gastrocnemius muscle with the calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride.


Results:
For legs 1 and 3, the threshold of the lanthanum chloride treated group was higher than the control group, and for legs 2 and 4, the threshold of the control group was higher than the lanthanum chloride treated group, which went against our hypothesis. For legs 1, 2, and 3, the average amplitude of contraction over five pulses was higher in the control group than the lanthanum chloride treated group, and for leg 4, the average amplitude of contraction over five pulses was higher in the lanthanum chloride treated group than the control group.
	For the test of threshold, legs 1 and 3 had higher thresholds when treated with the lanthanum chloride solution than when not treated with anything. Contrasting, legs 2 and 4 had higher thresholds when not treated with the lanthanum chloride than when they were treated. For the test of amplitude over five pulses, legs 1, 2, and 3 all had higher average amplitudes in the control group rather than the treated group, whereas leg 4 had a higher average amplitude in the treated group.  Using the paired t-test for both measurements of responsiveness, both had p-values greater than 0.05, 0.888 for threshold and 0.207 for amplitude, so neither result was statistically significant and there was not a significant difference in either measurement comparing before and after the treatment of lanthanum chloride. The null hypothesis cannot be refuted, which was that there was no difference in responsiveness in gastrocnemius muscle with the addition of a lanthanum chloride solution.


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not entirely support the hypothesis, as half of the data supported the hypothesis and half of the data contradicted the hypothesis. Only two of the legs experienced decreased responsiveness with regard to both threshold and amplitude when treated with calcium channel blocker, one of the legs experienced decreased responsiveness with regard to amplitude but increased responsiveness with regard to threshold when treated with calcium channel blocker, and one leg experienced increased responsiveness with regard to both threshold and amplitude. 
For the tests that supported our hypothesis, the results can be attributed to the calcium channel blocker functioning as expected: blocking the calcium channels on the presynaptic neuron at the neuromuscular junction. When calcium channels are blocked in this region, the vesicles that hold acetylcholine cannot be signaled to join with the cell membrane and release the acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, thus the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle cell cannot be signaled to open up and allow sodium ions into the cell to deoplarize it and create an action potential. Without an action potential, the sarcoplasmic reticulum will be unable to release calcium ions into the cell, thus myosin will be unable to bind and pull actin, so the sarcomeres will be unable to contract, which would prevent the contraction of the muscle as a whole. The reason that the muscles were less responsive instead of not responsive at all could be because the calcium channel blocker either ran out or was simply not strong enough to block all calcium channels completely. This would explain what was observed in the experiment as none of the muscles were completely unresponsive. 
For the tests that did not support our hypothesis, a potential reason for the gastrocnemius being more responsive after the treatment of calcium is similar to that of why the legs were not completely unresponsive: the lanthanum chloride simply wasn’t strong enough. The solution was very low in concentration, 0.1 mM, which could have resulted in the calcium channel blocker not taking effect in the muscle at all. Another reason for the additional responsiveness of the treated legs is that the calcium channel blocker may have needed more time to reach the synapses at which they affect the calcium channels. The ten minute waiting period that was required could have potentially been too little time, which means that the calcium channel blocker did not have enough time to reach the calcium channels and inhibit them, thus decreasing the responsiveness of the muscle.
The data found in this experiment was both supported and contradicted by the prior study, as the study found that calcium channel blockers decreased the responsiveness of muscles, and in this experiment there were examples of decreased responsiveness and increased responsiveness [Protti:1996].
Ultimately, the data found in this experiment does not allow for a clear conclusion on the effect of calcium channel blockers, particularly lanthanum chloride, on the responsiveness of muscles due to a lack of a clear common outcome associated with the treatment. A potential limitation of the experiment was a limited sample size, as only four frog legs were able to be studied. Observing the effect of lanthanum chloride on a much greater number of legs could potentially allow for a clear conclusion to be made on how it affects the responsiveness of the gastrocnemius muscle. A future study, other than repeating the experiment with more subjects, could be to see the correlation between responsiveness of the gastrocnemius from legs legs of the same frog, in essence comparing right leg to left leg to see if there is a difference in responsiveness between individual frogs or if there is actually a difference in responsiveness between individual legs, meaning right and left leg on the same frog may have different responsiveness. Legs three and four were from the same frog and displayed polarizing results in responsiveness, so it would be interesting to see if the trend is prevalent in all frogs.
