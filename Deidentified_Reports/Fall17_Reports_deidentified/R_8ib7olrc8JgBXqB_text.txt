Title: Effects of Lanthanum Chloride on Muscle Contraction of Frog's Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
Voltage gated Ca2+ channels is a key factor in the muscle contraction because it controllls the exposure of the tropomyosin binding site. Lanthanum is used to block Ca2+ channels, and we investigate its influence on the muscle contraction by injecting 1mM Lanthanum to frog’s gastrocnemus muscle. As a result, our hypothesis is that if we inject Ca2+ channel blocker, the lanthanum into a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, the muscle with not be able to contract. Although our result doesn’t support our hypothesis, we find a past similar research which focused on the latent period instead of threshold and amplitude. We discuss differences between their experiment and ours and figure out the potential possible problems in our experiment.

Introduction:
Muscle contractions controlll movement in vertebrate animals, and are especially important for jumping species like Rania pipiens, the Northern leopard frog. The contractions of the muscle cells are under the controlll of neuron system by the signal conveyed by action potential and the releasing of Ca2+. When an action potential is conveyed into the T tubule, the Ryanodine receptor would interact with the DHP receptor and cause the SR to release Ca2+. The Ca2+ would then bind to the troponin and uncover the myosin binding sites on actin. As a result, the amount of the Ca2+ released would impact the amount of myosin binding sites exposed. 
	As the past studies have shown, though the sensitivity to voltage change can be influenced by many factors such as binding of G proteins to the channel and binding of compounds such as DHPs, the Ca2+ tunnels still plays a very important role in the controlll of the muscle contraction [M. Spedding: 1992]. The lanthanum binds much more strongly than calcium to the membrane of barnacle muscle fibers and decreases the membrane exitability [Takata: 1966]. In addition, lanthanum can also bind the membrane instead of calcium and block the calcium from moving across the membrane in smooth muscle [van Breemen: 1969]. So we decide to find out how calcium channels play their roles in the muscle by testing the lanthanum’s effects on functioning of gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg. Our hypothesis, with the variable of the threshold and amplitude, is that if we inject Ca2+ channel blocker, the lanthanum into a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, the muscle with not be able to contract because the myosin binding sites covered by tropomyosin can’t be exposed to the myosin head and thus the threshold will be increased.


Materials and Method:
Preparation Three Rania pipien frog legs of similar size are prepared and the skin was peeled. Then, we use dissecting probe to separate the inner thigh muscle and take out the white sciatic nerve. After that, we use a scissor to cut the gastrocnemus muscle apart from the leg and tie the end of it to the force transducer tightly. The muscle should be hang vertical to the tray. Then we connect the IX-TA box to the computer with the Labscribe software. 
Method of treatment We inject 0.2Ml of 1mM Lanthanum Chloride solution into the gastrocnemus muscle and wait for 10 minutes for the chemical to fully function. At the same time, we spray Ringer’s solution on the frog legs to keep them moister.
Electronic stimuli The stimulus are applied through the sciatic nerve. We start from the voltage of 0.1V and add 0.1V every time until the twitch occurs. After that, we would apply the voltage of the threshold to the muscle for three times and record the amplitude. We would do this for the three controlll groups and the treatment groups. We use the legs themselves as the controlll groups.
Recording and analyzing of the data We use the Microsoft Excel to record and analyze the data.


Results:














Fig. 1 Avg. threshold of the contraction in the frog gastrocnemus with and without Lanthanum treatment. Variable 1 (controlll) mean  0.1 SD, variable 2 (treated with Lanthanum) mean  0.1 SD. P-value=1.

 
Fig. 2 Avg. amplitude of the contraction in the frog gastrocnemus with and without Lanthanum treatment. Variable 1 (controlll) mean  0.02 SD, variable 2 (treated with Lanthanum) mean  0.08 SD. P-value=0.36


Discussion:
According to the result of the experiment, there’s no significent difference regarding the muscle contraction threshold and amplitude since the P-value is significently larger than 0.05. As a result, the hypothesis is not supported by the data. However, we find another similar experiment done by Anderson KE and Edmen KAP in 1974. But what’s different is that they tested the latent period in the experiment. The latent period was found to increase from 3.2±0.09 ms (mean±S.E., n = 15) in normal Ringer to 7.7±0.3 ms (n =15) in 0.3 mM lanthanum. [Anderson: 1974] There are several differences between their experiment and ours. 
Firstly, we have different variations. They tested on the latent period and we tested on the threshold and amplitude of the contraction. The Ca2+ channel blocker would influence the latent period because it would take longer time for the SR to release enough Ca2+ to cause contraction of muscle, which means the latent period would be lengthened. Secondly, they controlll the temperature during the experiment in between 6ºC and 7ºC and the temperature won’t vary more than 0.1 ºC. As we know that the temperature may influence the strength of the muscles, maybe the amplitude and the threshold of the contraction would be influenced as well.
	In the future, we would reconduct the experiment and make several changes. 1. Use the length of the latent period as our variation. 2. Control the temperature during the experiment so that we can eliminate the effect of temperature on our result. We hope that with the second experiment, we can have a deeper understanding of the function of Ca2+ channel in muscle contraction.
