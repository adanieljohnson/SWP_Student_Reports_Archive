Title: Herbivory decreases root to shoot ratios of Pisum sativum subsp. arvense

Abstract:
Herbivory is a plant eating behavior exhibited by animals, and is an important part of the environment that plants are exposed to. Plants respond to their environment through things like resource and energy allocation, where more energy and resources may be spent on some aspects of life than on others. We hypothesized that the leaf damage caused by the imitated herbivory would cause the plant to allocate more resources to leaf repair and shoot growth than to root growth. We imitated the herbivory by punching a hole in each leaf of the experimental group after allowing them to grow for about twelve days, and allowed them two days to recover. At this point, we harvested some seedlings and determine a root to shoot ratio for height and one for weight for both the experimental and control groups. Our results found that the plants allocated more energy to shoot growth and leaf repair than to root growth, and the root to shoot ratios for both height and weight were significantly lower in the experimental group than the control group. Thus, our results supported our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Plants adapt to their environments by allocating more or less energy to various areas. One way to measure this allocation is thought root vs. shoot growth, specifically the length and weight of each.
	The specific environmental characteristic that we tested is the effect of herbivory on field pea growth. Field peas are a fast-growing plant, with long stems, roots and large leaves on seedlings. Each of these characteristics was important for our experiment, as we only grew the plants for two weeks. Additionally, long stems and roots increases the average root to shoot ratios for height and weight when compared to those of smaller plants. This larger value will allow us to more easily detect differences between the study groups, as we won’t be dealing with single milligram or millimeter values. Lastly, we needed our plants to have large leaves for seedlings, as we were studying herbivory. 
	According to Alison N. P. Stevens, “herbivory is the consumption of plant material by animals.” [Stevens:2010] In response to herbivory, some plants have developed defenses. Some physical defenses include thorns or spikes, while chemical defenses may include compounds like cocaine or nicotine [Coley and Barone: 1996]. Herbivory can affect plants in a variety of ways. In some ways, herbivory is detrimental to the plants, as they may be killed off entirely, or their growth or reproduction could be limited by leaves or fruits and seeds being eaten. However, herbivory may also aid plants, as it may help disperse seeds and decrease competition. [Prins and Nell: 1990]
 We mimicked this behavior by using a hole-punch to take a section of each leaf out of the experimental group. We compared the root to shoot ratios for height and weight for both the experimental and control groups using a two-tailed t-test. We predicted that the plant would direct more resources towards shoot growth to recover from the herbivory. This behavior would help ensure that the leaf has enough surface area for transpiration and sunlight collection in response the leaf-loss from the herbivory.


Materials and Methods:
We gathered approximately 200 grams of field pea seeds and soaked them in room temperature water for approximately ten minutes. Next, we collected six individual plastic planting containers, and separate into two groups of three on a planting tray with holes for draining.  The planting containers were filled with vermiculite and water until the vermiculite was damp. We spread the soaked seeds evenly over the wet vermiculite and patted them into the soil slightly. We cover the peas with dry vermiculite and water again to dampen the soil. Each side of the planting tray was labeled to ensure differentiation between the control and experimental groups. The tray was placed in a greenhouse with equal access to light and allow to grow. Plants were watered every two days using a typical watering can. Each planting container was watered for three seconds each time. The plants were allowed to grow for two weeks, and on the twelfth day, a hole punch was used to take one hole out of each leaf in the experimental group.  
 After two weeks, we removed three seedlings from each of the planting containers, totaling nine seedlings from each group. We ensured that the entire root was being removed with the seedling when it is removed from the soil. We rinsed any excess vermiculite from the seedlings with water, and patted them dry.  The seedling was weighed as a whole, and the weight recorded. Using scissors to cut between the shoot and the root, we separated the plant at the point where the stem changes colors. The root was weighed and the weight recorded. We calculated the weight of the shoot using the total weight and the weight of the root. We measured and recorded the maximum length of the root and the shoot for each seedling. The root to shoot ratio for height and the root to shoot ratio for weight were both calculated and recorded. We then calculated the mean weight of the whole seedling, root, shoot and the mean length of the root and shoot for the control and for the experimental group. The standard deviation for these values was calculated as well. We used two-sample one-tailed t-tests to determine the difference between the mean root to shoot ratio for weight for the two groups, and between the mean root to shoot ratio for the height of the two groups.


Results:
Overall trends of the data were that the root to shoot ratios for height and weight were larger than those of the experimental group, as seen in Tables 1 and 2, and Figures 1 and 2. Average R:S ratio for height among the control plants was 0.44, with a standard deviation of 0.198. Average R:S ratio for height among experimental plants was 0.27, with a standard deviation of 0.0415. Average R:S ratio for weight among the control plants was 0.229, with a standard deviation of 0.115. Average R:S ratio for weight among experimental plants was 0.141, with a standard deviation of 0.0599. According to our two-tailed t-tests, the differences between our groups for both root to shoot ratios of height (p=0.0128) and weight (p=0.0089) were statistically significant, as the corresponding p-values for each were less than 0.05. 


Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis, which was that the plants in the experimental group would spend more energy on shoot growth than on root growth. The extra energy allocation to the shoot growth would therefore stunt the root growth, causing the root to shoot ratio to be low for both height and weight, as was the case in our experiment. 
	In the beginning of paper, we discussed how plants allocate energy and resources to different things in response to their environment. According to our results, plants that are subject to herbivory allocate more resources to the shoots than to the roots. This can be explained by the plant halting root growth and using the energy it would have been allocating to roots to help repair the damaged leaves. Repairing the leaves is important for the plant, as without enough leaf surface area, transpiration and the capturing of carbon dioxide and sunlight are all negatively impacted. Without transpiration, carbon dioxide or sunlight, the plant cannot make enough energy for it to thrive and reproduce, or perhaps even to survive. 
	This is supported by Prins and Nell, who found that herbivory can positively or negatively impact plants, depending on where they are in their life and reproductive cycles [Prins and Nell: 1990]. 
	Possible sources of error in this experiment are generally due to human error. When removing the seedlings from the soil, although we were careful, it is possible we broke the roots and left some of them in the soil. Additionally, we imitated the herbivory with the hole-punch later than intended, as we originally wanted to imitate this behavior three days after the seedlings sprouted, as it would allow the leaves to be not completely removed by the whole punch, but would also allow the plant more days to recover from the leaf damage. It must also be considered that when we punched holes in the leaves, we were removing mass from the plant, which would cause an increased root-to-shoot ratio for weight. We believe that since the material was removed from the leaves, the mass is insignificant to the overall findings of the experiment.
	Future steps for this study could be to determine if extent of herbivory has a different effect on plant growth. For example, altering the amount of leaves removed between groups. Additionally, the herbivory could be repeated over long periods of time with time allotted for recovery in between. 
	Increased knowledge on herbivory and how it affects plant growth and resource allocation could be important information to aid agriculture and deforestation. If we know that plants generally are not affected by herbivory after a certain point in their growth cycle, we could transplant different species of plants into an area affected by deforestation at certain points in their growth cycle in order to help ensure their survival. Additionally, if we know how plants are affected by herbivory, agriculturalists could alter their strategies to adapt to this. For example, instead of pesticides, growers could use netting to keep animals away until a certain point in the plants’ life cycle where herbivory is no longer as detrimental to their growth. If future studies were done on the positive effects of herbivory for plant reproduction, farmers could use this information for help with seed dispersal and would have to do less planting. Overall, herbivory is a large part of the environment that plants must adapt to, and knowing as much as possible about how it affects plants throughout their life could help us be more efficient and productive in agriculture and regrowth after deforestation.
