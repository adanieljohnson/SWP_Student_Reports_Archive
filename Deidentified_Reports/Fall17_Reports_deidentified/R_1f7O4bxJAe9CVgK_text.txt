Title: Inhibition of Rubisco by CO2 in Brassica olaracea

Abstract:
The effect of CO2 concentration on Rubisco activity in kale (Brassica oleracea) was studied using the Hill reaction.  Rubisco is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of a carbon to a 5-carbon sugar - an important step in photosynthesis.  The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether CO2 concentration affects photosynthesis.  In the experiment, CO2 was added to the Hill reaction solution in different concentrations, alongside isolated chloroplasts in solution;  DCPIP was used in the Hill reaction as an electron acceptor.  It was predicted that a higher CO2 concentration would result in higher photosynthetic activity, but no significant difference was found between CO2-treated groups.  This may be attributed to our having used the incorrect method to measure Rubisco activity.  Rubisco is part of the "dark" reactions, while the Hill reaction assay measures only the activity of the "light" reactions.  We concluded that Rubisco activity is best studied by measuring gas exchange. 


Introduction:
Rubisco is the most abundant protein on Earth (Ellis 1979).  It catalyzes the addition of a carbon, from carbon dioxide, to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, yielding two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (Spreitzer and Salvucci, 2002).  This is the central reaction of photosynthetic carbon fixation.  However, Rubisco can be inhibited by binding O2, in which case it catalyzes a process called photorespiration, instead of carbon fixation.  The fixation of carbon by Rubisco, despite the enzyme’s inefficiency, is an energetically favorable reaction.  Sugars are still synthesized by plants, even though Rubisco is inefficient.  We are using kale (Brassica oleracea) to study Rubisco.  We were interested in whether the efficiency of Rubisco could be manipulated.  Kale is an important food crop and a C3 plant (it synthesizes a 3-carbon sugar in carbon fixation).  It is important to study the effects of CO2 concentration on crop plants, considering that CO2 levels in the atmosphere are rising.  Like other C3 plants, kale should be responsive to changes in O2/CO2 levels.  Since Rubisco is considered an inefficient enzyme, we are interested in manipulating the level of CO2 in the plant.  Rubisco binds CO2, as well as O2.  We are interested in changing the level of CO2 in the plant’s environment and measuring the change in photosynthetic activity.  We will change the level of CO2 in a solution with isolated chloroplasts.  Increased CO2 should result in increased photosynthesis, as an increased concentration of CO2 would lead to an increase in the likelihood of CO2, instead of O2, binding to Rubisco.


Materials and Methods:
A mortar and pestle, 3 centrifuge tubes, and a medium beaker were cooled on ice.  Kale leaves were added to the cooled mortar and pestle and ground with 20 mL pH 8.0 buffer.  The slurry was transferred to a beaker after being strained through cheesecloth to remove large particles.  This liquid was centrifuged at 200xG and 4oC for 3 minutes.  The resulting supernatant was poured into another centrifuge tube, isolating the solid debris, and centrifuged at 100xG at 4oC for 10 minutes.  This supernatant was placed in a clean tube and cooled on ice.
	10 mL seltzer and 10 mL 2x Hill reaction buffer were mixed and transferred into a test tube.  10 mL of this solution and 10 mL 1x Hill reaction buffer were also mixed.  3 test tubes were prepared with the chloroplast solution, 6 mL water, 2 mL DCPIP, and 2 mL 1x Hill reaction buffer with CO2.  3 more tubes were prepared the same way, with the exception of 2 mL 0.5x Hill reaction buffer with CO2 in place of 1x Hill reaction.  The control group was prepared with chloroplasts, 6 mL water, 2 mL DCPIP, and 2 mL pH 6.5 buffer.  The test tubes were placed in sunlight.  Absorbances were recorded at the start of the experiment and after 30 minutes in the light.  The independent variable was CO2 concentration, and the dependent variable was absorbance.  ANOVA was used to compare the three groups: control, 1x CO2, and 0.5x CO2.  The Tukey-Kramer test was also used to show whether the difference between each group was significant.


Results:
Both test groups showed a decrease in absorbance over the control.  The treatment with 1x CO2 showed a percent change in absorbance of -33.45 %, while the treament with 0.5x CO2 showed a percent change of -13.46 %.  ANOVA gives a p-value of about 0.001, showing that the results are statistically significant, but only between the control and 1x CO2 and between control and 0.5x CO2.  The Tukey-Kramer test shows that the difference between control and test groups is significant, but that between Group 1 and Group 2 is not significant.  The error bars represent an error of +/- 10%.

Discussion:
The results were found to be significant.  However, there was little difference in measured photosynthetic activity with regard to CO2 concentration.  This can be attributed to our using the incorrect method to measure photosynthesis.  We used the Hill reaction to measure photosynthetic activity.  The Hill reaction is the process of electron transfer in chloroplasts in the presence of light (Johnson, AD. Biological Principles Laboratory Manual).  This is known as part of the so-called “light reactions.”  We planned this experiment with the intent of using the Hill reaction to measure the action of Rubisco.  However, Rubisco is part of the “dark reactions” (Alberts, et al. Essential Cell Biology, page 476).  The dark reactions are not affected directly by the light reactions.  This means that our experiment measured the wrong activity.  The Hill reaction in no way measures Rubisco activity, as the Hill reaction measures electron transfer among components of the ETC in the thylakoid membrane.  Rubisco is found in the chloroplast stroma, where the process of carbon fixation occurs.  A better measurement of Rubisco activity can be made by measuring gas exchange (Kobza and Edwards 1987).  Rubisco is a strikingly inefficient enzyme (Spreitzer and Salvucci, 2002), and can be inhibited by O2.  Manipulation of Rubisco in crop plants would be beneficial in helping to alleviate the problems of water shortage and rising CO2 levels, especially in the developing world.  Therefore, it is important that the effects of O2/CO2 concentration on Rubisco activity are studied.  It is also known that Rubisco is inhibited by high temperatures (Sharkey, 2005).  With the current problem of climate change, it is extremely important that the effects of rising temperatures on plants are studied.
