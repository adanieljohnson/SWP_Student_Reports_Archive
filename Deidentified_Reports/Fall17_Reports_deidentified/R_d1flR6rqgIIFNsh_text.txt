Title: The Effect of NaCl Solution on the Rate of Photsynthesis

Abstract:
This study involves light dependent reaction in photosynthesis, and the effect and mechanics of the electron transport chain on the rate of the reaction. The study was conducted by calculating the percent of change in absorbance when chloroplast are put in different treatments every 10 minuets for 30 minuets. Then the effect 1.4M NaCl solution on the rate photosynthesis was compared to the rate of photosynthesis in a normal light environment. This experiment done assuming that NaCl slows, if not stopping, the flow of electrons thus slowing photosynthesis [Sudhir: 2005]. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the processed used by autotrophs to produce chemical energy for later use. This process appears in the chloroplast found in Eukaryotic plant cells. Photosynthesis has a light reaction that is an oxidative-reduction reaction in which electrons are translated via the electron transport chain [Karp: 2008]. DCPIP is a deep blue substance used in the reactions because it is an electron acceptor so when photosynthesis is occurring and electrons are being transferred to the DCPIP the solution becomes colorless [Johnson: 2016].  For this experiment spinach leaves will be used because they are easily accessible, the leaves are big, easily manipulated, and they are cheap. The experiment will involve taking the rate of photosynthesis in spinach leaves chloroplast that have been put in the presence of sodium chloride (I) compared to the rate of photosynthesis (D) in spinach leaves in light. The presence of sodium and chlorine ions can disrupt the electron transport chain causing the photosynthetic rate to decrease [Sudhir: 2005]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the spinach leaves treated with NaCl will have significently lower rate of photosynthesis compared to those put in light.

Materials and Method:
Five spinach leaves were obtained and their chloroplast were extracted by crushing the leaves in a mortar using a grinding buffer. Then 200 microliters were transferred into a tube and put in centrifuge for 10 minutes at 200 G’s at 4 degrees Celsius. Another 200 microliters were taken from that sample and put in centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000 G’s. The pellet was taken out and the previous repeated. Then the 13 test tubes were prepared. The blank contained only reaction buffer 100mM phosphate, and water. 3 negative controlll containing chloroplast, water, 130mM DCPIP, and reaction buffer all put in a dark environment. Another 3 negative controllls containing chloroplast, water, DCPIP, reaction buffer, and 20 microliters of 100mM tritian (emulsifies the cell membrane preventing photosynthesis) [Koley: 2010] detergent in a light environment.  3 positive controllls consisting of chloroplast, water, DCPIP, and reaction buffer. 3 samples containing chloroplast, water, DCPIP, reaction buffer, and 1.4M of NaCl solution in a light environment. After the preparation of the test tubes the initial absorbance’s were taken at 600 nm in a spectrophotometer.  Then the samples were placed back in their rightful environments for 10 minutes; then the absorbance’s were recorded again. This process was repeated two more times after 20 and 30 minutes. Then the percent change was calculated at each 10, 20, and 30 minutes compared to the initial absorbance with the percent of change being inversely related to a decrease in absorbance. Lastly 3 two sampled one-tailed unpaired T-test were ran comparing the average percent of change of the positive controlll and the light and salt treatment at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.

Results:
The mean of the light group percent after 10 minutes is 12.797 ± 3.705. The mean of the light and salt percent of change group is 2.237 ± 0.814. The difference is significently significent based on the first one-tailed unpaired T-test data (P = 0.0085) (α = .05) (d.f. = 4) (t = 4.822). The mean of the light group after 20 minutes is 18.503 ± 5.412. The mean of the light and salt group was 2.58 ± 0.845. The difference is significently significent based the second one-tailed unpaired T-test data (P = 0.0073) (α = .05) (d.f. = 4) (t = 5.035 ). The mean of the light group after 30 minutes is 23.83 ± 7.495. The mean of the light and salt group was 2.38 ± 1.008. The difference is significently significent based the third one-tailed unpaired T-test data (P = 0.0086) (α = .05) (d.f. = 4) (t = 4.81). Assay two of the light + detergent assay’s was an outlier at 10, 20, and 30 minuets which is shown to be true with 95% confidence by the Q-test which resulted in (Qexp = 1) (Qcri = 0.970) for all three time periods.

Discussion:
According to the data the difference between the percent of change of absorbance’s in the photosynthetic rate of spinach chloroplast in light compared to spinach chloroplast in light and a salt solution of NaCl is statistically significent. Therefore, the hypothesis that NaCl will hinder photosynthesis is accepted. The correlation of the reduced photosynthesis rate in a plant when exposed to NaCl is possibly due to the NaCl changing the conformation of the thylakoid membrane proteins which changes what gets in and what gets out effecting what is being reduced and oxidized ultimately disrupting the electron transport [Misra: 1998]. There are some possible errors that could have occurred in the experiment such as improper pipetting resulting in incorrect assays. Also there is not guaranteed way to see if which cubicle of assay got the most light or how efficiently the light was actually getting to the cubicles. A few proposed future experiments could be adding more replicate assays, using a more controlllled lighting and darkness environment, or testing of a different type of salt, such as KCl. NaCl has been found to reduce the yield of crops [Mirsa: 1998]. A problem with this is when roads are salted it could be negatively effecting crop yield resulting in a loss for the farming industry [Green: 2008]. Therefore, this process should be furthered studied to see how to possibly combat this effect.

Figure Legends: 
This figure represents percent of change in absorbance for the four treatments at the 10, 20, and 30 minute mark. This bar graph gives a visual display of the data and the relationship between the controlll and the treatments. This figure also includes the standard error bars. The standard error bars for the light + detergent treatment is skewed because of the second assay being a significent outlier which is shown by the Q-test in the results.
