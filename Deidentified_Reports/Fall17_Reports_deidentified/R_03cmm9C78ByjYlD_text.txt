Title: The Effect of Tetraethyl Ammonium Chloride on the Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Rana Pipiens

Abstract:
The muscle contraction of the gastrocnemius in the Rana pipiens was studied after treatment of tetraethyl ammonium chloride.  It was hypothesized that the inhibition of potassium channels of the muscle fiber would cause greater contractions in the muscle due to a greater depolarization.  The muscle was stimulated normally first then stimulated again after it had been injected with 0.2 mL of the potassium channel blocker.  The hypothesis was not supported by the data in this lab which used a paired two sample t-test.  The p-value came out to be 0.790395, a very high number for a p-value.  It was concluded that even though there was no significant evidence to support the hypothesis, there was still some interesting data that could lead to potential other experiments that will answer what role the potassium ion channels have in the contraction of muscle fibers.

Introduction:
The focus of this lab is to determine the effects of tetraethyl ammonium chloride, a potassium (K+) channel blocker, on a muscles ability to contract.  In order to study this, the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle of the Rana pipiens, or commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, will be treated.  The R. pipiens’s leg has a very simple anatomy where the upper part of the leg, where the thigh muscles are, is where the sciatic nerve lies and below the knee of the leg and behind the tibia is the gastrocnemius [Johnson: 2017]. Muscle contractions occur because of depolarization in muscle fibers causing action potentials.  A motor neuron’s axon terminal creates a synapse with a muscle fiber and this synapse is called the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).  At the NMJ, calcium ions (Ca2+) enter the axon terminal binding to the acetylcholine (ACh) vesicle allowing it to dock to the axon terminal membrane and release ACh.  Once ACh is released, it binds to the ACh receptors in the membrane of the muscle fiber which can then open up to let sodium ions (Na+) into the cell.  This causes depolarization in the muscle fiber and creates the action potential needed to contract the muscle [Wu: 2010]. The muscle fibers also contain K+ channels that is constantly letting K+ ions leave the cell [Davies: 1991]. Since tetraethyl ammonium chloride is a K+ channel blocker, K+ ions would not be able to leave the cell as the Na+ ions enter.  So, the hypothesis is that we could have greater depolarization and stronger action potentials leading to a stronger muscle contraction.

Materials and Methods:
There will be three R. pipiens legs used for three different trials.  These legs will be skinned to expose the muscles of the leg and the gastrocnemius will be detached at the tendon near the ankle bone.  Then the gastrocnemius will be strung up by the tendon previously attached to the ankle with string and the suspender provided so that the leg is lying flat on the dissection plate and the gastrocnemius is suspended with some tension in it.  The muscle will be directly stimulated with the probes supplied with the iWorx EP program.  The probes will be inserted into the gastrocnemius so that the black probe is entering the base of the muscle and the red probe is entering the top (Refer to Figure 1 below).  For the controls, each muscle will be stimulated without treatment first to determine the voltage needed to reach the threshold that creates action potential.  The voltages used will be 0V, 0.1V, 0.2V, 0.3V, 0.4V, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, 3V, 4V, and 5V.  Then the same leg will be used for treatment as well.  The gastrocnemius muscle will be injected with 0.2 mL of 100 mM tetraethyl ammonium chloride and the stimulated again with the same voltages.  The thresholds will be determined for each and if possible the max output.  This process will be done again on the other two R. pipiens legs.  Once the data is collected, a paired two-sample t-test will be used to determine results and support for hypothesis.

Results:
The graph (Figure 2) shows that with the addition of tetraethyl ammonium chloride the amplitude of the muscle contraction would generally go down.  The only exception to this was trial 3 where the threshold voltage causes the change in amplitude for the control to be 0.135 and for the treatment to be 0.898.  In Figure 3, it looks as if after the contraction the injection was stronger but that is more than likely due to the strong outlier in the third trial.  It also seems that the actual voltage needed to reach threshold for each muscle decreased after the injection into the gastrocnemius muscle (Table 1). Again, it seems that treatment 3 is the exception to this trend with it requiring more voltage to reach threshold.  The paired two sample t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the muscle contractions of the control and treatment R. pipiens gastrocnemius muscle.  The degrees of freedom were 2, the t-value was 0.30361, and the p-value was 0.790395.

Discussion:
The data collected does not support the hypothesis of the lab since there was not significant evidence provided by the paired two sample t-test.  Therefore, it cannot be said that by inhibiting the K+ channels in muscle fibers from opening causes stronger muscle contractions due to greater depolarization.  As a matter of fact, it seems that blocking the potassium channels in the cells instead had an effect on the threshold of the depolarization needed to create the action potential in the muscle.  A similar experiment was run with potassium ion channels and how they cause hyperpolarization in cells [Siegel: 1992].  Hyperpolarization is when the difference of the negative charge of the inside of a cell and the positive charge outside the cell becomes greater.  In the experiment from 1992, Siegel mentions that the hyperpolarization caused vasodilation in smooth muscle when the Ca2+ channels are also closed.  Maybe instead of thinking of potassium ions in the cell contributing to the strength of action potential, like hypothesized, it would be more helpful to think of them contributing to the rate of action potential created.  This would be interesting to looking into further in future experiments with tetraethyl ammonium chloride and the effects it has on muscle contractions.  It could also be possible that errors were a factor in not getting data to support the hypothesis.  Before the experiment decided to stimulate the muscle directly, the original thought was to stimulate the sciatic nerve.  However, due to technical reasons the nerve would not stimulate so the experiment had to change to direct muscle stimulation.  Also, when stimulating the muscle there were some problems with the actual graph showing the muscle amplitude.  Instead of showing a (what would be considered) normal myogram, once the muscle was stimulated the contraction phase of the myogram never came back to the relaxed state.  Overall, based off the results of this lab, more testing will be needed to determine how the potassium channels have an effect on muscle contraction.
