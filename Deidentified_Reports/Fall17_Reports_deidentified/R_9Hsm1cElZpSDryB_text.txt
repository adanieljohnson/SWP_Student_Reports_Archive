Title: Effects of Calcium Inhibitor on the Muscle Contraction of Lithobatis Pipiens

Abstract:
The intent of this experiment was to examine the effect of A23187, a calcium ion-channel inhibitor, on the threshold to contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog. Application of electric current to initiate a sufficient action potential and induce threshold of contraction was supplied both directly to the muscle itself and through the sciatic nerve by the use of electrodes. Calcium ions not only induce the release the neurotransmitter ACh (acetylcholine) into the synapses of neurons, but also bonds to troponin to initiate fiber contraction through the bonding of actin and myosin. It was therefore hypothesized an application of A23187 to a muscle would decrease the current required for a muscle to reach threshold and contract, as it would increase the amount of neurotransmitter released by the muscle T-tubules and decrease the amount of troponin needed to separate from Actin. This was investigated through the attachment of electrodes to the sciatic nerve and directly to the gastrocnemus muscle, and subsequently an application of current from a myogram to register the threshold current required for a muscle to reach contraction before and after an application of A23187. The results of this experiment show that the experimental groups had an unchanged or increased threshold

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to test the effects a calcium inhibitor, A23187, has on the gastrocnemus muscle of Lithobatis Pipiens. Specifically, the correlation between the threshold of the muscle when injected with the calcium inhibitor.
 Skeletal muscles are made up of many myofibrils, and within these myofibrils, sarcomeres. When an action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction, the T tubules of the muscle fiber relay the signal to the extensive network of the muscle’s sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Sarcoplasmic reticulum is voltage gated, and when the action potential arrives it releases stored Ca2+ into the muscles fluid-like Sarcoplasm. These calcium ions then bind to the Troponin of the Actin proteins found in every Sarcomere (Squire, 2010).This enables the Myosin proteins to break down an ATP molecule into ADP and a phosphate group, and then bond with the Actin site now abandoned by the Troponin and Tropomyosin as they now are deformed by their new bond to calcium. A23187 is a calcium ion inhibitor. This means it increases the amount of calcium ions at the intercellular level. Threshold is the minimum amount of electric current needed to cause an action potential in a muscle, and as Calcium ions cause troponin and Tropomyosin to un-bond from Actin proteins, it should theoretically lower the threshold required to cause contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle. 
Through the application of an electrical current using electrodes, a stimulus can be produced in the frog leg either directly into the muscle or via the sciatic nerve. The electric current will travel through the T-tubules of the muscle to the vast network of sarcoplasmic reticulum, where voltage-gated calcium channels open and release into the muscle’s myofibrils. The depolarization of the T-tubule is called an action potential, and this is unique as the action potential can travel from the nervous system to the muscle itself to cause contraction. 
By using a controlll test and then injecting these same frog legs with A23187, these electrodes can be used to test the threshold of the frog legs both through direct and nervous stimulus of the gastrocnemus muscle. A calcium inhibitory should decrease the threshold of the muscle, as an increase in the concentration of intercellular calcium ions should decrease the amount of current required to elicit a contraction of the muscle. If there are more Calcium ions in the sarcoplasm, it should take less electricity to release the amount of calcium required for a muscle contraction. This test will measure the amps required to cause threshold and the force of contraction for a controlll group and a group injected with A23187 via both direct muscle stimulus and stimulus via the sciatic nerve. If each leg is tested for threshold, and then is injected with 100 mM A23187, the threshold of each leg should be lower for the second test as the current required to activate the sarcoplasmic reticulum should not be as high as the controlll. The A23187 tests should require less Calcium ions as there are less binding sites to the same amount of Troponin in each Gastrocnemius muscle due to the increase of ions present caused by its inhibitory properties.


Materials and Method:
: Three frog legs will be tested. First the skin of each leg will be removed as shown in the lab video by sliding the leg of carefully as to not damage the muscle. A pair of scissors was then used to disconnect the muscle from the bone. Finally, the Achilles tendon was severed without damaging the sciatic nerve. The gastrocnemus muscle was kept moist during the experimental period via the use of Ringer’s solution. The muscle of each leg was peeled above the knee area to expose the sciatic nerve for testing purposes. The leg was then pinned to the testing tray, and the muscle was tied at a 90-degree angle with a moderate degree of tension by the leftover Achilles tendon. Two sets of electrodes were then attached to the leg. One was directly inserted into the muscle via two electrodes, the other to the sciatic nerve. An electrical current was applied to an electrode starting at 0.1 amps until the muscle reached threshold and contracted. After the threshold current was recorded as a controlll value, the same procedure was followed for the other electrode. This was performed on all three frog legs. Next 1 Ml of 100 mM A23187 calcium inhibitor was injected into each leg using a needle. The electrodes were applied, and current was sent through each electrode starting at 0.1 amps until threshold was reached and the muscle contracted or twitched. Statistical data was then collected by entering the averages of each test done on each frog leg into a Paired T-test template.

Results:
Figure 1. Shows threshold level of the gastrocnemus muscle before and after the injection of 1 Ml of 100 mM A23187 calcium inhibitor. For this round of experiment the electrodes were applied directly to the muscle.
Figure 2. Shows threshold level of the gastrocnemus muscle before and after the injection of 1 Ml of 100 mM A23187 calcium inhibitor. For this round of experiment the electrodes were applied directly to the muscle.
Paired T-Tests:
The average threshold was calculated both for the controlllled and experimental trials. This was done by using the statistics observed in each of the three frogs. The average threshold of contraction when the electrode was attached to the nerve for the controlll trials was 0.167 amps. This was equivalent to the experimental trial, as the statistics for amps to threshold of contraction were identical in both the controlll and experimental groups. The T-test for the two groups was identical. The average threshold of contraction or twitch of the gastrocnemus muscle when the electrodes were applied directly to the muscle, bypassing the nerve, was 0.267 amps for the controlll group, and 0.40 amps for the experimental group. After a paired T-test was calculated for the data, the p value was found to be 0.2697. This means the difference in the groups statistically does not give us reason to believe that the calcium inhibitor caused the shift in data value.


Discussion:
The paired T-test showed the data that was significently different. The data contradicted our hypothesis that the calcium inhibitor A23187 would lower the threshold of contraction, and though the sample size of the data could have influenced the p value for our T-tests it does show our data is uniform. The three tests performed would not have carried the same weight had we performed 100 tests; therefore, it is possible our lack of extensive testing could have had a marginal impact on the outcome of our data. If this tests were to be performed again, it would benefit the experiment to perform many more repetitions; however, we have limited resources in our lab and were given three frogs legs which are damaged by each use of the electrode physically and chemically. Despite this, the data collected does directly contradict our hypothesis.
The experiment can be broken down into two aspects further than the experimental and controlll: nervous stimulus and muscle stimulus. The experimental and controlll group which were applied nervous stimuli opposed our hypothesis in a uniform way. The threshold of each frog before and after given A23187 had an identical threshold. Each leg had its own value for its individual threshold to contraction, and this value did not waiver in the application of the calcium inhibitor. The muscle group was less uniform in its results; however, the results found did still contradict our hypothesis. The threshold of Frog 1 was like the nervous group in that it was identical before and after the application of the calcium inhibitor at 0.4 amps. Frogs 2 and 3 both had a high threshold after the application of the inhibitor. Frog 2 rose from a threshold of 0.2 amps to 0.3 amps, and frog three represented somewhat of an outlier. Its threshold rose from 0.2 amps to 0.5 amps. Regardless of the lack of uniformity in the amp shift of the muscle group, the thresholds either were the same or higher for the test trials involving A23187 for all the frog legs. When creating our hypothesis, we believed an increase in calcium ions would reduce the amount of sarcoplasmic calcium ions required to initiate threshold. This meant the sarcoplasmic reticulum would need to release less calcium into the sarcoplasm to induce a contraction and reach threshold.
The data contradicts this notion, as do some prior studies of A23187. The data states that the inhibitor either has no effect on the threshold of a muscle, or raises the threshold of a muscle. It was found that in the skeletal muscle of barnacles, though an increase of Ca2+ was recorded “and A23187 specifically involved the Ca2+ intracellular release, but [did not have an effect] on the Ca2+-troponin reaction.” [Desmedt, 1975] Furthermore, the book Structural Elements of the Nervous System states that calcium ion influx due to A23187 damages proteins within muscle fibers. [Lajtha, 1984] While intuitively it would seem an increase of calcium ions would lower the threshold, the calcium pulled in by A23187 has been found to have no effect on the calcium-troponin interaction, and A23187 damages the proteins necessary for contraction.
Our hypothesis was rejected. A23187 does increase the amount of ionic calcium within the cell; however, this increase of calcium does not contribute to the troponin-calcium interaction necessary to initiate the myosin power strokes necessary for a muscle twitch. A23187 also damages proteins within myofibrils such as actin and myosin, and this has a negative effect on contraction as well. Our data supports this, as all of our frog legs either had an identical threshold before and after the application of A23187, or a lower threshold after the application
