Title: Caffeine increasing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and consequently the twitch amplitude and muscle contraction of a leg muscle fiber from the species Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The experiment and statistical analysis of this study attempt to examine the effect of caffeine on neuromuscular controlll. We hypothesized that there will be significent difference between the electrically stimulated twitch amplitude of a Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle that receives caffeine and that of a Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle that receives no caffeine. This was done by testing the twitch amplitude of the muscle fiber from the gastrocnemus muscle of the species, Rania pipiens. We used a force transducer to measure the force generated by the muscle before and after the injection of 0.1Ml of 200mM of caffeine. Caffeine is experimentally observed to increase action potentials in the neuromuscular system, and our results supported this finding as the twitch amplitude was consistently increased with the addition of caffeine to a Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle. This increase in twitch amplitude as an effect of caffeine injection is supported by the high statistical significance demonstrated by the P-values being much lower than 0.5 in all 3 cases of the legs – 4.74E-8, 1.77E-5, and 4.66E-12 respectively. Increased rate of action potentials results in a stronger twitch amplitude and muscle contraction, standing as an explanation for why drinking caffeinated beverages in

Introduction:
The world’s most widely consumed drug, caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that affects the neuromuscular system. The specimen Rania pipiens has skeletal muscles useful for examining the effects of caffeine on neuromuscular controlll and is the focus of this experiment. It has an exceptionally large ratio of leg length to body mass, which demonstrates the immense capabilities of our neuromuscular systems that allow versatile movement. Of the many muscles that constitute our bodies, a single skeletal muscle is made of bundles of muscles fibers each containing numerous myofibrils, which are bound together by connective tissue. In each myofibril there are assemblages of thick myosin and thin actin filaments which slide past each other to contract a muscle fiber upon its innervation via a motor neuron [Sadava: 2016]. Filaments are able to slide past one another upon the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of a muscle cell, and caffeine has been studied to increase this release of Ca2+, which should then result in the increase the sliding of filaments and overall muscle contraction. There is a “minimum unit of contraction” [Sadava: 2016], or a twitch, which can be measured in terms of force using a force transducer, and the amount of Ca2+ release is directly proportional to this contraction. Caffeine additionally has an antagnostic effect on adenosine receptors. Adenosine diminishes firing rates of action potentials and is an “endogenous metabolite similar in structure” to caffeine [Kalmar: 1999]. This suggests that caffeine diminishes inhibitory action and increases excitability of motor neurons. We observed the twitch amplitude of the muscle fiber, or the maximum amount of force generated in the nerve by way of fired action potentials, in order to examine the same previously mentioned effects. The caffeine and environmental conditions will serve as the independent variables, and the effects of caffeine on neuromuscular controlll will serve as the dependent variable. We hypothesize that there will be significent difference between the electrically stimulated twitch amplitude of a Rania pipiens leg muscle that receives caffeine and that of a Rania pipiens leg muscle that receives no caffeine at all.


Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens legs were obtained that had previously been kept in a controlllled, lab environment. The legs were each skinned with a pair of forceps by us grabbing the top of the skin and pulling downwards towards the foot and off like a sock. They were then kept moist about every 5 minutes with frog Ringer’s solution. The inner thigh muscles were gently separated using a dissecting probe, starting at the upper end and extending to the knee. The newly exposed white sciatic nerve (not to be confused with white connective tissue) was gently freed from the connective tissue, using a dissecting needle and forceps. To prepare the muscle for stimulation via a force transducer, the end of the gastrocnemus muscle was tied with a string and then tied to the metal hooks of the machine at a 90-degree angle to the table while overall the leg formed a perpendicular angle. The rest of the leg lying on the table was pinned down around the bones using 4 metal pins. Finally, 2 stimulator needles were forked into the muscle and attached back to the force transducer. Once Lab Scribe was successfully detected by my computer, first, the twitch threshold was determined. To do so, the number of pulses was set to 1, the frequency to 1, and the pulse width to 5 ms. Then, the pulse amplitude was set to 0.1 V and hit apply. The pulse amplitude was increased by 0.1V until the first twitch picked up on the machine with a value. This lowest value that gave a strong contraction is the twitch threshold. Then, in order to determine the twitch amplitude, the pulse amplitude was set to this twitch threshold, the stimulus frequency to 1 Hz, the number of pulses to 5, and the pulse width at again to 5 ms. This served as controlll leg 1. Then, the experiment was repeated but with an injection of 0.1Ml of 200mM of caffeine into the muscle before repeating the stimulations. This trial served as experimental leg 1. These 2 trials were then repeated for legs 2 and 3. A paired T-test was used to compare the two groups, the controlll group (or the 3 muscles before caffeine injection) and the experimental group (the 3 muscles after caffeine injection).


Results:
Leg 1 of the Rania pipiens exhibited an average twitch amplitude of 0.0196 V before caffeine injection and an average of 0.8686 V after injection. The standard deviation of the twitch amplitudes before injection is 0.00182 and, after injection, is 0.0186. This gave way to a P-value of 4.74E-8. Leg 2 of Rania pipiens exhibited an average twitch amplitude of 0.0478 V before caffeine injection and an average of 0.8852 V after injection. The standard deviation of the twitch amplitudes before injection is 0.00455 and, after injection, is 0.0759. This gave way to a P-value of 1.77E-5. Leg 3 of Rania pipiens exhibited an average twitch amplitude of 0.0686 V before caffeine injection and an average of 1.311 V after injection. The standard deviation of the twitch amplitudes before injection is 0.00260 and, after injection, is 0.0. This gave way to a P-value of 4.66E-12. A trend of increasing twitch amplitude after caffeine injection is observed for all 3 legs. This is a trend seen in Figure 1. and also in Figure 2. and Figure 3. as well. There is a significent statistical difference between the controlll and experimental groups. This is testified by each of the 3 legs having a T-test P-value much lower than the P-value of 0.5.


Discussion:
The results support our hypothesis that there will be significent difference between the electrically stimulated twitch amplitude of a Rania pipiens leg muscle that receives caffeine and that of a Rania pipiens leg muscle that receives no caffeine at all. The data demonstrates that caffeine increases the twitch amplitude of the muscle fiber contraction of a Rania pipiens leg muscle. This increase in twitch amplitude as an effect of caffeine injection is supported by the high statistical significance demonstrated by the P-values being much lower than 0.5 in all 3 cases of the legs – 4.74E-8, 1.77E-5, and 4.66E-12 respectively. The mechanism for how caffeine affects neurotransmitter release in the neuromuscular system supports these results. Caffeine has been successfully studied as “an agent which increases Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum” [Allen: 2006] which in turn triggers constant muscle contraction until Ca2+ is no longer available to the muscle fiber filaments. Once Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it travels into the sarcoplasm of the muscle cell, binds to troponin on actin filaments, and exposes myosin-binding sites also located on actin filaments. Myosin heads can then bind to actin and, with the release of an inorganic phosphate, can pull the actin filament towards the center of the sarcomere and shorten, or contract, the muscle. The myosin head then gets released with its binding to ATP, and returns to its cocked position with the hydrolysis of the ATP molecule. The head can then bind to another myosin-binding site and again contract the sarcomere and the muscle. As long as calcium remains available to these filaments, “the cycle repeats and the muscle contraction continues” [Sadava: 2016]. This explains why drinking caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and soft drinks might make one feel jittery or more active, and also more awake during the work day. A more accurate way of measuring muscle contraction would have been to stimulate the sciatic nerve rather than the muscle, as this would more accurately demonstrate muscle contraction in a vertebrate neuromuscular system. The experiment could have additionally been improved if we had found a more constant way to inject caffeine into the muscle. If the experiment were to be repeated, I would further attempt to understand how exactly caffeine increases Ca2+ release and if this has any longer term effects on muscle contraction.
