Title: Longer PSII antenna in Spinacia oleraca Causes More Efficient Electron Transport than Ocimum Basilicum Chloroplasts

Abstract:
Photosynthetic mechanisms vary in sun and shade plant chloroplasts. Specifically, shade chloroplasts have a longer PSII antenna and therefore have a higher affinity for electron transport and photosynthesis. S. oleraca (shade plant) chloroplasts are hypothesized to have a higher rate of photosynthesis than O. basilicum (sun plant) chloroplasts. Photosynthetic activity was measured between S. oleraca and O. basilicum using the % change in absorbance as 130mM DCPIP as reduced by electron transport. The photosynthetic activity of S. oleraca was found to be significently higher than O. basilicum, supporting the hypothesis that increased length of PSII antenna in shade plants creates a greater affinity for electron transport and photosynthesis. Further study of how PSII antenna length is affected by light exposure and how it affects photosynthesis is suggested. Implications of these results relate to the further understanding of the electron transport mechanism and how that mechanism is both affected by the environment and regulated by the plant itself.

Introduction:
Photosynthetic mechanisms vary in plants in order to optimize the light energy captured in the environment in which they live. Specifically, plants that grow in full sun versus plants that grow in shade differ in their photosynthetic mechanisms. Plants that grow in full sun need to regulate the amount of light energy they convert since it is readily available, while shade plants need to have a high affinity for capturing light energy because it is less readily available.
To further determine the specific difference between sun and shade plant chloroplast photosynthetic mechanisms, the electron transport chain (ETC) mechanism between Spinacia oleraca and Ocimum basilicum chloroplasts is studied in this experiment. S. oleraca is used as the shade plant model organism due to its high density of chloroplasts, and O. basilicum is used as the sun plant model organism due to its availability and similarity in leaf size to S. oleraca. 
The electron transport chain is the photosynthetic mechanism within the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast that works to synthesize ATP and NADPH from light energy. Electrons within Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI) are excited by light energy and move across the membrane to produce ATP and NADPH. As DCPIP is introduced to the chloroplasts, these high-energy electrons reduce DCPIP to the colorless form of DCPIPH2. Therefore, the reduction of DCPIP and change in absorbance is used as an indication of the electron transport in this study.
In regards to the ETC of sun and shade plants, Sun plants have a smaller PSII antenna size than do shade plants (Ruban, 2009). As the antenna size of PSII increases, the deficiency of chlorophyll increases and the capacity for electron transport decreases (Terao & Katoh, 1996). Therefore, it is expected that the photosynthetic activity of O. basilicum chloroplasts will be higher than that of S. oleraca chloroplasts.

Materials and Method:
S. oleraca leaves were obtained from a grocery store and refrigerated prior to use. The central vein of four S. oleraca leaves were isolated and disposed of, and the remaining leaf was ground using a mortar and pestle and added to 20Ml of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8.0). The S. oleraca solution was then strained through cheesecloth, and centrifuged at a speed of 200 x G. The supernatant was then centrifuged at a speed of 1000 x G. The pellet of the second centrifugation was isolated and 20Ml grinding buffer was added to suspend the S. oleraca chloroplasts. An O. basilicum plant was bought from the grocery store, and the chloroplasts were isolated from four O. basilicum leaves using the same method as the S. oleraca chloroplast isolation. The number of S. oleraca chloroplasts and O. basilicum chloroplasts were compared under a phase microscope using a hemocytometer. S. oleraca chloroplasts are seen in Figure 1, O. basilicum chloroplasts in Figure 2. It was estimated that there were four O. basilicum chloroplasts for every S. oleraca chloroplast in the same area. 
	Photosynthetic activity of O. basilicum and S. oleraca chloroplasts were measured using the percent change in absorbance of 130 mM DCPIP in a reaction buffer of 100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5. Percent change in absorbance was calculated as [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’)/ Absorbance at time zero] x 100%. The time 0 measurement of absorbance at 600nm was measured at the time of addition of chloroplasts, and the subsequent absorbance measurements were taken at 10, 20, 40 minutes. 400μl O. basilicum chloroplasts and 100μl S. oleraca chloroplasts were tested to controlll for the ratio of chloroplasts. The level of light, temperature, and concentration of reactants was kept constant for both the O. basilicum and S. oleraca chloroplasts. The percent change in absorbance of DCPIP was then compared at 40 minutes between the O. basilicum and S. oleraca chloroplasts using a two-sample t_test assuming equal variances and an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
The photosynthetic activity, measured by the % change in absorbance of DCPIP over 40 minutes, of S. oleraca chloroplasts was significently higher that the photosynthetic activity of O. basilicum chloroplasts (t(4) = 2.77, p = 0.0008). The increased photosynthetic activity of S. oleraca chloroplasts versus O. basilicum chloroplasts can be seen in Figure 3.

Discussion:
Because the % change in absorbance was greater in S. oleraca chloroplasts, the photosynthetic activity of S. oleraca was higher than that of O. basilicum. Therefore, the original hypothesis that the larger PSII and PSI antennae size in shade plants causes increased photosynthetic activity in shade plants is supported.
However, scientific literature conflicts as to whether PSII antenna size causes a difference in sun and shade plant photosynthesis. Boardman suggests that, rather than sun plants chloroplasts having a shorter PSII antenna, they have more photosynthetic capacity in terms of a higher level of electron transport enzymes (1977). Ruban disagrees with this theory and suggests, as mentioned previously, that increased size of PSII antenna in shade plants causes a higher affinity for electron excitation and therefore a higher capacity for electron transport (2009). Although this experiment tested the level of photosynthesis between sun and shade plants, and shade plants have longer PSII antennae than sun plants, further study is needed to determine specific relationship between PSII antenna size and electron transport.
	Possible errors within this experiment include the ratio of number of O. basilicum and S. oleraca chloroplasts. Because the ratio of O. basilicum to S. oleraca chloroplasts was merely estimated, there could have been a greater number of S. oleraca chloroplasts, and the photosynthetic activity of S. oleraca would be measured as greater than O. basilicum. Another possible error is the extraction technique of both S. oleraca chloroplasts and O. basilicum chloroplasts was the same, when in fact it might be more difficult to isolate O. basilicum due to a thicker cell wall or less penetrable chloroplast membrane. It is also possible that the results from O. basilicum and S. oleraca chloroplasts are not generalizable to all sun and shade plant chloroplasts. Further study with a controlll for ratio of chloroplasts, and with different chloroplasts from several types of both sun and shade plants is suggested to further determine differences between sun and shade plant photosynthesis.
	The difference in photosynthetic mechanisms between sun and shade plants relates to the significance of PSII antenna size in the regulation of electron transport in photosynthesis. Different environmental conditions, such as level of light exposure over time in sun and shade plants, can cause biochemical shifts in electron transport, and therefore affect the rate of photosynthesis. The importance of further study between plants in different environmental conditions, such as sun and shade plants, is that of the furthered understanding of how electron transport is affected by external factors and how chloroplasts self-regulate photosynthesis.
