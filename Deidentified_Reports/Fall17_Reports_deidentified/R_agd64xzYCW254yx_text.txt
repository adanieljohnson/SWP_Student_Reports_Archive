Title: Increased frequency of aggressive behaviors shown by male “Betta splendins” in the presence of a female “Betta splenden”

Abstract:
The following experiment serves to study the frequency of aggressive behaviors of two male Betta fish (Betta splendins) when exposed to each other, and a foreign female Betta fish. It is known that aggression can be provoked when an animal encounters a member of its own species and sex, or that of the opposite sex [Marler: 1976]. In the present experiment, it was predicted that two male Betta fish will display a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors when presented with one female Betta fish, compared to when they are alone. Three observations were conducted: observing the behavior of two male Betta splendins alone, when one female Betta was visible with a partition; and when one female Betta was present with no partition. The hypothesis for the experiment was supported, however, due to the lack of replicates, a statistical test was not conducted. 

Introduction:
Animal behavior is observed to understand the purpose of various physiological, and learned actions that animals demonstrate. Scientists attempt to understand how animals see the world and the evolutionary basis for their behavior. The demonstration of certain behaviors is contingent upon the organisms’ genetic makeup and environmental stimuli [Johnson: 2017]. The following experiment serves to study the frequency of aggressive behaviors of two male Betta fish (Betta splendins) when exposed to each other, compared to when they are exposed to a female Betta fish. “Betta splendins” are native to Thailand, and can be found in various habitats including ponds and other muddy waters [Simpson: 1968]. Betta fish exhibit intraspecific agnostic behaviors that regulate social interaction associated with aggression, sexual activities and species recognition. Intraspecific behavior is the interaction between organisms of the same species, competing for limited resources. Betta splendins display broadside movements and facing movements, which are considered aggressive intraspecific behaviors [Johnson: 2017]. Broadside movements occur when the fish turns its side toward the opponent, allowing dorsal, caudal and anal fins to be extended. Frontal display can be observed when the gill covers spread and branchiostegal membranes protrude, creating a red ‘mane’ [Simpson: 1968]. Aggressive behavior occurs when agnostic actions are observed along with other threat behaviors including raising of the dorsal fin, lowering the head, and arching the back; along with darting, biting and nipping at the opponent [Johnson: 2017].  It is known that aggression can be provoked when an animal encounters a member of its own species and sex, or that of the opposite sex [Marler: 1976]. In a similar experiment conducted by Ricardo J. Matos, the results showed that a present female Betta fish initiated increased aggressive behavior in male Betta fish. Although there was an increased amount of “conspicuous displays (e.g. tail beats and time with gill cover erect)”, the Matos experiment showed a “decrease of more aggressive displays (e.g. attempted bites)” [Matos: 2002]. In the present experiment, we hypothesized that two male Betta fish will display a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors when presented with one female Betta fish, compared to when they are alone. The purpose of observing the frequency of aggressive behaviors was that the quantitative results provided evidence that male Betta fish exerted more aggressive behaviors overall when a female was present.

Materials and Method:
The experiment required: a small aquarium with transparent and nontransparent divisions, two male Betta fish, and one female Betta fish. The experiment consisted of three separate observations: Observation 1 – Two male Betta fish were placed together (with no partition) and observed for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of rest. Observation 2 – Two male Betta fish were placed together, with a transparent partition separating them from one female Betta fish. Behavior was observed for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of rest. Observation 3 –  Two male Betta fish and one female Betta fish were placed together in the same tank (with no partition), and observed for 5 minutes. During each ‘observation’, the number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by each male were counted in 1 minute intervals. All types of aggressive behaviors that each male displayed were counted, despite the levels of behavioral severity. One person was responsible for counting the behaviors of one fish for all three observations. The controlllled environment served necessary to test the dependent variable, being the two male Betta fish observed alone, and the independent variable, being the female Betta fish added to the same tank. The frequency of aggressive behaviors was averaged in all three observations, and the standard deviation was taken as well. 

Results:
The aggressive behaviors in observation 1, with no female present, showed the lowest frequency (11.5±2.12). Observation 2, having a transparent partition with female Betta fish visible to both males, showed an increased frequency of aggressive behavior (23.5±4.95). Observation 3, where both males and the female Betta fish are placed together in the same tank, showed the greatest number of aggressive behaviors in the male Betta fish (29.5±4.95).

Discussion:
In the present experiment, it was predicted that two male Betta fish will display a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors when presented with one female Betta fish, compared to when they are alone.  Animals typically show aggressive behavior toward any external threats or challenges. This experiment served to understand the aggressive interactions displayed by two male Beta fish and how those interactions could change when a female Betta fish was introduced. It is known that aggression can be provoked when an animal encounters a member of its own species and sex, or that of the opposite sex [Marler: 1976]. The increase in the frequency of aggressive behaviors of the male Betta splendins when a female was present, could have occurred due to the addition of the foreign female. The two male Betta fish had already been introduced prior to the two female trials.  In a similar study conducted in Denmark, at Copenhagen University, served to investigate directly whether the sex of an ‘audience’ influences male-male Betta splendins contests [Matos: 2002]. The results of the Denmark experiment showed that the frequency of aggressive male behaviors increased when a female was present. It was noted that the results seem to support the idea that when a female is present, males are confronted with a trade-off between expelling their male opponent and not driving away the female [Matos: 2002]. In relation to the present experiment, the ideas and results of the Denmark study support our findings that the frequency of male-male aggressive behaviors increase when a female is present. The overall design of this experiment could be altered by increasing the amount of trials to obtain more quantitative results, and categorize the aggressive behaviors for better accuracy. Aside from small procedure changes in the current experiment; a better venture includes investigating spatial effects and how increasing tank size could decrease the aggressive behaviors of two male Betta fish. If two male Betta fish are sharing a six-gallon tank, they are more likely to bump into each other than if they shared a fifty-gallon tank. Indeed, the present study generates more questions than answers; however, Betta splendins continue to serve as viable animals when observing behavior. While aggressive behavior of Betta fish has been improved by numerous years of selective breeding, the overall tendency of aggressive behavior and exaggerated fin length are both natural. The general pattern of movement and postures used to communicate intentions remains that of a typical male fish [Marler: 1976]. From an evolutionary perspective, mate preference and sexual selection play a pivotal role when addressing agnostic behaviors between male Betta splendins in the presence of a female Betta splenden. In a study conducted by Doutrelant & McGregor, they investigated mate choice in female Betta splendins and revealed that females who are present for male-male interaction favored the more aggressive male [Doutrelant: 2000]. This finding has a direct correlation to the results of the present experiment, motivating male Betta fish to display aggressive behaviors when a female is nearby in order to mate and reproduce; as the goal of all animal species is to reproduce and maintain high fitness.
