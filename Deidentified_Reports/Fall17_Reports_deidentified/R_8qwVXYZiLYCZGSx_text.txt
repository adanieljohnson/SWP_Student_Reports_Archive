Title: The Effect of Lidocaine on the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Northern Leopard Frog 

Abstract:
In this experiment we discovered the effect of lidocaine on the gastrocnemus and sciatic nerve of the Northern Leopard Frog. Our hypothesis was if the muscle was injected with lidocaine the contractions would be significently lower than a muscle without lidocaine. We measured the twitch threshold by the nerve to get our results. We noticed that once we injected the lidocaine and waited 5 minutes to stimulate all the contractions. It was followed by a very low voltage and some could not be seen by looking at the muscle. We concluded that lidocaine made the muscle contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle were weak like we predicted. 


Introduction:
This experiment explores the neuromuscular system of the Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens, in a process known as excitation-contraction coupling. It begins with an action potential traveling along a nerve cell to the neuromuscular junction, where it depolarizes the neuron causing the release of Ach (Sadava:2017). This neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on the muscle fiber, opening up sodium channels and creating an action potential in the muscle fiber. This stimulates the release of Ca+2, ultimately causing the muscle to contract and the re-uptake of the Ca+2 causes the muscle fiber to relax (Johnson:2017) This process can be shown with the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens.  The activities of the muscle can be monitored through the program Iworx. We used the Rania pipiens because the gastrocnemus muscle was strong and gave off adequate pulses to make for good measurements. Lidocaine is an anesthetic that causes temporary numbness in the skin by blocking nerve signals in the body. Lidocaine is also a sodium channel blocker. We hypothesized that through measuring the muscle twitch threshold and with the injection of lidocaine into the gastrocnemus of the frog will cause the muscle to produce weak or no contractions. 


Materials and Method:
For our experiment, we first had to isolate the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve from three different frog legs. We had to remove the skin from each frog leg by pulling it down to the frog’s foot. Next we used Ringer’s solution to moisten each in a dissecting pan. Then we separated the inner thigh muscles of the frog leg to expose the sciatic nerve. We then had to use scissors to cut the gastrocnemus muscle from the leg of the frog.  We secured the frog legs in the dissecting pan by tying the gastrocnemus muscle to a stand with string and we clamped the top part of the leg to the dissecting pan. We connected the sciatic nerve to a sleeve electrode and connected that to the adapter on the IWorx program. We set the stimulus parameters at 1 pulse and 5 pulses at 1 Hz frequency with amplitude increasing from 0.1 to 0.5.  We ran tests to determine the twitch threshold through nerve stimulation.  The threshold voltage was determined when we increased the stimulus voltage increments of 0.1V. We tested to a pulse amplitude of 0.5 at 1 pulse and then used the threshold to test the stimulation at 5 pulses. Next we injected the gastrocnemus muscle with 0.2 Ml of lidocaine and waited 5 minutes for the muscle to relax. Then we repeated the same process that we used for the untreated leg. We repeated this on two other frog legs and recorded the data. We ran a two-sample t_test to graph our findings. 


Results:
The voltage of the twitches after the lidocaine injection were lower on each frog leg at 1 pulse as well as we ran 5 pulses. All the frog legs whether treated or untreated had a twitch threshold of 0.2 v except for treated frog A and C  whose twitch threshold was 0.3 v.  All of the lidocaine injected frog legs produced weaker contractions than the untreated groups.The average voltage for the untreated group was 0.2575 v with the common amplitude of 0.2. The average voltage of treated group was approximately 0.072 v with a common amplitude of 0.26. The results were significent because they produced a p_value of 2.21E-7. 

Discussion:
Our results proved that when the gastrocnemus muscle was injected with lidocaine the voltage of the contractions was significently lower than the untreated gastrocnemus. The lower results after the lidocaine injection can be proven due to the fact that lidocaine blocks the signals from the sciatic nerve to the gastrocnemus muscle. The results show that when we stimulated the leg without lidocaine it was able to contract consistently with 1 pulse or 5 pulses but when we injected the lidocaine the muscle wasn’t able to contract consistently at 1 pulse or 5 pulses. The graph showed the differences between of the average pulse amplitude and voltage of contractions when lidocaine was injection versus the untreated muscle. The untreated muscle on average was able to produce around .25 volts compared to the treated muscle which produced on average below 0.1volts for contractions.  Our experiment results were statistically significent and we accept our claim. Our results supported our hypothesis because we knew the contractions after the injection would be very weak or absent. This results occurred for us biologically because the injection of lidocaine caused a block in the sodium ions channels which made it hard for the gastrocnemus muscle to produce a strong contraction. A possible error we could’ve encountered was inadequate measurements of the lidocaine injections. We also don’t know if the size of the frog leg played a role in the ability to contract with an injection of lidocaine.
