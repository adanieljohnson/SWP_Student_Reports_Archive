Title: The effects of a potassium channel blocker on the strength of contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle of the Leopard Frog. 

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to test the effects of a potassium channel blocker on the strength of muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog. Potassium channels play an important role in the process of muscle contraction and relaxation. Potassium channels open due to depolarization of the muscle cell, and they allow an efflux of positive charges out of the cell, this which causes the muscle relax. We therefore predict that blocking these potassium channels in the treatment experiment will increase the strength of muscle contraction, as excess positive charges will not be able to leave the cell, resulting in a stronger muscle contraction. To test this hypothesis we will be treating the gastrocnemus muscle with Tetraethylammonium Cl, a potassium channel blocker, and we will then be using a force transducer to stimulate the muscle, and to record the resulting strength of muscle contractions. Our results did not support our hypothesis, as the treatment experiment had weaker contractions than the controlll experiment at every stimulus voltage. We therefore cannot say that treating the gastrocnemus muscle with a potassium channel blocker will result in larger muscle contractions. 

Introduction:
A nerve stimulates muscle contraction through a process called excitation-contraction coupling. We will be monitoring the contraction and relaxation at the macroscopic level of muscles and nerves in the Rania Pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog, specifically the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve. We are performing our experiment on skeletal muscle because skeletal muscle is common in many other organisms, so we may be able to compare our results from this experiment to other organisms. Muscle contraction occurs as a result of neuronal signaling. At the neuromuscular junctions, nerve impulses can cause a release of ACh into the synapse. ACh will bind to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, this which causes depolarization of the cell. Slight depolarization of the cell causes voltage gated sodium channels to open, sodium then travels down its concentration gradient, and floods into the neuron. Once enough sodium channels have opened, and threshold is reached in the cell, the cell will fire an action potential, this which causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This release of calcium triggers a series of interactions between the actin and myosin muscle filaments, which causes the muscle to contract. The release of calcium ions also causes the potassium channels to open, and potassium ions leave the cell, moving down their concentration gradient. Sodium channels open quickly, whereas potassium channels are slower to open, and they stay open for longer. This allows potassium ions to carry excess positive charges out of the cell, allowing the cell membrane to return to a negative state [Johnson: 2017]. 

In our experiment we will be examining the effect of a potassium channel blocker on the strength of contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. The muscle is located on the back of the frog leg, below the knee. We will be treating our muscle with 100 mM of Tetraethylammonium Cl, which will inhibit the opening of the potassium channels. The independent variable in this experiment is the potassium channel blocker, and the dependent variable is the strength of muscle contraction. We predict that blocking the potassium channels in the treatment experiment will increase the strength of the muscle fiber contractions in the gastrocnemus muscle, compared to the controlll experiment. We have made this prediction because we think that if the potassium channels are unable to open, then the potassium ions will not be able to carry excess positive charge out of the cell, this which will prevent the muscle fibers from returning to a depolarized state, and therefore the strength of contraction will increase. Potassium channels are crucial in preventing excessive membrane depolarization, and they contribute to the decrease in force during fatigue, therefore we assume that blocking these crucial potassium channels will result in the cell membrane becoming further depolarized, and an increased muscle force [Cifelli, 2008]. 
Our hypothesis is in line with a previous experiment done on the skeletal muscle of mice. They found that disrupting the function of potassium channels through the use of a blocker, resulted in an increase in contraction force [Zhu, 2013]. 


Materials and Method:
Frog leg preparation:
Place the frog leg in a dissecting pan. Grasp the skin at the top of the leg and pull it down towards the frog foot. Remove skin and lay skinned leg in dissecting pan. Gently separate the inner thigh muscles, this will reveal the white sciatic nerve and the accompanying blood vessels. Free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue. Be sure NOT to touch the sciatic nerve with any metal tools. Keep the exposed tissues moist with Ringer’s solution. Gently separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the bone, start at the top of the leg, and work your way down toward the foot of the frog. Use scissors to cut the bottom of the muscle from the connecting bone near the foot. Tie a piece of cotton string around the end of the detached muscle, leaving a loop in the string. Lie the leg in the dissecting pan and connect the string to the force transducer using the loop in the string. Pin the leg down to the tray using the metal pins, place two pins in a cross at the top of the muscle, and two at the bottom of the muscle (Be sure not to touch the sciatic nerve with the metal pins). Change the height of the force transducer so that there is slight tension in the string, and therefore slight tension in the strung muscle. Insert the two needle probes into the muscle, placing the black probe into the lower part of the muscle, and the red probe into the mid/upper part of the muscle. Connect the BNC connector of the pin electrodes to the stimulator output of the force transducer. 

Control experiment: Testing muscle contraction strength: 
Open iWorx LabScribe. Check values for stimulus parameters. Pulse amplitude should be set to 0.000V, number of pulses should be set to 1, frequency should be set to 1, and pulse width should be set to 5ms. Click Apply to finalize any parameter changes. Type 0.1V in the mark box and click Apply. Click Record to stimulate the muscle with 0.1V. Stop the recording after the muscle has twitched, or after a couple of seconds if no contraction occurs. Record the muscle amplitude. Increase the stimulus voltage in 0.1V increments, recording the resulting muscle amplitude for each increase. Increase in 0.1V increments up to 0.5V, then increase the voltage to 1.0V. Next, continue to increase the voltage in 1.0V increments up to 5V. These results will serve as the controlll experiment for this frog leg. 

Treatment experiment: Testing muscle contraction strength:
To prepare the potassium channel blocker, dissolve 1.7g of 100 mM Tetraethylammonium Cl in 100 Ml of Ringer’s solution. Treat the gastrocnemus muscle with 0.2Ml of 100 mM of Tetraethylammonium Cl solution, by injecting it directly into the muscle. Repeat steps 1-3 from the method; Control experiment: Testing muscle contraction strength. These results will serve as the treatment experiment for this frog leg. 

Repeat these method for the second and third frog leg. 

Statistical test:
Once results have been recorded for all three frog legs, use a one tailed Paired t_test to compare the observations taken from the controlll experiment and the treatment experiment. I am using a one tailed Paired t_test because our hypothesis predicts that the strength of the muscle contractions of the treatment experiment will be statistically greater than those of the controlll experiment. 


Results:
The muscle amplitude of the treatment experiment was on average, lower than that of the controlll experiment at every stimulus voltage (Table #1). However, the average threshold of the treatment experiment was higher than that of the controlll experiment (Figure #1). The difference in strength of contractions between the controlll experiment and the treatment experiment is greater between 0v to 0.5V stimulus, compared to 1.0V to 5.0V stimulus (Table #1). Interestingly, the average maximum strength of contraction for the controlll experiment was reached at 3.0V, and then the strength of contractions declined at 4.0V and 5.0V, whereas for the treatment experiment, the average maximum strength of contraction was reached at 5.0V, showing the strength of contractions increasing every time the stimulus voltage was increased (Figure #1). 

After using a one tailed Paired t_test, we can see that the difference in mean strength of contraction of the treatment experiment and the mean strength of contraction of the controlll experiment was significently different (t_stat=3.974874, d.f.=10, P=0.002623). Our hypothesis was however not supported as the mean strength of contraction for the treatment experiment was lower than the mean strength of contraction for the controlll experiment. 


Discussion:
Our results do not show an increase in muscle contraction force for the treatment experiment, compared to the controlll experiment, and therefore our hypothesis is not supported. Although we hypothesized that treating the gastrocnemus muscle with a potassium channel blocker would result in a larger contraction, the treatment experiment had weaker contractions than the controlll experiment at every stimulus voltage. Potassium channels are crucial in allowing the muscle cell membrane to hyperpolarize, and return back to its ready state in order to contract again [Cifelli, 2008]. We therefore assumed that blocking these channels would stop the potassium efflux, meaning that the muscle fibers would not be able to relax as quickly, resulting in a larger contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. 

As mentioned previously, potassium channels are crucial in preventing excessive membrane depolarizations, as they allow the potassium ions to carry excess positive charge out of cell. Perhaps blocking the potassium channels in the treatment experiment did result in excessive depolarization of muscle fiber cells in the gastrocnemus muscle. A study on the skeletal sartorius muscle of the Rania Pipiens revealed that adding a potassium channel blocker caused a decrease in tetanic force. This which was attributed to the significent membrane depolarizations [Gramolini, 1997]. 

Furthermore, A study on the skeletal muscle of mice revealed that potassium channels are essential in preventing skeletal muscle contractile dysfunctions. These dysfunctions can include fibre damage, large membrane depolarizations, and large increases in unstimulated intracellular calcium [Cifelli, 2008]. This could be a potential explanation as to why our treatment experiment did not produce larger contractions than the controlll group. The potassium channel blocker disrupted the normal efflux of potassium ions out of the cell during hyperpolarization, and as a result the cell membrane remained depolarized. This excess depolarization could have caused a slight muscle contractile dysfunction, and could account for the lower muscle contractions of the treatment experiment compared to the controlll experiment. 

If we were to conduct another experiment on the contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle, it would be interesting to test the effects of a potassium channel activator. Adding additional potassium into the cell could cause the contraction to be stronger, as it takes longer for the potassium to carry positive charges out of the cell, and it will take longer for the muscle to relax.  Or maybe the additional potassium will speed up the process of hyperpolarization, and cause the muscle contraction to be weaker and shorter. It would also be interesting to test the effects of a potassium channel activator on the strength of a series of contractions. Channel activation causes resting potassium permeability to be increased [Ashcroft, 1988], so perhaps the first contraction will be stronger, but the following contractions may decrease in strength. The additional potassium might mean that not enough positive charge will be carried out of the cell, resulting in no undershoot, therefore the muscle cells will not be able to depolarize as well for the following contractions, causing weaker or shorter contractions. On the contrary, activation of the potassium channels may increase potassium efflux from the cell, causing a larger undershoot, and this may cause quicker depolarization of the muscle cells. 

Many other studies have tested the effects of a potassium channel blocker on the muscle contraction of fatigued muscles. Next time we could test the effects of a potassium channel blocker on fatigued muscles, compared to unfatigued muscles, to see if this makes a difference on the overall strength of contractions. This could be interesting, because the unfatigued muscles will most likely produce similar results to the treatment experiment. The fatigued muscles may however produce different and interesting results.
