Title: Effects of Aggression on the Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp.(Crayfish)

Abstract:
In the experiment, the researchers try to discover whether aggressiveness would increase the specific metabolic rate or not using Procambarus sp. as experiment subject. The hypothesis is that the aggressiveness or aggressive behaviors will increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp.. The researched used one-tailed paired t-test to analyze the experiment result. The average difference is 0.0003186; t-value is 1.641834; p-value is 0.242325 after 20 minutes. The hypothesis cannot be accepted, and the null hypothesis that the aggressiveness would not increase the specific metabolic rate is not rejected. Further experiments and tests are needed to reach a conclusion.

Introduction:
In the experiment, the researchers try to discover whether aggression would affect the metabolic rate of Procambarus sp., commonly known as crayfish. Specifically, the researchers try to find out whether aggressive behavior would increase the metabolic rate of the crayfish .Dr. Lahti conducted similar research, Metabolic rate, and aggressiveness between Brown Trout populations, in which he discovered that aggressiveness in Brown Trout population increased their respiration rate (Dr. Lahti 2002). Crayfish, just like all other creatures, needs energy in order to move and function. Its small body size, high basal metabolic rate, and aggressiveness towards intruders to its territory make it the perfect organism to study under lab setting on this topic. The metabolic rate refers to the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiological process at any given time. When the crayfish’s activities require more energy, its metabolic rate rises. When facing a potential threat, such as an intruder to its territory, the crayfish would be alerted and focus on the intruder to launch attacks or to initiate defense mechanisms. These actions all require the crayfish to spend more energy as well as making physiological changes. The researchers used the two-tailed paired t-test to compare the oxygen consumption, which is an ideal indicator of an organism’s metabolic rate, of crayfish during resting state and displaying aggressive behaviors. We hypothesize that the aggression and aggressive behaviors of the crayfish will increase its metabolic rate.

Materials and Methods:
Select a healthy crayfish, weigh it and put it into a water jar integrated with an oxygen probe. Fill the jar completely with water, and seal it airtight. Measure the oxygen concentration in the water every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. Take the crayfish out of the jar, and allow it to rest for 40 minutes. Put a mirror in the water jar, and then put the crayfish back into the jar. Seal the jar, and make sure the mirror always faces the head of the crayfish, so that the crayfish would mistake the reflected image as an intruder. Measure the oxygen concentration for every 5  minutes for 20 minutes. Repeat the above steps on two other healthy crayfishes. Use 1 tailed paired t-test to analyze the experimental data.



Results:
Generally speaking, all three crayfishes’ specific metabolic rate increases when the mirror is installed. However, crayfish 1 experienced significantly less increase in specific metabolic rate compared to other two crayfishes. The average difference is 0.0003186; t-value is 1.641834; p-value is 0.242325 after 20 minutes. The average difference is 0.000918333; t-value is 2.205853; p-value is 0.158156 after 10 minutes.

Discussion:
The hypothesis is that the aggressiveness would increase the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish cannot be accepted, and the null hypothesis that the aggressiveness would not increase the specific metabolic rate is not rejected. Because the p-value is greater than 0.05. Further testing is needed. This result does not match with Dr. Lahti’s research, Metabolic rate and aggressiveness between Brown Trout populations, in which he suggests that the aggressiveness would increase the metabolic rate of the organisms (Lahti 2002). There are two possible explanations for the result. The first one is the first crayfish seemed uninterested to the mirror image whereas the other two test subjects held their claws up and stared at the mirror all the time. The second possible explanation is that the crayfishes got used to the mirror image after realizing the image is not actively interacting with them. The evidence is that when t-value after 10 minutes is significantly smaller than that after 20 minutes. In the future, researchers could try to do more tests on more crayfishes of different kinds. At the same time, researchers should actively disturb the crayfish in addition to the installment of the mirror.
