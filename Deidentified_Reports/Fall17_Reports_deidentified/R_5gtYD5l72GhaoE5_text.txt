Title: Lack of Effects of Salinity on Photosynthetic Activity in Chloroplasts of Spinacia oleraca Independent of the Exposure of Light 

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of salinity on photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca leaves by exposing chloroplasts to saline environments. It was predicted that the activity of photosynthesis will decrease in the presence of a 35 mg/Ml saline solution. Chloroplasts were extracted from the leaves and grinded into a liquid where they were further isolated using a centrifuging technique. The chloroplasts were introduced to a high energy electron alternative and absorbances were recorded to examine the change in activity over thirty minutes. It was found that saline introduction did not influence the amount of photosynthesis occurring in the chloroplast; however, light environments did effect photosynthesis. 

Introduction:
All living organisms require energy to survive and function and plants use photosynthesis from light to produce their energy source. Photosynthesis uses oxidation and reductions reactions and an electron transport chain where protons are pumped across a membrane to create a gradient synthesizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the fuel source [Johnson:2017]. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of the cell by molecules of chlorophyll. Using light-dependent reactions, high excited electrons move through Photosystem I or Photosystem II and eventually are released from the chain, thus creating ATP [Johnson:2017]. In this experiment, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) is used because it is a good electron acceptor that can me observed in the Hill reaction in isolated chloroplasts. The effects of salinity on photosynthetic activity are tested in this experiment by isolating chloroplasts from Spinacia oleraca, exposing the chloroplasts to saline (or no saline) environments, and measuring the absorbances via a spectrometer. The change in absorbance will determine whether there was photosynthetic activity. Leaves from Spinacia oleraca were the organisms used in this experiment because it is a popular agricultural crop worldwide and knowing the effect of salinity on this plant could help in future agriculture techniques. How salinity effects such a crucial biological system is important because stress introduced by salinity is one of the most negative stress effecting glycophytes crops around the world [Chen: 2017]. In a study by Killi and Haworth showed that introducing quinoa to a salt-stress environment reduces the photosynthetic activity by impairing the electron transport chain of Photosystem II [Killi: 2017]. In the Ma et al study on Rapeseed, photosynthesis was inhibited with an introduction to a saline environment [Ma et al: 2017]. Possible reasons for the inhibition was that the salt caused stomatal closing [Ma et al: 2017].  Based on these other studies and prior knowledge, it is can be hypothesized that introduction to a saline environment to Spinacia oleraca leaves will reduce the amount of photosynthetic activity independent of exposure to light. 

Materials and Method:
Place mortar, pestle, and beaker on ice. Remove large central veins from four spinach leaves and discard of the veins. Grind viable leaves in the mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Add another 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer and grind until mixture becomes slurry. Filter through a triple layer cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Transfer filtered liquid into a 50-Ml centrifuge tube. In a balanced centrifuge, centrifuge for 3 minutes at 200 x G (200 times gravity). Pour supernatant into another 50- Ml centrifuge tube. Again, in a balanced centrifuge, centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000 x G (1000 times gravity). Pour supernatant into a third 50-Ml centrifuge tube. In the centrifuge tube from the second centrifuge, add 20 Ml of cold grinding buffer and suspend. Prepare one blank (8 Ml distilled water and 2 Ml 100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5 reaction buffer), three replicates of chloroplast, in light, and no saline solution (6 Ml distilled water, 2 Ml 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml reaction buffer), three replicates of chloroplast, in light, and saline solution (2 Ml 130 mM DCPIP, 2 Ml reaction buffer, and 6 Ml of 35 mg/Ml saline solution), three replicates of chloroplast, in dark, and no saline solution (6 Ml distilled water, 2 Ml 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml reaction buffer), and three replicates of chloroplast, in dark, and saline solution (2 Ml 130 mM DCPIP, 2 Ml reaction buffer, and 6 Ml saline solution). After all replicates have been prepared, add 100 μL of chloroplast. The prepared chloroplast that is used is the sample of the pellet after the second centrifuge mixed with the grinding buffer. Mix immediately after added chloroplast. Transfer each sample into a cuvette. Take time zero absorbances at 600 nm in a spectrometer. Place the samples tested in dark in a dark cabinet and the samples tested in light under a direct light source. Wait 10 minutes and take absorbances. Replace samples into their designated areas and wait another 10 minutes. Record absorbances at time equals 20 minutes and again place samples back in their correct locations. Wait a third period of 10 minutes and record the absorbances a final time. To analyze results, a two-tail t_test was performed to determine statistically significance. 

Results:
The null hypothesis was that the samples that included saline solution and the samples that had an absence of saline solution would produce similar photosynthetic activity. The alternate hypothesis was that the samples that included saline solution and the samples that had an absence of saline solution would produce different levels of photosynthetic activity. The general trend in all samples was an increase in photosynthetic activity. However, there was a much larger increase in activity in the two groups exposed to light compared to the two groups exposed to a dark environment. Figure 1 shows the general trends and displays the means and standard deviations for each group of samples. The results of the t_tests proved that both the dark samples with saline compared to the light samples with saline are statistically significent (t_stat= 7.9189, d.f.=2, p=0.0156). Comparing the two light samples, (t_stat= 0.6044, d.f.=2, p=0.6070), showed that they were not statistically different. Similarly, the two dark samples were statistically insignificent (t_stat= 1.1976, d.f.=2, p=0.3538). Finally, the dark sample without saline compared to the light sample without saline was statistically significent (t_stat= 5.4721, d.f.=2. P=0.0318). Upon first glance of the data, it appeared that there were two outliers: sample 2 containing no saline solution and exposed to no light and sample 4 exposed to direct light and containing saline solution. After performing a Q-test it was disproven that neither was an outlier as Qexp > Qcritical. The critical value associated with the number of trials was 0.970 and the experimental values were 0.8229 and 0.9580, respectively.

Discussion:
The difference between both the light samples with and without saline and the dark samples tested with and without saline proved to be statistically insignificent concluding that saline had no high impact on photosynthesis. The alternate hypothesis was rejected and the null hypothesis was confirmed as there was no significent change in the presence of saline solution. The hypothesis that photosynthetic activity would decrease in the presence of saline was also refuted. This is not in accordance with Ma et al or Killi and Haworth as they both concluded a decrease or inhibition of activity. The study conducted by Killi and Haworth was different because they tested the effects of salinity on quinoa, a grain, opposed to spinach, a vegetable.  Also, Ma et al tested salinity on a seed (rapeseed) which may have different agricultural properties effecting photosynthesis. This experiment is important because knowing that salinity has no effect on photosynthesis, provides agricultural companies with a greater area to plant their crops (specially Spinacia oleraca) without considering the effects of salinity. Two possible experiments to conduct to further investigate the effects of salinity on photosynthesis are: 1) running the same experiment conducted above but use different species of plants, and/or 2) test different and increasing levels of salt on Spinacia oleraca and their effect on photosynthetic activity.
