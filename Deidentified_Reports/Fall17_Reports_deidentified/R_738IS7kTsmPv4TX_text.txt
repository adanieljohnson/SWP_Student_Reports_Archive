Title: Effect of higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in water on specific metabolic rate of Procambarus spp.

Abstract:
In this lab, 100 mL of seltzer was added to 900 mL of room temperature water to measure the effects of increased levels of carbon dioxide on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus spp, or the crayfish. The experiment was conducted by measuring the dissolved oxygen concentration of the water each crayfish was in for twenty minutes, both with and without the addition of the seltzer. The oxygen consumed by each crayfish was then used to calculate the specific metabolic rate of each crayfish. The original hypothesis was that the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish would lower with increased levels of carbon dioxide. To measure the significance of the results, a paired t-test was used. The calculated p-value was 0.1330, indicating that the results were not significant, and the hypothesis was rejected. The crayfish did have slightly lower specific metabolic rates with the addition of the carbon dioxide, but there was not enough variance to support the hypothesis. This experiment is significant because carbon dioxide levels are rising in our oceans, and the potential consequences to aquatic life need to be understood.

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab was to measure the effect of higher concentrations of carbon dioxide on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus spp. Procambarus spp. is a freshwater crayfish primarily found in the southeastern US. This species is commonly used in labs for its relatively small size and ability to survive in low dissolved oxygen concentrations [Bonvillain: 2012]. Metabolism is the process of balancing, converting, and transferring energy within an organism. One of the key reactions in metabolism is the conversion of carbon and oxygen from the glucose molecule into carbon dioxide gas. This reaction also releases electrons that are captured by NAD+ and FAD, that bring the electrons to the electron transport system. In the electron chain, energy is given up and used to change low-energy ATP into higher energy ATP. At the end of the chain, molecular oxygen removes the electrons, and is delivered to the cells. The necessity of oxygen causes the amount of energy expended to be directly proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed [Johnson: 2016]. An animal’s specific metabolic rate is the amount of energy expenditure/oxygen consumption per gram of body mass per unit of time. In this experiment, a dissolved oxygen probe is used to measure the amount of oxygen consumption of the crayfish. The addition of seltzer to the water will increase the carbon dioxide levels in the water. Higher concentrations of carbon dioxide make it harder for sea animals to respire and make sea animals more susceptible to already low concentrations of oxygen [Brewer, Peltzer: 2009]. Specifically, increased carbon dioxide in the water reduces the rate at which carbon dioxide can be released after respiration, increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. This also impairs hemoglobin’s ability to carry oxygen [Hargreaves, Brunson: 1996]. While the effects of increased carbon dioxide concentrations on respiration are known, we were curious how an increase in carbon dioxide would affect the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in the short run. Although breathing would be expected to be more difficult, we wondered how much the carbon dioxide would decrease the specific metabolic rate. Our hypothesis is that the addition of seltzer to the water will decrease the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish.

Materials and Methods:
Three crayfish of similar size were selected. Each crayfish was weighed, and then placed in a mason jar with room temperature water of twenty-two degree Celsius for twenty minutes. A dissolved oxygen probe was attached to the mason jar, and the amount of oxygen was measured at intervals of five, ten, fifteen, and twenty minutes. After all three crayfish have been measured, prepare the next three mason jars with a mixture of 0.9L of room temperature water and 0.1L of Seltzer. Again, measure the dissolved oxygen levels in the mason jar for each crayfish for twenty minutes, recording at the same time intervals. A paired two-sample t-test will then be used to interpret results.

Results:
Based on the data collected, both of the first two crayfish had a lower specific metabolic rate when placed in the water with the addition of seltzer, than in the regular water. The third crayfish was omitted from the results after an inaccurate dissolved oxygen reading of 0 during the control measurement. The first crayfish’s specific metabolic rate decreased from 0.0044824 to 0.0040529 and the second crayfish’s specific metabolic rate decreased from 0.0027598 to 0.0020923. Figure 1 shows the averages of both of these crayfish when in the water without seltzer and with seltzer. To measure the significance of this experiment, a paired t-test was used. The degrees of freedom was one, the t-statistic was 4.7155, and the p-value was 0.1330. This led to the conclusion that the results were not significant.

Discussion:
Based on the results of the pair t-test, our results were not significant and the hypothesis was rejected. Although two of the crayfish did show a decrease in the specific metabolic rate, the differences were not large enough to show significance. The data on the third crayfish could not be used because the dissolved oxygen sensor registered the oxygen concentration as increasing for the duration of the twenty minutes, falling back to baseline at the conclusion during the control. The dissolved oxygen levels were also recorded as increasing during the control part of the second crayfish for a portion of the time. A potential explanation for this error was that the sensor was not pushed far enough into the lid, or that the seal was not tight enough, allowing some oxygen to enter through the top of the sensor. Another potential source that could have altered the significance was the huge variance between the specific metabolic rates of the three crayfish. Although all were of similar size, each crayfish had significantly different rates ranging from 0.00209 to 0.00665 in the experimental portion. While these results were not significant, they were done with a small sample size of only two crayfish. Improvements to this experiment would be a larger sample size, more care in the setting up of the dissolved oxygen sensor, and testing the effects of different amounts of carbon dioxide. An interesting future study could be to determine if there is a minimum threshold or amount of carbon dioxide where the respiration and metabolic rates of sea animals are severely impaired. While the 10% concentration of carbon dioxide did decrease the specific metabolic rate, maybe larger concentrations are needed to create a more significant decrease. A study was done in China in 2012 on three separate aquatic species: oyster, scallop, and mussel, to determine the effects of ocean acidification on the metabolic rates of these species. Increased carbon dioxide levels in the water lower the pH and make the ocean more acidic. To conduct this experiment, bubbling carbon dioxide gas was added to water tanks, with the pH being constantly measured. The results showed that metabolism was affected in all three species as the pH was lowered. The metabolic rate was mainly measured in ammonia excretion, which is excreted as a product of catabolism in bivalves. For two of the three species, there were minor decreases in oxygen consumption, with a large drop in consumption in the third species. It was concluded that while all species are effected by the increase in carbon concentration and ocean acidification, the magnitude of the response differed among species [Wenguang, Maoxian: 2012]. The effect of carbon dioxide on aquatic species is becoming prevalent to society since ocean acidification is quickly becoming a large problem. While it is thought that the increased carbon dioxide lowers metabolism, the larger question is will aquatic species be able to adapt to increased carbon dioxide in the oceans in the long run?
