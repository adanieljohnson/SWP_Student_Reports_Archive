Title: Male Betta splendens behavior in response to females

Abstract:
Abstract
	This study deals with male Betta splendens response to one another in the presence of females. Aggressive behaviors are generally displayed between males to demonstrate dominance. Therefore, we suspected that the number of aggressive behaviors would increase as the female became more accessible, and the males had to demonstrate their fitness. There are three front-facing and three broadside behaviors associated with aggression in male Betta fish. The total number of these behaviors was counted during three different five-minute trials, with five minutes of rest in between. The first trial, which served as the control, the two males were observed with no female visible or present. The second trial had two males and a female visible, but not accessible. In the final trial, the two males and one female were all in the same compartment together. Our results found that the total number of aggressive behaviors increased with each trial, with the most occurring in the third trial. Future studies further investigating this idea of increased aggression in the presence of females could allow us to predict and preemptively respond to possible threats during research studies and recreational outdoor activities.


Introduction:
Introduction
	All animals have a drive to reproduce, and pass their genes on to the next generation. To do this, animals must attract mates and be chosen, called sexual selection. Some species are choosier than others, and may employ similar tactics to attract mates by demonstrating their fitness. Some tactics may involve colorful displays, building or nesting sites, aggression, or any of many others. [Gibson: 1996] 
Aggression can be defined as hostile or violent behavior or attitudes toward another; readiness to attack or confront. [Dictionary] In a study on dogs, aggression was sorted into eight types: aggression related to fear; dominance; possessiveness; protectiveness; predation; punishment; pain; and intra-specific aggression. The study found that aggression occurred more in males than in females, and that dominance and inter-male aggression types were most likely. [Borchelt: 1983] 
Since males tend to display aggression towards one another as a means of domination, which would prove their fitness to females, we decided to study the behavior of male Betta splendens fish in the presence and absence of females, and record their behaviors. Betta splendens were used as they demonstrate colorful and obvious behavioral displays in the presence of members of their own species. [Hogan: 1967]
	Behaviors between male bettas are usually antagonistic or aggressive, and are characterized as either front-facing or broadside displays. The latter includes pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. Facing movements include erecting pectoral fins, spreading opercula and protruding branchiostegal membranes.  [Ecology and Evolution: 2017]
	We expect that in the presence of a female, the male betta fish will demonstrate more behaviors if she is not separated from the males than if she were. Additionally, we think the males will demonstrate more behaviors in the presence of a female than they will when the two of them are alone with each other. 


Materials and Methods:
Materials and Methods
	We selected a tank with three compartments, and another with any number of compartments. In the first tank, we placed two male betta fish and female, each in their own compartment of the tank, and the remaining male in the other tank. Males were labeled for the entirety of the experiment as Male A, Male B and Male C. 
In each trial, we counted the total number of aggressive behaviors demonstrated by each male over the course of five minutes. Males could exhibit the same behavior multiple times throughout the course of trial, so long as the behavior stopped and began again, and was not continuous. In between trials, the males were switched from tank one into tank two and vice versa as indicated by which was used in each trial. Fish were separated into their own compartments, with glass and opaque separations in place. The fish were allowed five minutes to rest before the next trial began. 
	In the first trial, the opaque and the glass divider between Male A and Male B were removed, and the fish were observed. In the second trial, the opaque and glass dividers between Male B and Male C were removed, and the opaque divider between the males and female were removed, but the glass divider remained in place. In the last trial, the opaque and glass dividers were removed between Male A, Male C and the female. 
	To gather results, we calculated the percent change from Trial 1 to Trial 2, Trial 1 to Trial 3, and Trial 2 to Trial 3. 


Results:

There was a 104% increase in behaviors from Trial 1 to Trial 2. There was a 157% increase in behaviors from Trial 1 to Trial 3. There was 25.5% increase from Trial 2 to Trial 3. Overall, the behaviors increased in the presence of a female. The most behaviors occurred when the female was not separated from the males whatsoever. 


Discussion:
	According to our data, our hypothesis is supported. We thought that the total number of aggressive behaviors would increase as the female was introduced and became more accessible. Overall, the most aggressive behaviors occurred when the female was accessible, the second most when the female was visible but not accessible, and the least during the control trial, when the female was not seen at all. 
	A possible explanation for this increase in aggressive behavior is reproductive competition. In many species, males compete with one another for the attention of a female. In some cases, this includes colorful displays, in others nesting sites are built, and in others males demonstrate physical strength by fighting with one another. Since the driving force behind these aggressive behaviors is the desire to be selected as a mate, it stands to reason that presence of a female would increase the malesâ€™ aggression, as they are competing for her specific attention. Additionally, males tend to direct some aggressive behaviors towards females, which may also account for the increase in aggressive displays. [Le Boeuf: 2015]
	Further studies on this topic could involve experiments on other species with more samples to further determine whether or not males demonstrate more aggressive behaviors in the presence of females. Additionally, experiments dealing with aggression to determine if the presence of certain concentrations of pheromones could increase or decrease aggression. Lastly, the time in the reproductive cycle for animals like big cats or humans could also impact aggressive displays.
	Information from further studies of this type could allow us to predict times of increased or decreased aggression in animals that may attack humans, especially in areas surrounded by more wilderness. Pheromone studies could help decrease aggression towards hikers, explorers and caretakers, as could research studies on the impact of reproductive cycles on aggressive displays. More research on this topic could enhance safety measures in wilderness and captivity scenarios, and help minimize danger towards those who may come into contact with aggressive species.

Figure 1 shows the total number of aggressive displays observed by both male fish in each trial. Trial one occurred in the absence of a female. In Trial two, the female was visible, but not accessible, and in Trial three the female was accessible.
