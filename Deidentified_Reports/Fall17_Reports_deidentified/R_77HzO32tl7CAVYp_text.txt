Title: The effect of temperature change on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris spp.

Abstract:
The organism that was used for this experiment was the Procambris spp., a specie of crayfish. The goal of this experiment was to alter an environmental factor, specifically temperature, to see how the metabolic rates of the crayfish varied when exposed the two different temperatures. We hypothesized that the crayfish in the lower temperature water would have a lower metabolic rate than the crayfish in the room temperature water, due to the direct proportionality between glucose breakdown and oxygen consumption of the crayfish. The statistical test used to determine if the hypothesis was correct was a paired t_test. Though the statistical test performed did not statistically support our hypothesis because the p_value was 0.857, our data displayed trends like what we predicted would happen, as two of the three crayfish tested had lower specific metabolic rates in lower temperature water than they did in the higher temperature water. For this reason, it might be necessary to obtain more data to fully draw conclusions from our experiment. 


Introduction:
Metabolism within an organism is a collection of chemical processes and reactions within the body’s cells, and includes the “entire process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer” [Johnson: 2017]. The specific metabolic rate itself refers to the actual amount of energy being consumed per gram of organism. 

In this experiment, we observed a heterotroph, the Procambris spp., and the effect that a change in environmental temperature had on its specific metabolic rate. These organisms are ectotherms, which means that their core body temperature is based on the environment that they’re in. According to Armitage and Wall, the temperature of the environment an organism is in is a major determinant of the metabolic rates of animals [1982], and since we were observing the effect of environmental temperature on metabolic rate, an ectotherm was the ideal organism for this experiment. Additionally, the Procambris spp. organisms are small and easy to handle, which was necessary for this experiment as we needed to fit them into small test-chambers. 

Due to the direct proportionality between glucose breakdown and oxygen consumption, we inferred that if the temperature of the water environment of the crayfish was decreased, the dissolved oxygen content of the water would increase. We believed this would happen because the molecules would be moving at a slower rate and subsequently contain more oxygen. Therefore, we hypothesized that crayfish in the lower temperature water would have a lower metabolic rate, due to the fact that they do not have to work as hard in order to obtain the oxygen needed to create energy.


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, three Procambris spp. of similar size were chosen, weighed, and placed in individual holding tanks. One crayfish at a time was placed into a screw-top testing chamber that was filled to the brim with oxygen-saturated water. The test chamber was first filled with room temperature water, at 22 degrees Celsius. To make sure that the crayfish was exposed to as much oxygen as possible, the chamber was filled with enough water until it overflowed, and the top of the chamber was screwed on as tightly as possible. There was an oxygen probe built into the top of the chamber, that extended into the chamber itself. The oxygen probe was used to measure changes and fluctuations of the dissolved oxygen content of the water. The entire testing-chamber and probe was then placed into a large dishpan of room temperature water. Once the instrument stabilized, we measured the baseline dissolved oxygen content of the water and recorded it. Measurements were taken at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after the initial recording. The probe was then removed, and the volume of the water was measured by pouring it through a funnel into a graduated cylinder, for future calculations. The same process was then repeated with the same crayfish, however this time the test chamber was placed in a waterbath with water that was colder than room temperature. We then performed the same experiment with the next two Procambris spp.. The specific metabolic rate of the crayfish was found by measuring and recording the change in the dissolved oxygen of the water (equation shown below). 

Specific metabolic rate = (ΔO₂ × L of water) ÷ (mass × time)

The data was then statistically analyzed using a paired T-test.

Results:
As seen in the Figure 1, both the first and third crayfish tested, displayed a higher specific metabolic rate in room temperature water than colder water. The first crayfish displayed a specific metabolic rate of 0.00112 mgO2(gmin)-1 in warmer water (22 degrees Celsius), and decreased to 0.000907 mgO2(gmin)-1 in colder water (7 degrees Celsius). The third crayfish displayed a specific metabolic rate of 0.00116 mgO2(gmin)-1 in warmer water (22 degrees Celsius), and decreased to 0.00102 mgO2(gmin)-1 in colder water (12 degrees Celsius). Also displayed in Figure 1, the second crayfish however, displayed a higher specific metabolic rate in colder water than in room temperature water. The second crayfish displayed a specific metabolic rate of 0.0011 mgO2(gmin)-1 in room temperature water (22 degrees Celsius), and increased to 0.0016 mgO2(gmin)-1 in colder water (8 degrees Celsius). The statistical analysis of the paired t_test revealed the P-value to be 0.857, the t-value to be 0.205, and 2 degrees of freedom.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that crayfish in the lower temperature water would have a lower metabolic rate than when placed in room temperature water. These trends did occur with the first and the third crayfish we tested, because the temperature decreased, the specific metabolic rate decreased by 0.00021 mgO2(gmin)-1 for the first sample and 0.00014 mgO2(gmin)-1 for the second. The hypothesis was not statistically supported however, as the p_value from the statistical analysis was 0.857 which is greater than 0.05, revealing our data to be statistically insignificent. 

Because the trends we predicted were seen, but the data was statistically insignificent, we looked to previously done studies to provide more support. Two studies in particular agreed that temperature was related to metabolic rate, but they differed on the question of why they were related. One study involved placing mussels in 12 degrees Celsius water, and then transferring them to tanks containing 5 degrees Celsius water, and concluded that a higher metabolic rate occurred after a change in environmental temperature [Hawkins: 1995]. However, this study believed that the change in metabolic rate due to temperature change, could also be a result of outside influences such as the relationship between internal causes and environmental factors, specific to each organism. For example, they noted that oxygen consumption is higher in younger animals, which may explain why younger animals usually have a lower tolerance for temperature change [Hawkins: 1995]. This shows that while there is a correlation with temperature and an organism’s metabolic rate, the change in metabolic rate is actually due to an internal cause, not just the pure fact of temperature change. 

Another study agrees that metabolic rate in ectotherms is driven by the temperature of the environment. However, the experimenters provide another possible explanation for the relationship, as the possibility of the kinetic energy of the cells within the organism as the driver for metabolic rate [Clarke: 2004]. This study also looked at the resting metabolic rate of organisms, and its relation to temperature. They argued that an organism’s metabolic rate due to temperature could simply be the result of an evolutionary temperature adaptation that those organisms developed, due to the demands of living in a particular thermal environment. 

The trends seen in the second crayfish did not support what we had predicted would occur, because as the temperature of the water decreased (from 22 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius), the specific metabolic rate increased (from 0.00111 mgO2(gmin)-1 to 0.0016 mgO2(gmin)-1). This did not support what was stated above that as the temperature decreases and there is more dissolved oxygen in the water, the organisms do not have to work as hard to obtain the oxygen they need, and therefore had a lower specific metabolic rate. A possible reason for the contrasting trend seen in the second crayfish, could perhaps be because the water in the testing chamber startled the crayfish, causing it to get anxious, breathe harder, consume more dissolved oxygen, and ultimately causing its specific metabolic rate to increase.

One study presents the idea that some organisms might just need some time to acclimate to the temperature change, before their metabolic rate stabilizes into a “normal” metabolic range for that temperature. This study looked at fish in marine environments, and determined that for temperate fish, cold water temperatures either lead to dormancy, or set off responses that attempt to offset the effects of that environmental temperature reduction on metabolic rate [Johnston: 1987]. In other words, the change in temperature originally causes an abnormal change in metabolic rate, until they have time to compensate and get used to the new temperature of the environment they are now in. This could explain why the second crayfish in our experiment displayed trends that were inconsistent with the other two crayfish. Perhaps, this crayfish had a harder time adjusting to the temperature than the other two crayfish, which would explain the increase in metabolic rate. This is a possible source of error in our experimental techniques, that could be corrected for future studies. 

In the future if this experiment were to be repeated, I would put the crayfish in the cold water and wait about 10-15 minutes before I started recording the dissolved oxygen consumption, to give them time to adjust to the new environment. I think this would ensure that I was really determining whether the temperature change affects metabolic range over a long period of time, and not just an initial change because of the crayfishes’ unfamiliarity with a new environmental temperature. I believe that waiting longer before testing, along with more crayfish of a similar size and specie, would prove that the crayfish in the lower temperature water have a lower metabolic rate than the crayfish in the room temperature water.
