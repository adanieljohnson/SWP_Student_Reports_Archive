Title: The Effect of Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitor on Rania pipiens Maximum Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to learn more about the neuromuscular system, specifically the effects of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitor on the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. The experiment was conducted using three Rania pipiens leg muscles. Each were treated with AChE inhibitor after a baseline for maximum muscle contraction was determined before the treatment by conducting five pulses at the stimulus that yielded the maximum contraction. Then, the maximum stimulus was repeated and contraction amplitude was found after the treatment of AChE inhibitor was injected in the muscle. The experiment was conducted three different times on three different Rania pipiens leg muscles. Leg 2 had a p_value of 0.0643 it did not yield statistically significent data. Leg 1 produced a p_value of 0.0064 and leg 3 produced a p_value of 0.0001 yielded statistically significent data, but the data yielded opposite results. Therefore, the data was inconclusive and the data did not support the hypothesis. This could be due to the inhibitory effects of multiple choline derivatives. 

Introduction:
Rania pipens is commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog and was used in this experiment because the animal is easy to manipulate and cultivate in a lab environment. In this experiment there is a focus on the gastrocnemus muscle in the Rania pipiens leg. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that controllls the opening and closing of calcium ion channels in a motor neuron. The diffusion of calcium ions induces the depolarization and the firing of an action potential in a motor neuron. Muscles contain many motor neurons. In order to increase muscle strength and create a higher muscle contraction there has to be an increase in the firing rate of the motor neuron. Acetylcholine esterase is responsible for the removal of acetylcholine in order to close the calcium ion channels and stop muscle contraction [Sadava, et al.:2016]. Therefore, a choline esterase inhibitor treatment should leave the calcium ion channels open for a long period of time due to acetylcholine build up in the muscle cells. This allows calcium ion channels to stay open longer because the esterase can no longer remove the acetylcholine [Castillo & Katz: 1975]. It is hypothesized that if acetylcholine esterase inhibitor increases the amount of acetylcholine and continues to keep calcium ion channels open in the gastrocnemus muscle, then it will yield a higher maximum contraction in the experimental group compared to the controlll.

Materials and Method:
1.	Collect frog leg, place in dissecting pan, and dissecting pan, and dissect Gastrocnemius muscle and Sciatic nerve.
2.	Use Ringer’s solution to keep the Rania pipiens leg moist during the lab.
3.	Use LabScribe to record the maximum contraction of the Rania pipiens muscle.
4.	Set parameters to 1 pulse, frequency 0.5Hz, pulse width (W) 5ms, pulse amplitude 0.000V.
5.	Determine the threshold stimulus of the muscle by increasing the amplitude by 0.5Hz until the threshold is found.
6.	Find maximum contraction by increasing the amplitude from the threshold until the peak of period does not increase.
7.	After the maximum contraction is found, conduct five pulses at the maximum contraction and record the amplitude.
8.	Wait a minute.
9.	Inject 0.2Ml of ACh Esterase inhibitor solution (2% solution of Sevin) using a syringe.
10.	Repeated steps 1 and 6 for each Rania pipiens leg muscle.
11.	Use paired t_test to present statistical data for each Rania pipiens leg maximum muscle contraction.

Results:
In leg one of the Rania pipens, the average maximum contraction before the treatment of AChE inhibitor was 1.2438 volts with a standard deviation of 0.0322 volts and after the treatment the average maximum contraction was 1.1130 volts with a standard deviation of 0.0865 volts, as seen in Figure 1. In leg one the p_value was 0.0064, as seen in Figure 1. In leg two the average maximum contraction before the treatment of AChE Inhibitor was 1.7128 volts with a standard deviation of 0.0029 volts and after the treatment there was a maximum contraction of 1.7098 volts with a standard deviation of 0.0041 volts, as seen in Figure 2. In leg three the average maximum contraction before the treatment of AChE inhibitor was 1.4356 volts with a standard deviation of 0.0055 volts and after the treatment there was an average maximum contraction of 1.4722 volts with a standard deviation of 0.0080 volts, as seen in Figure 3. In leg three the p_value was 0.0001, as seen in Figure 3.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported because the data was only significent regarding leg 1 and leg 2, but the results were opposite of each other. The majority of the data concluded that the muscle before the treatment yielded a higher maximum contraction compared to the treated muscle, with the exception of leg 3. This can be explained through the competitive process between inhibitors and choline derivatives. In the reaction between an inhibitor and a choline derivative it has been found that the inhibitor has a drug-like inhibitory effect that relaxes the muscle. The inhibitor and the cholinesterase react in a two-step process where initially AChE inhibitor creates an action potential by acetylcholine’s natural opening of the calcium ion channels, but then in a second step the reaction slows done because the inhibitor floods the synapse with calcium ions by blocking the reuptake of acetylcholine and inhibits the cell from firing more action potentials. The increased rate is of firing therefore creates a lower volt maximum contraction because there is not enough action potential being fired before the muscle is exhausted [Castillo & Katz: 1957]. One way to make the experiment yield more conclusive data is to conduct the experiment on more Rania pipiens legs. Also, there is a possibility that the amount of calcium was taken up and the leg was fatigued before the after treatment trials. This could have hindered the amplitude of the maximum muscle contraction in the after treatment trials.
