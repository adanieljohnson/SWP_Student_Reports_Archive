Title: A23187 ineffective at decreasing stimulus frequency required to generate muscle tetany in gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The presence of Ca2+ plays a critical role in both the transmittance of action potentials from neurons to muscles and the expression of those action potentials in the form of muscle contraction. Calcium ions also play a role in contracting the sarcomeres in the muscles themselves by allowing myosin to bind to actin. A23187 facilitates the release of Ca2+ in these two stages of neuromuscular activity as a calcium channel activator. The present study investigates the role of A23187 in the ability of the gastrocnemus muscle to reach tetany in a Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens, at various stimulus frequencies. Because Ca2+ facilitates both processes mentioned involved in muscle contraction, initially, we predicted that A23187 would decrease the frequency at which the gastrocnemus muscle would reach tetany.  Our results indicated no significent difference in the performance of the gastrocnemus muscle before and after administration of the calcium channel activator. These results indicate that whatever change in Ca2+ concentration the A23187 caused was not sufficient to affect the ability of the gastrocnemus muscle to reach tetany. This would suggest that short term administration of a calcium channel activator does not, in fact, effect skeletal muscle performance.


Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are controlllled by the motor neurons of the nervous system. They are composed of thousands of myofibers which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells [Johnson: 2017]. Axons from motor neurons, which originate in the gray matter of the spinal cord, extend into muscles and then branch to stimulate several myofibers at neuromuscular junctions. The electrical signals that travel down axons reach neuromuscular junctions which signals the opening of calcium ion channels [Johnson: 2017]. The influx of calcium into the presynaptic membrane triggers the fusion of acetylcholine vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, leading to the release of this neurotransmitter to the neuromuscular junction and eventual binding to the postsynaptic membrane of the muscle, thus opening sodium ion channels that generate an action potential in the muscle [Johnson: 2017]. This depolarized charge spreads through the T-tubules of the muscle causing the release of calcium ion from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This calcium binds to troponin on the thin filament, changing the tropomyosin’s position and allowing the thick filaments to bind onto the thin filament. This is the final step that allows the activation of the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber which tenses the muscle tissue [Johnson: 2017].   A23187 is a calcium channel activator that is also known as calcium ionophore for its ability to bind Ca2+ ions [National Center for Biotechnology Information: 2017]. As discussed above, calcium allows for both the transmittance of action potentials from neurons to muscles and the binding of myosin to actin to contract the muscle fiber. We investigated the effects of the presence of A23187 on the ability of the gastrocnemus muscle of a Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens, to obtain tetany at different frequency values. Tetany, or maximum muscle contraction, is achieved through a process called temporal summation in which the muscle contracts repeatedly at such close intervals that a contraction begins before the muscle is fully relaxed following the previous contraction [Johnson: 2017]. We chose R. pipiens for its easy accessibility for laboratory use, well developed leg muscles, and easily isolatable gastrocnemus muscle. Because calcium ionophore increases Ca2+ ion concentration in the presynaptic membrane and in the myoplasm of the muscle cell [Germinario: 2010], we predict that the presence of A23187 will decrease the frequency required for the gastrocnemus of R. pipiens to reach tetany.


Materials and Method:
We used an IXTA system in conjunction with a computer to generate myograms of the contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle. We attached C-BNC-SE probe-type simulating electrodes to the gastrocnemus muscle which was attached on the distal end to a FT-302 force transducer with string. We pinned the other portions of the R. pipiens leg to the blue dissection wax and raised the transducer to remove slack from the string without creating immense tension as shown in Figure 1. We moistened the leg muscles with frog ringer’s solution every five minutes while the muscle tissue was exposed to keep the muscle fibers viable.  We stimulated the leg with all of the default program presets with the exception of using 1 volt of electricity at 4 Hz for 5 seconds to observe tension levels that might indicate a state of tetany. Upon failure to achieve tetany at a certain frequency value, we increased the frequency by 1 Hz and repeated the process until tetany was achieved. After tetany was achieved in the controlll group, we injected the leg with .2 Ml of 100mM A23187 and allowed the leg 5 minutes of rest. The 100mM A23187 solution was prepared by dissolving 5 mg in 10Ml ethanol and diluting to 100 Ml in Ringers solution. We then repeated the exact same procedure that was used for the controlll. This procedure was executed for three R. pipiens legs. For analysis, we used a paired t_test to compare the results of the controlll and experimental groups.


Results:
Upon first observation of the results, it appeared that calcium channel activator did indeed lower the stimulus frequency required to generate tetany. Both groups appear to have tightly grouped, precise results and the average frequency required to achieve tetany in the experimental group, 10.33, was 4 hertz less than the average frequency required to achieve tetany in the controlll group, 14.33.  Despite this difference, there was no significent difference following administration of A23187 (t(2) = 3.464, p = 0.074) as shown in Figure 2.


Discussion:
We do not have the statistical ability to reject the null hypothesis in favor of our predicted, alternate hypothesis. Our hypothesis could not be accepted, and A23187 does not in fact decrease the stimulus frequency required for tetany according to our results. This would suggest that calcium channel activator does not affect the gastrocnemus muscle’s ability to achieve tetany at a given frequency. Contrary to this fact, we noted how once the frog was injected with A23187, it seemed to respond more quickly, and with more force. In light of this information, we question whether our statistical test’s result is a matter of physiology or merely a flaw in experimental design and statistical testing.   Calcium ionophore is known to increase calcium concentration in the neuromuscular presynaptic membrane and the myoplasm of muscle cells. Calcium is an integral component of physiological processes at both of these locations and is necessary for neuromuscular communication and muscular contraction. We would then expect that increased concentrations of Ca2+ improve the speed and force at which action potentials can be communicated and expressed in muscle cells. Indeed, in a study conducted by Zakharov et al. (1978), approximately a 2.5 fold increase in contractile force was demonstrated by a guinea pig papillary muscle after injection with A23187 at a constant frequency. Their results support the intuitive conclusion that increasing calcium concentration in the myoplasm and presynaptic membrane improve muscular performance [Zakharov: 1978]. A likely explanation as to why our results do not support this conclusion is because 5 minutes may not have been enough time for A23187 to diffuse throughout the entirety of the gastrocnemus muscle through the muscular membrane. If we were to repeat this experiment, allowing more time for the calcium channel activator to diffuse or bathing the muscle in the A23187 solution would ensure that the experimental treatment has the opportunity to completely express its physiological function.  Furthermore, our p_value of .07 is still relatively low for an experiment conducted with sample size of n=3, which yields only 2 degrees of freedom. This leads me to believe that we would be able to support our hypothesis with a larger sample size. Therefore, if we were to repeat this experiment again, instead of using 3 R. pipiens legs for 3 trials, we would use 10 R. pipiens legs for 10 trials to see if our hypothesis truly is rejected or if our low sample size could be the cause of our inability to reject the null hypothesis. We suspect the latter, in light of our seemingly distinct results before and after administration of the calcium ionophore despite the potential source of error mentioned above. In conclusion, further experimentation is required to gain a full understanding of the function of A23187 in the gastrocnemus of R. pipiens. Despite our results, we are confident that calcium ionophore can change the ability of a muscle to achieve tetany and hope to prove so through further experimentation.
