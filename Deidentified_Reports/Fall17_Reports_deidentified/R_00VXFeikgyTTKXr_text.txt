Title: The Duration of Time Betta splendens Spend in an Aggressive State While in the Presence of Various Colored B. splendens

Abstract:
This experiment examines the effect color has on the aggression of Betta splendens. Male bettas often exhibit aggressive behaviors such as “red mane” and tail flashing towards other male betta fish [ Johnson: 2017]. We wanted to test and see if the color red on a betta provoked a longer duration of “red mane” or tail flashing of a focal fish during a time span of five minutes as opposed to a transparent betta fish. We believed that the red betta would cause a longer duration of aggression in a focal fish than the transparent fish would. However, after experimentation, we got the mean time that focal fish spent showing “red mane” or tail flashing towards a transparent betta fish as 51 seconds and the mean time of those same traits towards a red betta fish as 46 seconds. After performing a one tailed paired t-test, we got the p-value of .405, showing little statistical significance that our hypothesis was supported. Therefore, after experimentation, we believe that the color of a betta fish does not necessarily provoke more or less aggression.


Introduction:
In this experiment, we are testing to see how male Betta splendens (betta fish) respond to the color of another betta fish. Male betta fish are known for their aggressive behaviors towards other bettas and other species of fish [Johnson: 2017].  Betta fish are native to Siam and Thailand, they were originally bred to fight with each other, because people had noticed that they were territorial and aggressive in the wild. Eventually, the idea of having an aggressive fighting fish spread to Europe [Soniak: 2016]. The Bettas have two main aggressive behaviors broadside and facing movements [Johnson: 2017]. These movements have different levels of aggression and we are testing to see the duration of time a male betta fish spends in the highest level of aggression in broadside and facing movements respectively, tail flashing and “red mane” [Johnson:2017]. We believe that the focal fish will produce “red mane” or tail flashing for a significant amount of the duration of five minutes in the presence of a fish of the color red and not much “red mane” or tail flashing in the presence of a transparent fish.


Materials and Methods:
In the experimentation, we will have two live male betta fish that are red and transparent, all separated into separate tanks, with no interaction with one another. In the center tank, we will have a focal fish, who we will test the aggression of.  There will be three replicates of the focal fish. Each focal betta will be in the presence of each the red and the transparent fish for a duration of five minutes and significant rest in between [Johnson: 2017]. During each trial, we will observe the focal betta and the duration of time the focal betta uses either tail flashing (broadside) or “red mane” (facing) throughout the entirety of the trial [Johnson: 2017]. We will then record the time in the trial that the betta spent in these two aggressive behaviors on the table. We will apply a one tailed paired t-test to this experiment in order to compare the mean time of the focal fish showing aggression to either the transparent fish or the red fish [Johnson:2017].


Results:
After using a one tailed paired t-test, we were able to acquire the p-value of p= .405. The focal fish had a higher mean time in the aggressive states of red mane and tail flashing while in the presence of the transparent betta fish as compared to the focal fish in the presence of the red betta fish.


Discussion:
After completing the experiment, the results show that our hypothesis can be refuted. Our p-value was .405, which is well above the value of .05, showing that we have no statistical significance to prove our hypothesis. Therefore, there is no certainty that a betta fish of the color red is more likely to create aggressive behaviors such as “red mane” and tail flashing in a focal fish, as opposed to a transparent fish in the presence of the same focal fish. Though red is one of the two colors of aggression, (the other being blue) [Johnson: 2017]it is likely not a main factor that contributes to the overall level of aggression that is portrayed by a fish. We think that it is likely that habituation of the bettas, after constantly being subjects of experimentation, became a reason the bettas no longer react in the same aggressive manner towards each other. In addition, we believe that rather than color, there are genetic factors that lead some fish to demonstrate more aggressive patterns than others. For further study, it would be interesting to test other genetic components, such as size, to see if that is reasoning for is true. In another experiment done by students at Washington College [Connaughton:2011], they tested the way fake fish’s colors affect aggression, they too came to conclusion that color does not necessarily promote more aggression, as a result, it supports the rejection of our initial hypothesis.
