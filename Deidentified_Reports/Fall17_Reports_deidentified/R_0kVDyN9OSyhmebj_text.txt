Title: Herbivory’s effects on R. raphanistrum resource allocations

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment is to investigate herbivory’s effects on R. raphanistrum resource allocations. Punctuations of holes are used to imitate the effects of herbivory. It is hypothesized that plants that have holes on their leaves would have smaller R:S ratio because they need to grow their leaves much more to compensate the smaller photosynthesis rate. Plants are grown in the dirt for two weeks and the length and weight are obtained. In the end, the result shows no statistically significant difference between the results, which doesn’t match up with the previously stated hypothesis. This inconsistency may be caused by some experimental errors. 


Introduction:
One of the important capabilities that a species should have in order to have high reproductive fitness and outcompete other species by adapting to the continuous changing environment the nature world is technically called resource allocation. Resource allocation has been proved by many experiments to help the plant optimize its growth under changing environment by shifting plant’s phenotypic behaviors to invest relatively more in those organs that obtain the limiting resource(Bazzaz & Grace, 1997). There are many factors that may affect plants’ resource allocation strategies, such as the use of fertilizer, pollen limitation and so on (Janeček, Patáčová, & Klimešová, 2014; Qiaoqiao Huang, Burd, & Zhiwei Fan, 2017).
In this experiment, the strategy of allocation of resource of the plants is quantified by measuring the root to shoot ratio (of length and weight). Plants will allocate their resource to shoots and roots differently depending on the environment. Usually, when in an environment that has low level of nutrients in the soil, the roots tend to be larger and heavier compared to the shoots, because it is more necessary to grow the roots than growing the shoots, thus resulting in a lower R:S ratio. In contrast, it is more necessary to grow the shoots than the roots when there are difficulties for the shoots to capture resource, resulting in a higher R:S ratio. (Wang, Chen, Liu, & Li, 2014)
Effect of herbivory on plants’ resource allocation strategies and thus on the changes of plants’ phenotypic behaviors is of particular interest in this experiment because herbivory is one of the most important components of the terrestrial community . And it is known that herbivory will affect the development of the plants only when the tissue that has high potential to gather resource in the future is damaged (Bazzaz & Grace, 1997). So the effects of herbivory are imitated by punctuating small holes (1-2mm in diameter) on the leaves of the plants as the leaves are important organs for photosynthesis.
During the experiment, the plants, R. raphanistrum, commonly known as radish, are used to carry out the experiment. This particular plant species was used because it is easy to grow and it grows at a high rate. In addition, it is easier to measure the weights and lengths of the radish shoots and roots.
It is hypothesized that plants that have holes on their leaves, which imitate the effects of herbivory would have smaller R:S ratio because they need to grow their leaves much more to compensate the smaller photosynthesis rate caused by the herbivory.

Materials and Methods:
The seeds of R. raphanistrum were used during the experiment. And the provided dirt in which the seeds were planted were separated into 6 containers of the same size. Each container was given exactly 12 radish seeds. After being put into each container, each group of seeds was added 50mL of a specific kind of fertilizer called Miracle Gro (38mL/10g) to even boost the growth the growth rate. And each dirt was stirred thoroughly for the seeds to distribute evenly in the soil and for the fertilizer to mix thoroughly with the dirt and the seeds. Then, half of the groups were labeled as control groups and the other half was labeled as experimental groups. Both groups of radish were put into a greenhouse and watered each day with to ensure that the soil in each container was moist enough so the basic requirements for normal growth of the plants are met. After one week of growth, all of the leaves of the radishes in three experimental groups were punctuated with one hole each. And after another week of growth, the weights and lengths of shoots and roots of the radishes in both groups were collected. Two sampled T-test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between two sets of data obtained.  


Results:
According to the results of the two-sampled T-Test, there was no significant difference between R:S(Mass) results in the experimental (M=0.365, SD=0.167) and the control (M=0.346, SD=0.0542) conditions; t(4)=0.185, p=0.862. 
And also, there was no significant difference between R:S(Length) results in the experimental (M= 1.72, SD=0,191) and the control (M=1.44, SD=0.148) groups; t(4)=2.02, p=0.112.

Discussion:
From the T-Test results obtained, they showed that there was no significant difference between the roots to shoots ratios, both in mass and length, which indicated that the results didn’t support the hypothesis stated earlier that the plants affected by more herbivory activities would have more shoots than roots (smaller R:S ratio). While in other similar experiments that focus on plant resource allocations, other experimenters show that fertilization and competition do have some effects on plant biomass allocation – unfertilized plants under competition stress, which have less nitrogen concentration, tend to store higher concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates than unfertilized plants without competition and fertilized plants with or without competition (Janeček et al., 2014). What’s more, one of the studies also shows that a combination of SO2 fumigation and decreasing nitrate availability will change the allocation strategies of radish. In this study, SO2 has been proved to inhibit radish plants’ ability to respond to decreasing nitrogen concentrations (Coleman, Mooney, & Gorham, 1989). 
Although there is a possibility that herbivory may not be the important factor that affect plant resource allocation, I think the reason that I didn’t get significantly different results from my experiment may due to some errors of performing the experiment. For example, the holes punctuated in each leave, which are used to mimic herbivory behaviors, may not be abundant or big enough to make a difference on the results, and that the time for growth is not long enough for the two groups to become distinct from one another. And the time that we perform herbivory to the plants may be too late to make an effect because plants’ allocation strategies may not be affected anymore after their initial growth stage(Bazzaz & Grace, 1997). In addition, there are only 3 sets of data for each group, which means the data may not be abundant enough to yield a more consistent result. And when measuring the weights and lengths of the shoots and roots, the plant may not be separated fully, causing he inconsistency of final result as well. So future improvements of the experiment can be: having more samples and repeating the experiment for at least three times so that the potential errors will be reduced, and having more holes punctuated on the laves of the plants.
