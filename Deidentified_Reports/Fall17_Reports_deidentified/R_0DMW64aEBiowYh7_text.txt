Title: The Role of Lanthanum Chloride in the Contraction of the Rania Pipien Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
	The primary objective of this lab was to determine the effect of lanthanum chloride, a calcium blocker, on the threshold voltage of muscle contractions in Rania Pipien leg muscles. The gastrocnemus muscle of three frog legs were prepared and then stimulated by electrode pins connected to a force transducer. A software program on the computer recorded a myogram for each registered contraction. The threshold voltage and amplitude for each frog leg were recorded before and after the injection of 2mM of lanthanum chloride. The results collected between the two groups resulted in a p value of 0.5 and a paired t_test value of 0. The results showed that there is no significent difference between the controlll and treatment group, thus the hypothesis was not supported. Therefore, lanthanum chloride did not significently affect calcium and its role in the contraction of muscles.


Introduction:
In this lab, we studied the effect that calcium has on muscle contractions by injecting 2mM of lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania Pipien leg. This specie was a good model organism for this experiment because the preparation of the leg is quick and the gastrocnemus muscle can be easily observed and separated from the leg. Skeletal muscles in both vertebrates and invertebrates consist of thousands of myofibers which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells. The individual myofibers are bound together by connective tissues to form functional groups which are the skeletal muscles proper.  Several steps are involved in the contraction of a muscle. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons with axons that extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Acetylcholine binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential travels down the t tubules and activates the DHP voltage receptor. The DHP shape change causes the attached ryanodine receptor to also change shape, thus releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium then travels to the myosin where it binds to troponin. The act of calcium binding to troponin causes a shape change that pulls the tropomyosin off of the binding site for actin. The muscle then can contract as actin pulls on the myosin and then unbinds. This action will continue to happen until all the calcium has ran out. This is where the lanthanum chloride comes into play. Several studies support that extracellular calcium plays a great role on the contractions of muscles. One study ran a similar experiment to test the effect of different calcium channel blockers including lanthanum chloride on muscle contractions. The results found that lanthanum chloride successfully blocked extracellular calcium and inhibited muscle contractions by 90%. [Glusa: 1987].
Due to what is known about muscle contractions and the role that calcium plays in it, we believe that if 2mM of lanthanum chloride, a known calcium channel blocker, are injected into the frog leg muscle, then the threshold level for muscle contractions will increase since the calcium channels will be blocked. Therefore, a greater stimulus, or a higher voltage, will be needed for a contraction to occur and be recorded on the myogram. 


Materials and Method:
Before the lab starts, download the LabScribe software that will be used to record the muscle contractions. To start the lab, one must first prepare the three frog legs on the dissecting pan. Using forceps, grasp the skin at the top of the leg and pull down to the foot until the skin is completely separated from the leg. Using a dissecting probe, gently separate the inner thigh muscles beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. This will reveal the white sciatic nerve and accompanying blood vessels. Carefully and gently free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue using forceps and a dissecting needle. Using scissors, cut the gastrocnemus muscle at the knee and tie a string around the end of it. Throughout the experiment, keep the frog muscle and the sciatic nerve moist with frog Ringer’s solution. Take one of the three frog legs and attach the string to the stand so that there is tension in the string and the gastrocnemus muscle is vertical. Connect the BCN connector of the pin electrodes to the force transducer. Next, puncture the gastrocnemus muscle with two electrode pins used for direct stimulation of the muscle. Using the software, begin by sending a .1V stimulus into the frog leg and record the results. Increase the voltage by .1V until a response is observed. This response will indicate the threshold of the frog. Once the threshold is found, use a needle to inject 2mM of lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg. Wait 10 minutes for the chemical to influence the muscle. After 10 minutes, send a .1V stimulus into the frog leg and record the results. Again, increase the voltage by .1V until a response is observed. Follow the same procedure for the other two frog legs and record all of the results. Use a paired t_test to determine if the results are significent.


Results:
The first experimental leg showed an increase in threshold by .2V and a decrease in amplitude by .025amps. The second experimental leg had no change in threshold, staying at .4V, but the experimental leg increased in amplitude by .054 amps. Lastly, the third experimental leg was seen to decrease in threshold by .2V and an increase in amplitude by 0.128amps. Using a paired t_test, it was found that the mean threshold voltage of the controlll group was not significently greater than the mean of the treatment group (t_stat = 0, d.f. = 2, P = 0.5). The sample mean of the data was 0.


Discussion:
	In this experiment, it was hypothesized that if 2mM of lanthanum chloride, a known calcium channel blocker, are injected into the frog leg muscle, then the threshold level for muscle contractions will increase since the calcium channels will be blocked. It was believed that there would be an increase in threshold due to the major role calcium plays on muscle contractions and based off of studies conducted with calcium channel blockers. In one study, the effect of dantrolene, a ryanodine receptor inhibitor, was shown to inhibit muscle contractions. [Nasledov: 2007]. Since ryanodine causes the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it makes sense that blocking the ryanodine receptor would lead to a blocking of extracellular calcium and thus an inhibition of muscle contractions. 
In comparing the experimental group to the controlll group: the first experimental leg had an increase in threshold by .2V and a decrease in amplitude by .025amps, the second experimental leg had no change in threshold and an increase in amplitude by .054 amps, and the third experimental leg had a decrease in threshold by .2V and an increase in amplitude by 0.128amps. While the first leg seemed to support the hypothesis of a decrease in threshold, the other two legs did not show the same trend. Overall, this data did not support the alternative hypothesis as the p value found was 0.5. Since this p value is not less than 0.05, these results are statistically insignificent. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis meaning there is no significent difference between the controlll and the treatment group. 
 There are several factors that could explain why the experiment did not support the hypothesis. One possible reason behind this outcome is that the calcium could have come from a different channel that the lanthanum chloride did not block. In that case, there would still be extracellular calcium to bind to the troponin and allow the muscle to contract. Further, there could have been some human error in the experiment. The placement of the pins on the frog muscle could have affected the results as the electrode pins do not always give the most accurate data unless placed in the right spot. Lastly it is possible that the amount of lanthanum chloride used was not enough to have a noticeable effect. Due to the variability of the results for each frog leg, the results of this experiment may be viewed as an outlier to the other experiments that support the inhibiting effect of calcium channel blockers on muscle contractions. Future studies could include testing the effect of lanthanum chloride on voltage level that causes tetanus.
