Title: The effect of lidocaine on gastrocnemius muscle response in Rana pipiens 

Abstract:
Neuromuscular control is important in our understanding of how the muscular and nervous systems work together to generate movement. This study analyzed the effects of lidocaine on threshold voltage to muscle response and strength of muscle contraction determined by the voltage of the response observed in Rana pipiens. It was expected that if R. pipiens leg muscle is injected with lidocaine, we expect that the threshold required to produce a stimulus response will be higher compared to not injecting lidocaine; additionally, it was expected that the stimulus response in lidocaine-injected muscle will be lower than non-lidocaine-injected muscle. The sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscles of three R. pipiens were isolated and stimulated pre- and post-lidocaine injection. The results showed no statistically significant difference in threshold voltage, but a statistically significant lower muscle response strength in lidocaine-treated muscle. This experiment confirmed what was previously known in other studies that lidocaine decreases the calcium ion concentration by inhibiting the influx of extracellular calcium ions and the ACh-induced release of stored calcium ions, as well blocking sodium channels, preventing the neuron from generating an action potential.

Introduction:
The nervous system and muscles in vertebrates and invertebrates work together to generate movement in the organism. There are many aspects of neuromuscular control that explain how muscles respond to a signal, and this experiment explores an aspect of neuromuscular control known as excitation-contraction coupling. The system begins working when nerve impulses reach the neuromuscular junction, causing the release of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), which binds its receptors to receptors on the membrane of the muscle. This action results in opening up the sodium channels, which generates an action potential in the muscle. This action potential stimulates the release of calcium ions from the internal storage sites and activates the contractile mechanism in the muscle, causing it to shorten [BIO114 Laboratory Manuel: 2017].
	In order to explore how this excitation-contraction coupling mechanism works, we used the leg of the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens. We chose this study organism because its neuromuscular control system functions similarly to humans and we could easily isolate and study interaction between the major and nerve and muscle in the leg of R. pipiens. By isolating the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle, we can send pulses to the sciatic nerve to make the gastrocnemius muscle twitch. This action can be described by the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism described previously. 
In this experiment, we injected lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle of R. pipiens to determine the effects of lidocaine on the response of the muscle. Lidocaine is an anesthetic that causes temporary numbness and loss of feeling in the skin. A 2010 study showed that lidocaine caused the rat’s tracheal smooth muscle to relax – a low dosage caused slight decrease in contraction and higher doses caused the muscle to relax more quickly [Kao: 2010]. A 1993 study describes how the effects of lidocaine work mechanistically on intracellular calcium ion in smooth muscle airway: lidocaine relaxes the airway smooth muscle by decreased calcium ion concentration. It does so by inhibiting the influx of extracellular calcium ions and inhibiting the ACh-induced release of stored calcium ions [Kai: 1993]. 
	Thus, if R. pipiens leg muscle is injected with lidocaine, we expect that the threshold (in volts) required to produce a stimulus response will be higher compared to not injecting lidocaine. We also expect that the stimulus response in lidocaine-injected muscle will be lower than non-lidocaine-injected muscle.

Materials and Methods:
Isolating Nerve and Muscle	
We isolated the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle of R. pipiens taking care not touch the sciatic nerve to any metal and detaching the gastrocnemius muscle from the bottom of the leg. the leg was pinned to the dissecting trey. The muscle was hung from the apparatus with string and was tied such that the muscle was taught. A sleeve was placed sound the sciatic nerve and connected to the box that would send the impulses to the nerve and cause the muscle to twitch. The test subject was maintained in Ringer solution so that it would not dry and be able to conduct the current to stimulate the nerve and muscle. 
Inducing a Response
The box that connected the sleeve attached to the sciatic nerve was connected to a laptop. The computer program iWorx on the laptop was used to send and monitor impulses. The settings were set as follows: Pulse amplitude (Amp) set to 0.000V; number of pulses (#pulses) set to 1; Frequency (F(Hz)) set to 1, and pulse width (W) set to 5ms. The Amp setting was changed to determine threshold: we used 0.0V, 0.1V, 0.2V, 0.3V, 0.4V, and 0.5V. 
Addition of Lidocaine
Three R. pipiens legs were used in this experiment. A response was induced in the leg and the results were recorded. The muscle was then injected with 2mL of 25mM lidocaine. After 5 minutes, a response was induced in the leg once again and the results were recorded. The procedure was followed for each leg. This way we were able to test the effects of lidocaine compared to untreated muscle response. 
Stimulus Response
The stimulus response was recorded as the “Voltage Out” which corresponded to the strength of the contraction. This was recorded by measuring the difference in the peak right before the response and at the maximal peak. The strength of the contraction was measured in volts. 
Statistical Analysis 
In order to test if the results are significant, a paired-two-sample t-test was applied to the threshold and “Voltage Out” data. We determined if there were significant differences between the threshold voltage required to elicit a response in the muscle and if there were significant differences between the strength of the muscle contraction between untreated (– lidocaine) and treated (+ lidocaine) R. pipiens muscle.

Results:
Threshold 
The threshold to response was recorded for each leg before and after treatment of lidocaine. The threshold to response for each leg before treatment was at amplitude 0.2 volts, with an average om 0.2V. The threshold to response for each leg after treatment was at amplitude 0.3 volts for frogs A and C, and 0.2 volts for frog B, with an average of 0.27V (Table 1). There was no statistically significant difference in voltage required to induce a response in pre-treated and post-treated R. pipiens muscle (p=0.18).
Strength of Muscle Response
The average strength of muscle contraction increased up to 0.659V with increasing amplitude for untreated R. pipiens muscle. The average strength increased up to 0.085V for lidocaine-treated R. pipiens muscle. There was no stimulus response at an amplitude lower than 0.2V for the untreated group. There was a very small to no stimulus response at an amplitude lower than 0.3V for the treated group (Figure 1). There was a statistically significant difference in the strength of muscle contraction between the untreated and lidocaine-treated groups (p=0.034).

Discussion:
Threshold 
The trend in threshold voltage required to elicit a response in the gastrocnemius muscle suggests that lidocaine has the effect of increasing the amount of voltage required to stimulate a response. The average threshold for lidocaine-treated R. pipiens muscle stimulation was higher by about 0.07V compared to untreated. However, there was no statistically significant difference in threshold voltage as previously expected. There are several explanations for these results. The amount of lidocaine used may not have been sufficient enough to cause a great difference in the amount of stimulation required to elicit an initial response. Previous studies have emphasized that the dosage, both amount and concentration, of lidocaine is an important factor in the ultimate response of the muscle. The 2010 Kao study used concentrations of 1mM and 40mM lidocaine, and our study used 25mM lidocaine [Kao: 2010]. If we had used a stronger concentration, it may very well have induced more numbness in the muscle and thus would have required a stronger voltage stimulation to make the muscle contract. Perhaps it would be interesting to determine how different concentrations or different amounts (at the same concentration) significantly affect the threshold voltage required to make the muscle contract. Another factor that could have affected the results is the amount of time we waited to perform the stimulations after injecting the muscle with lidocaine. We only five minutes, and the results might have been different if we had waited 10, 15, or even 20 minutes. This would allow for the muscle to more significantly decrease calcium ion concentration by allowing for more time in inhibit the influx of extracellular calcium ions as described previously [Kai: 1993]. This could be another potential aspect for future studies. 
Strength of Muscle Contraction
There was a statistically significant difference in the strength of muscle contraction between the untreated and lidocaine-treated groups (p=0.034). The strength of muscle contraction for untreated R. pipiens muscle was significantly higher than the strength of muscle contraction for lidocaine-treated R. pipiens muscle. This result is what we expected and aligns with results from previous studies that have shown that lidocaine causes muscles to relax. The strength of muscle contraction is effected by lidocaine because lidocaine causes the calcium ion concentration in the muscle to decrease by inhibiting the influx of extracellular calcium ions and inhibiting the ACh-induced release of stored calcium ions. Lidocaine is also known as a sodium channel blocker, so it also works by preventing the sodium channels from opening up to generate the action potential in the muscle [Cummins: 2007]. Biological systems are not perfect systems and lidocaine is not a perfect, so there will still be action potentials, but they will be reduced, causing the strength of the response we observe to be lower. It would be interesting to further this study by examining different muscles in different parts of the body and how they interact with lidocaine. This has important implications for humans because lidocaine is frequently used for minor operations like removing splints or inserting stitches, or even to remove discomfort in irritated parts of the body.
