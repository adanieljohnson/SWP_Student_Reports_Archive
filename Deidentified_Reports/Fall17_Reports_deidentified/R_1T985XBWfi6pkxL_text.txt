Title: Changing Temperature and Its Effect on Photosynthesis in the Enriched Chloroplasts of Strawberry Leaves

Abstract:
In this experiment the effect of changing temperature on photosynthesis in enriched strawberry leaf (Fragaria ananassa) chloroplasts was observed. The strawberry leaf chloroplasts were placed into three different temperatures: a hot bath at 35 degrees Celsius, room temperature 23 degrees Celsius, and an ice bath at relatively 0 degrees Celsius. It was predicted that the chloroplast kept in the hot bath would have the highest absorbance readings compared to the other experimental groups. The light absorbance was recorded at time zero, at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes for each experimental group.  An ANOVA test was performed to show the significance between the mean values between each group. A Tukey Kramer Test was used to show further correlation between the means, and the results of the test showed that the majority of the means did not reject the null hypothesis meaning there was not significant variance between the values. The results concluded that the greatest amount of light absorbance was recorded in the chloroplasts that experienced the cold temperatures. This result could have been due to the fact that strawberry plants experience the highest levels of photosynthesis in temperatures ranging from -6 degrees Celsius to 29 degrees Celsius. 

Introduction:
In photosynthesizing organisms like plants light is key to driving the reaction of photosynthesis. Temperature can potentially have a significant effect on the photosynthetic activity in plants. Strawberry plants grow and photosynthesize best when grown in areas with full sun at least six hours per day with uniform temperatures. Day-neutral strawberries will flower, produce strawberries, and show the highest levels of photosynthesis at temperatures ranging from 20C to 29C. Strawberry plants can tolerate temperatures as low as -6C, but ultimately will stop photosynthesizing or die at -12C. (Haifa, 2014) In this experiment photosynthesis will be observed in strawberry leaves at 35C in a hot bath, at 23C room temperature, and cooled at 0C in an ice bath. Higher temperatures have been correlated to an increase uptake of carbon dioxide and this will contribute to photosynthetic gain in the strawberry leaves. Maximum photosynthetic effect has been seen more often in areas of higher temperature than in areas of lower temperature. (Long,1991). If enriched chloroplasts from strawberry leaves are placed in three different temperatures ranging from hot, room temperature, and cold, then the highest levels of photosynthesis will be seen in the hot temperature. The amount of light was kept constant for each experimental group. The positive control was the test tube with no chloroplasts in the solution. The negative control was the blank test tube with no DCPIP in it in order to zero the light absorbance readings. The independent variable was temperature and the dependent variable was the amount of light absorbed in the photospectrometer.

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment strawberry leaves were obtained from a local strawberry farm and stored until they were needed for the experiment. In the lab a mortar and pestle, a medium sized beaker, and 3, 50 ml centrifuge tubes were packed with ice and cooled. The central veins were removed from 6 strawberry leaves , and the leaves were rinsed and dried. Next the leaves were cut into smaller pieces in order to grind them more finely. The mortar and pestle were dried and the leaves were placed inside with 10 ml of grinding buffer. The leaves were ground until it reached a paste-like consistency. Once it had reached a paste form 10 ml of grinding buffer was added to the mixture again. The liquid was then strained through cheesecloth into the chilled beaker to remove excess leaf debris. The liquid was then transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube labeled "A" and spun at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius with a balancing tube in the centrifuge. After centrifugation the supernatant was poured into another 50 ml centrifuge tube mark "B". Tube "B" was then centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant from tube "B" was poured into the third centrifuge tube marked "C". The pellet at the bottom of tube "B" was not disturbed or poured into tube "C". 20 ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet in tube ''B", mixed gently, and placed in ice. Next 11 test tubes were labeled 0-10. Each experimental group and the no chloroplast sample had three replicates prepared with 6ml of water, 2 ml of 130mM DCPIP, and 2ml of reaction buffer. The blank test tube contained 8ml of water, no DCPIP, and 2ml of reaction buffer.  Next 11 cuvettes were labeled 0-10. 100 micro liters of chloroplasts were added to the blank and tubes 1-9. Each tube was mixed immediately. The spectophotometer was set using the blank prepared in order to take the absorbance of each solution. Each tubes absorbance was recorded for time zero. Next the tubes were put into their designated temperatures. Tubes 1-3 were placed in the hot bath, tubes 4-6 were placed in the ice bath, and tubes 0 and 7-10 were kept at room temperature. fro ten minutes. After the ten minutes the absorbance was recorded for each tube again. This incubation time of 10 minutes and absorbance recording was repeated twice more until a total time of 30 minutes was reached. The average of each experimental group and the positive control were calculated. The percent change for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes from time zero were also calculated. 

Results:
The results show that the highest level of absorbance and photosynthesis levels was the ice bath samples that were kept at a temperature relatively close to 0 degrees celsius. This rejected the original experimental hypothesis. An Anova statistical test and a Turkey Kramer test were performed to show the relationship between the means of each experimental group at the three different time intervals. The data showed that the majority of the experimental groups accepted the null hypothesis , meaning that there was no significant difference between the means of cold, hot, and room temperature chloroplasts at each time interval. 



Discussion:
The results showed that the ice bath samples had the highest levels of absorbance which rejects the original experimental hypothesis. Although the difference was marginal, the cold temperatures still showed the highest levels of photosynthetic activity. It was later established that the critical temperature range for strawberry growth inhibition is between 35 - 40 degrees Celsius. (Kadir,2016) These results could be due to a number of factors. From an experimental observation in lab the spectrophotometer experienced absorbance reading issues when cold cuvettes were placed in the device. The fogging caused by the cold solution could have caused the spectrophotometer to record inaccurate amounts of light absorbance. The foggy cuvette caused the readings on the spectrophotometer to continuously rise which forced us to make an estimate on what we presumed the absorbance reading was for that specific solution. Another factor could have been the photosynthetic temperature range of strawberry plants which is between -6 degrees and 29 degrees Celsius for optimum activity, and our hot bath was 35 degrees Celsius which falls outside of the range. It could have been too warm for the strawberry chloroplasts to absorb light at maximum levels. This experiment can be adapted to test other forms of flora. A study done by James A. Marsh Jr. and his colleagues at the University of Chicago studied effects of temperature on the photosynthesis and respiration in eelgrass. Their results showed that the eelgrass kept in hotter temperatures photosynthesized at greater rates than that of the cold temperature eelgrass. (Niu,2012) Their results prove the original hypothesis, but this was probably due to there use of a more hot temperature adapted plant. In a time where climate change is a popular topic of discussion, studying how temperature effects photosynthetic rates in plants will become very important to understanding and identifying other environmental issues in the future.

Figure Legends: 
Table 1: Table 1 shows the experimental groups and their average absorbance readings along with the percent change over time. 

Figure 2: Figure 2 shows the absorbance levels of each experimental group at each time interval. As seen from the data negating the data collected by the test tube with no chloroplast the ice bath test tubes had the highest absorbance levels of all of the experimental groups.

Figure 3: The ANOVA Test and The Turkey Kramer test show the relationship between the means of each experimental group and its coinciding time interval. The ANOVA and the Turkey Kramer tests showed that the means accepted the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis states the means had no significant differences between the values for the majority of the data. 

Figure 4: Figure 4 shows the details of the Turkey Kramer test. It shows that the majority of the means have no significance between the two means.
