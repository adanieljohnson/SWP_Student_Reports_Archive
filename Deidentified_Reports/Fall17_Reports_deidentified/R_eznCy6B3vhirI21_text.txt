Title: The Effects of Aggression on the Metabolic Rate of Procambris sp. Crayfish

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to measure the metabolic rate of crayfish underwater while in the presence of another crayfish. We wanted to see if there was a difference in specific metabolic rates in the Procambris sp. crayfish when alone versus when in the presence of another crayfish. Over a span of twenty minutes, dissolved oxygen levels in the crayfish environment were tracked in order to calculate the specific metabolic rates. In a study similar to the one that was conducted, it was concluded that higher metabolic rates were directly related to an increased level of consumption of oxygen. Based off of these conclusions, we hypothesized that the smaller and less dominant or aggressive crayfish will experience a higher metabolic rate when the larger crayfish is present. To determine this, we used a paired t_test to calculate the difference in specific metabolic rate. From this paired t_test, the p_value was calculated to be about 0.174, not supporting our hypothesis, but supporting our null hypothesis instead. 

Introduction:
The goal of this week’s lab was to measure the metabolic rate of crayfish underwater while in the presence of another crayfish. The scientific name of the crayfish is Procambris sp. These crustaceans live in freshwater environments and are native to the eastern United States and Canada. Metabolism is defined as the process by which the body breaks down and converts food into energy. Oxygen consumption can be used to determine the specific metabolic rate of an organism over a period of time. In a study, similar to the one we will be conducting, K.A. Sloman found that the metabolic rate of brown trout, Salmo trutta, increased as a result of being in the presence of another Salmo trutta fish [Sloman et al: 2000]. We will conduct a similar experiment, but with the use of a different organism, a Procambris sp. crayfish. We will compare the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish when they are alone versus when they are in the presence of another, larger crayfish. These crayfish were selected for this experiment because of their small size and ease of use in a lab. In order to calculate the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish, the dissolved oxygen levels will be tracked and recorded. The volume of the water in which the crayfish will be tested in will be kept constant at the same volume throughout the experiment. Based off of K.A. Sloman’s conclusions and findings, we hypothesize that the introduction of another crayfish will ultimately increase the specific metabolic rate compared to when the crayfish will be kept alone. The specific metabolic rate will be higher when the crayfish is introduced to the other crayfish. 

Materials and Method:
Today, we will be measuring oxygen consumption using different sized crayfish, a small and a large crayfish. The experiment will be conducted in relatively room temperature water (22℃). First, we will obtain a mass of each crayfish by weighing them separately on a scale and then place them into the test chamber which has been filled with the room temperature water and saturated with air. However, the small crayfish will be placed in a smaller chamber within the larger chamber that has the larger crayfish. The smaller chamber will be clear so the two crayfish are visible to each other, but will prevent physical contact between them. We will ensure that the top of the test chamber is tightly screwed on so no air can escape. Next, oxygen meters will be used to measure dissolved oxygen in mg/L. The oxygen concentrations will be observed every five minutes, for twenty minutes. The volume of the water which the crayfish will be tested in will be kept constant. This volume of water will also be measured and recorded. Once the twenty minutes have elapsed with the presence of the other or larger crayfish, the large crayfish will be removed from the chamber and we will conduct the same procedure with the small crayfish without the presence of the large one. This procedure will be repeated one more time with two more crayfish. A paired t_test will be used to determine the statistical significance of the introduction of another crayfish on overall metabolic rates. 

Results:
Over twenty-minute time periods, three crayfish were tested per each group. The average specific metabolic rate of the controlll group (isolated) was approximately 0.000657 that had a calculated standard deviation of about 0.000259. The average specific metabolic rate of the experimental group (aggressed) was calculated to be about 0.000233 with a standard deviation of about 0.0000652. It was actually observed that there was a higher specific metabolic rate in the crayfish that were kept separately or alone. One thing we found rather interesting and peculiar was that when the crayfish were introduced to each other, they seemed to not care at all. The larger crayfish was often observed to move into a corner away from the other crayfish. 

Discussion:
In the end, our calculated p_value of 0.174 was not sufficient or significent enough to support our original hypothesis. However, the null hypothesis that the introduction of another crayfish will have little to no difference in specific metabolic rate was supported. The data we collected contradicts the findings and conclusions of Sloman’s study. The introduction of another crayfish was found to actually decrease or reduce the specific metabolic rates. We believe this could have been due to the fact that when the crayfish were introduced to each other, there was no interaction between them, as the larger crayfish always found itself in a corner facing the opposite direction of the other crayfish. 
For future study, we might try stimulating the crayfish to interact with each other, as the crayfish had very little reaction in our study. This should ultimately lead to better conclusions and data. Another possibility we could consider is the use or implementation of more crayfish into the chamber, increasing the chance of interaction.
