Title: Observations of the Effects of Temperature on Photosynthesis in Kale

Abstract:
The effect of temperature variation on photosynthetic activity was studied in kale. The rate of activity was determined using the percent change in the absorbances of chloroplast solutions combined with DCPIP, which is directly related to photosynthetic activity. It was hypothesized that the activity would be at its best at 0ºC. This experiment involved centrifuging a kale leaf to extract and enrich its chloroplasts and proceeding to react the chloroplasts with DCPIP in temperatures ranging from -10ºC to 50ºC. Initial absorbances were obtained before placing the chloroplasts in the varying temperatures under the same amount of light. Two more absorbance measurements were taken over a period of 30 minutes. The general trend showed that the chloroplasts at 35ºC had the most significant increase in activity. The ANOVA test, however, revealed that these results were insignificant. 

Introduction:
This experiment will determine the effects of varied temperatures on photosynthetic ability in the chloroplasts in kale. Water baths and ice buckets will be utilized to alter the temperature of the chloroplasts during their reaction with light. The effects of temperature on plants have been studied for both scientific and agricultural purposes. A study done by the American Society of Plant Biologists report that "starch grains in the chloroplasts rapidly reduce in size when chilling stress is applied" [Taylor and Craig: 1971]. At the same time, "Photosystem-II-mediated electron transport is particularly susceptible to heat-stress" [Quinn and Williams: 1986]. Kale specifically has made itself pretty popular due to its ability to withstand frost. A study done on spinach thylakoids revealed that when frozen, the thylakoids "were unable to form a light induced proton gradient" [Steponkus, Garber, Meyers, and Lineberger: 1977]. Therefore, there is no shortage of conflicting research on this discussion. However, because of the kale-specific ability to thrive during the winter months, it is hypothesized that the kale chloroplasts will show the most activity at 0ºC.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment began with the preparation of samples made up of the extracted kale chloroplasts. The first step required that most of the equipment used be chilled in an ice bucket. This included mortar and pestle, a 200 mL beaker, and 3 centrifuge tubes. A large kale leaf was deveined and torn into small pieces. The pieces were then rinsed with water and blotted dry. The pieces were placed into a cooled mortar, followed by 10 mL of cool 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer. The spinach was grinded into a thick paste, eliminating all large chunks. 10 more mL of grinding buffer was added and mixed in with the paste. The mixture was then strained through 3 layers of cheesecloth into the beaker. The liquid was placed in a centrifuge tube marked 'Kale mixture'. The mixture was spun at 200×G for 3 minutes at 4ºC. The liquid was then centrifuged twice more in order to obtain the pellet from the mixture. The pellet was then placed in a centrifuge tube, to which 20 mL of grinding buffer was added. The pellet was gently resuspended with a transfer pipet. Fifteen large test tubes were washed and labeled. The same mixture was added to every tube except for the blank. Tubes 1-15 received 6 mL distilled water, 2 mL 130 mm DCPIP, 100  L of enriched chloroplasts, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The blank tube received a mixture of 8 mL distilled water, 100  L of enriched chloroplasts, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The tubes were gently swirled to induce mixing. Small samples of each tube were poured into cuvettes and initial absorbance measurements were taken using the spectrophotometer. The tubes were then placed into environments that varied greatly in their temperatures. The blank tube was left in the test tube rack at room temperature, 23.3ºC. Tubes 1-3 were placed in an ice bucket that had been prepared with salt to lower the temperature of the ice. A thermometer revealed the temperature in this environment was -10ºC. Tubes 4-6 were placed into a separate ice bucket with no salt, measured to be 0ºC. Tubes 7-9 were left in a test tube rack at room temperature, 23.3ºC. Tubes 10-12 were placed in a test tube rack that was contained in a water bath set to 35ºC. Tubes 13-15 were placed in another water bath, this one set to 50ºC. Desk lamps containing the same bulbs were placed directly above each set of tubes. Every ten minutes for the next 30 minutes, the test tubes were emptied into cuvettes and the absorbance was measured. The final data was statistically tested using an ANOVA.  

Results:
The results of this experiment were graphed to show time vs. the percent change in absorbance of the chloroplast solutions. The interpretation of these results can be found in the discussion.

Discussion:
The average percent change of the absorbances over 30 minutes revealed that the chloroplasts were at their maximum photosynthetic activity at 35ºC. The ANOVA, however, gave a p value of 0.797, rendering the results insignificant and supporting the null hypothesis. This is most likely because of the short time frame. "The photosynthetic response of plants to low temperature is dependent upon time of exposure" [Huner, Oquist, Hurry, Krol, Falk, and Griffitth: 1993.] This makes sense because plants usually grow in seasons that last longer than 30 minutes. If the experiment had been run for a longer period of time, more significant results would have been obtained.
