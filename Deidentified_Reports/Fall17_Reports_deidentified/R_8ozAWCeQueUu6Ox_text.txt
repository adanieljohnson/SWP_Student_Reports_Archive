Title: Effect of Tank Size on Betta Fish Behavior

Abstract:
Studying behavior in animals can help relate to the human world and provide more understanding into how evolution may impact behavior. Observing behavioral patterns helps in things like animal training and understanding human behavior. Our experiment observed the aggressive behavior of male Betta fish, Betta splendins, in a variety of settings to understand how their surrounding environment may impact their behavior. We hypothesized that the less space the fish were given, the more time they would spend displaying aggressive behavior. Ultimately, our data did not support our hypothesis as there was not a significent change in time spent displaying aggressive behavior in different tank sizes. 

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of behavior of animals in their environments. Ethology is important for its real world applications of how animal behavior relates to evolution, human characteristics, and what this means for the surrounding world. In our experiment, we used Betta fish, Betta splendins, in different environments and exposed to other Bettas. Noam Miller’s work in Cognition in Fishes shows that fish are seen as “model species” for their different cognitive and social behaviors and norms [Miller: 2017]. This is why our experiment focuses on fish. Additionally, Bettas exhibit distinct physical displays of aggression which can be quantified and interpreted, as we did in our experiment [Johnson: 2017]. In our experiment, we observed the behavior of male Bettas in the presence of another male Betta in different sized tank settings to see differences in behavior. We hypothesized that when the fish were given more space, they would show aggressive behavior for less time. 


Materials and Method:
Our experiment used only male Betta fish. The two fish were placed in a medium sized tank separated by an opaque divider, so the fish could neither see nor swim to each other. We removed the opaque partition and timed the fish for five minutes. We quantified their behavior by timing the amount of time they displayed aggressive behavior, namely the flaring of their operculum. We would begin timing as soon as the operculum became erect and stop timing any time that it went down. After the five minutes was over, we would replace the opaque partition in between them and allow for five minutes to rest so that the fish would not habituate. We then replicated the same situation three ties for the medium tank, which serves as our controlll. We then replicated the experiment with a large tank and again with a small tank. 

Results:
This table displays the time in seconds that each of our two fish spent displaying aggressive action for each of our three tank sizes. The mean and standard deviation are broken up by tank size rather than fish to discuss differences in tank size rather than individual fish behavior. The mean of the small tank aggressive behavior time in seconds was 9.33 ± 8.49. The medium tank mean was 22.84 ± 32.29. The Large tank mean was 4.48 ± 3.84. Since our medium tank served as our controlll, we used two two-tailed two-sample t_tests against the controlll to test for significance. The mean of the controlll group (medium tank) was not statistically significently different from that of the small tank (t_stat = 0.87, d.f. = 10, P = 0.40). Similarly, the mean of the controlll was not statistically significently different than that of the large tank (t_stat = 1.28, d.f. = 10, P = 0.23). 


Discussion:
Our data did not support our hypothesis. We hypothesized that the more space the fish were given, the less time they would spend displaying aggressive behavior. However, our data showed no significent difference in the amount of aggressive behavior displayed in the controlll compared to our experimental groups. This could be one of several factors. The fish could be all talk and no action type fish who will display aggressive behaviors but will ultimately avoid actual fighting under most all circumstances. We could have had two fish that were naturally a bit less aggressive, but it is most likely because the fish we were using had been doing the same experiment for many hours over the previous two weeks, and were either habituated to the situation or simply tired. In Teresa L. Dzieweczynski’s work, she argues that fish that are familiar with each other also may change their behavior towards one another compared to fish that have never encountered each other before, which could serve as an additional confounding variable in our data [Dzieweczynski: 2017]. Our experiment could have been improved by using more fish who have not done the experiment repeatedly.
