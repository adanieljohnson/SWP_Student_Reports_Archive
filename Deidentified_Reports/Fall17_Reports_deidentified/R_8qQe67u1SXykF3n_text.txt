Title: Nicotine’s Impact on Muscle Contractions in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Although the addictive nature of nicotine is well known, individuals across the country continue to metabolize this compound while using tobacco products. A better understanding of the effects of nicotine on various aspects of the body is needed in order to ensure all those consuming this chemical are educated about its impact. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether or not nicotine has an impact on muscular contractions. Because nicotine functions as an ACh agonist, it was hypothesized that it would have an impact on this value. After the threshold voltage of each leg of the Rana pipiens was determined, three trials with this voltage stimulus were performed to measure the force of muscle contractions at control and then three more were performed after nicotine supplementation to determine the force of muscular contraction with the ACh agonist. These values were then averaged. When paired t-tests were performed, the p-values were 0.002, 0.0, and 0.0 for legs 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Through this, it was determined that the data was statistically significant and that nicotine leads to an increase in the force of muscular contractions within the R. pipiens.


Introduction:
The number of Americans suffering from smoking related diseases is around 16 million (“Current Cigarette”, n.d.). With so many individuals suffering from the effects that tobacco products caused, an understanding of the impact that the addictive chemical, nicotine, has upon the body is necessary. Action potentials are electrochemical signals that stimulate responses of muscles. In order for these signals to be spread, a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine’s (ACh) must be released. When two ACh molecules are released by the postsynaptic membrane, they bind to a receptor in the postsynaptic membrane and a ligand-gated ion channel opens that allows sodium ions to enter that neuron. This influx of cations causes the postsynaptic cell to depolarize and the action potential is spread. In sum, ACh stimulates action potentials and is involved in propagating their signal from neuron to neuron. Additionally, in order for these action potentials to spread, the stimulus must reach a threshold voltage, generating an electrical current that spreads from neuron to neuron, ultimately stimulating muscular contractions. The force of these muscular contractions can be measured in volts. Some compounds function as agonists, which are molecules that are structurally similar to other molecules and that bind to the receptors of certain neurotransmitters and mimic their effects. An example of an agonist is nicotine, which is an ACh agonist (van der Oost, 2001).  In vertebrate muscles, such as the legs of the Rana pipiens used in this experiment, an increase in ACh or a chemical that binds to its receptors and generates a response would theoretically increase the force of muscular contractions. R. pipiens was chosen as the test organism due to its size, as it could be skinned and dissected without great difficulty. Its anatomy also made it a useful test subject, as the gastrocnemius muscle had was to right size so that the probe measuring the strength of contractions could be inserted. This muscle can be seen in Figure 1. We hypothesize that nicotine will have an effect on muscle amplitude because ACh is the neurotransmitter that stimulates muscles and an agonist mimics a response, so increased levels of a substance with a reaction similar to ACh would increase the force of muscle contractions. Thus, the independent variable in this experiment is the presence or absence of nicotine, while the dependent variable is the force of muscle contractions, measured in amplitude of voltage. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to properly perform this experiment, one must first acquire and skin three different frog legs. Once each leg is skinned, attach the probe to the gastrocnemius muscle of one leg. In order to determine the threshold of that leg inject stimulus at increments of 0.1 V using LabScribe software and the electrical probe. These electrical forces are stimulated by inputting the desired voltage into LabScribe and pressing record. Once the threshold voltage for an action potential is determined, inject this voltage into the leg three times. Record these values. Next, inject the gastrocnemius with 2 mL of 1 mg/ml nicotine. Next, inject the voltage previously found as the threshold voltage for that leg three times, recording the force of muscular contraction values. Repeat this process for the other two legs. Find the averages of both the control muscle amplitude and experimental muscle amplitude portions of each leg. Then preform a paired t-test comparing the force of contractions of the control group without nicotine and the experimental group supplemented with nicotine in order to determine if the data found was statistically significant. 


Results:
The muscle amplitudes of the gastrocnemius muscles did increase when supplemented with nicotine. The average experimental muscle amplitude of leg 1 was 0.216 volts compared to the 0.1303 volts generated as the average control muscle amplitude of leg 1. The average experimental muscle amplitude of leg 2 was 0.142 volts compared to the 0.0347 volts generated as the average control muscle amplitude of leg 2. The average experimental muscle amplitude of leg 3 was 0.168 volts compared to the 0.0397 volts generated as the average control muscle amplitude of leg 3. The average control muscle amplitude of all the legs is 0.0682 volts and the average experimental muscle amplitude of all the legs is 0.1753. The standard deviation of the control trial of leg 1 was 0.007 while the standard deviation of the experimental trial of leg 1 was 0.001. The standard deviation of the control trial of leg 2 was 0.0086 while the standard deviation of the experimental trial of leg 2 was 0.011. The standard deviation of the control trial of leg 3 was 0.001 while the standard deviation of the experimental trial of leg 3 was 0.00058. The p-value of leg 1 was 0.002. The p-values of legs 2 and 3 were both 0. Figures 3 and 4 show the significant increase in muscle amplitude, while Figure 1 shows a less drastic increase. 

Discussion:
These results did support the hypothesis that nicotine would change the force of muscle contractions when injected with the same voltage stimulus.  The increase in the force of muscle strength can be explained by nicotine’s chemical characteristics as an ACh agonist (Saldava, n.d., pp.941-955). ACh function as a crucial step within the neuromuscular junction, as it is a key component of the propagation of action potentials. When it binds to ligand-gated sodium ion channels on the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron, it increases the amount of sodium ions that depolarize the cell. Recent research has found that with nicotine supplemented, more molecules performing the same functions as ACh as nicotine functions as an Ach agonist. Additionally, it has been found that nicotine itself prompts the increase in the number of molecules of acetylcholine released (Carlisle, 2007). With more ACh and more molecules acting like ACh, more ion channels are opened and the neuron is able to depolarize more quickly. This faster depolarization generates a greater muscular response, as the response of muscles is dependent on the strength of the stimulus. Although the voltage of the initial stimulus in each leg was the same, the stimulus of neuronal depolarization increased in the strength of contraction with the addition of nicotine to the muscles. If this is considered in a system that’s more applicable to humans, smokers and those who metabolize nicotine through different sources could also experience an increase in the speed of neuronal depolarization and in turn muscle amplitude. This would be an interesting topic of future study, as the use of e-cigarettes is increasing nationwide. The implications of these future studies could prompt nicotine users to contemplate the impacts of their habits on their bodies, prior to the onset of serious medical conditions. Possible sources of error could include human error in the injection of nicotine or in the computer-based recording of muscle amplitude.
