Title: Effects of 200 mM Caffeine on the Leg Muslces of the Rania Pipiens Leads to Stonger Muscles Contractions 

Abstract:
Abstract-

Calcium is known to be an important component of muscle contraction as it plays a fundamental role within the filament sliding theory. In this experiment, contraction and calcium were at the center of study through the use of the Rania Piepien’s gastrocnemus muscle. This experiment strived to determine whether or not caffeine would increase the amount of Ca2+ in the muscle and therefore, lead to greater contraction. After stimulating the experimental legs (the legs prior to injecting them with caffeine) with one volt of current and then stimulating the same legs after having had injected them with caffeine via syringe (experimental group), they produced significently greater contractions. This supports the idea that caffeine leads to greater muscle contractions. 


Introduction:
Introduction-  

Muscle contraction is fundamental to living creatures as many physiological and behavior actions rely on this function. There are three major types of vertebrate muscle (skeletal, cardiac, and smooth). Skeletal muscle is responsible for voluntary movement, cardiac muscle is responsible for the beating of the heart, and smooth muscle is known for creating movement within hollow organs. Focusing on skeletal muscle, biologists have discovered that the contraction of this type of muscle can be explained through the sliding filament theory. The theory can be broken down into a simple process. First, the motor nerve stimulates an action potential, which stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca+2 into the muscle cell, which binds with troponin and allows actin to bind with myosin. Next, the ATP is re-synthesized, which allows the actin and myosin to maintain their strong binding conditions. Finally, calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum-- breaking the bond between the actin and the myosin and allowing for relaxation. 
Evidently, calcium plays a fundamental role in the contraction of muscles. In a 1968 report, two researchers (A.Weber and R. Herz) explore the effects of caffeine on muscle contraction. For their experiment, the researchers focused their attention on the gastrocnemus leg muscles of the Rania Pipiens and the bunny rabbit. After isolating the legs of the specimens, the researchers applied caffeine to the gastrocnemus of muscle of each specimen and observed for changes with regards to strength of contraction [Weber: 1968]. Concluding their experiment, the researched observed that those muscles, which had been treated with caffeine, also released more ionized calcium. The release of more Ca2+ was determined to be responsible for an increase in contraction regarding the gastrocnemus muscle for both the Rania Pipiens and the rabbit. 
This experiment is similar to our own as we wish to test the effects of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens. We will obtain three frog legs in which each will serve as the controlll and experimental group as we measure the degree of contraction (millivolts) of the legs before and after the injection of caffeine (0.1 millimeter of 200 mM). We will carry-out the experiment with the following experiment in mind: If we inject caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle group of the Rania Pipiens, then the amplitude of muscle contraction will increase.  


Materials and Method:
Materials and Method- 
The first materials required are the three frog legs, which have been completely severed from the body. Such were collected and skinned through the use of the hands, scissors and tissues. The leg muscles were completely visible and the gastrocnemus muscle was separated from the bone by sliding scissors up and down the bone and detaching it at the Achilles tendon.  Next, the inner thigh muscles which begin at the upper end and extend down to the knee were separated. Doing this allowed the sciatic nerve to become visible. The legs were kept moist with frog ringer. Next, the gastrocnemus muscle was tied with a string and suspended to the electrophysiology recording equipment. The leg was flat and pinned on the exam table with a string tied to the gastrocnemus muscle at 90 degrees relative to the table. The string connecting the gastrocnemus muscle was taut and kept sturdy. With the sciatic nerve exposed it was draped over the sleeve electrode of the electrophysiology (EP) recording equipment. Once the leg was properly set up, the electrophysiology (EP) recording equipment program was set to deliver 5 waves of 1.0 V of current to each leg. After this was done, each leg was injected with 0.1 milliliters of 200 mM of caffeine through the use of a syringe and then delivered with 5 more pulses of 1.0 V of current. The results were recorded using Labscribe and run through a paired t_test.


Results:
Results- A significent increase in contraction (measured in volts) was generated from the gastrocnemus muscles after the 200 mM Caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens (Figure 1).  Each of the three legs exhibited similar characteristics when serving as both the controlll and the experimental group. Each leg muscle experienced chemically induced tetany after having been injected with the 200 mM caffeine--the gastrocnemus muscle instantly stiffed up in each of the three trials and experienced fatigue. After having experienced such, the gastrocnemus become hard and plump. The muscles were round in shape and rich in color (pinkish/red).

The controlll group averaged 1.3 (mV) with a standard deviation of ±0.26. The experimental group averaged 1.7 (mV) with a standard deviation of ±0.33. The data produced a t-value of 4.66 and a p_value of 0.043.

Discussion:
Discussion: 
The collected data in this experiment supports our original hypothesis which stated that the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens would contract to a greater degree after having been injected with caffeine. This is represented by figure 1 and so; our null hypothesis was rejected. This supports the idea that caffeine lead to greater influx of Ca2+ within the gastrocnemus muscle and therefore, lead the muscle to contract to a greater degree. This degree is made evident through figure 1 as the experimental group (injected with caffeine) measured a higher Volt average as opposed to the controlll group. Within a greater sense, this data reveals that this specimen and others like it are effected greatly through the use of caffeine. A dosage of caffeine like the one used in this experiment could lead to performance changes in species as their muscles contract to a greater degree when exposed to caffeine.  Although our data, and this primary literature support our hypothesis, it is clear that there were some limitations within our experiment. These limitations fall within the realm of our specimen. We were only given three legs to work with, which produces plenty of room for error. For example, the third leg did not produce as great as a contraction as we had predicted even after being injected with caffeine. This may have been a result of early fatigue. This highlights the idea that some legs are naturally defective and therefore, can lead to inaccurate results. Also, within the parameters of this experiment, we only had room to stimulate each leg with one measured volt of current (stimulus). Being able to stimulate the muscles at different currents (higher or lower) could help aid in understanding how the stimulus effects the level of contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. We were also only able to test the effects of a very specific concentration of coffee (200 mM). Testing a variation of concentrations would better help us understand how caffeine floods muscle groups with Ca2+ and ultimately, plays a role in muscle contraction. 
These limitations lead us to propose ideas for future study. Such ideas include testing the effects of other substances on the degree of contraction of muscle groups. One proposed study could include injecting Epinephrine (adrenaline) into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens and observing for effects on muscle contraction. Again, three legs could be used in this experiment, where each serves as both the controlll and experimental group as they are stimulated, then injected, then stimulated again. A study like this could further our knowledge on how muscles contraction is effected through different substances, which commonly enter the body. Also, considering the effects of caffeine on muscle groups, we consider moving forward with testing how caffeine and other substances effect the human body specifically.
