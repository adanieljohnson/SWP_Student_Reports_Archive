Title: The size of a male opponent does not affect the frequency or duration of red mane display in male Betta splendins

Abstract:
In this study, we examined the effect of opponent size on frequency and duration of the display of red mane in male Betta splendins. Test subjects were exposed to a large male Betta spelendens opponent for five minutes, given a ten-minute rest period, and exposed to a small male Betta opponent for five minutes, separated by a glass partition. We predicted that the male Betta splendins will show a higher frequency and longer duration of red mane display in the presence of a larger opponent because the Betta perceives the larger fish as more of a threat. However, the results did not support our hypothesis, showing significent change in neither frequency (p = 0.5000) nor duration (p = 0.4442) of red mane display.

Introduction:
Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, use conspicuous and costly aggressive displays in male-male interaction. Aggressive displays such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and flashing, erect pectoral fins, opercula spreading, and red mane play a significent role in both intra- and interspecific interactions by conveying the individual’s fighting ability to dissuade an opponent from combat. These displays serve as a less exhausting and damaging way of settling conflicts between male Betta splendins rather than a fight where one (or both) fish would be seriously injured or killed. These displays are still metabolically costly, however, so the displayer must “appraise the opponent” in order to avoid a much larger degree of exhaustion [Bones, 2017]. It is important to understand these patterns of visual communication, as they regulate social interactions, particularly those associated with “aggression, sexual activities, and species recognition” [Johnson, 2017]. From this understanding, we can see that the allocation of energy towards agnostic displays in Betta splendins has an evolutionary basis; males who prove themselves superior without entirely exhausting themselves will produce more offspring, and these traits will be inherited.  In this experiment, we observed how the size of another male Betta fish can induce the test subject male Betta fish to display his red mane. The red mane is the most aggressive example of a facing behavior that Betta splendins will use to intimidate opponents. By quantifying these stimulations, we will be able to understand the typical pattern of behavior and the evolutionary basis behind it. Different species with varying ecological backgrounds and histories behave differently, so observing how Betta fish assess possible threats will give us insight as to which traits can have an adaptive advantage. We intend to determine whether the size of the opponent Betta fish influences the frequency and duration of the expression of the red mane, a specific agnostic behavior of a high intensity. It is hypothesized that the Betta splendins will show a higher frequency and longer duration display of red mane in the presence of a larger opponent because the Betta perceives the larger fish as more of a threat.

Materials and Method:
To set up this experiment, we obtained three medium sized male Betta fish as the three test subjects or trials, one large male Betta fish, and one small male Betta fish. The tank was partitioned using a piece of glass as well as an opaque partition between each section. We placed the large fish in the left section, small fish in the right, and Fish 1 (trial 1 fish) in the middle. Then, we removed the opaque partition between Fish 1 and the large fish, and observed their interactions for 5 minutes. We replaced the opaque partition after 5 minutes and allow Fish 1 to rest for 10 minutes. After the full rest period, we removed the opaque partition between Fish 1 and the smaller fish and observed the interaction for 5 minutes. We then repeated this process with Fish 2 and 3. The frequency of the display of the red mane as well as the duration in seconds of each of the three fish were recorded, averaged, and the standard deviation was found. Following the collection of data, we ran a paired t_test and found p values to determine the significance of the treatment.

Results:
Fish 2 did not exhibit red mane in the presence of the large opponent or the small opponent. We selected a fourth fish, hoping he would show red mane, and we would be able to replace Trial 2 data with Trial 4 data. Unfortunately, he did not express it in the presence of either opponent. The data from these two trials were discarded because the fish did not show any response to any sort of stimulation, so only trials 1 and 3 were analyzed.  The means of the red mane display frequency in the presence of a large vs small fish were 0.5 expressions and 2 expressions respectively, and the error bars that represent standard deviation overlap. The means of the red mane display duration in the presence of a large vs small fish were 0.35 seconds and 45.5 seconds respectively, and the error bars representing the standard deviation of the small opponent treatment encapsulates the positive and negative error bars of the large opponent treatment. There was no statistical significance between the frequency of red mane display in the presence of a large or small opponent (p = 0.5000) as seen in Figure 1, and there was no statistical significance between the duration of red mane display in the presence of a large or small opponent (p = 0.4442) as seen in Figure 2.

Discussion:
The null hypothesis was not able to be rejected in our experiment, so our hypothesis that the Betta fish will show a higher frequency and longer duration display of red mane in the presence of a larger opponent was not supported. One reason the treatment didn’t produce significent results was likely due to the habituation of the Betta fish. The fish had been experimented on repeatedly before this class period, and the 10-minute rest period given to the fish between these trials was not enough to prevent such long-term habituation. Additionally, more trials should have been conducted, but the duration of the lab period limited the number of trials possible.  Due to that fact that we changed our experiment the morning that it was conducted, we did not research existing studies analyzing the effects of the opponent’s body size on the behavior of the male Betta fish. Studies have been conducted, however, claiming that body size asymmetry between the contestants had no effect on behavior [Dzieweczynski, 2005]. The Betta fish were relatively similar sizes; the fish displaying red mane will always appear larger than its opponent. The purpose of the display of the red mane is to make themselves look larger to the opponent, so the size of the body behind the red mane is not as important. Fish’s behavior is not determined by size; a male could feel the need to be more aggressive in the presence of a larger male to show that he will hurt the larger fish if it tries to attack, or he could display aggressive behaviors to prove his dominance as the larger opponent. Rather, a more interesting variable we could have measured would be the effect of the color of the opponent on the frequency and duration of red mane display in a male Betta fish. In the interspecific competition experiment conducted in the lab a week prior to the execution of this experiment, the male Betta fish was able to discern that he was in the presence of a fish of a different species. Thus, he did not expend energy on agnostic displays because the fish was not a threat to him. A similar experiment could be conducted to test the effect of the presence of a Betta fish of the same color vs the presence of a differently colored Betta fish on the frequency and duration of red mane display. One study has been conducted analyzing the behavior of male Betta splendins towards similarly-colored fish compared to differently-colored fish. The study found that males used more aggressive displays towards similarly colored individuals, including significently longer duration of gill flaring [Bones, 2017]. More evidence is needed to corroborate or dispute these findings, so this could be an important topic of further research. Another influential factor in the behavior of male Betta fish is the presence of an audience and if that audience is male or female. Both male and female fighting fish have been shown to have the ability to extract information from male-male displays and use that information in subsequent interactions- a process known as “eavesdropping” [Matos, 2002]. An experiment involving an audience would involve a network of communications rather than a simple sender-receiver dyad, and could deepen our understanding of how Betta splendins intra-specifically communicate and compete. A previous study was conducted in which subjects attempted significently more bites and spent less time near the opponent with a male audience than a female audience [Matos, 2002]. This indicates that the presence and sex of an audience determines how individuals should display during an interaction, but further studies are required when it comes to predicting the costs of aggressive behavior of the lack thereof. While the results from the experiment we conducted ourselves were inconclusive, this failure prompted the synthesis of better ideas for future experiments.
