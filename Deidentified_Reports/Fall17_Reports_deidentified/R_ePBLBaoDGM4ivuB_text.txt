Title: Negative Effects on Photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea var. sabellica leaves Due to Cold, Hot, and Room Temperature Conditions

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to determine how temperature affects photosynthesis in kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica) leaves. A Chloroplast suspension made from kale leaves was mixed into solutions containing DCPIP and a buffer. Solutions were placed in three different temperature conditions—cold, room temperature, and hot—and the absorbance of each was measured every ten minutes for a period of 30 minutes. It was hypothesized that the highest rates of photosynthesis would occur in room temperature samples, followed by cold temperature samples, and lastly hot temperature samples. Results, while not statistically significant (meaning they were due to random chance), proved the hypothesis correct. It is likely that the results seen in the experiment were due to the denaturing of RUBISCO, the enzyme responsible for the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. In hot temperatures, this enzyme denatures, and at low temperatures, the frost-resistant properties of kale prevent complete denaturing of RUBISCO enzymes. 

Introduction:
   Photosynthesis is the metabolic process carried out by plants, in which light energy is used to excite electrons and drive a series of reduction reactions to ultimately produce glucose. This process is split into light-dependent and light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, photons are used to generate NADPH and a proton gradient that drives the production of ATP. The light-independent reactions contain RUBISCO (enzyme), which uses ATP and NADPH to combine 5 carbon molecules to 1 CO2 molecule to produce a 6-carbon glucose molecule [Johnson: 2017]. This process is easily disrupted by factors such as temperature, which can denature RUBISCO, and thus halt or decrease the production of ATP. In a previous experiment, Weis found that Rubisco is especially sensitive to elevated temperatures. The purpose of this lab was to determine how both cold and hot temperature conditions affect photosynthetic activity in kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica) leaves, which are known to be temperature resistant, especially to frost conditions [Frost tolerance of vegetables]. Centrifuged samples of kale chloroplasts were placed in an ice bath (approx. -1 C), room temperature (~23 C), and a heat bath (approx. 30 C) for three, 10-minute intervals. A baseline sample and control group were also utilized. The independent variable of this experiment is temperature, and the dependent variable is rate of photosynthesis, or more specifically absorbance (nm) which is indirectly proportional to photosynthesis. All samples contained DCPIP, which is reduced when photosynthesis occurs. As a result of the reduction of DCPIP, the sample’s color will change from blue (color of oxidized DCPIP) to clear (color of reduced DCPIP), and thus, absorbance, measured using the spectrophotometer, will be lower in samples where activity is present and higher in samples where activity is absent [Johnson: 2017]. If kale chloroplasts are exposed to high temperatures, photosynthetic rate will be lower than that of samples placed in room temperature and -1 C conditions. Room temperature samples will present the highest rates of photosynthesis. 


Materials and Methods:
Preparing the chloroplast sample: Remove and discard the central veins from the kale leaves and rinse and dry the remaining parts. Combine the leaves and 10 mL of grinding buffer in a mortar and pestle, and grind the leaves into a thick paste. Add 10 more mL of grinding buffer, and repeat the grinding process. Strain the liquid, using a cheesecloth, into a centrifuge tube labelled “sample A” and spin it at 200G and 1200 rpm for three minutes. Transfer the liquid into a centrifuge tube marked “sample B”, making sure not to dislodge the pellet at the bottom of the sample A tube. Centrifuge sample B at 1,000 G and 2800 rpm for ten minutes. Discard the supernatant. Then, add 20 mL of the grinding buffer to the sample B pellet, and stir the solution. 
    Preparing the temperature samples: Label 13 test tubes and prepare the mixes in Table 1. Prepare the ice bath and heat bath, place a thermometer in each, and record the temperatures. Number 13 spectrophotometer cuvettes. Then, add 100 μl of the chloroplast sample to test tubes #1-10. Mix each sample after adding the chloroplasts, and transfer them to the cuvettes. Blank the spectrophotometer using the blank sample, and then measure each sample at time zero (baseline condition). Then, place the samples in their according conditions (making sure they are exposed to direct light from either a lamp or windowsill). Every ten minutes, for a period of thirty minutes, repeat the process of blanking the spectrophotometer and measuring the absorbance of all samples. Calculate the percent change in absorbance at 10, 20, and 30 minutes. 

Results:
Data was recorded using a spectrophotometer and measured at 600 nm. Figures 1-3 show average absorbance of chloroplast samples in cold, room temperature, and hot conditions at 10, 20, and 30 minutes. All conditions show a decrease in absorbance over time, however, room temperature samples had a decrease by the largest factor, with average absorbance decreasing by 0.07 nm. Absorbance is indirectly proportional to photosynthesis, because of the DCPIP that is added to all samples; it is important to note that photosynthesis occurred in each temperature condition, regardless of whether it occurred at very low rates (as seen in 30 C conditions). Figures 4-6 show the percent decrease in absorbance across the 30 minute span of the experiment for each temperature condition. In these figures, the change in photosynthetic rate across the timespan and the differences between the three temperature conditions are more noticeable. However, the results were not statistically significant (p=0.235), meaning they were due to random chance. Thus, changing temperature conditions did not significantly affect photosynthetic rates in kale leaves.   

Discussion:
Figures 1-6 show that photosynthetic activity increased the most in samples tested in room temperature conditions, followed by samples in cold conditions, and lastly, those in hot conditions. The enzymatic activity (specifically that of the enzyme RUBISCO) that drives the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, and its dependence on temperature conditions, explain the results shown in Figures 1-6. Figure 3 showed the smallest decrease in absorbance of the three temperature conditions, and Figure 6 showed the smallest percent change in absorbance between zero and 30 minutes. These results indicate the denaturing of RUBISCO in ~30 C temperature conditions. While experiments conducted by Feller et. al were done on wheat and cotton, results similarly showed that, “Increasing the leaf temperature above 22.5°C for wheat or 30°C for cotton during the last 5 min of the irradiation period caused progressive inhibition of Rubisco activation”. From these results, we can conclude that RUBISCO, regardless of which plant it is in, is denatured at ~30 C. Photosynthetic rates in cold conditions (approx. -1 C) were second highest, likely due to the frost resistance of kale leaves [Botanical interests], and subsequently the denaturing of fewer RUBISCO enzymes compared to samples in hot conditions. With denaturing of only some enzymes, chloroplasts still had photosynthetic activity, although it was limited, which explains why absorbance was lower than that of room temperature samples, but higher than that of ~30 C samples. However, large errors could have been due to the consistency of the chloroplast suspension, which was too thick and the means of distributing the suspension into the test tubes too unprecise to ensure that each sample had the same concentration of chloroplasts. In further trials of this experiment, samples should be tested in their temperature conditions for a period of time longer than 30 minutes and chloroplasts should be more accurately distributed into each test tube. Additionally, Feller et. al found that RUBISCO had enzymatic activity at 50 C, which indicates that its denaturing is reversible. Thus, testing more variations of “hot” and “cold” conditions would provide more insight into the temperature conditions in which kale functions best.
