Title: The Effect of Darkness on Procambarus Sp. Specific Metabolic Rate

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to learn more about metabolism and gas exchange, specifically the effects of darkness on the metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. The experiment was conducted using three Procambarus sp. Each organism was tested with a twenty-minute light period, then a twenty-minute dark period. The oxygen consumption was recorded at five-minute intervals. The specific metabolic rate was calculated. The p-value was 0.167904, so the data collected was not significant. Therefore, the data was inconclusive and did not support the hypothesis. This result could be due to the limitations posed by the conditions of the experiment.


Introduction:
The objective of this lab is to determine the effect of darkness on the metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. In this experiment, the metabolic rate will be determined by the measure of oxygen consumption under this environmental condition. The specific metabolic rate is being measured because it is relative to weight, so that the variation between different crayfish is negligible. The metabolic rate increases with the rise in environmental temperature. Therefore, it can be said that there would be an increase in metabolic rates during the light periods, and alternatively, a decrease in the metabolic rate during the dark periods as a result in relatively colder temperatures in the latter. [Sadava, et. al.: 2016]. It has also been determined that the organisms have a decrease in oxygen consumption in the dark due to a decrease in their motor activity as a result of predation [Ansell, et. al.: 1973]. It is hypothesized that the experimental group (conditions), the darkness of the environment, will result in a low oxygen consumption compared to the light period; the latter of which being the control group.

Materials and Methods:
1.	Fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air.
2.	Set test chamber in empty plastic dishpan.
3.	Weigh crayfish and gently place it in the test chamber, screw on the top of the test chamber.
4.	Gently fill the container with water so the top overflows slightly.
5.	Place the entire tank set-up to the neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature water.
6.	Turn on the instrument and let you reading stabilize.
7.	Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration.
8.	At 5,10,15 and 20 minutes read oxygen concentration.
9.	Remove the probe after 20 minutes.
10.	Measure the volume of the crayfish by pouring the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder.
11.	Take the test chamber and wrap aluminum foil around it so there is no light coming through the test chamber.
12.	Repeat steps 4-11 for each
13.	Calculate the specific metabolic rate using the following equation for each Procambarus sp.

Results:
The experimental group resulted in a higher specific metabolic rate across all three Procambarus sp. The Procambarus sp. was very energetic during the experiment; there was a lot of movement. The control group resulted in an average of specific metabolic rate of 0.000606 O2 g-1 min-1 with a standard deviation of 0.000229, as seen in Figure 1. The experimental group resulted in an average of 0.001489 O2 g-1 hr-1 with a standard deviation of 0.000503, as seen in Figure 1. The p-value was 0.167904, as seen in Figure 1.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported because the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish was higher in the experimental group, the dark period, compared to the control group, the light period. This result can be explained in a study where seventy Porcellio laevis intermoult tenth instar males were compared under conditions of daylight and complete darkness, over a period of eight hours at 25º C. The isopods respiring in total darkness had significantly higher oxygen consumption rate than did those tested in light [Husain & Alikhan: 1979]. However, the hypothesis is supported in a study examining the effect of light on oxygen consumption of two amphipod crustaceans, the hypogean Niphargus stygius and the epigean Gammarus fossarum, there was a much higher oxygen consumption in the epigean G. fossarum, an organism inhabiting a dark environment [ Simčič, et. al:2007]. Potential explanations for the increased oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate observed during the dark period experiment could be a result of the following distinctions. The variation in results among studies could be the result of the different adaptations of different organisms. Porcellio laevis, hypogean Niphargus stygius, and the epigean Gammarus fossarum are not all the same organism and therefore maintain homeostasis differently. The conditions of our experiment were limited to the sample size of three Procambarus sp. In addition, an error in the experiment was that the aluminum foil did not cover the jar completely, so the dark period could have had some light. Also, the crayfish were stressed from being captured, moved, and placed into a new environment. The experiment could have been better is there was also a transitional period, both dark and light, so there would be less stress on the crayfish and create a more realistic environment. Also, the water temperature inside the jar could have been colder to create a more realistic environment during the dark period, potentially lowering the specific metabolic rate during the colder period.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. displays the average specific metabolic rate for the Procambarus sp. The control yielded a specific metabolic rate of 0.000606 O2 g-1 min-1 with a standard deviation of 0.000229. The experimental group yielded an average of 0.001489 O2 g-1 hr-1 with a standard deviation of 0.000503. The p-value was 0.167904. The error bars represent the variation in the specific metabolic rate average between the three Procambarus sp.
