Title: The Metabolic Effects of Environmental Salinity Concentrations on Procambris sp. Crayfish

Abstract:
The metabolic rate of organisms can be affected by many different variables. This experiment measures the effects of increased environmental salinity on Procambris sp. Crayfish. Oxygen consumption was used as an indicator of metabolic rate. Crayfish were kept in a chamber and the oxygen level of the chamber was monitored. The salinity level of the chamber was increased, and the oxygen level monitored once again. The metabolic rates were then calculated and compared using a paired, two tailed t_test. The results show a general trend of metabolic rates decreasing when the crayfish were treated with the salinity solution. However, the results were not statistically significent. Experiments using different salinity concentrations could further this research.

Introduction:
Metabolism is the rate at which an organism uses energy, usually in the form of ATP. Metabolic rates can be affected by many factors, including stress, temperature, and salinity [Meade, 2002]. These factors cause the organism to need more or else energy, therefore increasing or decreasing the metabolic rate. This experiment tested the effect of salinity on Procambris sp. Crayfish on metabolism by measuring the oxygen consumption of the crayfish. Crayfish were used in this experiment because their metabolic rate can be easily affected by their environment and internal factors. Oxygen consumption is directly correlated to metabolic rate, as oxygen is used in cellular respiration as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain in cellular respiration. Oxygen’s position as the final electron acceptor makes it key to the movement of electrons down the chain, and therefore key to the operation of the protein ATP synthase [Cassina, 1996]. The equation for cellular respiration is as follows: C6H12O6 (s) + 6 O2 (g) → 6 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O (l) + heat [Speakman, 2013]. This shows how oxygen consumption is directly correlated to ATP production. ATP production speed is also directly correlated to ATP usage in the organism. If ATP is being consumed at higher rates, it will be produced at higher rates, causing oxygen consumption rate to be higher. This experiment measures how salinity, an environmental factor, affects crayfish metabolism. Crayfish are a freshwater species, which means they are usually hypertonic to their environment [Helfrich, 2009]. Because of this, crayfish must expend energy to retain ions. It is hypothesized if the external salinity increases, their metabolic rate should decrease as the crayfish and the environment become more isotonic to each other. However, if the environment becomes hypertonic to the crayfish, the crayfish will once again have to expend energy to keep from passively gaining ions from the environment. 

Materials and Method:
Procambris sp. Crayfish were placed in a container filled with oxygenated water. The oxygen probe was secured to the top of the container, and the container was sealed. This chamber contained about 900Ml of water. This chamber was then put in a room temperature (22℃) water bath. The oxygen level in the container was measured for 20 minutes. Then the crayfish was removed, and the water in the chamber was replaced with a .73% NaCl solution. The same crayfish was placed back in the chamber, and the chamber was sealed and placed in the same water bath. The oxygen level in the container was measured for 20 minutes. From this data the metabolic rates for the salinity treatment and the freshwater treatment were calculated. This procedure was repeated two additional times with different crayfish.

Results:
The data shows the metabolic rate of the crayfish to decrease in salt water. Figure 1 shows that all three trials support this trend. Trial one had 60% decrease in metabolic rate, while Trial 2 had a 62.5% decrease, and Trial three had a 72.5% decrease. The average decrease in metabolic rates was 65%. A two-tailed, paired t_test was performed, which resulted in a p_value of .068. 

Discussion:
Although the salinity treated crayfish metabolic rates were not statistically significent from the controlll crayfish metabolic rates, as seen in Figure 1 the general trend of the data supports the hypothesis that salinity, to a certain point, can decrease the metabolic rate of crayfish due to reduced need to actively retain ions. This is similar to other work in the area and current models of ion retention systems  [Langdon, 1987].  The lack of significance could be attributed to small sample size. 
This research could be furthered by testing higher concentrations of salinity to find the point at which crayfish must expend ATP in order to prevent passive gain of ions from the environment. This could be used to find the theoretical “curve” of metabolism of the crayfish in different salinity levels. The salinity level at the minimum of this curve would be equal to the concentration of ions in the crayfish.
