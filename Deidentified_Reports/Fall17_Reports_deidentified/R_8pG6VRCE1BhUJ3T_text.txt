Title: The Inhibitory Effect of Lanthanum Chloride on Neuromuscular Function in Rana pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle 

Abstract:
In this study, we investigated the effect on lanthanum chloride on neuromuscular function in Rana pipiens neuromuscular junction between the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve.  Lanthanum chloride is a calcium channel blocker, and because of this, we hypothesized that after the injection of lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens leg, the twitch threshold would increase and the twitch amplitude would decrease due to Ca2+ channels not being able to open.  This would result in the contractile machinery of the muscle to not be activated and a weaker twitch to occur.  The sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle were attached to the iWorx system which delivered electric stimuli to the nerve in increasing voltages and measured the response of the muscle.  There was an increase in twitch threshold after the injection of lanthanum chloride from 0.14V to 0.21V, however this increase was not statistically significant.  Additionally, there was a very slight decrease in twitch amplitude from 0.41V to 0.40V, but this decrease was also not statistically significant.  Thus, our hypothesis failed to be accepted.  However, more studies need to be done in order to test differing concentrations of lanthanum chloride on larger sample sizes of differing organisms.  

Introduction:
Organisms respond to their environment and changes in their environment using their nervous system.  The nervous system allows the organism to respond quickly and precisely through the generation and propagation of action potentials (AP).  Organisms also use their nervous systems to move their muscles and skeletons.  APs are generated in the motor neurons and travel down the axons until they reach the axon terminals and the neuromuscular junction.  At the axon terminals, the depolarization of the cell membrane causes voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to open, causing Ca2+ ions to rush into the cell. An action potential will be generated in the muscle cells, releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which will then activate the contractile machinery, and the muscle will contract and twitch [Johnson: 2017].  Lanthanum chloride is a calcium channel blocker meaning that it inhibits the opening of Ca2+ channels in response to depolarization of the cell.  In a study carried out by Weiss and Goodman, the effects of lanthanum chloride on the contraction of intestinal smooth muscle was investigated, and they found that lanthanum chloride inhibited calcium movement, calcium uptake, and muscles contractions.  [Weiss and Goodman: 1969].  Due to these findings and the crucial role Ca2+ plays in the excitation-contraction coupling, we designed an experiment to test the effect of lanthanum chloride on the neuromuscular function in the legs of Rana pipiens, the northern leopard frog.  Rana pipiens was chosen as the test species in our experiment because it has been used to investigate neurons for years, the sciatic nerve is easy to isolate, and the muscle can stay alive in vitro for many hours.  We investigated the effect of lanthanum chloride injection into the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens on the twitch threshold and twitch amplitude in order to determine the effect of lanthanum chloride on both the likelihood that the muscle will respond to an electric signal and the strength of that response. The independent variable in our experiment is the presence of lanthanum chloride in the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens, and the dependent variables are the twitch threshold and the twitch amplitude.  Our null hypothesis is that the the injection of lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens will have no effect on the twitch threshold and the amplitude of the response.  Our alternative hypothesis is that the injection of lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens will increase the twitch threshold and decrease the amplitude of the response because the lanthanum chloride in the muscle will block the ability of Ca2+ to be released form the sarcoplasmic reticulum, inhibiting the contractile machinery and not producing a contraction. 

Materials and Methods:
First, we dissected the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve from the Rana pipiens leg.  We ensured that the nerve and muscle were kept wet with Ringer’s solution at all times.  We hooked the nerve up to iWorx electrophysiology recording equipment and suspended the muscle at a 90° angle using a string in order to measure the tension and twitch.  Then, we stimulated the sciatic nerve using the iWorx system starting at a voltage of 0.1V.  We continued to stimulate the nerve in increasing intervals of 0.1V until we saw a distinct twitch of the gastrocnemius muscle which was a twitch visible to the naked eye and not just recorded on the iWorx software.  Once we saw this twitch, we stimulated the nerve at intervals of 0.01V in order to find the twitch threshold.  For example, if the first twitch was observed at 0.3V, then we would stimulate the nerve with 0.29V next and continue to decrease the stimulus amplitude by 0.01V until no twitch was observed.  The smallest stimulus amplitude that produced a twitch of the gastrocnemius muscle was determined to be the twitch threshold.  We also recorded the twitch amplitude in volts of each twitch response in order to determine the strength of the response.  Once the twitch threshold was determined, we injected the gastrocnemius muscle with 0.2mL of 1mM lanthanum chloride and waited 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes had passed, we repeated the previous steps in order to find the new twitch threshold and twitch amplitude.  This procedure was repeated for all three Rana pipiens legs.  After all data was collected, we averaged the twitch threshold of all 3 trials before the injection of lanthanum chloride and after the injection of lanthanum chloride, and averaged the twitch amplitude before and after the injection.  Two separate one-tailed paired t-tests were run to determine if the differences in the averages of the twitch threshold and twitch amplitude were significant.    

Results:
The injection of lanthanum chloride increased the stimulus amplitude needed to produce a twitch of the gastrocnemius muscle, thus the twitch threshold increased after the injection.  The average twitch threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens before the injection of lanthanum chloride was 0.14V, and the average twitch threshold after the injection of lanthanum chloride was 0.21V.  The standard deviation of the twitch thresholds before injection was +/-0.09, and the standard deviation of twitch thresholds after injection was +/-0.12.  The one-tailed paired t-test run for twitch threshold produced a t-statistic of 1.85 and a P-value of 0.205 for 2 degrees of freedom.  The injection of lanthanum chloride also slightly decreased the average twitch amplitude.  The average twitch amplitude of twitch at twitch threshold before the injection was 0.41V, and the average twitch amplitude after the injection was 0.40V.  The standard deviation of the twitch amplitudes before the injection was +/-0.41, and the standard deviation after the injections was +/-0.52.  The one-tailed paired t-test run for twitch amplitude produced a t-statistic of 0.23 and a P-value of 0.84 for 2 degrees of freedom.  Additionally, in trial 1 after the injection of lanthanum chloride, we saw contractions of the tibialis anterior longus muscle at stimulus amplitudes of 0.23V and 0.24V but no contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle.  We also observed twitches of the tibialis anterior longus at stimulus amplitudes of 0.06V in trial 2 after the injection of lanthanum chloride and 0.15V in trial 1 prior to the injection   

Discussion:
Because the P-value of 0.205 was larger than our alpha value of .05, we fail to accept our alternative hypothesis that lanthanum chloride would increase twitch threshold.  We must accept our null hypothesis that the injection of lanthanum chloride will have no significant effect on the twitch threshold.  Additionally, because the P-value of 0.84 was larger than our alpha value of .05, we fail to accept our hypothesis that lanthanum chloride would decrease twitch amplitude, and we must accept our null hypothesis that the injection of lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle will have no significant effect on the twitch amplitude.  While both of our alternative hypothesis failed to be accepted, lanthanum chloride did have an effect on the neuromuscular function of Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve.  The injection of lanthanum chloride blocked some of the calcium channels in the muscle preventing calcium from rushing into the cell as quickly, making it harder for the muscle cell to generate an AP and contract.  This effect can be seen in the increased twitch threshold after injection as it took a larger stimulus to produce an AP meaning that more Ca2+ voltage-gated channels had to be stimulated before the same result could occur.  However, it is likely that our sample size was too small and the organisms differed too much from each other in order to produce a statistically significant response.  For example, one of our legs needed stimulus amplitudes of 0.19V and 0.25V in order to produce a twitch while another leg only needed stimulus amplitudes of 0.06V and 0.07V to produce a twitch of even stronger magnitude. This shows that the sensitivity of our organisms’ sciatic nerves differed vastly, and because our sample size was so small, only 3 subjects, it is hard for statistical tests to account for this vast difference in sensitivity.  On the other hand, the results of the twitch amplitude makes biological sense.  An AP is an all-or-nothing event, meaning that once it is stimulated it will occur with same strength every time. Thus, once twitch threshold was reached, an AP was generated, and this AP will have the same strength no matter what stimulus amplitude causes it.  Thus, it is logical that the twitch amplitude before was 0.41V and after the injection was 0.40V because these values are almost the same, making the difference not statistically significant.  Our results do not align with the study carried out by Weiss and Goodman as they found lanthanum chloride to inhibit all calcium movements and uptake; however, in their study, they used 1.8mM lanthanum chloride and used ileal smooth muscle from guinea pigs [Weiss and Goodman: 1969]. Thus, it is possible that we did not experience the same results as this study because we used a less concentrated version of lanthanum chloride and used a different muscle of a different test subject. More tests would need to be conducted to investigate the effects of higher concentrations of lanthanum chloride on Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscles and also the effect of lanthanum chloride on muscles involved in different neuromuscular junctions of different organisms. We would also test more subjects and wait longer after the injection of lanthanum chloride in order to ensure that it fully takes effect because in the experiment conducted by Weiss and Goodman, the muscles were placed in the solution containing lanthanum chloride for an hour before retesting their neuromuscular function demonstrating that lanthanum chloride takes a significant amount of time to take effect in the muscles [Weiss and Goodman: 1969].  In general, our experiment failed to significantly demonstrate the inhibitory effects of lanthanum chloride in neuromuscular junction due to its status as a calcium channel blocker.  However, our raw data begins to indicate this inhibitory function on lanthanum chloride.  More tests need to be done in order to fully investigate the effect on lanthanum chloride on neuromuscular function.
