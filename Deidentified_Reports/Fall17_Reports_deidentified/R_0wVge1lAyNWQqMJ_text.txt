Title: How the presence of shelter affects the aggressiveness of aggression in Betta splendins

Abstract:
In this experiment,  we observed Betta splendins on its aggressive behavior with and without shelter. All of the trials were between two fish and the observations recorded were of a single fish. We hypothesized that the shelter would increase the aggression response due to the fish having something to protect. Aggressiveness measured on a scale of physical reactions that were ranked from least to most aggressive. The controlll group consisted of the fish seeing each other for five minutes, and the experimental group was the fish, one with a shelter, seeing each other for five minutes. In our results, we saw that the fish was less aggressive in the experimental group. Tee decreased aggressiveness could be because the shelter reduced the aggressiveness of the fish. However, I think it is more likely that the fish was less aggressive because the experimental trials took place after the controlll trials, so the fish was tired. The experiment was supposed to emulate a bettas response to another betta in the wild, but I think instead it showed us how the display patterns might change overextended continuous period of aggression.

Introduction:
Betta splendins, also known as the Siamese fighting fish, can be very aggressive and territorial. The fish have various displays and movements that inform their opponent or possible mate of their state of aggression. Territorial aggression is expressed in a variety of ways ranging from patrolling behavior, chasing intruders to even physical combat [Lynn et al., 2007]. The different parts of a betta’s surroundings like food, mates, nesting sites and shelter can often alter their behavior depending on the scarceness of a resource. In an attempt to emulate competition for resources in the wild we will include a shelter in our experimental group to see how that affects the aggressiveness of the behavior of a male. The outcome of the experiment will hypothetically be the betta fish in the experimental group being more aggressive as he has a shelter to defend.

Materials and Method:
This experiment is purely for the observation of their aggressive behaviors. The fish will not have physical contact with each other as there will always be another barrier. The purpose is to simulate another betta male being in its territory without putting the fish in any danger. This experiment will require two male betta fish in one tank split by two barriers, one translucent and one opaque. A shelter will also be needed, but that will be put in the tank later in the experiment. The dividers should be removable so that they can be added and taken away as needed. The research will take place in multiple timed sections. There will be six total trials; a trial consists of removing the opaque barrier so that the fish can see one another for 5 minutes. After each trial takes place, there is a 5 minute rest period where the transparent wall is put back so they cannot see each other. The second three tests will take place with one of the fish having a shelter on its side. The shelter is a skull looking hollow item. We will quantify aggression via four levels that are divided into broadside and facing displays. Whatever aggressive behavior takes place one group member will time how long they record the action, and the determined multiplier will multiply the response. The more aggressive behaviors have high multipliers the rankings are as follows 
Facing Display                    Broad Side Display
1-Erect Pectoral Fin            1- Pelvic Fin Flickering
3-‘Red Mane’                      3-Tail Flashing
Most of the behaviors are given in the name, except the Red Mane which is when the fish flares its operculae making its gills flare out giving it a pseudo ‘mane’. The numbers next to each behavior correlates to the multiplier. 1 being slightly aggressive and 3 being extremely aggressive. A two-tailed 2 test will most likely be used to analyze this data. 

Results:
The outcome, as displayed in figure 1, is that the experimental group overall was aggressive for less time than the controlll group was. The difference between controlll and experimental in less aggressive behavior was only ~50 seconds, but the difference in more aggressive behavior was ~135 seconds. 

Discussion:
The male bettas were very aggressive with one another right away, showing multiple aggressive behaviors all at once and various times. Compared to the experimental group the controllls groups averages were all higher, but the pectoral. When the first experimental group trial was starting the fish had already been aggressive for ~460 seconds during the controlll period. In an experiment done that tested the metabolic costs of aggressive behavior, it was found that displays like the ‘Red Mane’ and Dorsal Fin Spreading have positively correlated with higher oxygen consumption [Castro et al., 2006]. I think that the decrease in aggressive behavior in the experimental group has less to do with the experimental variable and more to do with the experiments being right after one another. The fish being tired makes more sense than the presence of the shelter reducing aggressiveness. It is possible that the shelter added security to the betta’s section. I think to properly expand this experiment multiple controlll and experimental groups would need to form, and the tests between the two groups would need to separate by the rest period of a day. The outcome directly disagrees with my hypothesis, but I am attributing the issue to a flaw in our experimental design so that if I were to run this again, the fish would have ample time to calm down and rest before the experimental tests were run. Other experiments found that when the fish are given the option between food and a mirror often the betta male would choose the food. I think this I is a good indicator that bettas would prefer a resource over aggressiveness [Hogan, 2004]. This experiment was supposed to show the significance of resource competition on betta fish aggression behavior. It ended up showing that the fish can only be very aggressive for a limited amount of time before the cost of the response is too high, or the fish is tired and cannot keep up the aggression for as long. Also moving into future experiments, it would be interesting to test that if there were no physical barrier in the experimental group if the fish would retreat to its shelter.  Perhaps the fish without a shelter would try to take the shelter; I think this would be a better gauge on how the scenario would play out in the wild.
