Title: Effects of Salinity on Oxygen Consumption and Specific Metabolic Rate of a Orconectus sp. Crayfish

Abstract:
Effects of Salinity on Specific Metabolic Rate was assessed following addition of .65% NaCl to the surrounding water of three Orconectus sp. Crayfish, and each crayfish was used as its own control group. The control group was the oxygen saturated water without additional salinity, and the treatment group was adding .65% NaCl to the water surrounding the same crayfish. Each crayfish was left in the untreated water for twenty minutes (control) and then twenty minutes with water with increased salinity (treatment). Our hypothesis stated that if the salinity is increased in the water surrounding the crayfish, their osmotic rate/ oxygen consumption will increase which will increase their metabolic rate. In the end, the experiment showed that the average specific metabolic rate decreased in the crayfish when placed in the water with a higher salinity (.000415 (mg)(L)/(min)(g)) when compared to the crayfish’s specific metabolic rate when placed in the water with no added salinity (.00097(mg)(L)/(min)(g)). However, the statistical testing does not show any significance amongst the data; therefore, due to experimental inaccuracy we cannot reject the null hypothesis or support an alternate hypothesis. (t-stat= 1.8357, df=3, P= .1637). (p> .001).

Introduction:
Autotrophs and Heterotrophs obtain energy and a similar set of mitochondrial enzymes to help capture energy in the form of ATP. An organisms’ metabolism is the entire process of balancing energy capture, energy conversation, and energy transmission. Its metabolic rate is the amount of energy expended. Therefore, a way to measure an organism’s metabolic process is to measure energy transfer and release. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are indirect indicators of energy production by an organism: the oxygen we inhale is turned into water after it gains electrons, and the carbon dioxide we exhale is the remainder of the glucose molecules that were broken down for ATP production. This metabolic process takes place in the mitochondria where glucose goes through a series of reactions to convert to carbon dioxide. The electrons released during these reactions are transported in an electron transport chain that uses the energy released form the electrons to generate ATP. The electrons end up going to oxygen to form water. In this lab, we will analyze the relationship between the salinity of water and the rate of metabolism in a Orconectus sp. Crayfish. In order to do this, we will record the oxygen consumed by the crayfish. The specific metabolic rate can be calculated by multiplying the change in O2 concentration in the water by the total volume of water in the chamber, then divide that number by time multiplied by the weight of the crayfish. We will be given three crayfish of different size, and each crayfish will be its own control group. Each crayfish will be placed in a control treatment of water without added salinity for a total of 20 minutes, and then each crayfish will be placed in the treated chamber with .65% added NaCl for twenty minutes. In a similar study, adult crayfish were transferred to a range of seawater concentrations (salinities from 7 to 28 where 100% seawater equals 35). The osmolality of the hemolymph increased significantly as the salinity increased after 48 hours. All crayfish in this experiment increased their osmotic rate in high salinities of 21 and 28 (Holdich 1997). Therefore, our alternate hypothesis states that if the salinity is increased in the water surrounding the crayfish, their osmotic rate/ oxygen consumption will increase which will increase their metabolic rate. The null hypothesis states that the crayfish will not change their metabolic rate when transferred into water with more salinity. The dependent variable is the oxygen consumption of the crayfish in the surrounding water, and the independent variable is oxygen saturated water without added .65% NaCl and the oxygen-saturated water with added .65% NaCl.

Materials and Methods:
First, we will be given three different crayfish of different size and weigh each crayfish. Then, we will fill the testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air and set the chamber into an empty plastic dishpan. Then we will place one crayfish in the test chamber and fill the container with the control water with no added salinity. Next, we will place the oxygen probe into the top of the chamber and take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Then, we will record the oxygen concentration every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, we will remove the probe and measure the volume of water the crayfish was in my pouring the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder. After the control treatment, we will repeat the same steps with the same crayfish but instead refill the chamber with oxygen-saturated water with .65% salinity. We will then repeat this entire process with the other two crayfish. The statistical test used to compare each crayfish’s metabolic rate to no added salinity in the surrounding water to the .65% salinity in the surrounding water will be a one-tailed paired t-test.

Results:
All three-crayfish consumed oxygen in the oxygen saturated water, but the results showed that all three-crayfish consumed more oxygen in the control water than the .65% NaCl water. The crayfish in the control water had an average specific metabolic rate of .00097. The crayfish in the treatment water had an average specific metabolic rate of .000415. When .65% of NaCl was added to the oxygen saturated water in the chamber surrounding the crayfish, the oxygen consumption decreased, which is shown by the oxygen probe after 20 minutes; therefore, the crayfish’s’ specific metabolic rate decreased since oxygen consumption is directly related to the specific metabolic rate calculated by multiplying the change in O2 concentration in the water by the total volume of water in the chamber, then divide that number by time multiplied by the weight of the crayfish. However, the statistical testing shows a p-value that is too small to show any significance amongst the data. The one-tailed paired t-test shows that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected since p>.001). (t-stat= 1.8357, df=3, P= .1637). (p> .001).

Discussion:
This data does not support our alternate hypothesis that if the salinity is increased in the water surrounding the crayfish, their osmotic rate/ oxygen consumption will increase which will increase their metabolic rate. On the other hand, this data shows the opposite trend: if the salinity is increased in the water surrounding the crayfish, their osmotic rate/ oxygen consumption decreased which decreased their metabolic rate. In all three crayfish, their oxygen consumption in the twenty-minute interval was greater in the water with no added salinity than their oxygen consumption in the treated water with a higher salinity. 
However, the statistical testing for this experiment show that there is no significance amongst the data; therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis or accept an alternative that the crayfish will have a decreased oxygen consumption in water with more salinity. (t-stat= 1.8357, df=3, P= .1637). (p> .001). Raising salinity in water is actually known to increase the osmotic rate in ectotherms since the surrounding water has an increased number of ions that flow into the crayfish which causes more water to follow during oxygen consumption. Salt, such as NaCl, stimulates osmosis by attracting the water, since water is polar, and causing it to move across the membrane of the crayfish and other marine organisms. In a similar study, the oxygen consumption in a sea bass exposed to different salinities showed that the metabolic rate increased each time the salinity increased by up to 80% (Dalla 1998). This is because the osmotic rate increased due to higher salinities, and organisms rely upon osmosis and diffusion for oxygen uptake which is directly related to the specific metabolic rate. In a study measuring hemolymph concentrations of chloride and sodium and osmotic pressure in red swamp crayfish, the data showed that the crayfish hyper regulated their osmotic pressure and ionic concentrations at lower salinities but became isosmotic (hyposmotic) at higher salinities. Therefore, when the crayfish were transferred from freshwater to 2.0% NaCl, the hemolymph osmotic pressure and concentrations of NaCl increased. The hemolymph is the fluid in the crayfish’s body cavities and tissues, and the increased osmotic pressure caused the crayfish to consume more oxygen and therefore increase its metabolic rate. (Newsome 1994). Therefore, salinity affects marine organisms through the processes of osmosis and diffusion, and raising salinity in water is known to increase the osmotic rate in organisms which in then increases the organism’s oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate. Our data did not show this overall trend, and this could be because the oxygen probe used in the experiment was not working correctly and did not accurately measure the actual oxygen consumption of the crayfish in the twenty-minute interval. If we were to expand this study, it would be important to look at different concentrations of NaCl in the water in order to see how various concentrations can affect the crayfish’s oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate.

Figure Legends: 
Effect of salinity on crayfish specific metabolic rate. No added salinity (blue bar) show normal specific metabolic rate of crayfish in oxygen saturated water. Added .65% NaCl (grey bar) cause a decrease in the crayfish specific metabolic rate in oxygen saturated water. Three crayfish were used and used as their own control group, and surrounded by water under the same conditions causing oxygen consumption. Each bar is mean specific metabolic rate of three crayfish from each treatment or control group; error bars are ± .0005013 s.d. for the control and ± .0004016 s.d. for the treatment. T- test results show no significant difference between the two means. (t-stat= 1.8357, df=3, P= .1637). (p> .001).
