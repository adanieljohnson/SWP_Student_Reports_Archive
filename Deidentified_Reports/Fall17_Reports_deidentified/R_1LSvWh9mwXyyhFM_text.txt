Title: Sodium Butyrate's lack of effect on the growth of Physarum in response to a food source.

Abstract:
Many organisms use signal transduction pathways to respond to external stimuli in their environment. This experiment observed the effect of sodium butyrate on the intracellular signal transduction pathways of Physarum. Ca2+ is an important second messenger that triggers a response in the cell by activating calcium dependent enzymes that are important in cell processes, and since sodium butyrate has been proven to inhibit calcium channels then Ca2+ cannot be interpreted by the cell and coordinate a response. A stimulus that Physarum respond to is a food source; they grow toward it. To test this, a treatment group of agar plates was soaked in a 100 uM sodium butyrate. Physarum culture and a food source were added to two separate squares in the agar plates of the treatment group and the controlll group, and then allowed to incubate for twenty-four hours. After this time period, the distance the Physarum grew was measured and a two-sample t_test was done to determine the significance of the data. The results show that the sodium butyrate treatment did not have a significent effect on the growth of the Physarum toward the food source. These results are inconclusive; however, it is important to study the effect of sodium butyrate on Physarum in order to apply it to other organisms.

Introduction:
Physarum are a simple organism, also known as yellow slime mold, that use multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways to carry out their functions and processes. Some of their responses are regulated by G-protein coupled receptors and ion coupled receptors. Physarum respond to chemicals in their environment through a process called chemotaxis in which they either move toward or away from specific chemicals [Johnson, 2016]. Similarly, they respond to food in their environment by crawling toward it. In particular, this lab will observe Physarum’s behavior in response to sodium butyrate, which is known to inhibit the activation of calcium channels. Ca2+ is a second messenger and acts as a stimulus used to trigger a response by the cell, and if sodium butyrate inhibits the activation of calcium channels, then the cell won’t be able to respond to certain external stimulus, such as chemotaxis toward a food source [Johnson, 2016]. Furthermore, sodium butyrate has also been discovered to have other varying effects on cell functions. For example, research revealed that sodium butyrate treated cells showed a downregulation of genes associated with cytokine signaling [Joseph, 2004]. Similarly, sodium butyrate also causes histone hyperacetylation, which then causes effects in cytoskeleton assembly which is involved in the reversal of cell behavior associated with chemically induced movements [Kruh, 1981]. Without cytokine signaling and with defective cytoskeleton, the cell won’t be able to move and respond to stimulus. With all these effects of sodium butyrate in mind, we predict that the treatment group of Physarum will show no movement toward a food source because it won’t be able to respond to the external stimulus. Since, Physarum lack a central nervous system, observing their response to changes in their environment can help us learn more about the signal transduction pathways and compare it to that of other organisms.

Materials and Method:
We made a mixture of one Ml of one 2 mM sodium butyrate and twenty Ml of water and then obtained six water agar plates. Next we made the treatment group by adding five Ml of the 100 uM sodium butyrate mixture to each of three agar plates. Then we let the three agar plates with the mixture sit for ten minutes, and then drained the excess liquid out of the agar plates. The controlll group is the three agar plates without the sodium butyrate mixture. Next we cut two one cm by one cm squares into the middle of the controlll plates and the treatment plates. Then we cut the same size squares out of the Physarum culture and put one square of mold into one square of the six plates, and then put three to four oats in the other square of each of the six plates. Next, each plate was wrapped in foil and labeled correctly. They were all placed in an incubator at 25 degrees Celsius and the distance traveled toward the food source was recorded using a ruler for each Physarum after twenty-four hours. After data was collected, a two-sample t_test was performed to determine the significance of the results.

Results:
After twenty hours, the treatment Physarum showed growth more random and spread out in all directions, while the controlll Physarum showed growth more directed toward the food source. Furthermore, the controlll group had a slightly higher average movement (5.33 cm) than the treatment group (4.67 cm); however, the p_value is 0.6213, which proves these results to be insignificent.

Discussion:
The p_value suggests that our hypothesis is rejected and that we cannot conclude that sodium butyrate decreases the growth of Physarum. While the average distance traveled for the treatment group was slightly less, it was not enough to be significent. These results could be explained by the fact that it was found that sodium butyrate causes an immediate depression of the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein, which should in turn inhibit cell motility; however, after a certain time interval the Physarum can overcome the sodium butyrate block and the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein can return to normal [Loidl, 1982]. Once returned to normal, the cell can continue moving, which in this experiment would be toward its food source. In this case, since we allowed nearly twenty-four hours until measuring the Physarum, it could have been after the Physarum overcame the sodium butyrate block. The fact that the treatment Physarum showed more random movement rather than directly toward the food source could be a result of its signaling pathways being disrupted by the calcium channel inhibition. The sodium butyrate reduced the chemo-attractive effect of the food source on the Physarum, so it grew in all directions rather than toward it. Furthermore, another experiment investigated the effect of sodium butyrate on the lymph node carcinoma of prostate cells and its accompanying effect on calcium channel expression. It explains that sodium butyrate stimulates the differentiation of prostate cells, which causes an increase in the expression of calcium channel expression [Weaver, 2015]. Despite the fact these are prostate cells, this research could be applied generally to Physarum cells and thus explain why the Physarum were able to grow in the sodium butyrate agar despite our initial prediction that their growth would be inhibited. According to this report, sodium butyrate allows the expression of calcium channels and thus allows external signals to be interpreted, which explains why Physarum were able to grow because they could coordinate a response to the food source. On another note, it is possible we did not add enough sodium butyrate to cause an effect on the intracellular signal transduction pathways. Since our results were inconclusive, more experiments involving sodium butyrate and Physarum should be done to help better understand the effect sodium butyrate has on cells considering its potential to stop cell proliferation. Given this, the presence of sodium butyrate in cells has been found to reverse transformation characteristics of cancer cells [Kruh, 1981]. It has potential to inhibit signal transduction pathways, thus preventing the signal to transform healthy cells into cancer cells. Furthermore, sodium butyrate has also been found to induce cell apoptosis [Hague, 2016].  Inducing cell apoptosis could also be important in slowing down the proliferation of cancer cells by inducing cell death in these defective cells. With its potential to deform cytoskeleton, to suppress the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins, to inhibit calcium channels, and to induce cell apoptosis, sodium butyrate seems to be a great candidate to research in order to try to prevent cancer cells from spreading.
