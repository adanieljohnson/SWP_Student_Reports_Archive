Title: Effects of Different Salinity Levels on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Crayfish

Abstract:
Metabolism is the most essential biological process for every living organism. The specific metabolic rate of an organism can change with the environment it is in. The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of different salinity levels on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish. The hypothesis is that the specific metabolic rate of crayfish decreases with increased salinity. Oxygen consumption level is tested in order to estimate the specific metabolic rate and NaCl is added to alter the water salinity levels. However, the results show that there is no significant difference between the specific metabolic rates of crayfish, whether put in a higher salinity level or not (p-value>0.05). For further study, more than two salinity levels should be compared to reach the effect of the hypothesis.



Introduction:

For every living organism, metabolism is the most important process of which energy is converted and transferred within the organism. The specific metabolic rate measures the amount of energy used by all physiological processes per unit body mass per minute [Johnson:2017]. For an animal, its specific metabolic rate can vary with the surrounding environment. In this study, the aim of our research group is to find out the effect of different water salinities to crayfish. Crayfish are used as the model organism since they are easy to obtain and they react to changes in the environment rather quickly. They live in flowing freshwater environment that they are hypertonic to. This means that the crayfish have higher osmotic pressure than that of the freshwater and ions in their body will passively flow into the surrounding water. To prevent too much loss of ions, energy is used by crayfish to retain the ions. According to the study by Nordlie and Leffler, osmoregulation, which is the active regulation to maintain water and ion concentration balance in an organism, is a major energy cost which takes up 25%-50% of resting metabolism. [Nordlie: 1975]. The study by B.Ron et al. also suggests that higher salinity in sea water is the cause for a reduction in the routine metabolic rate of Oreochromis mossambicus [Ron: 1995]. When the salinity of the surrounding water is increased, the differences of concentrations between inside and outside of the crayfish body is decreased. The amount of passively lost ions will decrease and thus the crayfish no longer needs to use as much energy to retain the ion loss. Less energy use, lower metabolic rate is needed. Thus, we hypothesize that when the surrounding salinity is increased, the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish would decrease. 


Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish under different water salinities are estimated through oxygen consumption. Since oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the energy produced by an organism, specific metabolic rate can be calculated. 
The crayfish is weighed before being put into a testing chamber filled with room temperature water saturated with air. The chamber is then put into a dishpan filled with room temperature water. The top of the chamber is sealed after a dissolved O2 probe is inserted into the chamber. Dissolved O2 reading is taken at the start and 5, 10, 15, 20 minute junctions. After the last reading, remaining water volume in the chamber is measured. Next, the process is repeated with the same crayfish in water with higher salinity. To increase the salinity of water, NaCl is added to room temperature water. The salinity will be calculated at the end. The whole experiment is done on two other crayfish to ensure the results are not accidental. The specific metabolic rate is calculated as below:
Specific Metabolic Rate= [amount of oxygen consumed(mg/L) *H2O volume(L)] / [time(min) * weight of crayfish(g)]
To analyze the data, a one tailed paired t-test was conducted between the controlled and treated groups.


Results:
For the treated groups, the average water salinity after the addition of NaCl was 0.73%. As shown in Figure 1, two out of three sets of data showed that the specific metabolic rate of crayfish decreased with the increase in salinity. However, the data from the first trial showed an increase in the specific metabolic rate in contrast with the results of other groups. The one tailed paired t-test comparing the specific metabolic rates of controlled and treated groups resulted in a p-value of 0.26 and a t-value of 1.57.


Discussion:
From the p-value obtained, it is shown that there is not a significant difference between the specific metabolic rates of controlled groups and groups treated with NaCl addition in water (p=0.26>0.05). This does not support the hypothesis that the specific metabolic rate of crayfish will decrease with higher salinity. The possible reason why the first set of data doesn’t match with the trend of the other sets is that during the experiment for the first treated group, the crayfish was very agitated, its constant movement may be the reason of increased oxygen uptake. A similar study was conducted by Sui Y et al., with 4 different salinity levels (0.16, 2.5, 5 and 7.5%) and for longer periods of time (0, 6, 12, 24 and 168 h) [Sui: 2016]. Their results show that appropriate amount of NaCl addition can save the energy used by osmoregulation by blood parrotfish and thus decrease the metabolic rate. However, the effect of this is only temporary. For further study, the effects of different salinity levels should be tested. To understand the effects of water salinity, we can more thoroughly understand the lives of aquatic animals and their health conditions.
