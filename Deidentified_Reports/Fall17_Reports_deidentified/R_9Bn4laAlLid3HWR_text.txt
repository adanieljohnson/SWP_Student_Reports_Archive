Title: The Effects of Sodium Chloride on Photosynthesis in Chloroplasts of Spinacia oleraca 

Abstract:
Saline, an important factor that effects agriculture development specifically in dry areas, is tested for effects on photosynthetic output. The process of photosynthesis relies heavily on the intake of carbon dioxide and the cofactor of light in order to excite electrons and split water molecules. The Hill Reaction is the process by which excited electrons from photosynthesis begin electron transfer in chloroplasts. It is hypothesized that if adding 10% sodium chloride solution to a solution of enriched chloroplast from Spinacia oleraca that the observed absorbance of the chloroplasts will decrease more compared to no sodium chloride. This occurs because an increased salinity will decrease the amount of carbon dioxide exchange and decrease the effect of the Hill Reaction, and thus decrease the activity of chloroplasts and rate of photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are isolated and compared in normal conditions compared to saline conditions. The experiment results were statistically insignificent with a p value equal to 0.4365 because the change in absorbance between the sample with sodium chloride and the sample without sodium chloride did not change significently. Just measuring the chloroplast absorbance alone demonstrated that salinity does not affect the chloroplasts directly. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process through which light energy in addition to carbon dioxide is converted into glucose for energy in plants, protists, and some bacteria. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb radiation from the sun in order to convert that energy into usable energy within the cell through the excitation of electrons. Stomata on plant leaves are vital for photosynthesis because they controlll gas exchange and specifically intake carbon dioxide that is essential to start the photosynthetic reaction [Brugnoli et al: 1991]. Many different factors can affect the multistep process of photosynthesis including the salinity in relation to chloroplasts. It is likely that salinity will reduce the rate of photosynthesis, because it causes an initial water deficit and limits the stomata opening which therefore limits carbon dioxide intake [Diao et al: 2014]. Testing light absorbance of chloroplasts is an effective way to test the impact of sodium chloride on the rate of photosynthesis because of the process of electron transfer that occurs in active chloroplasts called the Hill Reaction. The Hill reaction shows that there is an electron transfer that occurs within chloroplasts that are exposed to light in the presence of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol(DCPIP) as the electron acceptor. The DCPIP will absorb the maximum amount of light at 600nm and the decrease in absorbance at the wavelength will indicate any effects on photosynthesis.  It hypothesized that a decreased absorbance is observed in the active chloroplasts therefore decreasing their ability to conduct photosynthesis. This decrease in absorbance will be measured over time in order to calculate the percent change comparing normal conditions with the saline environment. Spinach leaves, Spinacia oleraca, are tested because many around the world eat spinach every day so it applicable to many people’s diet and thus is a common agriculture crop. Using common crops as testing substances allows us to relate our findings with real world ideas and help farmers improve their crops. Increased salinity is a common effector for soil across the world due to increased soil pH as a result of drought and dry areas in which farmers must use vast amounts of irrigation [Chaves:2008].  The spinach leaves are compared measuring the chloroplast absorbance in a sample with high chloroplast density with no sodium chloride and a sample with sodium chloride in a lighted setting. These other factors like light and increased chloroplast density are also important for increased chloroplasts activity and more photosynthetic output. Light is essential for photosynthesis because it is the initial stimulus that excites the electrons for the Hill Reaction; therefore, increasing light exposure will increase photosynthetic activity and absorbance. Using a sample with a large number of chloroplasts will also increase output because the more chloroplasts then the more output that will be observed. 


Materials and Method:
The spinach leaves must be reduced to only a dense pellet of many chloroplasts in order to isolate them to test the effect of salinity on their photosynthetic output. The experimental groups include a sample of chloroplasts in normal conditions under light, chloroplasts in a 10% saline environment, and a sample with no chloroplasts to compare to make sure the chloroplasts are truly indicating photosynthesis conduct. The central veins of four medium sized spinach leaves are removed and then the leaves are rinsed and put into a chilled mortar and pestle. The leaves and about 20 Ml of grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) are added to the beaker in order to grind the leaves into a thick slurry. The slurry is poured through cheesecloth into a mortar. The paste was placed in a conical tube and spun in the centrifuge at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4ºC. After this, the supernatant was poured into another 50 Ml conical tube and spun in the centrifuge at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4ºC. This resulted in a dense pellet of chloroplasts which is isolated and suspended in another 20 Ml of grinding buffer. There are three replicates of the sample with no chloroplasts, chloroplasts, and chloroplasts with saline. 10 test tubes total are used and each tube has 10 Ml of liquid total and water is added accordingly at the end to fill to this point. All of the tubes have 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) and all tubes except the blank have 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP. The blank has 100 µl enriched chloroplasts added as well as the controlll chloroplasts and the chloroplasts with saline. The tubes for saline chloroplasts have 1 Ml of a 10% sodium chloride solution added. The tubes are mixed after chloroplasts are added and placed into cuvettes. The absorbance of each tube is obtained at 600 nm using the spectrophotometer. This is done 3 times with 10 minute intervals between each and placing the samples back under light after they are tested. The “% Change” in absorbance at 10, 20, and 30 minutes is calculated using the following equation:  % change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at each time interval )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%. Then plot change in absorbance against time for each treatment. Using the change, determine the if the results were significent by using a two sample one-tailed t_test.


Results:
After completing the experiment, the data showed that for samples 1-3, where no chloroplasts were present, the absorbance remained the same with under a 1% change each time. However, in the samples that had chloroplasts and no saline there was a significent decrease in absorbance after each 10 minutes and the percent change in absorbance also increased after each interval. For the sample with chloroplasts and saline, the absorbance did reflect a definite decrease but the percent change remained steady after each 10-minute interval. Figure 1 represents the trends in percent change for each of the groups: no chloroplasts, chloroplasts, and with saline. The graph shows a small change in average percent change between those with just chloroplasts and those with saline. The chloroplasts in the controlll environment had lower absorbances than the chloroplasts in the saline environment. The t_test resulted in a test statistic of -0.167 and a p value of 0.4365 for the sample size of six indicating insignificent data and a rejected hypothesis. 


Discussion:
Based on trends and the results from the t_test, the data does not support the hypothesis that saline will decrease the rate of photosynthesis and decrease the absorbance in chloroplasts because the p_value was not significent. This indicates that salinity does not have an effect on absorbance or photosynthesis. However, this cannot be stated with certainty from these results because it still did decrease the rate of absorbance but just at the same rate of the samples with just chloroplasts indicating that it could have a slight effect. While the saline does cause the stomata to close slightly and decrease carbon dioxide intake, this possibly could not correlate to chloroplast absorbance. The study possibly did not accurately test the right aspect of the leave that is affected by salinity. The stomata are most likely affected by salinity and will close causing a decrease carbon dioxide and a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis. Another study similar to this experiment introduced spinach to a salt stressed environment but gradually increased the amount over a period of three weeks and then harvested the spinach plants to test for growth which is proportional to photosynthesis rate. The spinach plants had much thicker leaves with a decrease in biomass but the plants were still active and growing indicating that there was no correlation between saline and photosynthesis. The most significent finding in this study was the increase in leaf thickness which correlates to the type of plant being spinach. The findings of the study indicated that spinach also has a slight salt tolerance and thus spinach might not be the most ideal plant to test[Robinson et al: 1983]. Further experiments that could help solidify and further explore these findings could include increasing the concentration of sodium chloride added to the chloroplasts and decreasing the time duration between trials. It is possible that a 10% sodium chloride solution was too weak and did not increase the salinity of the chloroplasts enough to affect photosynthesis. Since the initial absorbance change was so much greater than the remaining trials it is possible that the change in photosynthetic rate occurs within a shorter duration. In order to fully understand the impact of sodium chloride and other salts on plants such as spinach, the best experiments would include a wide range of salts that tests living plants over a period of a couple weeks and within short intervals. The rate of photosynthesis is essential for plant and food production so the impact of salinity on plants needs to be further studied in order to ensure optimal conditions for plants and agriculture. For example, experiments about salinity in soil are vital for agriculture because they help farmers determine which types of soils will help them yield the most crops. If increased salinity will cause stomata closing and possibly decreased photosynthetic activity, then agriculturalists will want to avoid soils and pesticides with increased salinity. Climate change that causes regions to become more arid and dry will increase water use and irrigation use which can also increase the salinity of the soil and decrease photosynthetic output. The agriculture industry relies on experiments like these in order to determine the best environment for crops that will help produce the most yield.
