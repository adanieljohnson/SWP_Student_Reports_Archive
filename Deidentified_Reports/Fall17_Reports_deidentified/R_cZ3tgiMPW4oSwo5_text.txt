Title: Dominant Aggression Decreases Specific Metabolic Rate of Crayfish (Procambris sp.)

Abstract:
Metabolic rate is significent in the sense that the metabolism consists of the physical and chemical processes that occur within living cells and organisms for the necessity of maintaining life. In this study, specific metabolic rate and oxygen consumption were the focus of study through the use of crayfish (Procambris sp). This experiment strove to determine, whether or not the metabolic rate of a smaller crayfish would increase after having been exposed to a large, dominate crayfish that would have created social stress for the smaller crayfish. After exposing three smaller crayfish to a designated dominate crayfish, there was a decrease in oxygen consumption and therefore, metabolic rate of the smaller crayfish. This does not support the idea that aggression/social stress lead to an increase in metabolic rate.  


Introduction:
An organism’s metabolism is fundamental in the way that it is the sum of the chemical reactions that take place within each cell of a living organism that provide energy for vital processes and for synthesizing new organic material. The amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific period of time is referred to as its metabolic rate. Metabolic rate can be measured as the rate of heat energy released from an animal’s body (this procedure is known as calorimetry). However, measuring heat released from an animal body with accurate precision requires special equipment, which is often expensive. As a result, physiologists often use a process to measure metabolic rate that is correlated directly with heat production: rate of oxygen consumption. In an article published in 2000, K.A. Sloman set out to explore environmental factors, which lead to changes in specific metabolic rate. The researcher carried out a study where he observed the effects of aggression on metabolism through the use of the brown trout (Salmo trutta). Sloman placed a pair of the species in small, confined aquarium where he allowed one of the trout to establish a social hierarchy by becoming the dominant fish. He found that, the other fish (the smaller one) experienced high levels of social stress as a result of the aggression exhibited by the dominant trout. This led the smaller fish to have an increase in specific metabolic rate, which was measured through oxygen consumption [Sloman:2000]. This experiment is similar to our own as we wish to test the effects of aggression on specific metabolic rate. In order to do this, we will use crayfish (Procambris sp.). We will be measuring the specific metabolic rate of this species through oxygen consumption both before and after exposing the subject to an aggressor (dominate crayfish). This will allow us to study the effects of aggression/social stress on the metabolism of crayfish. We will carry out this experiment with the following hypothesis in mind: if a crayfish is exposed to aggression/social stress, then it will have a significent increase in specific metabolic rate.


Materials and Method:
Begin the experiment by weighing each of the four crayfish in order to ensure that 3 are smaller than the designated dominant crayfish (each crayfish having its metabolic rate measured should weigh at least one gram less as oppose to the dominate crayfish). Next, fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air and set the test chamber into the plastic dishpan. Fill the dishpan with water that has been saturated with air. Place the first of the small crayfish into the test chamber, and screw on the top. When the top is secure, gently refill the container with water so the top overflows slightly. Next, insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber. Make sure that the chamber is completely filled with water. Turn on the instrument and allow reading to stabilize. Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Read The oxygen concentration again at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Next, remove the probe. Carefully pour the water from the test chamber through a funnel into the graduated cylinder and record the volume of the water (volume will be used to determine specific metabolic rate). Refill the chamber with oxygen-saturated water and place the small crayfish into the testing chamber. Place the dominant crayfish into the surrounding dishpan, where it is close to the smaller crayfish. Once again, take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen and then write down the oxygen concentration at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. When finished, unseal the chamber and measure the amount of water used in order to determine specific metabolic rate. Return both the small crayfish and the dominant crayfish to their original holding pens. Repeat this process with the second and third small crayfish. 


Results:
A decrease in SMR was observed after having exposed the smaller crayfish to the aggressive and dominant subject. Each of the three small crayfish exhibited similar results as they inhaled less oxygen and experienced a much lower SMR whenever in the presence of the dominate crayfish. In each of the three trials, the small crayfish seemed unafraid of the larger crayfish. There was minimal interaction between the two subjects in each trail as they maintained their distances and exhibited little to no movement. The controlll group averaged an SMR of 6.57 x 10 ^-4 ±2.59 x 10^-4 g02/(g*min). The experimental group averaged an SMR of 2.32 x10^-4 ±6.52 x 10^-5 g02/(g*min). The data produced a t-value of 2.07 and a p_value of 0.17.


Discussion:
Considering our high p_value (0.17) our data in this experiment does not support our original hypothesis, which stated that the smaller crayfish would experience an increase in specific metabolic rate after being exposed to the aggression of a dominant crayfish. As a result, our null hypothesis could not be rejected. After being exposed to the dominant crayfish, the small crayfish consumed less oxygen from the saturated water and experienced a significent decrease in metabolic rate, which was unexpected (we hypothesized that the presence of a dominate crayfish would lead to aggression/social stress, and therefore cause the smaller crayfish to consume more oxygen). These findings can be interpreted from our results. As we look at figure 1, we see that the controlll group (represented by the black bar) points to a higher SMR than the experimental group (represented by the blue bar). These results point to the idea that the metabolic rate of a species may not increase due to the social stress/aggression caused by a dominate subject. Species in nature may not experience major physiological effects with an established dominate figure (like we had previously predicted). These results, (the decrease in oxygen consumption) may have been a result of (1) the idea that the two crayfish were, although different sizes, close in mass and (2) the idea that by the time the dominate crayfish had been presented, the smaller crayfish had time to relieve itself from the stress imposed by the researchers, who transferred the species from one location to another. The mentioned primary literature yielded results that are contrary to the ones found in this lab. This difference may be accounted by the idea that Sloman carried out his experiment with a larger size difference between his subjects than we did (the dominant trout was always at least 50% bigger than smaller trout). Considering the parameters of our experiment and the contradicting results discussed in the primary literature, there were clearly some limitations, which may have had drastic effects on our results. For example, we were only given four crayfish to carry-out this experiment. Having more crayfish to experiment on could rule out some room for error in the sense that these specific crayfish were simply not affected by the aggression imposed by the dominant crayfish. We also found that the size of the dominant crayfish was a limiting factor to this experiment. This is because the size difference between the dominate and the smaller subjects was not as large as we had hoped (we would have liked the dominate crayfish to have outweighed the smaller crayfish by at least 50% of its body weight). Having used a larger and more dominate crayfish in comparison to the smaller crayfish could have increased aggression and therefore, metabolic rate. The size of the dishpan used in this experiment was also a limiting factor in the sense that it was too large and allowed the crayfish to maintain great distances from one another. A smaller dishpan, which would have forced the crayfish to interact more closely could have also lead to more aggression and therefore, an increase in metabolic rate with regards to the smaller crayfish. With regards to ideas for future study, we suggest exposing the smaller crayfish to other sources of stress in order to determine if that stress leads to a higher metabolic rate. For example, an experiment could include placing a crayfish in the presence of a dominant crayfish, where the two must compete for say, food or a mate. The increase in social stress and aggression between the two subjects could lead to an increase in metabolic rate. Exposing a small crayfish to other types of predators like large fish, otters, or raccoons could also be tested for an increase in metabolic rate. Studies like these can further our knowledge in understanding how natural interactions effect our physiological systems.
