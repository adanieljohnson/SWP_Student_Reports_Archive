Title: Heightened Contraction in Rana pipiens Gastrocnemius after Caffeine Stimulation

Abstract:

	This experiment observed the role of caffeine at the neuromuscular junction, where action potentials transferred from the neuron to the muscle cause contractions. The effect of injecting 200 mM caffeine on the contraction amplitude of the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle was observed, and it was hypothesized that caffeine injection would result in a heightened muscle contraction as compared to the control. Three dissected gastrocnemius muscles were partially detached from the leg and suspended from a force transducer, and electric pulses were sent to initiate contractions in the legs before and after injection of caffeine. A paired t test using the differences in each measured contraction amplitude pre- and post- injection yielded a p value of .040, indicating that contractions post-injection were statistically greater than the control contractions. Caffeine, therefore, was found to stimulate greater contractions in the frog gastrocnemius muscle.



Introduction:
Vertebrate skeletal muscles contract when the cell membrane potential is altered, usually through an action potential (AP) sent from a neuron connected to the muscle cell at a neuromuscular junction. The neuron releases acetylcholine (ACh) to the muscle cell, which depolarizes the muscle membrane and continues the AP. The AP travels down the muscle cell membrane along t tubules, resulting in a chain of protein conformational changes that cause the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to release calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. The ions bind to filaments in the muscle sarcomere, ultimately causing full muscle contractions. This contraction can be induced by depolarizing the muscle with external electrodes, and the force of the resulting contraction measured and displayed in a myogram. 
The effect of caffeine on skeletal muscle contraction was of interest in this experiment. A previous case study that administered caffeine solution to frog (Rana pipiens) skeletal muscle showed that the resulting contractions were heightened [Kumar et al.: 2015]. Another study identified that caffeine acts on the muscle by increasing calcium release, which in turn would lead to a stronger contraction [Isaacson, Sandow: 1967]. 
Rana pipiens provides a good model for skeletal muscle function, since their muscles - namely, the gastrocnemius muscle - function in the same way as other vertebrate skeletal muscles. In this experiment, frog gastrocnemius muscles were directly stimulated by a force generator then injected with .1 mL of 200 mM caffeine before a second set of stimulations. Each leg was its own control, so the difference in contraction amplitude before and after the caffeine injection was analyzed using a one-tailed paired t test. It was hypothesized that after caffeine injection, the frog muscles would have greater muscle contractions.



Materials and Methods:
Frog Leg Preparation: 
	Three frog legs were obtained. The skin was removed and the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated by snipping the bottom end of the muscle at the tendon. The specimens were periodically moistened with Ringer’s solution to prevent drying. The detached end of the muscle was tied off with a looped string and suspended on the hook of the force transducer. The rest of the leg was pinned down and the leg was suspended orthogonally to the transducer and adjusted to create slight tension in the string. Two electrodes were poked through the muscles about an inch apart, and the electrodes were connected to the iWorx box. 

Applying electric stimuli: 
	With the stimulus amplitude set to 1.0 V, pulse width set to 5, frequency set to 1 Hz, an electric current was sent to the first leg. The software was left on Record, and then .1 mL of 200 mM of caffeine was injected into the muscle, carefully injected away from the electrodes. The recording was stopped after about 20 seconds, then a second recording was taken with the same stimulus. The leg was then properly and humanely disposed of and the same process was repeated with the other two legs. 


Results:
After injection of caffeine, the three gastrocnemius muscles stiffened almost immediately, but additional contractions could still be seen when a current was run through the legs. Consequently, it was also observed that the myograms showed an immediate spike upon caffeine injection before more pulses were even sent, leveling to what appeared to be a new resting potential. The caffeine injection into the second leg tested appeared to span only a section of the muscle, while the injections in the first and third leg spread throughout the entire muscle. All three legs showed an increase in contraction amplitude after caffeine injection, averaging a 1.092 V difference from the control (Figure 1). The average contraction amplitudes for the control and caffeine-treated groups were .9646 V and 2.0566 V, respectively, with standard deviations .88184 and .5106, respectively (Figure 1). A paired t-test using the average pulse amplitude from each of the three legs yielded a p value of .040, which is below significance level .05.


Discussion:
Given that p value of .040 obtained from statistical testing was below significance level .05, the null hypothesis is rejected. Thus, the alternate hypothesis is supported: that caffeine injection caused an increase in R. pipiens gastrocnemius contraction. The hypothesis may be better supported by testing a larger sample size of R. pipiens legs, though in this experiment the only apparent discrepancy, which was the uneven spread of caffeine observed in the second muscle tested, still resulted in a p value below .05.
	A pre existing case study suggests that caffeine takes effect by increasing calcium ion release and therefore increasing muscle contraction [Isaacson, Sandow: 1967]. The more calcium there is in a cell, the more ions that bind to actin filaments in sarcomeres and allow for contraction. It is then probable that in this experiment that caffeine affected the gastrocnemius muscles in this way. The mode by which caffeine causes a higher release of calcium may be studied further, as it is possible that caffeine interacts with the muscle on the outer membrane, causing more AP’s by depolarizing the membrane. On the contrary, caffeine may also act by entering the cell and directly opening ryanodine calcium channels in the SR. This can be tested by pairing caffeine injection with a blocker of DHP, a mechanically receptive protein that connects the SR ryanodine channel and t tubule and is crucial to transferring the AP signal to the ryanodine channel in order to release calcium. If caffeine directly opens the SR channels via interaction with ryanodine, this blocker should have no effect on the release of calcium and on muscle contraction, but if caffeine amplifies the AP along the membrane, deactivating DHP would stop the signaling pathway and prevent contraction entirely. A future experiment, then, can retain this procedure except add in a first injection of a DHP deactivator.
