Title: Cold water lowers specific metabolic rate in crayfish, Procambarus spp.,

Abstract:
We predicted that if crayfish are subjected to room temperature water and water at 12 degrees Celsius, then the specific metabolic rate will be lower in the colder water. We used Procambarus spp. to test the effects of cold water on specific metabolic rate for ecotherms. The oxygen consumption was measured for twenty minutes in a control room temperature environment and a cold (12 degrees Celsius) water environment. Our results showed cold temperatures lowered the specific metabolic rates in crayfish. This is because the cooler environment slows down the bodily processes and thus lowers energy consumption.  Statistically, our results are significant. Our P value was .01360. Clearly, our results support our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Metabolic rate is the measure of energy consumption in an organism. Specific metabolic weight is this energy consumption with weight divided out so that it can be compared without weight being a factor [Johnson: 2016].  Measuring ATP or NAD+ production would be difficult. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain and energy production would stop almost immediately without its presence [Johnson: 2016]. Because of this, there is a direct correlation between oxygen gas consumption and energy consumption. Thus, we can calculate specific metabolic rate. We will use three crayfish to test the effect of cold water on specific metabolic rate. Under colder temperatures, ecotherms’ bodily processes slow down so we predict that the specific metabolic rate will be lower when crayfish are subjected to colder water [Johnston: 1987]. The slower bodily processes will use less energy. The crayfish are a great subject of study because they are small, easy to handle, and easy to take care of. They are endothermic and will survive in tap water. A paired t test will be used in the analysis of our data. This experiment will help us understand how temperature directly effects activity and energy availability for ectotherms. 

Materials and Methods:
First, obtain three Procambarus spp. crayfish of similar and large size. Each crayfish will be tested in cold and room temperature water. Use ice to cool the water to 12 degrees Celsius. For the control test, fill up the jar to the brim with 22 degrees water and place it in a bin full of water. Weigh the crayfish and place it in the jar. Screw on the lid with the probe letting the jar overflow so that there is no air in the jar. Use the oxygen gas sensor setup to record the baseline oxygen gas concentration. Start a twenty-minute timer and record the O2 concentration at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. Remove the lid and crayfish. Measure the volume of water and record. Repeat this test but using iced water at 12 degrees Celsius and place in a bin of water that is also iced. This is the treatment test and both tests should be performed to each of the three crayfish. Return crayfish to their storage bins. A paired t test will be used to analysis the results. The control temperature will be used to see how the cold-water effects specific metabolic heart rate. 
From the data recorded, the specific metabolic rate is calculated by multiplying the oxygen gas consumption by the volume of water and then dividing this value by the product of the time elapsed and the weight of the crayfish.

Results:
In figure one, it is clear that for each crayfish, colder water lowered the specific metabolic rate.  The results in this case are shown individually because for crayfish two, the treatment group specific metabolic rate was much higher than all the other crayfish specific metabolic rate so it is much more helpful to compare the specific metabolic rates of each individual crayfish. The p value for this data was .01360. Being less than .05, these results are significant. The degree of freedom was 2 and the t value was 8.49. The treatment groups clearly had lower specific metabolic rates.

Discussion:
From our result, observations, and our statistical analysis, our hypothesis that cold water would lower the specific metabolic rate of crayfish was supported.  Each crayfish showed a higher specific metabolic rate in the warm water than the cold water (figure 1). The fact that specific metabolic rate was lower in each case shows that energy consumption dropped with temperature. One thing to note when looking at this figure is that crayfish 2 had much larger specific metabolic rates for both warm and cold water. This makes an average comparison difficult because the values of the treatment type would overlap for the crayfish. The difference in O2 consumption as a whole is unimportant so this does not affect the significance of our results. Comparatively between each crayfish, the results support our hypothesis. The p value for this data is .01360. This is less than .05 so our results are statistically significant. Clearly, the cooler water slowed down the bodily process in the crayfish and caused them to consume less energy [Campbell: 2017].  This in turn significantly decreased the specific metabolic rate. Future studies could look at how different levels of colder temperatures affect energy consumption in crayfish. A similar study was done on the effects of cold temperature on Procambarus spp.  It was found that the decrease temperature in their species of fish caused chemical changes that decreased specific metabolic rate [Johnston: 1987].  This goes along with our results and the support of our hypothesis.
