Title: Determining the intraspecific and interspecific Aggression of Betta splendins 

Abstract:
Understanding the aggression of Betta splendins is important to understand intraspecific interactions.   In this experiment, one male Betta splendins was allowed to view three different Betta splendins and also three gold.f.ish or, Carassius auratus.  The interactions that the one male Betta splendins were quantified with numbers.  In this study, two interactions were specifically observed, the red mane and tail flicking.  The male Siamese fighting fish, was allowed to see the other fish for only five minutes.  The average scores of the trials were added and also the rate of points per minute was calculated.  In this experiment, we found that Betta splendins do indeed display more aggression towards its own species because there was a significent difference between the two treatment groups.

Introduction:
Competition effects various aspects of everyday life for not only humans, but also for every living organism.  Competition, or the battle for scarce resources, is one of the driving forces of natural selection and consequently evolution.  Organisms compete with other species to for finite resources (interspecific competition), and also species fight within their own species (intraspecific competition)[Johnson: 2017]. One species that exhibits intraspecific competition is that of Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish.  Male Betta splendins show aggressive behaviors when they are in contact with other Siamese fighting fish [Nídia: 2006].  During confrontation, the two-fish exchange information about their readiness and their ability to fight [Nidia: 2006].  Betta splendins will fight each other aggressively and the conflict might end with a fish severely hurt and this concept is the basis of our experiment.  The aim of this study was to test if Betta splendins displayed the same amount of aggression towards Carassius auratus, or gold.f.ish.  To accomplish this, our group allowed Betta splendins to see one another, and we repeated the same procedure but instead allowed a Siamese fighting fish to see gold.f.ish.  To quantify the data, during confrontation we observed the Betta splendins and we assigned certain interactions with point values.  The inflation of the red mane a point value of 1, and the tail flicking as 2 (the higher the point value, the more aggressive the behavior was).  Our hypothesis for the experiment was that Betta splendins would display a difference in the aggressive behaviors between the intraspecific aggression and the interspecific aggression.  

Materials and Method:
For this experiment there was a total of four Betta splendins and 3 gold fish that were used.  The gold fish and the betta fish were placed in separate tanks.  All of the fish were separated so that each fish could not see each other.  One Betta splendins (betta fish #1), was chosen to interact with the 3 other betta fish and 3 gold fish.  To start the experiment, the opaque divider was lifted so betta fish #1 could see another betta fish.  Betta fish #1’s was closely monitored.  Every time, the fish inflated its red mane, a score of 2 was given.  Every time there was a tail flick, a score of 1 was given. The maximum time that was set for the interaction between the two betta fish was 5 minutes, but if it seemed that the betta fish #1 became uninterested, or habituated to the other fish, the observations stopped and a total time was recorded for the length of interactions.  Before trying another round, there was a minimum of five minutes resting time.  This same procedure was repeated for another two betta fish and three gold fish.  After the experiment, the total points for each round were calculated (the higher the score, the higher the aggression).  A rate of points per minute was also calculated, since not every trial lasted the same length of time.  A table was created with the data collected and two graphs were created.  One for the point total, and one for the rate of points per minute.  A statistical test, a two-sample t_test was used to verify the significance of the results.

Results:
There was a drastic difference in the aggressiveness score and rates between the intraspecies interactions and the interspecies interactions.  Figure 1 shows that the average the average aggressiveness score for the intraspecies interactions to be 48 points while Figure 2 shows 10.34 pts per minute.  The interspescies point totals and rates were lower with an average of 8.667 points and a rate of 2.933 points per minute.  The total points of aggressiveness (t_stat = 6.45 , d.f. = 4, P = 0.004).  and their rates (t_stat = 6.07, d.f. = 4, P = 0.003).  were significently different.  

Discussion:
The hypothesis that Betta splendins would show less aggression towards gold.f.ish was supported by the data that was collected because there was a significent contrast between the intraspecific and the interspecific interactions.  There was also a significent difference when the rate (pts/min) was calculated.  What is interesting though, is that the standard deviations varied greatly between the average points metric and the rates.  There was a smaller standard deviation between the two experimental groups in regard to points per minute, than total points accumulated.  This result was also replicated in another study where Betta splendins were subjected to different stimulus to invoke the aggressive behaviors.  In the experiment, the betta fish had a higher frequency to minute show of aggression towards the antagnostic stimulus than the neutral stimulus [Nidia].  This clear separation between intraspecific and interspecific aggression was replicated in another study with Betta splendins and catfish.  In one study, it was shown that Siamese fighting fish indeed were able to distinguish the catfish from its own species and fail to display the same amount of aggression [Johnson: 1973].  Within the same study, it was noted that Betta splendins did indeed attack the catfish but since the catfish did not reciprocate the aggression, the betta fish stopped the aggression [Johnson: 1973].
	The many reasons why Betta splendins display this aggressive intraspecific behavior.  One of these root causes of this behavior is territoriality [Begon: 2015].  Territory and its habitats and resources within the territory are finite, so it is rational to believe that Betta splendins exert energy to protect their limited resources.  By protecting their territory, they are able to survive and meet their metabolic requirements which will ultimately allow them to reproduce and increase their fitness [Begon: 2015].  Within this experiment, only male Betta splendins were used, and like what was said before, there was a sizeable amount of aggression towards the other males.   The aggression shown towards other males within the same species may also be attributed to the competition for mates, with the “strongest” or most aggressive fish being the one who is able mate with the females.
	Energy conservation is one reason why Betta splendins show variable levels of aggression with other species other than its own.  Siamese fighting fish spend a lot of energy engaging in these fights to show superiority [Nidia: 2006].  To help conserve energy, Siamese fighting fish use display actions first, before actually engaging in contact, which is much more energetically costly [Nidia: 2006].  In order to “win”, betta fish usually have to expend more energy than its opponent [Nidia: 2006].  Since, other species of fish are not competing for the same mates, it would be unreasonable for a Betta splendins to expend a lot of energy, since it would be a lost cause.
	There were inherent issues within our experiment that need to be addressed.  Even though we took great lengths to quantify the aggression of the Betta splendins, ultimately, there was still some subjectivity to the allocation of points.  Sometimes it was uncertain if the fish had inflated its red mane or if it had flicked its tail.  Also, there was only 2 characteristics that were observed, which might have skewed the data in either direction.  To improve this experiment, I would implement a more sophisticated manner of collecting data.  I believe tracking oxygen consumption of the Betta splendins in intra and interspecific interaction would be able to more accurately quantify aggression, since a higher O2 consumption rate would correlate to a higher metabolic rate and consequently more aggression.
	Intraspecific interactions are not exclusive to Betta splendins.  It is a natural phenomenon, which like what was stated before, might help an individual increase their fitness.  It is important to keep this in mind not only for its ecological implications, but also for the everyday lives of humans because competition seems to drive people to do better.  It also will likely help the species evolve.  The interactions between Betta splendins, even though it is much more extreme, and the competition between humans and all other species are closely related to each other.
