Title: Testing the Effects of 200 mM Caffeine on Rania pipiens Leg Muscle Contraction Amplitude

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to determine if caffeine causes a significent difference in the muscle amplitude of a frog’s (Rania pipiens) gastrocnemus muscle. We hypothesized that the 200mM caffeine we injected into the frog leg during our experiment would result in an increased muscle contraction amplitude when compared to the controlll group that would not be injected. When looking at the graphs, we first noticed that there seemed to be a significent difference in muscle contraction amplitude between the controlll and treatment groups. After performing the one-tailed paired t statistical test, we determined that the difference was significent in the controlll and treatment groups of a frog leg, supporting our initial alternate hypotheses. We believe this may have occurred because of increased levels of Ca2+ in the frog muscle.


Introduction:
Nerves help organisms respond quickly to stimuli in their environments. A frog muscle is a straightforward way to study how muscle nerves respond to stimuli because frogs are easily available to study and a frog’s muscles are sensitive to muscle stimulation. In this case, Caffeine will be the stimuli affecting the frog muscle nerves being tested. The independent variable 200mM caffeine will be injected into the frog leg, while the dependent variable will be the amplitude of the frog leg’s muscle contractions. 
Muscle contractions are caused by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine’s release, triggering the cell membrane’s depolarization, this depolarization of the neuron cell, causes Calcium ions to bind to the troponin, exposing myosin-actin binding sites. The binding of actin and myosin is the cause of muscle contraction. In the Isaacson and Sandow article [1967], Caffeine was discovered to cause an increase in 45Ca. This increase in 45Ca resulted in increased muscle contraction for the frog Sartorius muscle. We used this study to develop our own hypothesis about how caffeine would affect the gastrocnemus muscle in the frog. Although the gastrocnemus muscle is different from the Sartorius muscle, we still expect that the 200mM caffeine injected into the frog leg during our experiment will result in an increased muscle contraction amplitude. We believe that the caffeine will cause an increase in the calcium ions in the Sartorius muscle, this increase will make myosin and actin bind more easily, causing a higher muscle contraction amplitude.


Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, we began with preparing the frog leg muscle for testing. First, pulled the skin off of the frog leg and separated the gastrocnemus muscle from the rest of the frog leg, leaving a small amount of Achilles tendon. Then, we then tied two loops around the Achilles tendon so that the muscle could be attached to the force transducer. After checking the tension of the string connected to force transducer to ensure stable muscle contractions, we inserted the red and blue electrodes into the gastrocnemus muscle. Next, we changed the settings in the iWorks software to allow the muscle to contract five times at 1.0V. This would be our results for the controlll group. After recording each amplitude of each muscle contraction wave, we made the muscle contract five more times at 1.0V, then injected the gastrocnemus muscle with 200mM caffeine after the fifth contraction. We continued recording data for five more contractions in order to obtain our results for the treatment group. We repeated this for each of the three frog legs. After the experiment was conducted we used a one-tailed paired t_test to analyze the data of the controlll and treatment groups.


Results:
While testing the controlll, the muscle was contracting normally and contractions were easily observed, however, after it was injected with the caffeine, the muscle became very stiff and contractions were more difficult observe. Our results are displayed in Figure 1, the five muscle contractions averaged for each leg trial in the controlll and treatment groups. The average muscle contraction amplitude was obtained by finding the mean if the leg trial averages. The average amplitude of the controlll group was 0.447733333m, with a standard deviation of 0.10972965. The average muscle contraction of the treatment group was 1.337m with a standard deviation of 0.12765798. As displayed in figure 1, the caffeine treatment group had a larger muscle contraction amplitude than the controlll group. After running the one-tailed paired t_test, it appeared that the controlll group and the caffeine treatment group had a great statistical difference because our p_value was less than our alpha value 0.05. (t_stat = 17.157196, degrees of freedom = 2, P-value = 0.00338)


Discussion:
Our alternate hypothesis was supported biologically and statistically. When looking at the graph, the mean of the muscle contraction amplitude for the treatment group is higher than the mean of the controlll group. After conducting the one-tailed t_test, a significent statistical difference was displayed between muscle contraction amplitude in the controlll and treatment groups. This means that both the alternate biological hypothesis and alternate statistical hypothesis are supported. I believe that there a large statistical difference as a result of caffeine injections because after the frog muscle is injected the muscle is more stimulated by increased Ca2+ causing higher muscle contractions. The contractions in the controlll group cannot reach the same amplitude because they cannot produce the same amount of Ca2+ ions needed to produce larger muscle contractions. Based on the observation of the myograms in this experiment, there is one large jump in amplitude after the frog muscle is injected with caffeine, the muscle reaches a certain threshold, chemical induced tetany results, and there is a much higher amplitude growth when compared to the controlll group. Similar to Isaacson and Sandow, we observed major differences as the result of caffeine being injected into the frog leg muscle. 
	To further this experiment, I would change the concentrations of caffeine injected in the frog muscle. I want to know if the amount of caffeine injected into the muscle has an impact on muscle contraction amplitude. I believe that this could be a significent scientific discovery because people who exercise may want to know how much caffeine will help them have the best workout and if too much caffeine can be detrimental.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 Displays the average muscle contraction amplitude for the 3 controlll group legs tested (muscle before caffeine injection) and the 3 treatment group legs tested (after muscle injection) of Rania pipiens. The 3 averages for both the treatment and controlll groups were determined by first averaging the muscle amplitude of each frog leg trial, then finding the mean of all three of these trials. The trial data averaged for the controlll group were 0.5664m, 0.475m, and 0.3018m. The trial data averaged for the treatment group were 1.5168m, 1.2612m, 1.233m. The data bars represent the average amplitude of each muscle contraction group and the error bars represent the standard deviations of both the controlll and treatment groups, Control=0.45m with a standard deviation of 0.10972965 and Treatment=1.34m with a standard deviation of 0.12765798. The average contraction values for each group have been rounded to be more easily read on the graph. The results from the two-tailed paired t statistical test were (t_stat = 17.157196, degrees of freedom = 2, P-value = 0.00338)
