Title: Plant Allocation of Energy to Roots and Shoots Tested Through Crowding

Abstract:
Understanding the rewards plants gain from resource allocation is essential to understanding why plants grow the way that they do in different environments and circumstances they are affected by. One of these specific circumstances is the vicinity that plants are in with other plants, also known as crowding. To test the influence that crowding has on resource allocation in Vigna radiata, specifically root to shoot ratio, we collected data from six pots of V. radiata. Three of these pots were planted with a V. radiata sample in each corner, these pots represented uncrowded situations. Three pots were planted with the surface completely covered by V. radiata plants, these pots represented crowded situations. When root to shoot ratio was determined from samples in these pots, it was determined that crowding did not have a significant effect on root to shoot resource allocation. These results suggested that while recourse allocation was most likely taking place, the crowded plants simply grew thinner longer roots, keeping the root to shoot ratio within a very similar range to that of the uncrowded samples.
Key Words: Allocation, Crowding, Root to Shoot Ratio

Introduction:
Allocation is the ability to divide energy into different strategies that allow plants to thrive in the conditions they are specifically placed under (Waite & Hutchings, 1982). Plants have a total amount of energy they can produce through photosynthesis, however, they can allocate this energy in whatever way helps them succeed the most in their environment. For instance, if a plant is growing in a forest and is covered by a thick canopy and is struggling to receive enough sunlight to photosynthesize, it will allocate energy to growing taller to receive more sunlight(Johnson AD, 2017). This is what makes it possible for plants to thrive in almost any condition, and why you see so many different species of trees all across the world.
Crowding is the distance between plants growing in the vicinity of each other(Bosner & Aarssen, 2004). If plants are growing within very close vicinity of one another they can be said to be very crowded, while on the other hand, if plants are planted at a large distance from one another they would not be considered to be very crowded(Weiner, 2004). Crowding is a major factor in survival of plants, and is one of the main reasons that you will not often see successful large trees growing right next to each other. People are the same way. If your family has a set amount of food they can consume each day and this is equivalent to four servings, you will grow much more and be much healthier if you are only sharing with three other people compared to seven. Whether it be a human or a plant, competing for nutrients is essential, and it is much less stress on an organism if it isn’t competing in crowded conditions.
With plants having the ability to allocate resources in ways they best see fit, and the issue of crowding growth, we were interested to see if we could find a correlation between plant root size and crowding. To do this we looked at the root to shoot ratio(weight of root divided by weight of shoot) of plants in crowded positioning and of plants in uncrowded positioning. We predicted that since plants growing in crowded situations would need to compete for resources with one another they would need to allocate more energy to growing larger roots to out compete one another, hence leading to a larger root to shoot ratio than the plants growing in uncrowded positioning.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we started by planting six pots of Vigna radiata. The pots were filled with vermiculite that had been soaked in water, with a small layer of dry vermiculite at the top of the pot. Seeds were planted so that they covered the entirety of the surface of each pot, and then gently covered with the dry layer of vermiculite. Each pot was then watered, and placed in a tray, which was placed in a greenhouse. The pots were then left in the greenhouse for two weeks, being watered each day except for weekends. After the plants began to sprout, three of the pots had every plant removed except for four, one in each corner(Figure 1), these were deemed the "uncrowded pots". After two weeks of growth, the plants were then removed from the greenhouse and carefully harvested. Four plants were removed from each pot(these were all the plants in the uncrowded pots, and 4 randomly picked in the crowded pots) carefully so as not to harm the roots, and separated by pot. Each plant was then carefully weighed and data was recorded. Each plant was then cut at the part of the stem where the root and shoot meet. The roots and shoots were then carefully weighed and data was recorded. The root to shoot ratio was then calculated by dividing the root weight by the shoot weight for each plant. The mean value of all crowded plants' total weight, shoot weight, root weight, and root to shoot value was then calculated. The mean value of all uncrowded plants' total weight, shoot weight, root weight, and root to shoot value was then calculated. Next, the standard deviation of each of the mean values calculated was then determined. Finally, the data were analyzed for significance when it came to differing root to shoot ratios, using a one tailed, two sample T-test.

Results:
The uncrowded samples of V.radiata's full weight, shoot weight, root weight, and root to shoot ratio can be seen in table 1. The mean weight of the uncrowded samples was 1.9 grams±.531 grams. The mean weight of the uncrowded samples' roots was .6875 grams±.34 grams. The mean weight of the uncrowded samples' shoots was 1.165 grams±.068. The mean root to shoot ratio of the uncrowded samples was .59±.221.
The crowded samples of V.radiata's full weight, shoot weight, root weight, and root to shoot ratio can be seen in table 2. The mean weight of the uncrowded samples was .341±.167 grams. The mean weight of the crowded samples' roots was 1.26±.054 grams. The mean weight of the crowded samples' shoots was .211±.13 grams. The mean root to shoot ratio of the crowded samples was .75±.38.The summarized results of the V. radiata samples can be seen in figure 2.
When root to shoot ratio was analyzed using a 1 tailed, 2 subject t-test the results were not significant for root to shoot ratio differences in crowded V. radiata and uncrowded V. radiata samples (t=1.42, df=22, p=.85). This means that crowding does not have a direct correlation with a larger root to shoot ratio.

Discussion:
When it came to our experiment it was determined that crowding did not have a significant effect on root to shoot weight ratio in V. radiata. Our root to shoot ratio average weights for crowded plant samples and uncrowded samples were very similar, however there were many factors that could have caused this to be simply accredited to error. First of all, human error could have played a huge role in these results. We did not plant the samples with extreme precision, due to the fact that we could not guarantee all of the seeds would sprout. We also did not water the plants with the exact same amount of water each day, the water samples were not measured. We also had issues when it came to removing the plants from the soil in order to weigh them. We cannot be certain that root pieces did not break off, and human error definitely led to flawed results when it came to the crowded plants. When removing the crowded plants we attempted to do this in a random way, however we were not able to very successfully remove plants from the middle of the pot, and therefore had to take plants from the outside of the pot. Also, due to the fact that the roots were so much more intertwined in the crowded plants(seen in figure 3) there was a much higher chance that more of the roots were broken off when removing these plants than were broken off in the uncrowded samples.
When it came to simply looking at our plant samples and analyzing what was seen it was fairly easy to see that allocation was in fact occurring. The uncrowded plants stood much straighter than the crowded plants, looked much healthier than the crowded plants, and had much thicker larger leaves, as well as more leaves(figure 4 and 5). These observations would lead us to believe that the uncrowded plants had an easier time getting nutrients from the soil, and could therefore allocate more resources to growing their stems and leaves. However, while the heights of the plants all seemed to be similar, the leaves and thicker stalks of the uncrowded samples resulted in heavier weights. These results are consistent with figure 6(Weiner, 2004).These observations were then supported when looking at the root growth of the samples. The roots of the uncrowded samples were much more spread out and thick than those of the crowded plants(figures 7 and 8). The uncrowded plants' roots were able to spread out more easily to get resources and therefore could grow thick. On the other hand the crowded roots had to grow longer and thinner and could not spread out at all due to needing to compete for resources.
While height measurements were not made during this experiment, and we therefore cannot attribute any height differences to allocation, this would be an interesting change to the experiment in the future. Looking at how heights differed in the uncrowded and crowded plants could help to show significance between allocation root to shoot weight and root to shoot heights. This could show that crowded plants were in fact more sickly and had more roots that were simply longer thinner roots than those of the uncrowded plants.
The implications of this experiment, and future experiments would simply be to show that plants to in fact allocate their resources in simple condition differences. This is not a matter of proving an unknown fact, but simply giving more evidence to an already known and supported theory(Reekie, Bazzaz, 1987).
