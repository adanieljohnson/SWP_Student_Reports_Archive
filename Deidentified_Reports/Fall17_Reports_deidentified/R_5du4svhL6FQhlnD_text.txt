Title: The Effect of Light and Darkness Yielded No Statistical Significance on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus Sp. 

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to measure the effects of light and darkness on the specific metabolic rate of three Procambarus sp. The three Procambarus sp. are of the same species and only vary in size by a small number. We measured the dissolved oxygen content in a mason jar with the crayfish in them using a probe and then used that dissolved oxygen number to calculate the specific metabolic rate. We hypothesize that the specific metabolic rate will decrease with darkness because as the environment gets darker the temperature gets colder and oxygen consumption decreases and so does the specific metabolic rate. The p-value was 0.167904 mg O2/min g which is insignificant, there is no significance between the control or experimental group. Given there is no significance difference, the absence of light does not affect specific metabolic rate.   


Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to determine the effects of light on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish, Procambarus sp. The independent variable is the variation of dark periods or light periods. The independent variable is the specific metabolic rate. 

Within an experiment that studied body temperatures and metabolism of the Agamid Lizard, Amphibolurus barbatus found that as body temperature increased the oxygen consumption also increased [Bartholomew & Tucker: 1963]. Their body temperature changed as the temperature in the environment changed. Something that differs from our experiment to the experiment cited earlier are that lizards are terrestrial ectotherms, whereas crayfish are aquatic ectotherms. But, lizards are ectotherms and so are crayfish which is why it could make sense why both species could react the same way and leads me to make my hypothesis. Another thing to take into consideration to make an appropriate hypothesis is how oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate are related. Oxygen consumption is directly related to specific metabolic rate. Within cold temperatures, oxygen consumption is decreased which is another reason for our hypothesis. [Sadava, et. al.: 2016]. Because of this information we hypothesize that the specific metabolic rate will increase when the temperature of the water gets colder, therefore in the dark or in the absence of light rather than the light periods. 




Materials and Methods:
1. Fill the mason-jar or testing chamber with room temperature water that’s been saturated with air. 
2. Place the test chamber in an empty plastic dishpan filled with room temperature water. 
3. Weigh the crayfish and then place it into the test chamber, fill the container with more room temperature water up to the rim of the container. 
4. Screw on the top of the test chamber with the probe with it. 
5. Turn on the instrument to let it stabilize. 
6. Once it stabilizes, take the measurement of that as your baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. 
7. At 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes read the dissolved oxygen concentration with the instrument. 
8. Unscrew the top and remove probe after the 20 minutes. 
9. Pour the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder and measure that volume to get the volume of the Procambarus sp.
10. Wrap aluminum foil around the test chamber so that it is completely covered. 
11. Repeat steps 1-9 with the next two Procambarus sp.
12. Lastly, calculate the specific metabolic with the following equation for every Procambarus sp.

specific metabolic rate = O2 (mg/L)volume of H2O (L)/time(min) weight (g)




Results:
The p-value is 0.167904. This means that the p-value is not significant because it is larger than 0.05. The control’s average is 0.000605667 mg O2/min g  and the standard variation is 0.000229106 mg O2/min g . The average is calculated from the average of specific metabolic rate average of the two crayfish. The experimental average is 0.001488667 mg O2/min g and the standard deviation is 0.000503156 mg O2/min g. This shows that there is a stronger variation for the experimental group than the control’s.


Discussion:
We refute the hypothesis because there was no statistical difference between the control and experimental groups. But in an experiment that studied the effects of light intensity on two species of crayfish, Procambarus clarkii and Procambarus digueti established conditions of high irradiance conditions of two different light periods, one that was dark and one with extreme light conditions. These conditions were held constant for two weeks. Which can be a certain reason for why we got our certain results. In our experiment we used the same genus but our methods were not the same. They held their experimentals and controls for a longer duration of time than we did. Therefore it can be said that specific metabolic rate needs to be measured in a longer period of time. This experiment also marked that the metabolic rate of crayfish is affected by changes in environmental conditions. These two species of crayfish differ from the crayfish that we did our experiment on though. The Procambarus digueti originates from hot and tropical regions and their main habitat is that of shallow and very oxygenated waters. The other species of crayfish that this study tested on was the Procambarus clarkii that’s habitat is of high latitudes. The results of this experiment concluded that high irradiance in both the normal and high light periods resulted with a decline in oxygen consumption. Therefore when there was more light oxygen consumption decreased.  [Fanjul-Molesa, et. al. :1998] Within our own experiment, 

Some limitations that this experiment encountered was the stress that was most likely induced on the Procambarus sp from being left in light to a rapid change to darkness. This could have stressed the creatures enough to actually cause the increase in specific metabolic rate. Another limitation that was experienced was the late start of stabilization of the instrument that was used to calculate the dissolved oxygen. It was not consistent in reading the dissolved oxygen number at the very moment of 5 minutes, but alternatively it took longer for that to occur. That could have given some skewed data.  For future experiments, there should be a resting period implemented to allow a more relaxing transition between periods of light and darkness. Also maybe increasing the space that the crayfish was in could help reduce stress levels. Another thing to take into consideration with space is the idea that if it’s a small space this limits movement and metabolic rate and oxygen consumption as is. To expand our knowledge on the biological process of ectotherms and crayfish in general we could mimic their habitats to understand all that affects specific metabolic rate. This should also be taken into consideration for next experiments that are trying to see the true outcomes of specific metabolic rate because movement affects this. Because this was only tested on three Procambarus sp. a few other test trials could better improve results.

Figure Legends: 
 Figure 1. Figure 1 shows an increase in average specific metabolic rate from control to experimental (dark). The standard deviation, as noted by the error bars show that the experimental group has a larger variation than the control group. T-test results show that specific metabolic rates to show no significance since the p-value is 0.167904.
