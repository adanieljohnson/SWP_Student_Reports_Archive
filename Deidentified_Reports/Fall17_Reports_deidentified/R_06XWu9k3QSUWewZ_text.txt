Title: Exercise Does Not Affect Specific Metabolic Rate in Crayfish, Procambris spp. 

Abstract:
In this study, we looked at the effects of exercise on specific metabolic rate in crayfish, Procambris spp. We hypothesized that exercise would increase the specific metabolic rate in the crayfish. We used an oxygen probe to determine the oxygen consumption of the crayfish before and after they exercised for two minutes, then calculated specific metabolic rate from the data we collected. A paired t_test gave us a p_value of 0.568; this told us the difference between the average SMR before exercise and the average SMR after exercise was not statistically significent. Our hypothesis that exercise would increase SMR was rejected. This may be due to the fact that the exercise was very stressful for the crayfish. Stress can cause animals to respire anaerobically. Additionally, the crayfish paused intermittently during their two minutes of exercise, so they may not have exercised enough to affect their specific metabolic rates.

Introduction:
Metabolic rate refers to the sum total of energy produced by all the physiological processes that are happening in an organism at a specific time [Johnson: 2016]. One of these physiological processes is glycolysis, the process of converting glucose into energy [Sadava: 2017]. During this process, glucose gets split into pyruvate, becomes acetate, and is released as carbon dioxide. During the process of glycolysis, which occurs in the mitochondria of the cell, electrons are released and travel around in an electron transport chain. Energy released by electrons is used to convert ADP to ATP [Johnson: 2017]. During exercise, glycolysis becomes increasingly important; sustained exercise requires high rates of oxidation of metabolic fuels [Suarez: 1992]. In other words, working muscles require more oxygen so that they can generate more ATP through the process of glycolysis [Jensen: 2012]. In this lab, we tested how exercise affected specific metabolic rate in crayfish, Orconectes rusticus. We measured oxygen consumption as a proxy for specific metabolic rate. Crayfish make good subjects because tire quickly, and it is easy to measure how much oxygen they are taking in from their environment because they live in fresh water. We hypothesized that specific metabolic rate in crayfish would increase after exercise. 

Materials and Method:
We obtained three small crayfish from a tank of water that had been kept at approximately 23° Celsius. We began by taking the mass of one of the crayfish. We then placed the crayfish in a glass testing chamber that we had filled with the saturated, room temperature water we had previously stored the crayfish in. Immediately after placing the crayfish in the chamber, we screwed on a top with an oxygen probe inserted in it and measured the amount of oxygen present in the water in the chamber. We used the oxygen probe to measure the oxygen concentration of the water again after 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, we took the crayfish out and carefully poured the water from the chamber into a graduated cylinder to determine the volume. Next, we obtained a bin and covered the bottom of it with water. We placed the crayfish in the bin and poked it so that it ran around for two minutes. We put the fish back in the chamber with new water from the 23° Celsius tank, and, again, measured the dissolved oxygen concentration at 0 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes. We repeated this whole process over again with the next two crayfish. When the crayfish were not being studied, they were stored in individual tanks of room temperature water. Specific metabolic rate for all the trials was calculated from oxygen consumption, weight, volume of water in the chamber, and time. A paired t_test was used to determine if there was a significent difference between specific metabolic weight before and after exercise. 

Results:
In crayfish #1, we found that exercise increased specific metabolic rate, but in crayfish #2 and #3 we found that specific metabolic rate decreased after exercise. The average SMR before exercise was 0.003652 mg/min*g, and the average SMR after exercise was 0.00452133 mg/min*g. As Figure 1 displays, the SMR was higher after exercise. 


Discussion:
The difference between the average specific metabolic rate of the crayfish before and after exercise was not statistically significent. Our hypothesis that metabolic rate would increase after exercise was rejected. Our results do not align with much of the data that has been published on exercise and specific metabolic rate. In a study done by T.G. Bed.f.ord, rats’ oxygen uptake increased greatly after they completed a treadmill test [Bed.f.ord: 1979]. A different study found that, during flight, oxygen consumption and ATP turnover rates in birds increased [Suarez: 1992]. The crayfish we studied may have experienced a decrease in specific metabolic rate after exercise rather than an increase because they were under stress. We encouraged the crayfish to exercise by poking them. This could have frightened them and impacted their metabolic response. According to R.C. Newell, animals can respire anaerobically when they are under stress [Newell: 2017]. Anaerobic respiration does not require oxygen [Sadava: 2017]. This may explain why oxygen consumption did not increase after exercise. Additionally, the crayfish often stopped moving when we were poking them. They would intermittently curl up in fear or stop running to try to grab the pen that was poking them, and so they did not get two full minutes of exercise. It is possible that they did not get enough exercise to affect their specific metabolic rates. In the future, this experiment should be repeated with a larger sample size and a different form of exercise. The new form of exercise should not be frightening or stressful. We found that specific metabolic rate did not increase after exercise; however, this may have been due to the fact that the crayfish were in a stressful environment that caused them to stop running and curl up frequently. Additionally, the stress may have induced anaerobic respiration.
