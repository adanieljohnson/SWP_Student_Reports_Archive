Title: The Effect of Nicotine on Rana Pipiens’ Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
In this lab, the effects of nicotine, an ACh agonist, on the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana Pipiens was observed. This was measured with respect to muscle response output (measured in volts). Each frog leg acted as its own control, and after the control response data was recorded, 1mg/mL of Nicotine was injected directly in to the muscle. The nerve was then stimulated under the same conditions as the control. We found that there was a significant increase in muscle response after nicotine was injected. In frog one, muscle response increased from .3152 V to 1.413 V, yielding a p-value of 6.3E-9. Muscle response in frog two increased from .0996V to 1.087V, yielding a p-value of 4.35E-8, and in frog three muscle response rose from .3572V to 1.2784V, yielding a p-value of 9.36E-11. All of these p-values fell below the alpha value of .05, deeming significance. The binding of nicotine to ACh- like receptors promotes depolarization of the cell via sodium ions, increasing the number of action potentials fired, thus increasing muscle response in the form of voltage.


Introduction:
        ACh is one of the most important neurotransmitter in the human body. It has a very important rule in muscle contraction, and with insufficient ACh presence, muscle contraction cannot be carried out. ACh remains stored in vesicles in the presynaptic neuron, and it requires calcium in order to be released. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic synapse, this depolarization causes calcium to enter the cell, which causes the vesicles containing ACh to bind the membrane of the cell. From here, ACh is released in to the synaptic cleft. Because in this case nicotine is mimicking ACh, nicotine can bind to these ligand ion channels, causing the channels to release sodium and therefore depolarize the post synaptic membrane. This depolarization causes the firing of action potentials, which move in to the transverse tubules to signal calcium and begin muscle contraction.
         In this lab, it is examined if the increase in ACh agonist can translate in to stronger muscle contraction in the Rana Pipiens frog. The Rana Pipiens frog is relatively small in size, and is used because its sciatic nerve is accessible along with easy observation of the effect of environmental stimuli on muscle control. Muscle responses can be seen in a myogram, where the peak represents the strength of muscular output (measured in volts). This has been examined in other experiments, where in one specific experiment nicotine is injected in to rats and its response is observed. Injecting nicotine increased firing rate of action potentials by rapidly depolarizing the neurons. (Egan and North: 1986). However, the nicotine was injected directly in to the rat’s brain, so muscle response output isn’t recorded. However, the amount of action potentials is observed, and this trend can be used to deduce muscle response, where an increase in action potentials will increase the muscle response. Because nicotine promotes depolarization and increases the rate of action potentials, the injection of nicotine in to the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog will increase muscle contraction, and thus increase muscle response output when electrically stimulated.


Materials and Methods:
First, the skin needs to be removed from the entire frog leg.  Do this by making a small incision at the top of the muscle, then peel the skin off using your hands. Locate the sciatic nerve (large white nerve) within the thigh muscle, and isolate it as well, making sure not to damage the nerve. Place the nerve on top the electrode sleeve, then connect the sleeve to the IWX/214. Next, locate the gastrocnemius muscle, and isolate it by freeing it of any connective tissue. Then, placing the scalpel between the bone and muscle, cut the downward end of the gastrocnemius muscle off, making sure to leave the Achilles tendon attached. Tie the string around the tendon, making a knot, and hang the muscle from the IWX/214 at a ninety-degree angle from the dissection tray, making sure the rest of the frog is flat on the dissecting board. Set the Pulse amplitude to 1V, number of pulses to 5, frequency to 1, and pulse width to 5ms. Stimulate the muscle under these conditions, record muscle response, which is found at the top of each myogram. Let the muscle rest for 30 seconds after this step to reduce fatigue, then inject the 1mg/mL nicotine in to the top and bottom portions of the frog muscle. Stimulate the nerve immediately under these same conditions, record muscle response at the peak of each myogram. Repeat this same procedure two more times with two other frog legs. After all data is collected, a one tailed paired t-Test is ran in order to compare a p-value to an alpha value of .05 to determine significance.

Results:
       All three frog legs saw large jumps in strength of muscle contraction after nicotine was injected in to the frog leg. In the first frog, this difference was on average 1.0978V greater than the regular muscle responses. In the second frog, this difference was on average .9874V greater than regular muscle response, and the third frog saw an increase of .9212V. Comparatively speaking, these differences are large, and the addition of nicotine can yield a response that can possibly be around ten times larger than its regular response, as seen in frog number three. In the second frog leg, we had to run the experiment twice because the contractions were hard to see, and it was unsure how often contractions were in fact occurring. This frog’s sciatic nerve was also shorter than the others. In addition to these observations, our focus on data collection caused us to sometimes forget to use Ringer’s solution to keep the frogs wet. This would result in a minor systemic error decreasing muscle response output in all three frogs.
In frog leg one, before nicotine was injected in to the frog muscle, the mean calculated from 5 measurements was calculated at .3152V. After the 1mg/mL injection of nicotine, this mean rose to 1.413V. The mean difference in the two measurements was 1.0978V. In the one tailed paired T-test, n equaled 5, and there were four degrees of freedom. The T-value was 147.70, the P-value was 6.30E-9, and .05 was used as alpha. The standard deviation before nicotine was injected was .0113 and after the injection the standard deviation was calculated at .0225. 
	Before nicotine was injected in to frog leg two, the mean calculated from 5 measurements was calculated at .0996V. After nicotine was injected, this value rose to 1.087V. The one tailed paired T-Test showed a p-value of 4.35E-8, and a T-value of 91.106. Again, .05 was used as alpha. Before the injection, the standard deviation of the mean was .0276, and after nicotine was injected the standard deviation was calculated at .0037. There were four degrees of freedom.
	Lastly, in frog leg three, the mean calculated from 5 measurements before the nicotine injection was .3572V, then rose to 1.2784V after nicotine was injected. The one tailed paired t-test showed a p-value of 9.36E-11, and a t-value of 423.21. The value for alpha was .05, and there were four degrees of freedom. Before the injection, the standard deviation of the mean was .0130, and after nicotine was injected the standard deviation was calculated at .0089.


Discussion:
     Based on all three p-values falling below the alpha value of .05, the null hypothesis should be rejected and the alternate hypothesis should be accepted. This confirms that nicotine acted identically to ACh, and an increase in nicotine mimicked an increase in neurotransmitter released in to neuromuscular junctions. The binding of nicotine to ligand receptors opens sodium channels and initiates depolarization. Because more receptors are being opened due to increase ligand-presence, this leads to the increase in action potentials being fired. This follows the same trend outlined in the rat locus experiment, where an increase in nicotine presence produced an increase in neuron excitability and response, and an increase in action potentials was seen (Egan and North: 1986). This is important because this enables more calcium to be present in the muscle, and the rate of power strokes are therefore increased, giving an increased muscle response value. One limitation we faced that could have been improved in our experiment would be having the ability to pick our own frog leg. Although the change in muscle response based on nicotine is relative to a specific leg, having similar mass and sized frog legs could help us develop a more precise statistical mean. Similar sized legs would have helped standardized our data, possibly leading to less variation in strength of muscle contractions. 
	A next step could be to alter nicotine concentration in order to see where increasing use of nicotine injection caps off, meaning where response reaches it maximum possible value (tetanus). Another thing that could be done is to alter the number of pulses to see if the injection of nicotine also causes muscles to fatigue easier than regular muscles. This can also be done by increasing frequency of pulses.
