Title: Carbonated Water does not create a significant difference in the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus When Compared to Aerated Water

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied how two different environments would affect the specific metabolic rate (SMR) of Procambarus. The independent variables used were room temperature aerated water and carbonated water. We hypothesized that if the respiratory medium changed from room temperature aerated water to room temperature carbonated water, there would be a change in the rate of metabolism in Procambarus. The experiment involved each of the three Procambarus being put in a test chamber with either the aerated water or the carbonated water for 20 minutes. During that time, the chamber was set in a dishpan filled with either aerated water or carbonated water respectively.  We recorded the amount of oxygen that was consumed at five-minute intervals for 20 minutes using an oxygen probe. After completing the experiment we conducted a two-tailed t-test and found that the p-value was 0.2107, thus, no significant difference was found in the standard metabolic rate of Procambarus in aerated water and carbonated water.

Introduction:
This experiment was an independent study done in order to study how different respiratory mediums would affect the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus. Metabolic rate is affected by changes in temperature—as the environmental temperature increases, the rate of metabolism in ectotherms increases (Sadava: 2016).  However, we want to know if being put in carbonated water will affect the metabolic rate. According to an article that looked at the effects of increased carbon dioxide in fish, high levels of carbon dioxide in water led to reduced mortality and growth rates (Baumann: 2012). As one’s mass increases their metabolic rate increases. However, if the growth rate decreases then the standard metabolic rate will decrease. It must be noted that a different time scale was used in this experiment versus the one used in our experiment. However, based on this information, we hypothesized that if changed the respiratory medium was changed from room temperature aerated water to room temperature carbonated water, there will be a change in the rate of metabolism in Procambarus.

Materials and Methods:
1. Obtain 3 crayfish  
2. Begin with room temperature (22 ℃) aerated water  
3. Fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that had been saturated with air then set the test chamber into an empty plastic dishpan 
4. Weigh a crayfish then gently place in the test chamber and screw the top  
5. When top is secure, gently fill the container with water so the top overflows slightly  
6. Place the entire tank set up to the neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature water  
7. Insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber 
8. Turn on the instrument and let the reading stabilize  
9. Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration  
10. At 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes, read the oxygen concentration again then remove the probe 
11. Determine the volume of water the crayfish was in during the experiment by pouring it into a graduated cylinder  
12. For carbonated water, refill the chamber with carbonated water and submerge the chambers in a dishpan filled with room temperature carbonated water 
13. Repeat steps 6-11 for the Procambarus in the carbonated water  
14. Repeat this experiment 3 times twice on each Procambarus with both types of water  
15.  Clean up the area and calculate the specific metabolic rate by using the following formula:   (delta oxygen (mg/L)  x volume of water (L)) / (time (mins)   weight (g)) 
16. Complete a 2 tailed t-test to identify whether there was a significant difference in the specific metabolic rate between the 2 groups 


Results:
We found that the average specific metabolic rate in aerated water for the 3 Procambarus was 0.00103 with a standard deviation of 0.0005. In carbonated water, the average specific metabolic rate was 0.000645 with a standard deviation of 0.000164. The dilution concentration of carbonated water for the 3 Procambarus were 11.2%, 11.4%, and 11.2% respectively. Finally, after completing the two-tailed t-test we found that the p-value was 0.2107 meaning there was no significant difference found between the standard metabolic rate of the Procambarus in aerated water and carbonated water.


Discussion:
Since the p-value calculated was 0.2107, no significant difference was found in the standard metabolic rate between the Procambarus in aerated water and the ones placed in carbonated water. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported by the experiment. According to an article that studied the active respiration of fish at various concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide, oxygen consumption decreased linearly with the concentration of carbon dioxide (Basu: 2011).  This means that as carbon dioxide in the environment increases, oxygen intake decreases. Carbon dioxide is considered an asphyxiant, a substance that displaces breathable oxygen and impairs gas exchange. High levels of carbon dioxide, such as the one found in carbonated water are not appropriate conditions for Procambarus to survive. Not only does it affect oxygen consumption, which directly relates to the SMR, but it also affects the pH of their blood streams (Polashuk: 2017). 
While this experiment done by Basu was tested in a lab like our experiment was, it is important to note that there are 2 key differences. Firstly,  4 species of fish were tested in this lab while our experiment studied Procambarus only. Furthermore, our results did not have significant difference. However, this could have been a result of having such a small sample group to work with. Additionally, we had two other limitations in our experiment. The first was that the carbonated water poured into the glass testing chamber of the second Procambarus had been exposed to the lab environment. This could have led to the water having a loss of carbonation since it was exposed to the environment. The second limitation was while in the carbonated water, the Procambarus seemed to be under a lot of stress, which could’ve affected the oxygen consumption.  If we were to do another experiment, I would change the independent variable to darkness and see how the oxygen consumption would change then. This would allow us to compare how different changes in the environment impact the Procambarus oxygen consumption.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The figure above illustrates the difference between the specific metabolic rate among the 3 Procambarus in the 2 respiratory mediums. The number at the top of each bar is the average specific metabolic rate. The standard deviation of the SMR in the aerated water is 0.0005 while in the carbonated water it is 0.000164.  There was no significant difference between the oxygen consumption in aerated water and carbonated water since the p-value was greater than 0.05.
