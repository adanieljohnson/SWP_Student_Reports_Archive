Title: Tetraethylammonium Chloride’s Effect on Muscle Twitch Amplitude

Abstract:
	Muscle contractions occur when an action potential is generated causing a cell to depolarize. Depolarization causes gated potassium channels to open allowing potassium, K+, ions to leave the cell. Potassium ions travel through gated channels that must be opened for any ion movement to occur, the cell loses positive charge and repolarizes the cell back to resting potential. This experiment considered what happens to threshold requirements when K+ gated channels are blocked. The Rania Pipien’s, or Northern Leopard frog’s, gastrocnemus muscle was studied using the LabScribe program and tetraethylammonium chloride was used as the potassium channel blocker. The blocker was predicted to cause a difference in the threshold voltage for a muscle twitch. During the experiment the frog was stimulated at different volts and then injected with the solution. After, a paired t_test was performed on the results. The t_test revealed that the difference between the treatment and controllls groups was not statistically significent due to a p value of p=7.418. Tetraethylammonium chloride did not appear to cause a difference in these threshold voltages. Overall, blocking the potassium channels did not cause a significent effect on threshold values, and should be improved if replicated in the future.

Introduction:
Neuronal signals are electrical events which involves ion transfer, depolarization, and repolarizations [Sadava: 2016]. These electron events involve three ions that travel down their individual concentration gradients to eventually stimulate an action potential. At rest potassium, K+, ions flow out of the cell through their open gated channels to create a membrane potential, generally referred to as the resting potential. During depolarization potassium gated channels open and allow more potassium to leave the cell. This occurs because during depolarization Na+ gated channels opens creating an influx of positive charge within the cell. K+ ions then will flood down its gradient out of the cell due to the excess of positive charge which decreases the membrane potential and repolarizes the cell [Sadava:2016]. The electrical events can be studied and monitored using myograms, which record a single muscle twitch [Johnson: 2017]. A twitch is the minimum unit of contraction a stimulus can make [Sadava: 2016].
The goal of this experiment was to determine how restricting the gated potassium channels can affect contraction in mammal skeletal muscles. These parameters were studied by examining twitch amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania Pipiens, commonly known as Northern Leopard frogs. Using the muscles of Northern Leopard frogs, is useful because the frogs are very good jumpers and there for able to generate a lot of force when contracting the gastrocnemus muscle. The sciatic nerve in these muscles are also easy to isolate allowing us to stimulate the nerve directly. To study the gated potassium channels, we used a tetraethylammonium treatment on the frog legs. Tetraethylammonium (TEA Cl), has been proven to be a gated potassium channel blocker and “delays the outward potassium current” during contraction [Stanfield: 1970]. We predicted that blocking the potassium channels in the gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs, using TEA Cl, will result in a difference in muscle twitch amplitude when compared with a controlll group.


Materials and Method:
The frogs were skinned by hand and exposing the both the gastrocnemus and soleus muscles. The Achilles tendon was then cut to separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the bone and then tied the muscle off with thread. After tying off the muscle we set up the apparatus for direct muscle stimulation, by hanging the muscle up by the string (and applying a slight amount of tension to the string) and applying 2 probes directly to the muscle. The LabScribe program in the iWorx software was used to monitor the muscle twitches on our computer. Once the system was accurately set up, we started the stimulation on the first frog leg, without injecting it with anything, at 0 volts and observed the resulting amplitude of the muscle twitch. After we increased the stimulation in 0.1 increments until we got to 0.5 volts. During each stimulation we monitored the amplitude of each twitch and recorded it in our notebooks. After stimulating the muscle with 0.5 volts we skipped stimulating the 0.6-0.9 volts and stimulated with 1 volt to observe higher amplitudes. We increased our stimulation voltages from 1-5 in increments of 1 and recorded our observations each time. During our experiment we used 100 mM of TEA Cl by dissolving 1.7g of it in 100 Ml of Ringers solution. We injected 0.2 Ml of tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA Cl) directly into the muscle, while being careful not to insert the needle too far into the muscle (making sure that the chemical is being injected into the muscle and not outside of it). After injection waited about 30 seconds for the muscle to absorb the blocker and then began stimulated the muscle under the same conditions done previously to the leg (increasing by 0.1 increments from 0 to 0.5 and then increasing by 1 increment from 1-5). We repeated this process for both frog leg two and three and then compared the results. Throughout the lab we maintained our leg by washing it with Ringers solution every now and then to make sure the leg never dried out. We took certain safety measures to complete the lab making sure to wear gloves at all times when handling any part of the frog. Once the lab was completed every piece of equipment was cleaned of with ethanol and disposed the frog legs in designated bags at the back of the room. 

Results:
The threshold for treatment frog legs varied from the controlll threshold voltages from 0-0.2 as seen in Figure 4. From figure 3 one can tell that the treatment legs and have very little difference in threshold voltages than the threshold voltages of the controlll group legs. In fact, figure 3 shows us that the threshold for the treatment group decreased by 0.1 volts in frog leg 1 remained the same for the second frog leg and was increased by 0.2 volts in the third frog. Therefore, the treatment appeared to have threshold was 0.4 volts which was 0.2 voltages higher than that of the controlll group. The experiment had t-values of 0.3379 and after running a paired t_test the p values for the frog legs was p=0.7418. In addition, there were 3 threshold values for both the treatment and controlll group used in our sample so the degrees of freedom for the frog legs was 2. 

Discussion:
Injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA Cl) presented a slight difference in the threshold voltages. However, while there were experimental differences in the threshold levels of each frog leg, these differences were not statistically significent, because our p_value was greater than the alpha level of 0.05. Since our data was not statistically significent, we failed the null hypothesis was not rejected, there was not enough evidence to conclude that blocking the potassium channels in gastrocnemus muscle will cause a difference in threshold voltage for muscle twitch compared to a controlll group. This finding has not been supported in many studies including in Stanfield’s study who found that “TEA tended to shift the threshold” of membrane potentials of those muscles that were stimulated [Stanfield: 1970]. In addition, Stanfield found that TEA affects the overall kinetics of the twitch [Stanfield: 1970], this conclusion supports our experiment because the twitch amplitude of the treatment frog legs increased in smaller increments as we stimulated the muscle at higher voltages compared to our controlll group. Since the treatment twitch amplitudes were smaller than that of the controlll frog legs (when stimulated at the same voltages), then one can assume that the muscle twitch amplitude was increasing slower than the controlll group; therefore, the maximum contraction amplitude values would occur at later voltages for the treatment group. However, during maximum contraction was not a focus for this study and we did not stimulate the treatment frog legs to maximum contractions. It would be useful to include these values in future studies and stimulate the frog legs injected with TEA Cl to maximum contraction in the future. In addition, we only used a very small sample size of only 3 frogs. This small sample makes it difficult to extrapolate the results for a general population, so increasing the number of frog legs would greatly improve our study if done in the future. In summary blocking the potassium channels did not have a substantial effect on threshold levels required for action potentials however, due to limitations in the experiment these findings cannot be applied to the general contractile mechanisms for muscles.
