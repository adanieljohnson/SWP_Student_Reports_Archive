Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Rania pipiens Frog Leg Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to observe if an injection of caffeine influences the overall contraction of a Rania pipiens frog leg muscle. To trigger a muscle contraction, an action potential is sent down the axon to the axon terminal where neurotransmitters are then released into the synaptic cleft. Next, the neurotransmitters that were released bind to the receptors on a nearby cell of the muscle. The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium into the sarcoplasm which triggers the contraction of the muscle after a signal is then sent from the receptors down the t-tubules. The injection of caffeine has been observed to induce greater muscle contraction because higher levels of calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Using electrode stimulus on the gastrocnemus muscle, a myogram was created to determine the contractile, latent, and relaxation phases as well as the average amplitude of contraction. The P values calculated using a paired t_test for the amplitude of contraction, the contractile phase, and the threshold through the sciatic nerve were determined to be not significent. We hypothesized that the injection of caffeine would increase overall muscle amplitude of contraction of the leg muscle as more calcium would be released.

Introduction:
In this week’s lab, we will observe the effects of stimulating three Rania pipiens frog legs on its gastrocnemus muscle and its sciatic nerve. The purpose of this study is to observe if an injection of caffeine influences the overall contraction of a frog leg muscle. This process will portray how an action potential from a motor neuron stimulates contraction of a muscle. An action potential is sent down the axon to the axon terminal where neurotransmitters are then released into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the nearby cell of the muscle. A signal is then sent from the receptors down the t-tubules where the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium which triggers the contraction of the muscle. During this process of contraction, myosin heads bind to the thin actin filaments and a phosphate is lost from the ATP, thus triggering the power stroke. During the power stroke, the myosin head changes conformation and pulls the actin filament past the myosin filament. Since the action potentials will not be generated by neurons, a stimulator box will be used to send an electrical stimulus to the frog leg muscle. Frequency, duration, and amplification can all be controlllled. A myogram, a graphic representation of the muscular contractions will then be used once the threshold and maximum contraction has been determined. The myogram will be used to find the lengths of the three phases of muscle contractions, the relaxation, contraction, and latent phase. However, we will be testing the contraction of the frog leg muscle after an injection of caffeine has been administered. In a study, “The Relationship Between Caffeine Contracture of Intact Muscle and the Effect of Caffeine on the Reticulum” (Weber: 1968), similar to the one we will be conducting tested the effect of caffeine on the overall contraction of the frog leg muscle. It was concluded that caffeine ultimately led to more calcium release, thus resulting in greater contractions of the leg muscle. This was due to a greater amount of calcium being released. The controlll group will be tested first, as an electrical stimulus on the gastrocnemus will be administered. Based off the Weber study, we hypothesize that as a result injecting caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog legs, greater contraction levels will be observed as higher levels of calcium will be released. 

Materials and Method:
Each group will be given three frog legs which the skin will be removed from the legs first. The inner thigh muscles will be separated to reveal blood vessels and nerves next. Then a stimulator box will be used to induce muscle contraction. The threshold voltages will be determined from this. The leg will finally be pinned to the testing tray to insure no movement during contraction. Clay will also be placed under the leg to keep it from moving as well. This experiment will test the levels of muscle contraction of the frog leg before and after an injection of caffeine has been made. To test the effects of the caffeine loading, caffeine will be directly injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg using a provided tuberulan syringe. Approximately 0.1Ml of caffeine will be loaded into each muscle. The exposed tissues will also be kept moist with Ringer’s solution throughout the process. The data will be collected using a force probe and Acknowledge software on a laptop. Three to five more myograms will be recorded to record the different stages within a single muscle twitch (latent period, contraction phase, relaxation phase). The threshold through the sciatic nerve, the contractile phase, and the amplitude of contraction will all be measured through a force probe which relays the data to the computer. The myogram will graphically display the collected data. 

Materials used:
•	iWorx electrophysiology recording equipment
•	One laptop for recording data 
•	3 Rania pipiens frog legs
•	Latex gloves
•	1 dissecting tray
•	Chem wipes
•	0.3 Ml Caffeine (1.9g caf/ 100 Ml ringers solution)
•	Syringe for injection of caffeine
•	Metal pins to anchor the leg
•	Scissors


Results:
Figure 1. Average amplitude of contraction (mV) for Rania pipiens frog legs with treatment of caffeine and without the treatment. Three trials were ran, one trial per each leg. The error bars on both graphs represent the standard deviation.
	The average amplitude of contraction for the controlll group was 1.321mV±0.213 and 1.713mV±0.271 for the experimental group. The tests were conducted on the same legs, the controlll group tested first. Both groups were tested from 1V to 5V of electric current for data collection, repeated three times. The data collected was averaged as seen in the graph above. The average amplitude observed in the treatment group was greater than the average amplitude observed in the controlll group, thus supporting our hypothesis. 


Discussion:
In the end, the data collected from the experiment supported our original hypothesis that the gastrocnemus muscle treated with caffeine would experience a greater amplitude of contraction than the gastrocnemus muscle without treatment as observed in the graphs in the results section displayed above. This was also observed in the Weber, 1968 study. The administration of caffeine has been seen to increase the amplitude of contraction in muscles. Muscles treated with caffeine have been seen to contract at higher amplitudes as a result of a larger release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The more calcium released, the more powerful the muscle contraction. The calculated P-value using a t_test was 0.043, meaning the data was significent. 
One result that was found interesting was that the third leg treated with caffeine experienced a value decrease from the 1 volt stimulus to the 5 volt stimulus. This could have been a result of the muscle running out of available ATP, thus the muscle fatigued rather quickly. 
In a further study, we would want to obtain frog legs that would be larger and that would not fatigue quickly ideally. We want to also test other chemicals that would stimulate the release of calcium and then compare the average amplitude of contraction with the values from this study (caffeine). Also, the method of administering the caffeine could be different, maybe using the method of topical rub. Maybe there is a certain method of application that works better than direct injection. Lastly, it would be interesting to see what effects caffeine would have on muscle contraction if it was administered in a higher amount, maybe 0.3Ml.
