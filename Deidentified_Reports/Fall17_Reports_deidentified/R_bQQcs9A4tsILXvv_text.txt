Title: Competition Influences Plants Resources Allocation

Abstract:
In natural environment, plants usually adapt different strategies to maximize their chance of survival when confront certain pressure. In this experiment, we want to study whether competition can influence certain plant species to change their way to allocate resources by referring to R:S ratio of length and weight between the competition group and the non-competition group. We hypothesis that the R:S ratio between these two groups will contain significant difference and up to this point we can prove that plants’ strategies of resources allocation can be changed because of competition. In order to make our experiment possible, we randomly choose Oat and Wheat, these two species to be our subjects, and we mainly consider two situations: these two species grow independently and they grow together. After they seeds have germinated, we measure the R:S ration of length and weight of Oats and Wheat. However, we find out that there is no significant difference between the competition group and the non-competition group within these two species. Thus, our hypothesis has been disproved. Later in the reflection, we believe that our experiment contain certain fallacies because we do consider limiting resources in this experiment, so in the future, we may further study how competition influe

Introduction:
    According to the definition of plant allocation of resources, plants can allocate resources, which they obtain from the environment, to either their roots, the parts below the ground or the shoots, the parts above the ground. However, though “A species’ pattern of allocation is genetically determined, it is not completely fixed” [Johnson: 2006]. In nature, different environment tends to affect the growth patterns of plant species, and the plant also need to interact with other species to compete for resources. When the term competition involves, the idea is not to restore the balance between two or more species, but the dominance of one over others. According to an intensive study of Wilson (1998), he found that “below-ground competition usually affected the balance between the competing species more than above-ground competition” [Aerts: 1998]. Thus, when facing competition, plants usually evolve certain adaptations to change their strategies of allocating resources, “plants can indeed allocate more biomass to their root systems in order to increase nutrient uptake or they can show adaptive changes in their root morphology by having a higher root length per unit root mass(SRL)” [Aerts: 1998]. Based on these, we want to know what will happen to the length and mass of roots and shoots of the species that are under competition. In this experiment, we tend to prove that the R:S ratio of the plant species under competition will contain significant difference, due to plant’s change of allocation strategies, when compared to the same species that are not in competition.

Materials and Methods:
    We choose two species, buck wheat and oat, and decide to observe their change of R:S ratio in length and weight when under competition. We mainly set up three groups of experiment, and in each group, we plant three boxes of plant seeds. For the first group, in each of the box, we plant 40 seeds of buck wheat; for the second group, in each of the box, we put 40 seeds of oat. While for the last compared group, in order to fulfill the condition of competition, we select 20 wheat seeds and 20 oat seeds and put them together in every box. Then, we provide each group of them with the same amount of nutrient solution, which is 50ml, and put them under an environment of enough sunlight for them to germinate. Also, during the latter 14 days, we provide each group with enough amount of water.
    After 14 days, we find out that the seeds have germinated, and we measure the length and weight of the shoots and roots of all the samples we have selected from each box of each group. Also, we note that the roots are those below the ground, and the shoots part are those above the ground to where the leaves start to branch out.

Statistical Analysis
	We use several two-sampled T tests to examine how different the R:S ratio of length and weight are for the plant species in competition when compared to those that are not in competition. In each of the three groups, we randomly select 5 samples from each of the box and we calculate the mean of R:S ratio of length and weight for these samples. Then, we set up four T test: the R:S ratio of length for buck wheat between the mean of those under competition and that of those grow independently, the R:S ratio of weight for buck wheat between competition and non-competition group, the R:S ratio of length for oat between the competition and non-competition group and the R:S ratio of weight for oat between competition and non-competition group.



Results:
    We have calculated the P value for all the four sets of T test. And the results are that, P value equals to 0.539974 for the comparison of R:S weight ratio of wheat, 0.57605 for the comparison of R:S length ratio of wheat, 0.871929 for the comparison of R:S weight ratio of oat, and 0.087227 for the comparison of R:S length ration of oat. Since these data are all bigger than 0.05, we can conclude that our experiment provide weak evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is that the R:S ratio will not contain significant change between the competition group and the non-competition group of same plant specie. 

Discussion:
    We tend to figure out what this condition happens, since there is no change in R:S ratio, it means that there is no competition between oat and wheat. According to an important experiment done by Clements, Weaver, and Hanson, “In the exact sense, two plants, no matter how close, do not compete with each other as long as the water-content, the nutrient material, the light and heat are in excess of the needs of both. When the immediate supply of a single necessary factor falls below the combined demands of the plants, competition begins” [Went: 1973]. One possible explanation we conclude is that since competition means to compete for resources, the experiment should be conducted with at less one limiting resources. However, in our experiment, we provide the samples with enough resources. Thus, we can conduct further experiment to observe if the R:S ratio will change as if the light resource is scarce or the water resource. Another possible explanation is that, the different time of the germination and the mortality of these seeds show competition, which is an important observation that we have neglected, according to an experiment done by Bergeson and Perry, “interactions between heterospecific seeds influence the probabilities and timing of seedling emergence in certain species of annual plants” [Bergeson: 1989].
