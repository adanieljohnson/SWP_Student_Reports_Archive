Title: Agricultural Waste Effects on Oxygen Consumption and Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambris sp. 

Abstract:
We worked with Procambris sp. to demonstrate properties of metabolic reactions. We viewed the effects agricultural waste has on specific metabolic rate. Our null hypothesis was that the metabolic rate of crayfish would not change or would not change with agricultural waste pollution in their environment. Our alternative hypothesis was that the metabolic rate of crayfish would change with agricultural waste pollution in their environment. Three crayfish were used in this experiment. They each served as their own controlll. We added 100 Ml of agricultural waste to 900 Ml of water and added it to the testing chambers and measured oxygen consumption. There was an overall decrease in the specific metabolic rate when adding agricultural waste to the testing chambers. However, Our P value was 0.220083 which was not below our alpha level of 0.05. The results were not significent, and we failed to reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis was not supported (P=0.220083; t=1.762261; d.f.=2).



Introduction:
Heterotrophs such as crayfish obtain raw materials by consuming autotrophs and/or heterotrophs. Metabolic rate is the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiological processes at any given time. Metabolic reactions begin when an organism coverts glucose to energy which then goes through a series of reactions until it is converted into carbon dioxide. These reactions release high-energy electrons which are then captured by NAD+ and FAD, which begin the electron transport system. As the electrons release energy while making their way through the electron transport system. This release of energy converts low-energy ADP into high energy ATP in considerable amounts until electrons are not removed from the mitochondria. Removing electrons from the mitochondria requires the electrons to be converted into the oxygen that is delivered to the cells by the respiratory organs. This adding of electrons converts oxygen to water which is then returned to the bodily fluids or excreted [Johnson: 2016]. Oxygen consumption is an indirect indicator of energy production. We measured oxygen consumption of Procambris sp. to estimate its metabolic rate. Procambris sp. is a good model organism for this lab because these crayfish are ectotherms, meaning that they can alter their body temperature and affect metabolism. A 2001 study by Rowe found that crayfish found at contaminated sites had elevated metabolic rates compared to crayfish found at non-contaminated sites [Rowe: 2001]. Our null hypothesis was that the metabolic rate of crayfish would not change or would not change with agricultural waste pollution in their environment. Our alternative hypothesis was that the metabolic rate of crayfish would change with agricultural waste pollution in their environment. The independent variable was agricultural waste pollution and the dependent variable was oxygen consumption. 



Materials and Method:
We weighed 3 large crayfish and placed them into closed test chambers and filled the chambers with water. These chambers were then placed in a dishpan with room temperature water and oxygen probes were inserted. Once the oxygen levels stabilized, a base line reading for each crayfish was taken. Oxygen levels were also measured in five-minute increments for twenty minutes. The volume of water was then determined by pouring the water in the chamber into a graduated cylinder. This was then repeated for the 3 experimental crayfish but with adding agricultural waste pollution into the water-filled chamber. The agricultural waste was made with 100 Ml waste and 900 Ml water. The crayfish served as their own controllls. The oxygen rate of consumption was calculated for all 3 controllls and treatments. 

To evaluate the data, we used a two-tailed t_test to determine if the null hypothesis could be rejected or if we failed to reject the null hypothesis. An alpha level of Î±=0.05 was used. The controlll and treatment groups were compared. 


Results:

Error Bars Represent the Standard Deviation while the Data Bars Represent the Specific Metabolic Rate in mg. (P=0.220083; t=1.762261; d.f.=2)
The controlll group (n=3) specific metabolic rate was an average of 0.0161 mg. The experimental group (n=3) specific metabolic rate was an average of 0.0116 mg. The specific metabolic rate decreased for all three experimental crayfish. 


Discussion:
Our P value was 0.220083 which was not below our alpha level of 0.05. The results were not significent, and we failed to reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis was not supported (P=0.220083; t=1.762261; d.f.=2). There was an overall decrease in the specific metabolic rate when adding agricultural waste to the testing chambers. This could have been because the agricultural waste aided bodily functions. Our results were different from past research. This may be because of the exposure duration. Chronic exposure to low levels of agricultural waste can negatively impact organism functioning [Rowe: 2001]. The crayfish we worked with only had exposure for 20 minutes, which was a limitation to our experiment. We also had to share crayfish that had other treatments prior to our testing without waiting for an appropriate wash out time. This could have been a reason our p value was high. Our next step would be to expand our research to different exposure times to see which exposure times result in a significent change and whether this impacts the increase or decrease of metabolic rate.
