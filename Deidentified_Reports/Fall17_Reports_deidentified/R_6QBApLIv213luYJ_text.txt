Title: Differently colored monochromatic light has no effect on the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea leaves

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to find whether or not red, green, or blue light in any way affected the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea. It was predicted that, if light color affects the rate of photosynthesis, a difference is expected to be observed between the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts treated with red, green, and blue light. Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to capture energy from light in order to synthesize usable energy. It produces high energy electrons that travel through transport chains to synthesize ATP. To test activity, DCPIP, a blue electron acceptor, was added to a solution containing chloroplasts under different colors of light. If photosynthesis occurred, the DCPIP lost color, lowering the absorbance of the sample. Absorbances were compared to establish the effect of colored light on photosynthetic activity. Tukey-Kramer tests revealed that photosynthetic activity varied minimally among groups given colored light even though an ANOVA test indicated a significant difference (p=0.000006). Significant differences only existed between groups given no light or no chloroplasts and colored light groups. It was concluded that light color has no effect on photosynthetic activity in vitro since chloroplasts were isolated in solution.

Introduction:
In this experiment, different colors of visible light will be used on spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaf chloroplasts in order to determine whether or not specific colors of light affect the rate of photosynthesis. Spinacia oleracea was a perfect candidate for this experiment because it is easily obtainable since it is readily accessible to the public. It is also very cheap and easy to grind up so that the isolated chloroplasts can mix into solution. The Hill Reaction, photoreduction of an electron acceptor by hydrogen in water, will be used in order to determine the rate of photosynthetic reduction which can be translated to photosynthetic activity because the reduction of an electron acceptor always occurs in photosynthesis once a high energy electron has traveled through the mitochondrial electron transport chain [Johnson: 2017]. Plants, some protists and some bacteria capture and store energy from the sun in covalent bonds, oxidation-reduction potential, and an electrochemical gradient across a lipid bilayer using the process of photosynthesis [Johnson: 2017]. Photosynthesis is the process by which these organisms capture energy from sunlight to synthesize usable energy from carbon dioxide and water [Johnson: 2017]. ATP, the energy unit of the cell for plants and animals, does not directly come from photosynthesis. Plants and animals must carry out glycolysis and the citric acid or Kreb’s cycle in the mitochondria [Johnson: 2017]. The process breaks down glucose into CO2 which releases high energy electrons that create a proton gradient and power ATP synthesis by moving through mitochondrial transport chains and transferring the electrons back to molecular oxygen to produce water again [Johnson: 2017]. Photosynthesis is divided in two photosystems that collaborate to allow the overall process to happen. Photosystem I consists of excited high energy electrons leaving the chlorophyll and traveling through a multi-subunit complex to NADP+ to produce NADPH [Johnson: 2017]. In this step, NADP+ is reduced [Johnson: 2017]. To simulate this step in our experiment, DCPIP will be used as an electron acceptor. When it is reduced, it changes from blue to colorless [Johnson: 2017]. This color change indicates that photosynthesis has occurred. The absorbance of samples will be measured and decreased absorbances will indicate the presence of photosynthetic activity to whatever degree indicated by the scope of the change in absorbance. This study will examine the effects of blue, green and red light on photosynthetic activity when compared to no light and white light conditions. A previous study indicates that plants were greater in height, but had decreased capabilities to biosynthesize chlorophyll when given 100:0 Blue:Red LED photon flux ratios which is generally just the ratio of light of each color [Hernández: 2015]. Another study indicates that a combination of red and blue light, with blue light containing a higher fraction of the ratio, facilitated more efficient lettuce growth and photosynthesis [Wang J: 2016]. Based on these studies, we expect there to be a difference among different colors of light for photosynthetic activity and we expect white light to have the most activity. The dependent variable in this experiment will be the recorded absorbance as a representative value for photosynthetic activity and the independent variables will be time and the type of light, if any, that the chloroplasts are treated with. If light color affects the rate of photosynthesis, a difference is expected to exist in photosynthetic rate over time among the different colors of light that the chloroplasts are treated with.

Materials and Methods:
In order to perform this experiment, chloroplasts needed to be removed and separated from the spinach leaves. To do this, a chilled mortar and pestle and a grinding buffer were used to grind up spinach leaves that had their central vein removed. The resulting mixture was strained through a cheesecloth to ensure that large unnecessary solids were removed. The beakers, mortar and pestle, and centrifuge tubes needed to be chilled in crushed ice to slow enzyme action in solution and prevent damaging the chloroplasts before experimentation began. For four spinach leaves, 10 ml of grinding buffer was used to initially grind the spinach leaves and another 10 ml of grinding buffer was added for additional grinding before the solution was strained through the cheesecloth. Differential centrifugation was used in order to separate the chloroplasts from leaf debris. After the solution was strained through the cheesecloth, it was poured into a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube that was placed in a centrifuge spinning at 200G for three minutes at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was poured into another chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube and placed in a centrifuge at 1000G for ten minutes at 4°C. The supernatant from the second centrifugation was then poured into a new tube while the remaining pellet was stirred with 20 ml of grinding buffer to resuspend the pellet and it was stored on ice. The resuspended pellet solution contains enriched chloroplasts and was used for the remainder of the experiment. Nineteen test tubes were used to make mixtures for all the treatments, the blank, and the controls so that triplets could be made for all groups except the blank. A group with no chloroplasts in white light was used as a negative control to account for variation in absorbance over time for solution itself. A group containing chloroplasts in white light was used as a positive control because white light was hypothesized to have the most photosynthetic activity since white light is a combination of all colors of light. A blank mixture was created to blank the spectrophotometer to the absorbance of the solution without chloroplasts so that changes in absorbance could be accurately compared. The blank solution contained 8 ml of water and 2 ml of 100 mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5 as a reaction buffer to ensure that reducing electrons are isolated to the reduction of DCPIP rather than taking part in a phosphorylation process. The remainder of the test tubes contained 6 ml of water, 2 ml of 130 mM DCPIP and 2 ml of reaction buffer. All solutions were placed in cuvettes and 100µl of enriched chloroplasts was added to each. The spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nm for each measurement, and initial measurements of all tubes were taken before treatment. The cuvettes were then placed in their respective treatment groups and were measured in 3 ten-minute intervals where measurements were taken at the end of each interval. Colored light treatments were given by placing the respective triplets under a white, red, green or blue colored bulb in a lamp that was able to be placed very close to the solutions. An ANOVA test was performed on the average absorbances for each group after 30 minutes to determine if any significant difference existed between all the groups and Tukey-Kramer tests were performed on each group with every other group to determine which groups presented a significant difference from the rest of the groups.

Results:
Some level of photosynthetic activity occurred among all groups containing chloroplasts with the smallest change in activity present in the group given no light. According to Figure 1, the most photosynthetic activity occurred in the chloroplasts treated with red light, followed by white light, green light, blue light and finally no light. The group that did not contain chloroplasts experienced no change in absorbance over the 30-minute interval. 
An ANOVA test performed among the groups indicated that there was a significant difference of absorbances (p=0.0000006) among the different light conditions tested. Further Tukey-Kramer tests performed between each group individually with another group revealed that the no chloroplast group and the no light group were the only groups that were significantly different from any of the other groups. These groups were significantly different from all the treatment groups, but they were not significantly different from one another. The Tukey-Kramer tests also revealed that no significant difference was found between any other pairs of groups in the experiment.

Discussion:
According to the results, the hypothesis that a significant difference in photosynthetic activity will exist between the different colors of light is rejected because no significant difference was observed between the treatment groups of different colored lights. The only significant differences found between the groups were those of no chloroplasts and no light with the all groups that were treated with some form of light. The groups with no chloroplasts and no light had no change in absorbance because photosynthetic activity could not occur with an absence of chloroplasts or in the absence of light. The group given no light must have been exposed to light between measurements because a small change in absorbance was observed. An ANOVA test performed among the groups indicated that there was a significant difference of absorbance (p=0.0000006) among the different light conditions tested. Further Tukey-Kramer tests performed between each group individually with another group revealed that the no chloroplast and the no light groups were the only groups significantly different from any of the other groups. These groups were significantly different from all the treatment groups except from one another. The Tukey-Kramer tests also revealed that no significant difference existed between any other pairs of groups in the experiment. Similarly, a previous study on cherry tomatoes indicated that there was no difference among leaf size under different monochromatic lighting conditions [Hernández R: 2015]. However, it was also found that in cucumber plants under 100B:0R light, greater leaf size was observed [Hernández R: 2015]. Though this study indicated no difference in photosynthetic activity between different colors of light, other studies such as this indicate that the color of light does have an effect on some plants, but some of the effect is the result of physical features of the plants. A different study indicated that near-UV or half the green radiation present in white light increased the fresh and dry weight of marigold plants [Klein R: 1965]. These results present an interesting difference from the results of the present study because increased weight indicates that a larger amount of energy was gained throughout the plants lifetime since energy is required for plants to grow. If under a different light, plants can gain more mass, perhaps some forms of light actually do increase photosynthetic activity. Further studies should be conducted to see what exactly causes this growth because the aforementioned study indicated that near-UV or half green radiations do not appear to affect chlorophyll synthesis, mitochondrial oxidations or respiration [Klein R: 1965]. If photosynthetic mechanisms are not at play in plant growth under colored light, then other factors of plant growth and development must be explored. Another study on lettuce plant leaves found that Red and Blue light combinations are important in driving photosynthesis [Wang J: 2016]. More specifically, it was found that photosynthetic performance of the lettuce plant could be efficiently improved by increasing the blue fraction of light [Wang J: 2016]. In the present study, a very important determinant of photosynthetic activity was ignored. Stomatal opening in leaves controls the movement of gases in and out of the leaf which can have an effect on photosynthesis [Kana T: 1976]. Since photosynthetic activity in the present study only took into account the reduction of DCPIP in electron transport chains, we were unable to analyze the effects of structural factors of the plant on photosynthesis. According to the study on stomata and light color, stomatal opening rates varied with changes in light color [Kana T: 1976]. These opening rates effect the rate of photosynthesis which means that the present study’s results might have been different if a more true-to-life test subject, such as an actual living plant, was used to eliminate confounding variables such as gas exchange through stomata. Another related study found, using P700 redox kinetics for measurement, that the amount of light absorbed by chlorophyll in the deeper tissue of capsicum leaves is higher in red light than in blue light because blue light was preferentially depleted by the uppermost chloroplasts and that photoinhibition was still more severe in blue light than in red light in deeper tissue [Oguchi R: 2011]. The results of this study are important because the present study was done with no consideration of tissue depth related photoinhibition. With a consideration of the present study’s results along with the results of studies mentioned above, more studies should be conducted on different varieties of plants in realistic, lifelike scenarios because the results of this study differed from the studies mentioned primarily in relation to the structures and mechanisms present in living plants rather than the functioning of chloroplasts in a detached leaf. A source of error in this study might be that light color was not isolated for each treatment group well enough to establish that color played the only effect on the photosynthetic activity of a particular group since some white light shined on treatment groups of colored light when measurements were taken. If this study were repeated, it should be repeated without allowing the non-white light treatment groups to be exposed to white light. In future studies, light color should be tested only with live plants because too many other variables that respond to light color have an effect photosynthetic activity. Another source of error was the bulb used to produce green light. After the study, it was determined that the green light actually produced double the emission spectra of the other colored lights which caused it to produce more photosynthetic activity than expected since green light was believed to reflect off of the chloroplasts which would cause little photosynthetic activity. It is also possible that, because the bulbs were halogen bulbs with a colored film, light emitted from them was not pure monochromatic light. This means that little variation in photosynthetic activity would be expected anyways.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The figure above represents the average absorbance for each treatment group after the thirty-minute period. Error bars on each point represent a positive and negative standard deviation from the average absorbances using the triplets for each group. The dotted line represents the average absorbance (~0.55) for every group before the respective treatments were given. This was applicable because the solution in all treatment groups that contained chloroplasts was identical before a treatment was given. The more absorbance decreased below the dotted line, the more photosynthetic activity took place within the 30-minute interval.
