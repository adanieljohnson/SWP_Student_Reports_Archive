Title: Investigating the levels of aggressiveness of Betta splendens in different light environments.

Abstract:
This experiment investigates the role of different light environments on the aggressiveness between two male Betta splendens, otherwise known as Betta fish. Understanding the reasoning behind what evokes aggressive behavior in male Bettas can reveal the evolutionary and physiological importance behind animal behavior. Naturally, male Bettas will act aggressively towards one another when they are place within the same visual field. To expand on this discovery, we tested to see if aggressive behavior in male Betta fish could be enhanced or inhibited by placing them in a bright white light environment or a blue light environment. We hypothesized that the male Bettas would exhibit more sporadic movements and gill flares, when placed in the bright blue environment. In order to quantify the aggressive behavior of these male Betta fish, we counted the number of sporadic movements and gill flares that occurred in each environment. Also, to include variance within our study, we observed three different male Betta fish in the two differing environments. This allowed for the Betta fish to refrain from exhaustion. From the experiment, we found that there was no significant difference in the levels of aggressive behavior between the two light environments. We observed that the Betta fish may 

Introduction:
The types of behavior that an organism exhibits within their environment plays a major role in their ability to survive and reproduce. The study of animal behavior, also known as ethology, investigates the behaviors of individuals in response to both environmental and evolutionary factors. Understanding animal behavior is crucial to understanding how an organism chooses to expend their energy, which impacts their overall fitness. When investigating organisms, ethologists seek to find the physiological and evolutionary causes of behavior of organisms within their natural environment [Barash 2015]. In this experiment, we investigated the intraspecific behavior that occurs between two male Betta splendens in a bright white light environment and a bright blue light environment. B. splendens are naturally known to be aggressive towards one another. The two major types of intraspecific agonistic behavior that occurs between two male B. splendens are broadside movements and facing movements. Pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing are typical broadside movements; whereas, erecting pectoral fins, gill flaring, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes are common facing movements. The male Bettas may also raise their dorsal fin, arch their back, and dart around an opponent. All of these aggressive behaviors require the expulsion of energy; therefore, it is important that the Betta exhibits these behaviors only when they are threatened. Analyzing the cost of aggressive behavior in B. splendens can reveal how the species allocate energy when it comes to agonistic behaviors towards one another [Castro 2006]. In order to quantify aggressive behavior, we measured the number of sporadic movements towards the opponent, as well as gill flares towards the opponent. We hypothesized that the Betta fish will have more sporadic movements and gill flares when they are faced with one another in a bright blue environment. 



Materials and Methods:
For our experiment, we obtained a five-gallon aquarium and 4 male Betta fish (3 experimental fish and 1 spectator fish). The aquarium was filled, and a clear divider, with a blinder, was placed in between the Betta fish. It is important to keep the blinder against the divider during the rest periods in order to keep the fish from exhaustion. The first blue light situation was set up by taping a piece of blue transparent plastic to the side of the aquarium. Then, a lamp was set up to shine through the plastic. A thermometer was also placed in the aquarium to see if there were any changes in temperature while the lamp was on. Once the blue situation was set up, we removed the blinder between the two fish and observed their behavior for five minutes. After the five minutes was up, we returned the blinder and let the Betta fish rest for five minutes. After the rest period was over, we removed the blue sheet and observed the Betta fish behavior under direct white light. After completing both light situations, we repeated the same procedure for the second and third fish. While we were observing the experimental fish, we counted the number of sporadic movements and gill flares that the experimental fish made towards the spectator fish. We then calculated the mean and standard deviation for sporadic movements and gill flares in the blue versus white light environments. Then, a two-tailed T-test was performed to determine if our data held statistical significance. 



Results:
Our data revealed that, on average, there were more sporadic movements and gill flares occurring in the white light environment. For the sporadic movements in the white environment, we determined that the average was 9.6667  5.0332. For the number of sporadic movements in the blue light environment we determined the average was 6.6667  5.0332. For the number of gill flares in the white light environment, we determined the average was 2.3333  2.0817. For the blue light environment, we found the average number of gill flares to be 1.6667  1.5275. To test our data for statistical significance, we performed a two-tailed T-test for the sporadic movements and gill flares. For the sporadic movements, we determined a T-value of 0.729996 and P-value of 0.505845 (df=4). For the gill flares, we found a T-value of 0.447214 and P-value of 0.677869 (df=4). These values reveal that our data held no statistical significance. This data can be found below in Figure 1. and Figure 2. 



Discussion:
At the conclusion of our experiment and analysis of our data, we determined that our hypothesis was not supported. Since our data did not hold statistical significance, we determined that the blue versus white light environments would have no effect on the aggressive behavior of the B. splendens. For the amount of sporadic movements and gill flares that occurred between the three fish, we found that, on average, the Betta fish in the white light environment would exhibit more aggressive movements. Although the two environments had no significant differences, our quantified observations revealed that more aggressive gestures would occur in a white light environment. While we were observing the Betta fish, we did notice the potential occurrence of habituation. Since the male Bettas were not placed directly in the same environment with one another, we found that after about two minutes of visual contact with one another, the Betta fish ceased to act aggressively towards one another. This could be the result of the Betta fish using behavioral insight to realize that the other Betta was not directly in the same environment. Therefore, the Betta fish was able to conserve their energy. This observation holds evolutionary importance, because it reveals how Betta fish will allocate their energy in order to increase their overall fitness. A similar study was conducted with Betta fish that investigated the effect of a bright light cue and robotic fish on the aggressive behavior of Betta fish. The researchers in this study found that when the male Betta fish made visual contact with the robotic replica Betta, they would exhibit aggressive behavior. On top of this, the researchers found that when the male Betta was placed in the visual field of the robotic fish, and under a direct white light cue, the Betta fish’s aggressive behavior increased tremendously [Romano 2017]. Therefore, this experiment revealed how direct white light can increase the aggressive behavior of Betta fish. Although our data was not statistically significant, we found that if any light were to impact the aggressiveness of Betta fish, it would most likely be the white light over the blue light. Some sources of error for this experiment may include the movement of classmates around the area of observation, and the discrepancies in the intensity of light that was utilized for the experiment. The white light may have been entering the experiment environment at a much higher intensity than the blue light, which could have altered the behavior of the Betta fish. The overall purpose of this lab was to discover if different light environments could increase or decrease the aggressive behavior in male Betta fish. From this experiment, a future study could investigate how male Betta fish interact with one another when placed under different intensities of light. Therefore, a future study would be able to determine whether or not light intensity did factor into this original experiment. Ultimately, this experiment revealed how Betta fish will conserve their energy when they no longer feel threatened in an intraspecific interaction. This idea of energy conservation is essential to understanding the evolutionary importance energy allocation in Betta fish.
