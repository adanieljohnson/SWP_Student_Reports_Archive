Title: The Effect of Calcium Channel Activator on the Twitch Threshold for the Leg Muscle of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
	In this experiment, we studied the effect that the calcium channel activator A23187 has on the twitch threshold in the leg muscles of Rana pipiens, Northern Leopard Frog. This experiment was carried about by stimulating the sciatic nerve of the frog leg and measuring the amplitude of the twitch threshold with and without the calcium channel activator during three trials. It was hypothesized that the calcium channel activator would cause a decrease in the threshold of the twitch because the calcium channels would be opened by the activator and there would be an influx of ions that trigger contractions and therefore the threshold would not need to be as high to be stimulated and contract. The study did not necessarily show support for the hypothesis, but the muscles treated with the calcium channel activator had a lower threshold than the controlled muscles for the majority of the trials. The p value obtained was 0.269703, which was not significant, but the results did display a trend that the muscles treated with the activator had a lower twitch amplitude than without the activator. The experiment was successful in creating this trend likely because the activator activated muscle contraction which allows threshold to be lower since a minimal amount of voltage was then needed. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this study is to examine the effect that the calcium activator, A23187, has on the twitch threshold when it is injected into the leg muscle of a Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens. This species is especially important for researching neurons and the neuromuscular system because the muscle can stay alive and viable for a period of time while being studied and therefore the sciatic nerve can still respond to stimuli and twitches can be observed. Also, since these nerves are unique to animals, the intercellular communication examined in the frog legs can be used to compare to human muscles [Johnson: 2016]. This experiment will be conducted in order to understand the way nerves and muscles react to the signals from the neuromuscular system and consequently contract. The manner in which muscles contract begins with the axons of motor neurons entering a muscle, and spreading to supply nerves in myofibers at the neuromuscular junction. Here, nerve impulses cause the release of Ach which binds with receptors, which then opens Na+ channels that generate action potentials. These APs then cause Ca+2 to release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which causes contraction and shortening of the muscle fibers. Therefore, calcium is a necessary component in influencing muscle contraction and also determines the force and energy consumption during contractions [Barclay: 2012]. The threshold we are studying describes the minimum amount of stimulation in voltage that is necessary to conduct a twitch and muscle contraction. Data from previous experiments have shown support for the idea that increasing calcium causes the lowering of twitch threshold, however data on this subject is not yet conclusive [Constantin: 1967]. With this in mind, we expected that the calcium channel activator studied would cause the twitch threshold to decrease because the opening of the Ca+2 channels, due to the activator, will cause an inflow of positive ions and subsequently depolarization of the cell, so the threshold observed would presumably be similar to the AP threshold. The independent variable is the presence of calcium channel activator and the dependent variable being studied is the strength of twitch in the frog leg. We hypothesized that the calcium channel activator A23187 would cause the twitch threshold during muscle contractions in the frog leg to decrease.


Materials and Methods:
In order to study the neuromuscular function of Rana pipiens, or Northern Leopard Frog, the leg was prepared by removing the skin, exposing the sciatic never from between the inner thigh muscles, detaching the gastrocnemius muscle from the leg and then elevating the muscle above the dissecting pan with string. Ringer’s solution was used to moisten the legs throughout the experiments, and each leg was used as its own control because its threshold is tested first without the calcium channel activator. The C-BNC-N2 simulator cable was attached to the sciatic nerve and the nerve was stimulated while finding and recording the threshold.  During each stimulation, the frequency (Hz) was set to 1 and the pulse width (ms) was set to 5. The gastrocnemius muscles of the legs were then injected with the calcium channel activator, for the treatment groups, and the threshold was measured with the calcium channel activator present. The calcium channel activator used for the treatment group was 100nM A23187 solution, which was prepared prior to the experiment with the dissolving of 5.0mg in 10mL ethanol and then diluting to 100mL in Ringer’s solution. The statistical test used to organize the information from the experiment is a paired two-sample t-test. 


Results:
The results of this experiment showed that the twitch threshold generally decreased when the calcium channel activator was used, in comparison to the control amplitude threshold. Specifically, we observed that in the first trial frog leg the threshold for the control and treatment groups were the same, which skewed the conclusiveness of the data slightly, because in the second and third trials the treatment threshold had decreased from the control threshold, as seen in the figure. The voltage out of the muscle contraction which shows the strength of contraction decreased between the control and treatment for the first trial, increased between the two for the second, and stayed the same for the control and treatment of the third. The paired t-test used to analyze the information showed a t-value of 1.511858, degrees of freedom of 2 and a P-value of 0.269703. Since this P-value is not less than 0.05, the results are not significant however. The figure depicts the data of each of the three trials, comparing the control and treatment groups of each. In all the trials, except for the first, the twitch threshold decreased with the addition of the calcium channel activator.


Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported with the experiment, but the general trend illustrates that the twitch threshold seemed to decrease with the treatment of the calcium channel activator as opposed to the control leg muscles without the treatment. With this information, we can infer that the trend likely occurred because the calcium channel activator caused the opening of calcium channels, causing positive ions to flood in and depolarize the cell, because a lesser amount of voltage is then needed to stimulate a contraction of the cell.  The calcium channel activator increases the ability of muscle contraction because an influx of calcium ions is necessary to initiate muscle fiber contraction, therefore the threshold of the twitch can be presumed to have decreased with treatment because the calcium channel activator made the muscle more easily able to contract, therefore a lower threshold was needed to stimulate it [Barclay: 2012]. Possible future steps in researching this field should be to do more extensive testing on threshold changes, because there is limited data on the interactions between threshold changes and calcium channel activators. The data is relatively limited on this specific subject so more research on specifically the twitch threshold would be valuable to confirm that no other factors were behind the confirmation of hypothesis. Since the statistical test shows the data was not strong enough to prove that the results could not have been affected by other factors, as shown with the P-value not being significant, we cannot say that the hypothesis was supported, however it appears it could be with further supporting data and more trials. Some possible factors that could have negatively affected the experiment is the fatigue of the frog leg during the treatment portion after acting as its own control, and also the few amount of trials used. In a similar study about the effect of calcium on contraction thresholds in frog skeletal muscle, it is explained that the contraction threshold is changed because of the extracellular calcium concentration because it causes a larger depolarization to be required. The results of the study showed a decrease in contraction threshold of about 5mV, due to increase in extracellular calcium. This study therefore supports the results obtained in this experiment, however this study also states that the studies of calcium effects on contraction threshold often include inconclusive and differing results [Constantin: 1967]. This is in line with our experiment on the effect of a calcium channel activator on the twitch amplitude of Rana pipiens, which displayed a decrease in twitch threshold during muscle contractions with the presence of the calcium channel activator. Our data was also not conclusive however, but showed a noticeable trend that could lead to certainty with further studies and data on the topic in the future.
