Title: Varying levels of salinity and the effect on the rate of photosynthesis in isolated chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of salt concentrations in the reaction buffer on the rate of photosynthesis in spinach leaves.  Salinity is researched to decrease the rate of photosynthesis in a sample.  After isolating the spinach chloroplasts, a test was done using a spectrometer and varying concentrations of salt to see the effect this had.  Our results did not support our hypothesis that the highest salinity would have the lowest rate of photosynthesis.  Further research utilizing the entire spinach plant may need to be considered to yield results of decreasing photosynthesis. 


Introduction:
Spinach leaves are known as one of the ‘leafy green’ vegetables that can contribute to improved health due to the many nutrients they contain.  Spinach leaves can also be utilized in many plant studies because of the size of the leaf and the large veins.  The leaf contains the chloroplasts and chlorophyll where photosynthesis takes place, so using the leaves can ultimately benefit photosynthesis experiments.  The leaves are easily accessible in the produce section of grocery stores, and the chloroplasts are easy to isolate using a centrifuge.  Photosynthesis is used to produce energy for plants from taking in carbon dioxide, fixing it, and producing glucose. Many factors, internal and external, can affect photosynthesis because of the mechanisms used in the reactions leading up to the glucose product.  Common studies include light intensity, water salinity, or the use of herbicides.  In a thale cress study, a hypertonic salt solution caused ATP synthesis to decrease [Hou, et al.: 2018].  This study made us question whether or not different concentrations of salt would affect the rate of photosynthesis in a varying way that is related to the increase in concentrations. Most plants cannot thrive in salty environments because of the effect it has on the rate of photosynthesis. Another study on sorghum, a grain, reported that high salinity levels along with high temperatures decreased the rate of photosynthesis [Yan, et al.:2012].  While it appears that salinity has an effect on photosynthesis, the concentration of salinity and the type of salt used may affect the rate as well.  In an experiment with spinach leaves and their chlorophyll specifically, 4 different types of salts were used at 2 different concentrations.  The experiment focuses on structural effects of the spinach leaves such as the swelling of grana and the removal of green pigment [Yao, et al.: 1972].  This study led us to believe that even the structural parts of the spinach would be affected by varying concentrations of salt.  Based on previous experiments and background knowledge, the concentration of salinity and the effect on photosynthesis will be tested. The higher salinity will have a greater negative effect on the rate of photosynthesis.  


Materials and Methods:
We began the experiment by deveining the spinach leaves and grinding them into a solution with grinding buffer.  This solution was centrifuged two separate times, one at 200xG for 3 minutes and then removing the supernatant, and the second time using the supernatant at 1000xG for 10 minutes.  The liquid from the final centrifuge was used as the source of chlorophyll.  In test tubes including one blank solution, water, DCPIP, and a reaction buffer were added to equal 10mL in each tube.  Different groups received different salinity concentrations of the reaction buffer that was diluted to the correct concentrations of 0M, 0.25M, and 0.5M.  These solutions were transferred to cuvettes to be measured for absorbance in the spectrometer at absorbance of 600nm.  All of the cuvettes were placed under a lamp for a total of 30 minutes.  At each 10-minute interval the cuvettes were tested for change in absorbance.  Equation 1 was used to determine the change in absorbance over time which reflected the rate of photosynthesis in the cuvettes.  After the data was collected an ANOVA test and Tukey-Kramer test was done to find any significant differences in our data. 

Equation 1:
 % change=([absorbance @ time 0–absorbance @time tested]/absorbance @ time 0)*100


Results:
Percent change increased with the higher salinity of the reaction buffer, both 0.25M and 0.5M.  Time under the light source also affected the percent change of all 3 groups of data with an increase from the absorbance recorded prior (Figure 1).  The percent change was higher for both 0.25M and 0.5M compared to the control while the 0.5M percent change was higher than the 0.25M (Figure 2).  After the ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests were ran, the percent change was not statistically different when comparing the control to 0.25M, control to 0.5M, or 0.25M to 0.5M (p=0.922, AB= not sig, AC= not sig, BC= not sig).  


Discussion:
The results did not support our hypothesis that a high salinity would have the largest negative affect on the rate of photosynthesis; it showed the opposite.  The highest salinity concentration, 0.5M, had the largest percent change from the starting point to the measurements done after 30 minutes of light.  This data suggests that the highest salinity allowed photosynthesis to occur faster.  The same trend is shown for the 0.25M solution of reaction buffer.  The rate of photosynthesis was increased from the control group but lower than the highest salinity.  
	
Studies show that an increase in salinity can lower the rate of photosynthesis such as the study done on barley where 3 concentrations of salinity were tested on different genotypes, and susceptible plants were most affected by high salinity.  This study was performed using the entire plant that was potted in soil [Allel, Ben-Amar, Abdelly: 2018].  Our experiment was conducted by utilizing only the chlorophyll from the leaf instead of the entire plant. We may not have seen a significant percent change in the rate of photosynthesis because the entire plant was not utilized.  An experiment previously mentioned tested the effect of salinity on the structure of chlorophyll and the organelles found there.  The researchers observed swelling of certain structures and separation of membranes [Yao, Sterling, Stocking: 1972].  Using this information, we can predict the salinity had some structural effect on the chlorophyll even if the percent change in the absorbance was not significant.  

Some plants can adapt to stresses on their environment like soybeans in a high salinity soil.  An experiment showed root and shoot lengths increased in certain genotypes when introduced to a high salinity environment [Liu, et al.: 2017].  If a plant can adapt to salt stress immediately, it is possible some plants have adapted overtime to in order to continue photosynthesis at the highest rate.  The researchers continued to change genotypes of the soybeans to alter the ability to adapt when in high salinity. They found they could produce a plant that was very tolerable to high levels of salt in soil [Liu, et al.: 2017].  Continued research could be done to help genetically modify certain crops to increase yields in soil with higher salt levels. This could greatly benefit the agricultural community in regions where soil is high in salt and other molecules that may affect the rate of photosynthesis, and in turn, plant growth.
