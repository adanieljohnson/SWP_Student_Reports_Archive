Title: The addition of an acetylcholine receptor agonist, nicotine, causes increased muscle contraction amplitude in the Rania pipens gastrocnemus muscle

Abstract:
Because of the presence of the nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction, the acetylcholine receptor agonist nicotine, should have some effect on muscular contraction. Three Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscles were isolated to analyze the effects of nicotine on muscle contraction amplitude. To obtain controlll values, each frog leg was stimulated and analyzed three times using LabScribe software at the stimulation threshold. To obtain experimental data, .1Ml of 1mg/Ml nicotine was injected into the muscle prior to stimulation. The muscle was then stimulated three times at threshold value. Because nicotine is an acetylcholine agonist, it was thought that it would profoundly increase muscle amplitude. With the performance of a paired t_test, it was found that the muscle amplitude of nicotine-supplemented contraction was statistically significently higher than controlll values because of chemically induced contraction in the muscle. Frog one produced a p_value of .002, frog two produced a p_value of .00003, and frog three produced a p_value of .00005, confirming statistical difference between controlll and experimental values.


Introduction:
	Nicotine is an acetylcholine receptor agonist that is also a common stimulant in the everyday. Specifically, it has its own nicotinic receptor at the area where a motor nerve and skeletal muscle meet called the neuromuscular junction. This junction is responsible for initiating movement in the body. An essential component to this process is signal transmission from the nerve to the muscle at the synapse between the two called the neuromuscular junction. Because of the behavior of nicotine as an acetylcholine agonist, it should have some impact on muscle contraction. At the neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is the primary method of chemical transmission. When an action potential reaches the end of the presynaptic neuron, acetylcholine vesicles are docked and the acetylcholine is released into the synapse. Acetylcholine then binds to receptors on the motor end plate, causing an influx of sodium ions into the cell. This voltage change causes other processes to occur and, eventually, muscular contraction [Sadava: 2016]. 
In this experiment, the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipens was used to experiment on the neuromuscular junction. This is a great organism to study muscular contractions because frogs rely on their leg muscles to move [Kamel: 1996]. Additionally, it is very easy to isolate the muscle and directly stimulate it. Because of acetylcholineâ€™s role in initiating contraction at the neuromuscular junction, the goal of this experiment is to identify and analyze the effects of an acetylcholine agonist supplement on muscle contraction amplitude. Muscle contraction amplitude, measured on a myogram, gives information about the inherent strength of a muscular contraction. It has been previously seen that the acetylcholine agonist, levamisole produces hypercontraction in nematodes. Levamisole does this because it induces chemical excitation to supplement normal electrical stimulation, thus causing a stronger contraction [Richmond: 2008]. Therefore it is necessary to see if this result is true for a broader array of acetylcholine agonists. 
Nicotine is a stimulant seen very commonly in the everyday world. One prominent feature of nicotine is its ability to mimic acetylcholine and, therefore, act as an acetylcholine receptor agonist. At the neuromuscular junction, there exist some acetylcholine receptors called nicotinic receptors, which respond directly to nicotine to allow sodium influx in the muscle cell [Colquhan: 2003]. Because nicotine directly stimulates these acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, it will cause some changes when added. Specifically, the presence of nicotine (independent variable) should cause an increase in muscle contraction amplitude (dependent variable) because it basically serves as supplemental acetylcholine at the synapse. This extra acetylcholine should cause more calcium to be released in the cell for a longer period of time and, thus, a stronger muscle contraction. 


Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were each prepared identically in this experiment. The skin of the frog leg was removed, then the sciatic nerve was isolated from above the knee. The Gastrocnemius was then separated from the bone and the Achilles tendon was severed close to the ankle and tied off with a string. The string was then hung on a force transducer to lightly suspend the muscle and measure voltage. Four pins were then placed between the bone and the muscle at varying angles, to immobilize the rest of the leg and direct muscle stimulators were placed into two spots along the muscle for stimulation. In each frog leg the minimum threshold of stimulation was determined and we then recorded the muscle contraction amplitude of three twitches using LabScribe software to serve as our controlll data [Johnson: 2017]. To determine our experimental data, we then injected the frog with .1Ml of 1mg/Ml nicotine. It is necessary to record during the injection to account for changes in muscle contraction amplitude. Three amplitudes were then measured in order to account for the nicotine injection. These amplitudes needed to be added to the voltage change which occurred during injection because both contractions were simultaneously present. A paired t_test was then performed to determine whether the muscle contraction amplitudes obtained in the controlll and experimental groups were statistically different from one another.


Results:
Both of the first two frog legs showed to have a threshold of 0.4V. When stimulated at this threshold value under controlll conditions, leg one produced an average muscle contraction amplitude of 0.1303V with a standard deviation of .007V and leg two produced a 0.0347V muscle contraction amplitude with a standard deviation of .009V (figures 1 and 2). The third frog leg was stimulated at its threshold value of 0.2V and produced an average muscle amplitude of 0.0396V with a standard deviation of .001V(figure 3). When each leg was treated with nicotine, the myogram immediately spiked and the muscle very clearly initiated a continuous contraction. With this chemically induced contraction and normal stimulus, frog 1 produced a 0.216V average amplitude with a standard deviation of .001V (figure 1), frog 2 produced a 0.371V average muscle amplitude with a standard deviation of .01V (figure 2), and frog 3 produced a 0.168V average muscle amplitude with a standard deviation of .0006V (figure 3). Upon performing the t_tests, p_values were obtained. Frog 1 produced a p_value of .002, frog 2 produced a p_value of .00003 and frog 3 produced a p_value of .00005.  


Discussion:
	We hypothesized that nicotine supplementation would cause an increase in muscle contraction amplitude and our results supported this notion. After conducting this experiment, it is clear that the nicotine supplement produced a significent increase in muscle amplitude in each frog leg (figures 1, 2, and 3). This is most likely due to the action of nicotine before stimulation. When nicotine is first injected, the muscle immediately begins to contract without additional stimulation. This is due to a chemically induced contraction produced by the nicotine. When the nicotine is directly placed into the muscle, it causes activity in acetylcholine receptors which goes on to initiate its own contraction in the muscle. This chemically induced tetany remains in a state of constant contraction in the muscle. When normal electrical stimulation is used on top of that, it contracts again on top of this now pre-existing contraction. This mechanism is in accordance with a study analyzing chemical stimulation of muscle via phosphate injections, another acetylcholine agonist administered via injection [Kniffki and Mense: 1977]. Both our experiment and their experiment found that stimulant injection resulted in a chemically-induced contraction. Our results also match up with the findings in a previous study which found that nicotinic receptors are very active in muscle contraction because of their abundance at the neuromuscular junction. Because there are so many nicotinic receptors, their action accounts for a large portion of muscle depolarization [Wang, Yu and Ochani: 2003]. The presence of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in muscle tissue gives nicotine its own unique place to bind. Because of this, in the future it would be useful to study the effects of an analog of acetylcholine that does not have its own unique receptor. It would be useful to see if it would still bind to receptors in the neuromuscular junction even though it does not have its own receptor. Additionally, because the results of nicotine supplementation were pretty similar across the board, it would be interesting to see how this changes when concentrations. That is, would amplitude increase with increased nicotine, or simply last longer at the same amplitude? One final future way to study the effects of acetylcholine agonists at the neuromuscular junction would be to analyze how an agonist like nicotine affects the neuromuscular junction when an inhibitor is also added. It would be interesting to note whether the inhibitor or the agonist affect the muscle more or whether their effects cancel each other out. While the results of our study on the surface seem to be very clear, we did run into some limitations. First and foremost, the sample size in our experiment is the most prominent limitation. Because we only analyzed three Rania pipiens legs, it is very difficult to determine whether statistical difference will occur across the board. If we had more frogs legs to analyze, we could more confidently say whether the amplitudes are always significently different. Additionally, one of our Rania pipiens legs came with a split sciatic nerve. To compensate for this, we had to use the direct muscle stimulators. Because we were injecting into the muscle directly, it is possible that some nicotine got onto the stimulator which was sued for each of the three frogs. Thus, it is possible that the controlll values for frogs 2 and 3 could have been skewed. A third limitation came with the size of the frog legs. The frog legs that we used varied in size from small, slightly bigger and relatively large. Yet, we used the same amount of nicotine supplementation for each frog. This also could have altered the results. However, it seems that our experiment went well and that nicotine supplementation does in fact increase muscle amplitude
