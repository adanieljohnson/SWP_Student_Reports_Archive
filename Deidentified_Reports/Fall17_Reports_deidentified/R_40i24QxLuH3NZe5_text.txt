Title: The Effect of Tank Size on Total Betta Fish Aggression Time

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior can be tricky since the researcher has to create new methods of quantifying movements into numerical values that can be analyzed. When studying behavior, Betta fish, betta splendens, is often used as it has characteristic aggressive movements. In this study, we wanted to know if tank size has an effect on the total aggression time, using gill flaring as a marker. Statistical tests showed no significance between the medium tank and the large tank. Additionally, there was no significance between the medium tank and the small tank. Data like this is important when we want to know why animals react the way they do and how it translates to human behavior. 

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior using observational data that is quantified in some way. Animal aggression is a behavior that is often studied by scientists in an attempt to understand the drives behind such behaviors. To study aggression, a common animal subject is the Siamese Fighting Fish, or Betta spendens, which has been documented to exhibit characteristic agonistic behavior. Agonistic, or aggressive behaviors, are those movements that are exhibited by an animal that is threatened in some way [Johnson 2017]. A characteristic agonistic behavior of the betta fish is called gill flaring in which the fish inflates its operculum which results in the gills extending outward [Forsatkar, 2016]. Our group was interested in how the size of the tank in which two male fish are in would affect gill flare time. We hypothesized that, with regards to the medium tank and small tank, that the betta fish in the smallest tank would exhibit the longest total gill flare time due to the decreased volume of water available for evading behavior.  With regard to the medium tank and the large tank, the group hypothesized that the large tank would have a smaller total gill flare time due to increased volume of water for evading behavior. 


Materials and Methods:
The group obtained two betta fish that are to be used in all 9 trials. We completed the first trial on the medium tank (2400cm3 water) that was to be our control. For each trial, a stopwatch is assigned to both fish and the total time (in seconds) of gill flaring is recorded for each fish in each trial. After a five-minute exposure period was completed, the fish were removed and put into separate resting containers for five minutes. Two more trials were completed for the medium tank. Afterwards three trials were completed for both the small tank (1080 cm3 water) and the large tank (14,175 cm3 water) with five minute exposure times followed by five minute periods of rest. 
	The data collected was the time (in seconds) that each fish exhibited gill flaring behavior. These two numbers were then added together to create a total time of aggression. This data was then analyzed using a two-tailed t-test to determine whether there was a significance between the control trials and the large and small tank trials. Two tests were performed: one between the large tank and medium tank (control) and one between the small tank and medium tank (control). 


Results:
The average gill flare behavior time for the small tank was 9.33  8.49 seconds. The average gill behavior time for the medium tank was 22.8  32.3 seconds. The average gill behavior time for the large tank was 3.84  4.48 seconds. 
	A two-tailed T-test was used to analyze the data. The test performed between the medium tank behavior data and the small tank behavior data showed that the data was not statistically different (t-stat = 0.87, df = 10, P = 0.40). The test performed between the medium tank behavior data and the large tank behavior data showed that the data was also not statistically significant (t-stat = 1.28, df = 10, P = 0.23).

Discussion:
After performing the two-tailed T-test was performed, it was shown that there was no significant difference between the two experimental tanks (large and small tank) and the control tank. Saying this, our hypothesis that the smallest tank would elicit a longer total gill flare time than the medium tank as well as our hypothesis that the larger tank would have a smaller total gill flare time could not be supported and the null hypothesis that no effect on aggression time would be caused by changing tank size could not be rejected. 
	One likely reason that the data did not prove to be significant is the idea of habituation, which is the decrease of a behavior due to being desensitized to a continual stimulus. In a study concerning a bettas’ response to a continual stimulus of a mirror, it was found that the fish start to diminish behavior as the stimulus continues [Clayton and Hinde 1967]. In our experiment, the fish stopped any sign of gill flaring and agonistic behavior after seeing the other fish for about a minute of exposure. Another study links the quick habituation time to a stimulus as having a chemical basis that works specifically on agonistic behavior [Meliska 1975]. Beyond habituation, chemical changes work to explain what may have caused the minimal aggressive displays. The tank size may not have mattered with regards to total gill flare time if both of the fish were going to habituate so quickly.  
	In future trials it would be advantageous to run many more trials to solidify how tank size effects the total gill flare, agonistic behavior. Also, tanks with more specific measurements may be of importance in future trials because the volume of water in two containers may be the same but the containers can look very different. Research like this is important when understanding how and why animals react to stimuli and how that connects to human behavior.
