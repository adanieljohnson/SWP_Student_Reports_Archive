Title: Salt stress increases photosynthetic activity in spinach 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen, is an essential process for both plants and life on earth. There are many different factors that affect photosynthetic rates in plants; among them is salt concentration. It is thought that salt stress decreases rates of photosynthesis due to increased plant stress, thus we hypothesized that increased salt concentrations added to chloroplasts would decrease rates of photosynthesis. We used the properties of the Hill reaction and DCPIP to measure the effects of salt concentrations (0-500mM NaCl) on photosynthetic activity. The results indicated that there was a statistically significent increase in photosynthetic activity in chloroplasts treated with 500mM NaCl compared to controlll in a one-way ANOVA (p=0.027) and Tukey-Kramer test. It is unclear why our experiment deviated so greatly from previous literature but one possible explanation is the method used by previous literature and our study which, which directly added NaCl to chloroplasts instead of growing plants in the different NaCl conditions. The method for measuring photosynthesis was also different. However, these studies are important for understanding plant function because global salinity levels in soils have risen. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is an essential process for both plants and life on earth. It is the process by which plants convert light energy, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, a nutrient they use to perform other cell functions, and oxygen which is an important gas for respiring organisms. This is known as the process of photosynthesis, which occurs in the membrane of the thylakoid in the chloroplast. During this process, chloroplasts must absorb solar radiation in order to excite electrons in the cells, which are used to power the synthesis of glucose and release of oxygen as a byproduct. There are two types of reactions that plants undergo: light dependent reactions which require solar energy to capture electrons, and light independent reactions which convert carbon dioxide into glucose. For the purpose of this experiment, we will focus on light dependent reactions. 

Specifically in this experiment, we will look at photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca, commonly known as spinach. In order to measure photosynthetic activity, we will use the Hill reaction: 2H2O + 2A í 2AH2 + O2, which is a measure of ATP production, or reduction of an electron carrier such as NADP+ [Wohlfahrt:2015]. In laboratory experiments, A is replaced by an artificial electron acceptor, DCPIP. In its oxidized state (left side of the reaction) it is blue and absorbs well at 600nm of light; DCPIP turns colorless in its reduced state (right side of the reaction) and absorbs poorly at 600nm. Experimentally, these properties of DCPIP mean that at higher absorbance, there are lower rates of photosynthesis while the inverse is true for lower absorbance.

There are many environmental factors that affect photosynthetic rates and in this experiment we will explore if and what affect salt stress has on spinach. Previous studies have come to similar conclusions that either salt stress, which was defined differently in different studies, has either no significent effect on photosynthesis or the effect cannot be directly attributed to salt stress. Two studies on spinach specific came to different conclusions. A 1987 study conducted by Geunther and his research team looked at the effect of salt stress, with concentrations ranging from 0-400mM, on photosynthesis by measuring electron transport through PSII and from water to ferredoxin. The study concluded that overall photosynthesis decreased under high salinity (400mM) conditions but it was not attributed to the direct effect on salinity on different aspects on the thylakoid membrane complexes [Guenther: 1987]. A different study on spinach concluded that at 100mM concentrations of salt, there was no major decrease in photosynthetic potential of the leaf [Robinson: 1983]. Both these studies grew spinach leaves in the appropriate experimental salinity conditions, unlike this study which directly adds NaCl to chloroplasts. Studies of other plant species, such as various Indian mangroves, cheatgrass, and various other plant species (potatoes, peas, tomatoes, etc.) all concluded that salt stress generally decreases photosynthesis, but that this was most likely not directly related to chloroplast activity [3-5]. High salt concentrations inside the plant results in decreased stomatal activity in order to keep water inside to balance the ion concentration, which leads to disturbed normal function of plant activities including photosynthesis, thus resulting in the observed decrease in photosynthesis [Rasmunson: 2002].

Since the literature reports overall decreased or no change in rates of photosynthesis across a variety of species, we expect that an increase in NaCl added to chloroplasts will likely decrease the rate of photosynthesis in our experiment.

Materials and Method:
Sample Preparation: We ground up 5 fresh spinach leaves in 20Ml of grinding buffer (400mM sucrose on Tricine buffer, pH8) and collected chloroplasts by centrifugation. The sample was centrifuged for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm; the liquid was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 2800 rpm and the resulting pellet, containing mostly chloroplasts, was re-suspended in 10 Ml grinding buffer and used in the experiment. 

Experimental Setup: We had three experimental treatments, with three replicates each. Each treatment had different concentrations of NaCl added: 0mM (1Ml distilled water), 250mM, and 500mM. Each sample contained 5Ml water, 2Ml DCPIP, 2Ml reaction buffer, 1Ml NaCl, and 100μL chloroplasts. A negative controlll with no addition of chloroplasts was used. Once all the samples were prepared, absorbance at 600nm on the spectrometer was measured immediately for baseline, and subsequent measurements were taken every 10 minutes for a total of 20 minutes.

Statistical Analysis: In order to test for significance, a one-way ANOVA test was applied to the samples and a Tuckey-Kramer test was used to determine where there was significance between the samples. Significance was determined to be a p_value less than or equal to 0.05.

Results:
The results of the experiment show a trend of decrease in absorbance of the sample with increasing salt concentration (Figure1). The average absorbance of the samples containing 0mM NaCl (distilled water) was 0.060+/-0.011; the average absorbance of the samples containing 250mM NaCl was 0.046+/-0.003; the average absorbance of the samples containing 5000mM NaCl was 0.031+/-0.012. A one-way ANOVA for three sample groups with 2 degrees of freedom resulted in p_value=0.027 with a variance component of 66.8% (Table 1). The Tukey-Kramer test showed that there was only statistical significance between the 0mM and 500mM groups, indicated by an asterisk on Figure 1 (Table 2).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that increase concentrations of NaCl in chloroplasts would decrease photosynthetic rates was not supported. In fact, the opposite was observed, with statistical significance. There was instead a statistically significent increase in photosynthetic activity with increased concentrations of NaCl added, which is unlike what previous literature has suggested. There are several reasons that may account for the observed results. 

There were inherent differences between previous literature and our study. In previous literature, the plants were treated with different salt concentrations as they were grown, whereas in our experiment salt was added directly to chloroplasts. This exemplifies the difference in the effect of increased salinity in whole plant vs isolated plant system. The whole plant effect increased salinity has on photosynthesis could be due to other factors such as stomatal conductance - which is how previous studies have described the effects they have observed. However, our experiment focuses specifically on chloroplasts and specifically on electron acceptors. This difference in method could account for differences between precious literature and our experiment. "Salt stress" was also defined differently. One study defined it as 400mM [Guenther: 1987] and another as 100mM [Robinson: 1983]. Our experiment uses 500mM to measure salt stress, which could explain why the Robinson study did not find significent differences at 100mM compared to controlll - our study did not find significent difference between 250mM and 0mM NaCl either. The difference in concentration simply did not reach a threshold for significance. However, the more important finding in our experiment was that photosynthesis rates increased.

In previous studies, salt was available to the chloroplasts for conducting their cell function and managing/using ion gradients to push reactions forward. This changed many other aspects of the plant as a whole both structurally and functionally. Our study used spinach plants as grown for edible purposes and had salt added to the chloroplasts specifically, not the whole plant. This is a key difference because the whole plant did not respond to changes in salt concentrations, only the chloroplasts did. Salt is an important nutrient because it allows for the formation of ion gradients that push reactions forward. Too much salt is toxic, of course, because plants need to maintain hypotonic conditions within the cell. However, salt itself is necessary to conduct cell functions. Our interpretation of the results is that the 0mM controlll group did not have as much access to ions to form the necessary ion gradients to push the reaction forward. The subsequent increasing concentrations of NaCl provided the cells with ionic driving force they needed, thus increasing rates of photosynthesis.

However, this is an isolated system and further research on whole plant effects in necessary. A 2015 study noted that the beginning of the 21st century has been marked by decreased water resources, environmental pollution, and increase salinization of soil and water [Shrivastava: 2015]. This has major implications for plants because toxic amounts of salt stunt plant growth. Naturally, what affects plants affects all respiring species. Careful research is required to understand what these toxic levels are and how plants adapt to these persisting environmental changes. Moreover, how can we restore salinity levels and promote healthy growth of plants?
