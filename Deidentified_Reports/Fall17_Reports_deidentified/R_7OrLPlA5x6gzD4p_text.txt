Title: Unit 2: Neuromuscular Control Lab Report  Effect of Lidocaine on Muscular Function 

Abstract:
In this lab, we investigated how muscles and nerves respond to specific stimuli by 
isolating the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus from a leg of a frog (Rania pipiens). Using three individual frog legs, we compared muscle contraction by measuring twitch amplitude in volts between a controlll and experimental variable. We chose to test the effect of Lidocaine, a common drug and antagonist, on the sodium channels responsible for the contraction of a frog's gastrocnemus muscle. Over three separate trials we compared the twitch response in volts from our controlll variable with our experimental variable, the leg administered with 25mM of Lidocaine. Since Lidocaine is an antagnostic, we hypothesized that Lidocaine would decrease the response for muscle contraction. 


Introduction:
When a stimulus is present the central nervous system (CNS) sends a signal or an action potential (AP) through the neurons. When this action potential reaches the muscle junction, Ca2+ is able to enter the terminal axon, which causes a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), to be released and bind to the muscle fiber acetylcholine (ACh), to be released and bind to the muscle fiber. When ACh is bound to the muscle fiber, the fiber depolarizes and initiates an AP. This action potential can be blocked from proceeding if ACh is not able to bind with its receptors. Lidocaine, a commonly used atheistic, acts as an antagonist to receptors by blocking sodium ions (Na+) through sodium channels. When administered this drug prevents action potentials from firing, therefore causing decreases in twitch tension and contraction response. 
	In a recent case study on the effects of Lidocaine and the permanently charged sodium channel blocker QX-314 in rodents. Since local anesthetics block voltage-gated sodium channels in axons, they disrupt action potential generation and thereby prevent transmission of nociceptive information to the central nervous system. These researches chose lidocaine because its sodium channel blocking effects and because it activates transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels with a much lower potency than capsaicin (the pungent ingredient in chili peppers to activate TRPV1). They hypothesized that “the activation of TRPV1 channels by lidocaine may be sufficient to allow selective entry of QX-314 into nociceptors and thereby produce a long-lasting nociceptive-specific regional blockade beyond the short-lived nonselective effects of lidocaine alone” (Binshtok et al., 2009). To test this, they examined in rats the magnitude and duration of the effects of lidocaine alone, QX-314 alone, and the combination of lidocaine and QX-314 together on evoked nocifensive responses and motor behavior in vivo. In their results related to Lidocaine alone, an injection of 1% caused an almost complete blockade 30 mins after infection with full recovery after 1 hour (Binshtok et al., 2009). They found that that a lidocaine, and the membrane-impermeable sodium channel blocker, QX-314, a simple permanently charged quaternary derivative of lidocaine, produces prolonged local analgesia in contrast to the short-lived, nonselective effect of lidocaine when administered alone (Binshtok et al., 2009).
In our own experiment, we tested the effects of Lidocaine on the sodium channels responsible for the contraction of a frog's (Rania pipiens) gastrocnemus muscle. Building off this case study and previous knowledge of the nervous system, we hypothesized that Lidocaine would decrease the response for muscle contraction. Whereas twitch amplitude measured in volts was our continuous dependent variable, the presence of our stimulus (Lidocaine) served as our discrete independent variable. By isolating the sciatic nerve from a frog’s leg and injecting 25 mM of Lidocaine into one of the frog legs, we able to test the effect of this antagonist on muscle response. 


Materials and Method:
In this lab, we began by removing the skin of the frog’s leg from the top to bottom of the foot with forceps. Then, we gently separated the inner thigh muscles to reveal and isolate the white sciatic nerve. Very carefully, we removed the excess connective tissue and tied a string from the led to stand, which positioned the leg with slight tension at about ninety degrees. In the dissecting pan, we attached the BNC connector directly to the sciatic nerve and then set the number of pulses to zero and the pulse amplitude to 1.0 volts. For each trial of our three trials, we reset the stimulus amplitude to 1.0v and recorded the twitch response in volts for each of the controlll and experimental frog legs. Whereas twitch amplitude measured in volts was our continuous dependent variable, the presence of our stimulus (25mM of Lidocaine) served as our discrete independent variable. For each frog leg, we first recorded the amplitude response for the controlll variable (no drug) and then after administered 25mM of Lidocaine recorded the response. After we recorded the data for three separate trials, we carried out a paired t_test along with other calculations to measure Lidocaine’s effect on twitch amplitude. Whereas our statistical null hypothesis stated that there would be no change in twitch amplitude, our statistical alternative hypothesis predicted that Lidocaine would decrease the response for muscle contraction.







Results:
Figure. 1 
The presence of 25mM Lidocaine caused a decrease in twitch amplitude (v) for two out of the three trials. Average mean decrease of 0.1087 between the controlll (blue) and the experimental (red).

Discussion:
Given these results, our statistical alternative hypothesis that Lidocaine would decrease the response for muscle contraction was supported because there was an overall decrease in twitch amplitude after administering 25mM of Lidocaine. Since our P-value was lower than 0.05 we can reject our statistical null hypothesis in favor of our alternative hypothesis. Even though our third trial increased from 0.318 v to .515 v, we can assume that this was probably due to an error in our methodology of recording the twitch amplitude. If we conducted more trials, we could have a larger pool of data that would have made our data more statistically accurate. Also, since we had trouble connecting the BNC connector to the sciatic nerve, it could have skewed our raw data.
