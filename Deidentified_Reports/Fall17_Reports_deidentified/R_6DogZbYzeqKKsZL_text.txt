Title: The Minimal Effect of Different Wavelengths of Light on Photosynthetic Rate of Spinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
In order to maintain life, plants harvest their energy from the sun through a process called photosynthesis. Determining which wavelength of light causes the highest photosynthetic rate in Spinacia oleracea (spinach plants) may indicate what type of light is most suitable for efficiently growing and maintaining not only spinach plants, but other commercially sold plants as well. This experiment tested different wavelengths of light by measuring the absorbance of chloroplasts in the presence of DCPIP that were placed under different colored lights for 30 minutes with the expectation that there would be a certain wavelength of light that is optimal for spinach plant photosynthesis. The results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the photosynthetic rates of spinach leaves treated with different wavelengths of light. Further studies may be done to deduce whether light intensity of the different colored lights as well as the duration of light exposure would affect photosynthetic rate. 

Introduction:
In order for living organisms to maintain life, they must harness energy, directly or indirectly, from some type of external source. Plants capture light energy from the sun as chemical energy in covalent bonds, as redox potential, and as an electrical or chemical gradient across a membrane through a process called photosynthesis. The light dependent reactions of photosynthesis are the processes through which the proton gradient is established in order to drive ATP synthesis. Two main systems make up these reactions: Photosystems I and II (groupings of proteins and pigment molecules). As light energy hits the chloroplasts and is absorbed by Photosystem II, an electron becomes excited and is passed around until reaching the reaction center, at which point it is passed to plastiquinone, which indirectly results in the cleavage of water to produce O₂. The passing around of the high energy electrons causes the H+ molecules to get pumped across the thylakoid membrane from the stroma to the thylakoid lumen. Once the electron is passed to Photosystem I, this process is then repeated, this time using the excitation of electrons to generate NADPH (an essential electron carrier for photosynthesis). The protons then flow down their concentration gradient through ATP synthase, which converts ADP to ATP [Cooper: 2000]. In the light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle), RUBISCO, an enzyme complex, uses ATP and the generated NADPH to generate glucose from CO₂ and ribulose phosphate. 
The Hill Reaction is the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts and light. DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) can be used in this reaction as the electron receptor because it changes from dark blue to colorless when reduced. This reaction may be used to determine how environmental conditions, chemicals, and other factors affect photosynthesis reduction reactions and the overall rate of photosynthesis [Johnson:2016]. The Hill Reaction can be used to determine the photosynthetic rate of plants that are being treated with different wavelengths of light as well. Previous studies have indicated that plants treated with high intensity blue light (wavelength 470nm) demonstrate optimal photosynthetic performance [Muneer:2014]. Other studies suggest that both red and blue lights can have beneficial effects in photosynthetic rate as well as plant growth and larger stomata [Hahn:2004]. Determining which wavelength of light causes the highest photosynthetic rate in Spinacia oleracea (spinach plants) may indicate what type of light is most suitable for efficiently growing and maintaining spinach plants. This experiment tested different wavelengths of light by measuring the absorbance of chloroplasts in the presence of DCPIP that were placed under different colored lights (white, blue, red, and green) for 30 minutes with the expectation that there would be a certain wavelength of light that is optimal for Spinacia oleracea photosynthesis. 

Materials and Methods:
Four spinach leaves were obtained and the central veins were removed from each, after which the leaves were rinsed and blotted dry. In a chilled mortar and pestle, the leaves were treated with 10mL of grinding buffer and ground until the solution became a thick paste, at which point 10 more mL of grinding buffer was added before straining the solution through 4 layers of cheesecloth. This solution was added into a centrifuge tube and spun in the centrifuge at 200xG for 3 minutes at 4˚C. The supernatant of the resulting solution was added into a different centrifuge tube and spun in the centrifuge at 1000xG for 10 minutes at 4˚C. The supernatant of the resulting solution was added into another centrifuge tube and 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the remaining pellet. We then prepared 12 test tubes containing water, 130mM DCPIP, the reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and chloroplasts. There was also a blank test tube containing all of the same reagents except for the DCPIP. Samples of each test tube were then transferred to cuvettes and each absorbance was taken using the spectrophotometer (set at 600nm). The cuvettes were then all placed under their respective light sources for 10 minute intervals, after which the absorbances were recorded again until 30 total minutes were reached. The results of the experiments were analyzed using a single factor ANOVA test, using the absorbances recorded after 30 minutes. 

Results:
The results of the experiment indicate that the photosynthetic rate for the samples treated with white light for 30 minutes changed in absorbance by, on average, 46.2%. In comparison to the red, green, and blue lights, which changed by an average of 79.9%, 77.9%, and 74.4% respectively, the white light caused less of a change in absorbance. Figure 1 demonstrates the general trend of the data in terms of absorbance over time; that average absorbance of each treatment group decreased over time. This indicates that photosynthesis took place under all of the different wavelengths of light. After analyzing the data with the single factor ANOVA statistical test (shown in Table 1.), however, it was determined that the p-value was 0.65, which is much higher than the level of significance. This indicates that the difference in absorbances for each test group was not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
Since the results of the experiment did not provide statistically significant results, our hypothesis was rejected in that there was not a specific wavelength of light which significantly increased the rate of photosynthesis in spinach plants. Our data indicates that the red light resulted in the highest change in absorbance (79.9%) over the 30 minutes, which is consistent with previous studies that suggest that blue and red light wavelengths not only result in higher photosynthetic rates, but higher growth rates as well [Baba: 2012]. Another previous study suggested that green light supplementation to red and blue LEDs could even further enhance growth in plants (specifically in lettuce) [Kim: 2004]. The relatively low average percent change for the white light test group was due to the one outlier in this test group’s data set (percent change of -37.6%). A negative percent change would indicate that the absorbance of the enriched chloroplasts and DCPIP actually increased, which is unlikely since photosynthesis reducing reactions are occurring, causing the color of the solution to move more toward colorless from a dark blue color. Removing this sample results in an average percent change of 69.0%, which aligns more with the other average results in the experiment. Since the rest of the results didn’t demonstrate a significant difference between the percent changes in absorbances of the different test groups, it is possible that the test samples did not have enough time under the different wavelengths of light to demonstrate the differing photosynthetic rates. Future experiments could place the plants under each respective light source for a longer period of time and monitor the percent change in absorbance for each interval.
