Title: The Effect of Temperature on the Photosynthesis in Spinach Leaf Chloroplasts

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of temperature on photosynthesis in chloroplasts of spinach leaves. Photosynthesis is a metabolic process carried out by plants to collect and store glucose, which can later be used for energy. Photosynthesis can be impacted by a plant’s environment, with certain conditions maximizing the process and others hindering it. Temperature was specifically studied in this experiment. Photosynthesis involved many processes, many of which are temperature dependent.  In this study the independent variable was temperature. Spinach chloroplast were placed in three environments, an ice bath, room temperature, and a hot water bath, to determine how each would impact photosynthesis. The dependent variable, photosynthetic activity, was quantified by determining the percent change in the absorption of the chloroplasts over 30 minutes which indicates how much DCPIP is reduced, a direct indicator oh photosynthetic activity. We hypothesized that if spinach chloroplasts are placed in various temperature conditions, then photosynthesis will decrease at hot and cold temperatures compared to room temperature. After 30 minutes the average absorption of spinach chloroplast was lower in the samples left in room temperature than those left in cold or

Introduction:
In this experiment, the biological principal of photosynthesis was investigated in spinach plants. Photosynthesis is a metabolic process carried out in the chloroplasts of plants to create and collect energy as glucose. Photosynthesis begins with the absorption of light by chloroplasts which excites electrons. This excitement causes electrons to leave carrier molecules and triggers a chemical reaction, known as the light-dependent reactions, that generates a proton gradient. It is this proton gradient that powers ATP and NADPH synthesis, which in turn allows the synthesis of glucose from CO2 molecules in the light-independent reactions. Photosynthesis can be a difficult to quantify. However, a compound called DCPIP can be used as alternative electron acceptor in place of NADP+ in a process known as a Hill’s Reaction. DCPIP is blue in color, but as it interacts with and is reduced by electrons it loses this hue. This change can be quantified using a Spec 20 machine at 600nm to determine change in absorbance over time, which directly indicates how much photosynthesis has occurred [Johnson: 2016]. Photosynthesis can be impacted by environmental conditions. In conducting this experiment, we were interested in determining how temperature alters photosynthesis in spinach. We wanted to see what temperature was ideal and how the process was able to persist in less than ideal temperatures. It is logical to suspect that photosynthesis could be impacted by temperature because it is a multi-step pathway that includes temperature sensitive reactions and enzymes. Some reactions cannot occur at all temperatures and enzymes can be denatured outside of certain temperature ranges [Allen, et. al: 2011]. Investigating the effect of temperature on photosynthesis is pertinent because the climate in areas across the globe differ so vastly. Some areas naturally support high levels of plant growth, while others are barren. This disparity in the presence of plants in different geographical areas could be because plants cannot conduct photosynthesis at certain temperatures and, therefore, are not viable in some environments. Our independent variable was temperature that the plant was placed in, either an ice bath, room temperature, or a hot water bath. We decided to use specific temperatures because a study conducted by Song et al found that spinach plants at 42 degrees Celsius had significantly lower photosynthetic rates than spinach plants at room temperature [Song et al: 2014]. For comparison, a negative control mixture without chloroplast was included and the positive control was the chloroplast samples placed in room temperature. The dependent variable was photosynthetic rate. This was quantified by the change in absorbance of each sample. A high percent change in absorption of the samples shows that DCPIP has been reduced by electrons, which directly indicates that photosynthesis has occurred at a high rate. We hypothesized that if spinach chloroplasts are placed in various temperature conditions, then photosynthesis will decrease at hot and cold temperatures compared to room temperature. This hypothesis was based on the Song et al article which found that the photosynthetic rate of spinach is sensitive to temperature [Song, et. al: 2014]. This sensitivity to temperature is a major reason why we selected spinach as our model organism. In addition, spinach chloroplasts can be easily extracted.

Materials and Methods:
The veins were removed from four medium-sized spinach leaves and ground with 10mL of cold grinding buffer in a chilled mortar and pestle. An additional 10 ml of grinding buffer was then added and mixed, then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. This liquid was then added to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tubes marked “Spinach”, and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then poured into another chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube and the debris at the bottom of tubes was transferred to a discard beaker. The 50 mL tubes containing the chloroplast suspension were centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4°C. The remaining pellet was the suspended with the grinding buffer [Johnson: 2016]. 10 test tubes were numbered and filled with 6mL water, 2 mL 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 mL reaction buffer to create samples for three experimental groups a negative control. Another test tube was labeled “blank” and filled with 8 mL water and 2 mL reaction buffer. 100 μl of the enriched prepared chloroplasts was added to the blank test tube and #1-9, but not tube #10 the negative control, and mixed immediately. The mixtures were then transferred spectrophotometer cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was immediately blanked at 600nm and then the absorbance of all the samples were measured. Samples #10 and #4-6 were placed in room temperature at 23 degrees Celsius, #1-3 were placed in the ice bath at 0 degrees Celsius, and #7-9 were placed in a water bath set for 42 degrees Celsius. After 10 minutes the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbances of all samples were measured. After a sample’s absorbance was recorded, it was returned to its temperature condition. This procedure was repeated after 10 minutes, and then again after 10 more minutes.  Paired t-tests were performed to analyze the significance of the difference in the absorption after 30 minutes and percent change in absorption after 30 minutes of spinach chloroplast in room temperature with those in cold and hot environments 


Results:
The negative control had an absorption of 0.610nm and 0.327% chance over 30 minutes. The spinach chloroplasts placed in an ice bath had an average absorption of 0.802 +/- 0.034 nm after 30 minutes, giving them a 35.093 +/- 21.282% change over 30 minutes. The spinach chloroplasts placed in room temperature had an average absorption of 0.510 +/- 0.029nm after 30 minutes, giving them a 7.604 +/- 5.382% change over 30 minutes. The spinach placed in a warm water bath at 42 degrees Celsius had an average absorption of 0.556 +/- 0.004nm after 30 minutes, giving them a 2.583 +/- 0.586% change over 30 minutes. The paired t-test between the average absorption after 30 minutes of the chloroplasts in room temperature those in cold temperature had a p-value of 0.0656, a t statistic of 2.8401, and 3 degrees of freedom. The paired t-test between the average absorption after 30 minutes of the chloroplasts in room temperature and those in hot temperature had a p-value of 0.2342, a t statistic of 1.4852, and 3 degrees of freedom. The paired t-test between the average percent change after 30 minutes of spinach chloroplast at room temperature and those in cold temperature had a p-value of 0.0922, a t statistic of 3.0603, and 2 degrees of freedom.  The paired t-test between the average percent change after 30 minutes of spinach chloroplast at room temperature and those at hot temperature had a p-value of 0.1838, a t statistic of 1.6050, and 4 degrees of freedom. All t-tests showed that the differences were not statistically significant.


Discussion:
The result of this experiment did not support our hypothesis. The difference in the absorptions and percent change in absorption of the spinach chloroplasts after 30 minutes in hot or cold environments were not statistically different than that of the spinach chloroplasts at room temperature. This conclusion about statistical significance can be made because for all four paired t-tests the p-values were greater than 0.05. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 is required to declare statistical significance and reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that temperature has no effect on the rate of photosynthesis is spinach chloroplasts. While looking at the data in Figure 2 suggest that the spinach chloroplasts in room temperature did experience greater photosynthesis, their absorption after 30 minutes was the lowest indicating that DCPIP had been reduced, the difference was not extreme enough to be sure that it had not occurred by chance.  The p-value for the cold chloroplasts compared to room temperature were just slightly above 0.05, nearly statistically significant. Allowing the chloroplasts to undergo photosynthesis for a longer period of time may have allowed for a more statistical difference in absorbance to develop. Testing them at more extreme temperature changes could have resulted in stronger effects as well. A study conducted by Ruelland et al on photosynthesis in plants found that to an extent plants are able to adapt and withstand unideal temperatures. However, after a long time at these adverse temperatures, the plant is no longer able to photosynthesis [Ruelland, et. al: 2010]. While the chloroplasts in hot and cold did change in absorption, this change was an increase in absorption, indicating that DCPIP was not reduced. Figure 2 shows percent change in absorbance of the chloroplast over the course of the study. Chloroplast in cold temperature experienced the greatest percent change, but it was in the opposite direction of the change in absorbance that indicated photosynthetic activity. This is odd and could potentially be due to experimental error. We may not have properly cleaned cuvettes after taking them out of the ice and water baths. This could have left droplets on the sides that could have lead the Spec 20 to read the absorption wrong. There are a few other possible sources of error and limitations that may have contributed to the data that we obtained. An error was made when placing our test tubes in the hot water bath. The bath had a lid that should have been removed while allowing the tubes to sit. For the first 10 minute period the lid left on, leaving these tubes in darkness. This absence of light likely hindered the photosynthetic activity of these spinach chloroplast in the light-dependent reactions. The light-dependent reactions, however, still would have been able to occur in this period of darkness which explains why some chloroplasts in the hot water bath still experience some change in absorbance during the first 10 minute period. Another possible source of error was that we did not place the samples under a lamp. The samples, therefore, received a more limited amount of light. A stronger source of light could have made photosynthesis occur more readily and could have resulted in more pronounced changes in absorbance over the course of the experiment. This could have strengthened the results obtained. Additionally, to place spinach chloroplasts in a hot environment, the samples had to remain in test tubes when submerged in the hot water, rather than in cuvettes like the samples in other temperatures. This doesn’t seem like a major problem, but the larger sample size held in the tube would have had a higher quantity of chloroplasts which could have impacted the rate of photosynthesis that occurred. When transferring to cuvettes there was no way to ensure completely that each same quantity of chloroplast. While measures were taken to make this as consistent as possible, like mixing the tubes immediately, there was no way to accomplish complete accuracy. If one cuvette happened to receive a greater quantity of chloroplasts it would experience a greater change in absorption due to the greater amount of resources for photosynthesis. A major limitation of this study is that it only involved one plant. While the data could lead us to suspect that other plants may respond similarly, we can’t make any generalizations based solely on the results of this study on only spinach. This study could be done again using a variety of plant chloroplasts to see how different plants vary in their ability to continue to conduct photosynthesis at adverse temperatures. Another limitation was that we only investigated the effect of three different temperatures on photosynthesis. This study could be improved by expanding the number of temperature conditions that the spinach were placed in. This could provide a more accurate understanding about what temperatures maximize photosynthesis in spinach. As previously states, the study could also be improved by allowing the plants to undergo photosynthesis for a longer period of time. This may allow for the differences between each temperature condition to become more pronounced, and potentially statistically significant. The fact that we only ran this study for 30 minutes was a major drawback. A study conducted by Bulthius on the effect of temperature on seagrass photosynthesis did find that temperature had a significant effect on photosynthesis in their subject plant at some temperature. However, they studied plants in their natural environments for multiple weeks [Bulthius 1987]. This suggests that if our spinach chloroplasts in hot and cold environments had been left in their adverse environments for an extended period of time, their photosynthetic processes could have eventually been compromised and would have resulted in absorbances that were statistically different than those of the spinach chloroplasts at room temperature.
