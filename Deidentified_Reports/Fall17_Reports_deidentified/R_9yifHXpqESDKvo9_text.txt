Title:  Utilizing Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts to determine the optimal light intensity for maximal Percent Change in absorbance of Light.

Abstract:
In photosynthetic organisms, chloroplasts extract energy from light photons in a form of energized electrons that are utilized in later mechanisms of ATP synthesis, and later cycles that result in reduced carbons of glucose. In this experiment, the model organism, Spinacia oleracea, was utilized to determine the effects of light intensity on percent change in absorbance, measuring the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts. The observation of lights role in initiation of photosynthetic activity, led to the hypothesis: if Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts are placed in different light intensities, there will be an optimal light intensity for photosynthesis activity, in between extreme brightness and complete darkness. The control group contained chloroplasts placed under natural light, and the experimental groups contained chloroplasts under varying light intensities, due to manipulation of each lamps lumen intensity.  The chloroplasts were prepared via centrifugation and Hill Reaction. Absorbance’s were collected after ten minutes, calculating percent absorbance change. The results demonstrated that as light intensity increased, percent absorbance increased relative to the control.  From these observations, it can be concluded that the biological null hypothesis is accepted, and li

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is central to the metabolic activity of plants, as it converts solar radiation into energy used in cellular processes and metabolism, thus making it a vital mechanism. To begin the photosynthesis pathway, light radiation hits photosystems one and two, exciting electrons, creating a proton gradient that allows ATP synthase pump to phosphorylate ADP into ATP. The by-products of this stage in photosynthesis then travel to the Light Independent cycle and Calvin Cycle to reduce carbons into glucose and additional ATP [Cooper: 2000]. 
More specifically, the Light Dependent Reactions are critical to the pathway completion of photosynthesis. The excited electrons produced via PS 1 and PS 2 allow phosphorylation of ADP and the following steps within this mechanism to create glucose and useable energy from photon energy. Without light, the entire photosynthetic process would not occur [Cooper: 2000]. 
Like photosynthetic plant species, Spinacia oleracea, or spinach leaves, utilize photon energy to excite electrons within PS1 and 2 into usable energy forms. As light hits PS2, energy causes electrons to be excited and attached to plastiquinone, stimulating cleavage of water, releasing hydrogens to create the protons gradient needed for ATP synthase to phosphorylate ATP. PS1 then utilizes absorbed light energy to reduce electrons from NAD+ to NADPH, which are then replaced by electrons from the PS2 plastiquinone electron carrier [Fromme, et.al: 2005]. During this mechanism, light photons enter the photocenters of PS 1 and PS2 which each contain antenna pigment molecules, that absorb the light photon energy. After absorption, energy is transferred to chlorophyll reaction center where the excited electrons travel down the electron transport chain, creating a photochemically generated electrochemical gradient thus creating usable ATP energy [Cooper: 2000].  
Due to photosynthesis’s dependence on light to excite electrons into the rest of the pathway, light is a key determinant in the rate and efficiency of photosynthesis.  In an experiment conducted on Lolium plants, scientists found that average rates of photosynthesis increased with increasing light intensity, and then leveled out at 2500 ft-candles at a constant rate despite increasing light intensity [Wilson: 1969]. In a similar study conducted on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), easterni red oak (Qtercus borealis miaxima), white oak (Qutercuts alba L.) and dogwood (Corwutsflorida,L.),varied light intensity demonstrated that photosynthesis in loblolly pine constantly increased relative light intensity. However, in the remaining species photosynthetic rate increased to its maximum at on third of the maximum light intensity before leveling off to a constant rate [Kramer:1944]. Each of these experiments consistently demonstrate that light intensity is not only a key determinant in photosynthesis, but a higher light intensity will result in a higher photosynthetic output until a certain level of light intensity is reached. 
Like Lolium plants and the hardwoods described, Spinacia oleracea utilize similar processes during photosynthesis, so it is expected that their rate of photosynthesis will also follow parallel patterns in response to light intensity variations. Furthermore, Spinacia oleracea represent strong model organisms due to their easy reproduction, storage, and their large plethora of chloroplasts contained within each leaf in comparison to other organisms. Due to theses reasons, this experiment utilized Spinacia oleracea to gain further understanding about the mechanism of photosynthesis in response to light within photosystems 1 and 2. As previous studies have shown, light intensity and photosynthetic rate will each increase relative to each other, to an extent, however, it must be addressed if there is an optimal range of light intensity which photosynthesis outputs are maximal.  
Through collected observations in the trends of photosynthesis in comparison to light intensity, it is shown that light intensity levels play a direct role at the start of the photosynthesis pathway within photosystem 1 and 2 complexes. By studying PS1 and PS, the electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts can be measured via 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), demonstrating how light affects the rate of photosynthesis. As the ETC pathway responds to light, DCPIP picks up excited electrons becoming reduced, changing color from blue to clear, which demonstrates a change in absorbance or rate of photosynthesis [Ke:1967]. This understanding allows photosynthetic ability to be directly measured in response to light intensity via absorbance measurements over a period of time. As a result of this understanding, the independent variable utilized in this experiment was represented as light intensity which directly affected the dependent variable of the percent change in absorbance (nm) over time.  Using these observations and variables, it was hypothesized that if Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts are placed in different light intensities, there will be an optimal light intensity for photosynthesis activity, in between extreme brightness and complete darkness.


Materials and Methods:
To begin, four leaves of, Spinacia oleracea, spinach were collected from a local market and stored in a lab refrigerator. The leaves were deveined and ground in a chilled mortar and pestle where grinding buffer 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0 was added during grinding and then before drainage into cheesecloth covered beaker. The collected spinach slurry centrifuged two times, once at three minutes at 1200 rpm, and a second for ten minutes at 2800 rpm to collect maximum amounts of chloroplasts.  Then, the chloroplasts were separated into 16 tubes, in which there were three replicate tubes per experimental and control group. The tubes placed in natural light served as the control group while the remaining four groups ranging from bright to dark served as experimental groups due to their alteration of light intensities from natural light. 
The Hill reaction was assembled and all reactions included: 100mM 6.0 pH reaction buffer, water, 130mM DCPIP, 100 ul of chloroplasts, expect herbicide was not used.  After assembly, the five groups were placed under varied lumen intensities. The light intensity was altered via lumens, which is a measurement of light intensity of luminous flux, that is equal to the amount of light given off through a solid angle by a single radiating source. Lamps each contained bulbs of different lumen intensities: 1630, 890, 600 lumens. Complete darkness was obtained by placing the plants in a closed drawer and the control group was placed on the table near a window for natural light.  Finally, absorbance’s of each tube was collected at time zero to ten minutes using a spectrometer at 600 nm.  The percent change in absorbance was calculated and averaged per period of each group.  
Finally, data collected was statistically analyzed via a two tailed t test to determine if the means between two groups are significantly different.  This test allowed comparison the experimental and control groups to determine if there were significant differences.  All data was collected as Means +/- STD, a p value of less than 0.05 represents significant data.  


Results:
The increase in light intensities used on Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts greatly increased the percent change in absorbance of light over time in comparison to the natural light while as the light intensity decreased, percent of light absorbed also decreased. Chloroplasts exposed to complete darkness demonstrated a decrease in percent change in absorbance as significant (t(4)= 2.776, p= 7.79 E-7). Chloroplasts exposed to a light intensity of 600 lumens demonstrated an increased change in absorbance in comparison to natural light showed an observed significant difference(t(4)= , p= 0.0022). The chloroplasts exposed to 890 lumens demonstrated an insignificant difference: (t(4)=, p= 0.057), Finally, the chloroplast group exposed to1630 lumens demonstrated a significant difference: (t(4)=3.9909, p= 0.016).


Discussion:
Within this experiment, data collection provided clarification as to how light intensity directly affects photosynthetic rate which was observed as a change in percent light absorbed. Plants exposed to higher intensities of light demonstrated higher percent absorbance rates when compared to the control group of natural light. Plants exposed to lower light intensities demonstrated lower percent absorbance rates when compared to the control group.  However, an optimal range of light intensity was not observed, as percent absorbed linearly increased as light intensity, and there was no observable threshold as the chloroplast became saturated with light from darkness. Even though the data collected held significant differences between experimental and control groups, leading the biological hypothesis of: if Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts are placed in different light intensities, there will be an optimal light intensity for photosynthesis activity, in between extreme brightness and complete darkness, to be rejected. Due to the observed trends in data, it is shown that light energy is crucial to an efficient photosynthetic pathway, even if an optimum was not found. 
The increase in photosynthetic activity relative to light intensity within Spinacia oleracea is also seen within other similar organisms. In an experiment conducted on Lauderia borealis, photyoplanker, not only demonstrated the importance of light in photosynthetic processes, but how their light intensity affects a light saturation curve.  The results of this experiment demonstrated similar tends to our experiment in that as light intensity increased, so did photosynthetic outputs. The experiment found that due to light saturation, photosynthetic rates are flexible, and plants can more accurately respond to an environment through alterations of the light dependent cycles [Marra:1978]. This experiment directly correlated to the results observed in this experiment in response to light intensity manipulation.  
The experiment provided significant data and trends similar to those of other experiments, however, the experiment did not find an exact range of light intensities in which photosynthesis is optimal. In a study conducted, it found that photosystems one and two operate under photon intensities of 700 nm for PS1 and 677 nm for PSII. The study not only study the mechanism how photons are absorbed in the photosystems, but also why different intensities of light are absorbed within these photosystems. The article described how this is due to the fact that photosystems I and II contain different chlorophyll centers, which absorb different types of light. [Caffarri: 2014]. In addition, due to the fact that this experiment was not able to determine a threshold for maximal photosynthesis, it demonstrated that photosynthetic was linear to light intensity. In an experiment done on the process of water splitting within PSII, data demonstrated that harsh light intensity can actually decrease photosynthetic outputs at a certain level. The experiment observed that due to photo damage within photosystem two, the electron transport chain will be inhibited because the over saturation of light will result in a highly reduced system, in which Quinone cannot bind to its active site to initiate the ETC [Barber: 1992]. 
In addition, despite the significance of data observed within this study, there are possible sources of error that could have altered outcomes of how light intensity affects photosynthetic rates. The control group for natural was not actually natural due to the light contamination from fluorescent light. Thus, it was difficult to accurately predict the relative amount of photons present in natural light, altering the comparable values between experimental and control. Furthermore, another source of error could have occurred due to the light manipulation. Due to the fact that a broader range of light was not used, and the fact that natural light was not in between the experimental group intensity ranges, could have be a reason that the biological hypothesis was rejected. If a larger range of light intensity was used, and natural light was not confounded, then it could be determined if there is a threshold for maximal photosynthetic activity, or if it will linearly increase in response to light, never decreasing. 
Through a collection of the observations both within this experiment on Spinacia oleracea and other studies, new questions of further study can be proposed to better understand light pathway within the photosystems.  One possible study could include ideas of more photon energy is continuously favorable, and never decreases. For example, why does the curve for as light intensity increase photosynthetic activity also increases, but then levels off at a specific point no matter the increase in light.  This question would allow scientists to better understand the machinery involved within photosystems to collect light energy, and why too much light energy has not been shown to create negative effects. One other possible future study could include testing how plants utilize machinery in response to maximize output of photosynthesis, that is, are plants able to manipulate the types of machinery made and synthesized within cells to maximize different light intensities. These future questions can help clarify exactly how light manipulates photosynthesis and how different light intensities affect this pathway.  
Overall, the experiment demonstrated the effects of light intensity not only on photosynthetic output, but also on the electron transport systems in conjunction with photosystems one and two.  The observations allow future experimentation on this mechanism, and will demonstrate the role light plays in photosynthesis, and the flexibility of plant machinery to respond to changes within their environment.
