Title: Effect of competing species on the root:shoot length ratios of oats (Avena sativa) and mung beans (Vigna radiate)

Abstract:
In this study, the effect of interspecific competition was measured on the root:shoot ratios of oat and mung bean plants. Oats and mung beans were grown in separate pots of low-nutrient soil, then oats and mung beans grown together in the same pot. We predicted that if the oat and mung bean plants are grown by themselves in low nutrient soil, the root:shoot length will be lower than the root:shoot ratio of the plants while they are growing in the same pot, and if mung beans and oats are grown in the same container, then oats’ R:S ratio will increase more than the mung beans’ root:shoot ratio. The results of the study supported the aspect of the hypothesis pertaining to oats (p=0.002), but the mung beans showed no significant change in root:shoot length ratio (p=0.415).

Introduction:
Competition between plants can be defined as the interaction between two organisms struggling for limited resources and the negative effects that plants suffer from the presence of other organisms. Examples of such resources include, but are not limited to: sunlight, water, space to grow, Nitrogen, and other micronutrients (Johnson, 2017). Because there are limited resources available to plants, competition between and among species is critical to survival. The competition for resources is a prevalent force in structuring plant communities and natural selection, but the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie resource competition is still developing (Craine, 2013). By understanding these mechanisms, scientists can see how competition drives evolution. Resource allocation is fundamentally a process of evolution where organisms become more fit over time. They pass traits on to their offspring that are either beneficial or detrimental to the process of resource allocation, and plants that are better able to allocate their resources will have much more reproductive success. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a plant to allocate resources and express its genotype in different phenotypic or visual ways based on the environment (Johnson, 2017). Oats, or Avena sativa, are known to be a rather phenotypically plastic plant, as the environment they are grown in has a large effect on their phenotype (Mahadevan, 2017). Mung beans, or Vigna radiata, aren’t known to share the same degree of plasticity.
In this experiment, we grew oats and mung beans in separate pots of low-nutrient soil, then oats and mung beans together in one pot. We predicted that if the oat and mung bean plants are grown by themselves in low nutrient soil, the root:shoot length ratio will be lower than the root:shoot ratio of the plants while they are growing in the same pot because the plants will need to increase root surface area to increase nutrient intake. Additionally, if mung beans and oats are grown in the same container, then oats’ root:shoot ratio will increase more than the mung beans’ root:shoot ratio because oats are more phenotypically plastic than mung beans.


Materials and Methods:
To set up this experiment, we obtained nine pots. In three pots, 50 oat seeds were planted in each. In another group of three pots, 50 mung bean seeds were planted in each. In the last group of three pots, 25 mung bean seeds and 25 oat seeds were planted in each. After two weeks of daily watering the plants in the greenhouse, we harvested two plants from each of the three pots containing only oats and two plants from each of the three pots containing only mung beans. We also harvested two oat plants and two mung bean plants from each of the three pots where they were grown together. The vermiculite was broken apart to separate the roots, then we washed and dried the plants. Each root and each shoot were weighed in grams and the lengths were recorded in centimeters. 
The means and standard deviations of all four groups (oats alone, mung beans alone, oats in the presence of mung beans, mung beans in the presence of oats) were calculated. There were too much data to and possible t-tests, so I decided to focus on just the R:S length ratio. Two t-tests with 10 degrees of freedom were run for length: first between oats in the presence of mung beans and oats by themselves, second between mung beans in the presence of oats and mung beans by themselves.


Results:
The data show that the experimental treatment had a significant effect on the oats, but not on the mung beans (Figure 1). The root to shoot ratio of the oats increased from a mean of 0.6806 to 1.305, and the error bars that represent the standard deviations of these two groups did not overlap at all (p=0.002). The mean of the mung beans, however, decreased very slightly from 0.3033 to 0.2729, but the errors bars completely overlapped. The mung beans showed no significant change in root:shoot length ratio (p= 0.415). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the R:S ratio of both species would increase when grown together was proven false for the mung beans and was supported for oats. The second part of the hypothesis, that mung beans and oats are grown in the same container, then oats’ root:shoot length and weight ratio will increase more than the mung beans’ root:shoot ratio because oats are more phenotypically plastic than mung beans, was supported by the data. This shows that oats are essentially better at resource allocation and superior in fitness to the mung beans. It also shows how natural selection is likely to act on plasticity because this is a great weapon for plants when it comes to competition. Similar results were found in a 2014 study, where it was concluded that plasticity is an important aspect of how species evolve in different environments (Dai, 2014).
For further research, the experiment could be run with two plant species that are both known to be phenotypically plastic, such as oats and a species native to wetlands. A species located in the wetlands is likely to be very phenotypically plastic because it must endure drought and flood conditions. This will show how the root:shoot ratio changes when the competition is much stronger. Additionally, the changes in R:S ratio could be measured under conditions where the plants are deprived of specific resources. The difference between water deprivation and nutrient deprivation are important for understanding the mechanism by which the plants compete. It is still poorly understood how the mechanisms of competition may change with “heterogeneity of resource supplies” (Craine, 2013). 
Further experiments and research are necessary, as this topic can have practical agricultural uses as well as implications about the effects of climate change. By understanding how plants such as oats compete for resources in an environment, farmers can artificially tailor the environment of their crops to increase yield. Traits that increase plasticity can be artificially selected for, assuming the technology were available (Mahadevam, 2017). Additionally, plasticity definitely shapes how organisms phenotypically respond to environment disruptions such as global climate change. Plants that aren’t as phenotypically plastic could become extinct as the environmental conditions of our planet change so rapidly. In this cases, changes in phenotype could either be genetic, or due to phenotypic plasticity, and further experiments are required to differentiate the two (Merilä, 2014). Climate change is definitely not the only stressor acting on plants, but it is a significant one. In conclusion, this study was effective in accomplishing its purpose, and provided useful insights as to how phenotypic plasticity in plants contributes to evolution, and vice versa.
