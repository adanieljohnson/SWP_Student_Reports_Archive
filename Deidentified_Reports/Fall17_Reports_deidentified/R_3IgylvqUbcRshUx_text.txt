Title: The presence of food causes a decreased agonistic effect between male Betta splendens

Abstract:
Betta splendens is a common aquarium fish that is a model organism to use for studies on animal behavior because they are easily accessible and are known to display aggressive intraspecific behavior. Based on varying factors such as the presence of males, females, or food, B. splendens will display a range of aggressive behaviors in an effort to defend territory and secure a mate. Given that food is a basic necessity, it was predicted that the presence of food would have a significant effect on level of aggression in male B. splendens that are also in the presence of another male. We observed the behavior of several fish that were separated by a clear partition, first without food and then with food. We used a Likert scale to assign values to different displays based on their level of aggression. Our results yielded a statistically significant difference between levels of aggression shown in fish without food and in the same fish with food. 


Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, attempts to understand the relationship between physiology and behavior and how behavior has been shaped by evolution and selection. Observation is a key way to study and quantify patterns of animal behavior.  

Betta splendens is a model organism for the study of animal behavior because these fish are easily obtainable and they show high levels of aggression in the presence of other male B. splendens through quantifiable behaviors. Also called Siamese fighting fish, this species originated in southeast Asia but have been domesticated as common aquarium fishes in the United States and other countries [Johnson: 2017]. The domesticated form, which began being bred around 1910, is around 4.5 cm in length and comes in many shades of red, blue, and purple [Johnson: 2017]. When male B. splendens are visible to each other, they show aggressive behaviors such as broadside movements and front facing movements. These fish use these agonistic displays to exchange information about readiness to engage in a fight [Castro: 2006]. During their lifetime, B. splendens court females, build bubble nests for offspring, and defend their territory through such aggressive behaviors [Forsatkar: 2001]. 

The visible levels of aggression change depending on factors such as fish isolation, presence of a female, or presence of food. Fish encounter a trade-off between obtaining food and defending territory and securing a mate. Studies on changing levels of aggressive behavior in variable situations can provide insight about the factors that most influence such energy-costly behavior. We predicted that the presence of food will have a significant effect on the level of aggressive behavior displayed by the focal fish due to the prioritization of food over territory. 



Materials and Methods:
We used one male B. splendens as the aggressor and a total of four male B. splendens as the focal fish. All of the fish were comparable in size and color. For each trial, we placed the aggressor on one side of a tank and a focal fish on the other side of the tank, separated by an opaque or transparent partition. We observed the behavior of the focal fish for five minutes upon the removal of the opaque partition. We kept a count of the frequency of three broadside movements (in order of increasing aggressiveness): pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing that occurred during the five minutes. Then, the opaque partition was replaced and five minutes of rest was allowed. After the rest period, the focal fish was given a small pinch of food flakes and the opaque partition was removed. The occurrence of the three aggressive behaviors was counted again for five minutes. The process was repeated for the remaining three focal fish. We used a Likert scale in which we assigned one point for each occurrence of pelvic fin flickering, two points for tail beating, and three points for tail flashing. We totaled and averaged the points for each fish and in each condition (with food or without food). 
A two-tailed two-sample t-test was used to determine the significance of the difference between the aggressive behaviors of the focal fish with and without the presence of food. [Johnson: 2017]


Results:
With a cut-off level of 0.05, the two-tailed two-sample t-test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the average level of aggression of the focal fish without the presence of food and the average level of aggression of the focal fish with the presence of food (p = 0.031). The average of the total point count for with food is significantly lower than the average total point count for without food. 


Discussion:
Based on our results, our hypothesis was supported. There is a statistically significant difference between aggression levels of B. splendens with food and those without food. Aggression levels were significantly lower in fish with the presence of food than in the same fish without the presence of food. 

Aggressive behavior in B. splendens has evolved over time to be an effective yet biochemically costly mechanism to defend territory and win mates. These behaviors are costly in that they result in heightened metabolic rate, diminished energy reserves, and often physical harm [Castro: 2006]. Therefore, fish who are well fed consequently have higher energy reserves and are better equipped to engage in fighting. One study is similar to our own experiment in that draws a correlation between food and aggressive behavior in B. splendens. This study shows that prolonged inanition for two weeks severely inhibits a male's ability to perform the energy-costly displays needed for defense, and thus harms his ability to fight successfully. Furthermore, starved fish's display periods were shorter on average since energy reserves were depleted more quickly, and fighting mandates a large input of energy. Every fight reduces glycogen, amino acid, and lipid content to varying extents, so fish that are well fed have more resources to perform the aggressive behaviors characteristic of fights [Haller: 1991]. Therefore, it is logical that natural selection would act upon the fish that prioritized food obtainment since energy is so vital for successful fighting. Fish cannot defend their territories well if they are not first able to fight competently. It is not surprising to us that the focal fish in our experiment focused more on consuming food than displaying aggressive behaviors when food was present. 

Our results reveal that the presence of food likely has a significant effect on aggression levels due to the prioritization of food over territory defense. The relationship between food and aggression can be applied to a broader scheme to examine and predict how different animals will react to competition for food.
