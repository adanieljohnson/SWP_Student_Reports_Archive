Title: Effect of lowering temperature on specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp.

Abstract:
In this experiment we studied the effect that temperature has on the crayfish`s, Procambris spp., specific metabolic rate. We hypothesized that the lower the temperature the lower the crayfish`s specific metabolic rate will be. Metabolism refers to the processes of an organism capturing energy, converting it into ATP, and distributing it throughout its body. The crayfish is an ectotherm which means its internal body temperature is completely determined by the temperature of its environment and it derives heat energy from its surroundings. The specific metabolic rate incorporates the oxygen consumption of the organism, the volume of water that the organism is in, the organism`s weight, and the time over which you are measuring the metabolic rate. To test our hypothesis, we subjected three crayfish to two different temperatures, room temperature (22°C) and 12°C, and used a dissolved oxygen probe to measure oxygen consumption of the treatment and controlll groups every five minutes until twenty minutes elapsed. We found that for every crayfish the controlll group had a higher specific metabolic rate than the treatment group. We saw that there was a significent difference between the groups (t_stat=8.5516, d.f.=2, P=0.0134). From these results we can say our hypothesis stood as when the c

Introduction:
We are studying the effect that temperature has on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish, Procambris spp., and specifically how lowering temperature affects it. The crayfish is an example of Krogh`s Principle as it is an ideal organism for our study [Stoffels: 2016]. It is easy to handle, due to its size, and functions well in our apparatuses with which we will be conducting our experiments [Stoffels: 2016]. In addition, crayfish are ectotherms so it is much easier to alter their body temperature and affect their metabolism [Stoffels: 2016]. Lastly, they are relatively safe to use as they can pinch you, but are not dangerous to handle [Stoffels: 2016]. Metabolism is the overarching term which describes all the energy making processes in the organism, specifically in the cytoplasm of the cell and the mitochondria, that includes processes such as glycolysis [Stoffels: 2016]. During metabolism organisms take in oxygen and uses it to convert glucose to energy in the form of ATP, releasing the by-product of CO2 [Stoffels: 2016]. Therefore, metabolism can be measured through the organism`s uptake of O2 or the excretion of CO2 gas [Stoffels: 2016]. Specific metabolic rate is, as the name implies, the rate at which an organism can metabolize [Gleiss: 2010]. It takes into account the change in oxygen consumption, the volume of water around the organism, the time you are measuring the metabolic rate over, and the weight of the crayfish [Gleiss: 2010]. The crayfish is an ectotherm which means its body temperature is completely dependent on and conforms to the temperature of the environment around it [Stoffels: 2016]. Temperature alters metabolism because the cold, which temperature is an indication of and has a direct relationship with, hinders metabolic processes [Gillooly: 2001]. This is because in the cold the water cannot impart as much energy upon the cell in the form of heat relative to when it is warmer, since when the water it cold, there is not as much heat to give off [Gillooly: 2001]. The energy given off from the environment or water in this case is not ATP but rather thermal and it is transferred from the surroundings like water into the system like the crayfish [Gillooly: 2001]. Based on this, we predict that lowering the temperature of the surrounding water will decrease the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish.

Materials and Method:
First, fill screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air. Then set test chamber into an empty plastic dishpan. After, take the crayfish from its original holding chamber, where it is being maintained until used, and put it on a balance to weigh it out. Put the crayfish in the test chamber and screw on the top. Then fill the container with room temperature water so it overflows a little. Place the tank set-up in a dishpan filled with room temperature water (22°C). Insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber and then turn the probe on. Allow a couple minutes to allow for the readings to stabilize and record the baseline. At intervals of five minutes until twenty minutes have elapsed take the recording of oxygen concentration. Take the probe out and dump the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder to get the volume part of the specific metabolic rate equation. Do the same procedure with the same crayfish except use a water bath set at 12°C to submerge the chamber in. Also, this time refill the chamber with the oxygen-saturated water from the chilled tank. Repeat this whole procedure two more times with two different crayfish. Then after the data is compiled, insert it into the formula for specific metabolic rate: [(Change in O2 * volume H2O)/(Time * weight)]. To analyze and compare the results we will be using a paired t_test.

Results:
The general trends we saw were that, as shown in Figure 1, in every crayfish the treatment group had a lower specific metabolic rate than the controlll group. Among the samples of the treatment group there were varying rates, the treatment sample of crayfish one was relatively close to the treatment sample of crayfish three and the treatment sample of crayfish two was substantially higher than either of the other two crayfish. This same trend was observed among the controlll group. The average for the controlll group was 0.0012353 and for the treatment group was 0.0009167. The standard deviation for the controlll group was 0.00051 and for the treatment group it was 0.00057. The mean specific metabolic rate of the controlll group was greater than the mean of the treatment group (t_stat=8.5516, d.f.=2, P=0.0134).

Discussion:
From our results in Figure 1 we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported as the specific metabolic rates at 12°C were always lower in each crayfish then at room temperature and our stats showed significance. In our hypothesis we said that the colder temperature of the water would decrease the specific metabolic rate relative to when the crayfish were in the room temperature water. The biological reason for why this did occur goes back to crayfish being ectotherms. Being ectotherms, the crayfish are temperature conformers which means their internal body temperature is dictated by the temperature of the environment they are in [Stoffels: 2016]. So for the crayfish in room temperature water their body temperature ended up being about 22° and then for the crayfish in 12°C their internal body temperature was just about 12°C. As mentioned in the introduction, body temperature has a direct relationship with metabolic rate because it provides heat energy to the organism thus allowing it to perform its metabolic processes faster and take up more oxygen [Gillooly: 2001]. If the crayfish had been endothermic then it could have maintained its own body temperature [Gremillet: 2005]. Thereby, keeping its body temperature constant through metabolic processes rather than deriving heat energy from the environment [Gremillet: 2005]. For endotherms the metabolic rate would change from one temperature to another but not nearly to the extent of an ectotherm [Gremillet: 2005]. One might be skeptical and think the opposite of the results would happen since in colder water there is more oxygen present [Gillooly: 2001]. Therefore, with the increased oxygen presence around them the crayfish will increase its oxygen consumption [Gillooly: 2001]. This did not happen because the metabolic processes were still slower in the crayfish when it was in cold water, as shown in Figure 1. So, it could not utilize the greater oxygen concentration around it. The experiment we conducted is similar to another experiment that was done. In this one the researchers studied the effects of temperature and size on the metabolic rates of various animals including ectothermic fish [Gilooly: 2001]. In this experiment they put the ectothermic vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles) in varying environments of different temperature and saw how both their body masses and temperatures affected their metabolic rate [Gillooly: 2001]. What they found was that there was a direct relationship between temperature and metabolic rate and at the same time there is a direct relationship between body mass and metabolic rate as well [Gillooly: 2001]. This related to our study because it was essentially the same study except they used other ectotherms in their experiment. Their results were the same as ours and therefore enhanced the validity of our experiment. Furthermore, to our knowledge there was no evidence of error and therefore no sources of error. The only thing that could have affected it was that we did not do anything to hinder the locomotion of the crayfish so that could have had a slight effect on the metabolic rate data, although the overall result would have been the same, since the crayfish could have moved more in one of the temperature than the other increasing its oxygen consumption. It is difficult to compensate for this entirely since there was no way to make sure the crayfish do not move without introducing other confounding variables so we would try to minimize locomotion as much as possible by placing them in a smaller container while measuring oxygen consumption. Lastly, to increase the validity of our results further we should use more trials with different temperatures and more crayfish if we chose to repeat the experiment.
