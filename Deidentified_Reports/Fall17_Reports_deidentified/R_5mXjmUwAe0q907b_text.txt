Title: Effect of lowering temperature on specific metabolic rate of crayfish

Abstract:
In this experiment we studied the effect that temperature has on the crayfish`s, Procambarus spp., specific metabolic rate. We hypothesized that the lower the temperature the lower the crayfish`s specific metabolic rate will be. The crayfish is an ectotherm which means its internal body temperature is completely determined by the temperature of its environment and it derives heat energy from its surroundings. The specific metabolic rate incorporates the oxygen consumption of the organism, the volume of water that the organism is in, the organism`s weight, and the time over which you are measuring the metabolic rate. To test our hypothesis we subjected three crayfish to two different temperatures, room temperature (22°C) and 12°C, and we used a dissolved oxygen probe to measure oxygen consumption of the treatment and control groups every five minutes until twenty minutes elapsed. Our results were that for every crayfish the control group had a higher specific metabolic rate then the treatment group. We saw that there was a significant difference between the groups (t-stat=8.5516, df=2, P=0.0134). From these results we can say our hypothesis stood as when the crayfish were put in the lower temperature water their specific metabolic rates were lower.

Introduction:
We are studying the effect that temperature has on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish, Procambarus spp., and specifically how lowering temperature affects it. The crayfish is an example of Krogh`s Principle as it is an ideal organism for our study as it is easy to handle due to its size and functions well in our apparatuses with which we will be conducting our experiments [Stoffels: 2016]. In addition, crayfish are ectotherms so it is much easier to alter their body temperature and affect their metabolism [Stoffels: 2016]. Lastly, they are relatively safe to use as they can pinch you, but are not dangerous to handle [Stoffels: 2016]. Metabolism is the overarching term which describes all the energy making processes in the organism, specifically in the cytoplasm of the cell and the mitochondria, that includes glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, fermentation and Kreb`s Cycle [Stoffels: 2016]. During metabolism which, organisms take in oxygen and uses it to convert glucose to energy in the form of ATP releasing the by-product of CO2 [Stoffels: 2016]. Therefore, metabolism can be measured through the organism`s uptake of O2 or the excretion of CO2 gas [Stoffels: 2016]. Specific metabolic rate is, as the name implies, the rate at which an organism can metabolize [Gleiss: 2010]. It takes into account the change in oxygen consumption, the volume of water around the organism, the time you are measuring the metabolic rate over, and the weight of the crayfish [Gleiss: 2010]. In the formula the change in oxygen consumption, which as stated before is directly correlated to energy expended and specific metabolic rate, is multiplied by volume of water [Gleiss: 2010]. Then that value is divided by time and weight [Gleiss: 2010]. The crayfish is an ectotherm which means its body temperature is completely dependent and conforms to the temperature of the environment around it [Stoffels: 2016]. Temperature alters metabolism because the heat, which temperature is an indication of and has a direct relationship with, enables metabolic processes to be performed faster because of the energy the water imparts upon the cell in the form of heat [Gillooly: 2001]. The energy given off from the environment or water in this case is not ATP but rather thermal and it is transferred from the surroundings like water into the system like the crayfish [Gillooly: 2001]. Based on this, we predict that lowering the temperature of the surrounding water will decrease the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish.

Materials and Methods:
Fill screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturate with air. Then set test chamber into an empty plastic dishpan. Then take the crayfish from its original holding chamber, where it is being maintained until used, and put it on a balance to weigh it out. Put crayfish in the test chamber and screw on the top, then fill the container with room temperature water so it overflows a little. Then place the tank set-up in a dishpan filled with room temperature water (22°C). Insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber and then turn the probe on. Allow a couple minutes to allow for the readings to stabilize and record the baseline. At intervals of five minutes until twenty minutes have elapsed take the recording of oxygen concentration. Take the probe out and dump the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder to get the volume part of the specific metabolic rate equation. Do the same procedure with the same crayfish except use a water bath set at 12 C to submerge the chamber in and refill the chamber with the oxygen-saturated water from the chilled tank. Repeat this whole procedure two more times with two different crayfish. To analyze and compare the results we will be using a paired t-test.

Results:
The general trends we saw were that, as shown in Figure 1, in every crayfish the treatment group had a lower specific metabolic rate than the control group. Among the samples of the treatment group there were varying rates, the treatment sample of crayfish one was relatively close to the treatment sample of crayfish three and the treatment sample of crayfish two was substantially higher than either of the other two crayfish. This same trend was observed among the control group. The mean specific metabolic rate of the control group was significantly greater than the mean of the treatment group (t-stat=8.5516, df=2, P=0.0134).

Discussion:
From our results in Figure 1 we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported as the specific metabolic rates at 12°C were always lower in each crayfish then at room temperature and our stats showed significance. In our hypothesis we said that the colder temperature of the water would decrease the specific metabolic rate relative to when the crayfish were in the room temperature water. The biological reason for why this did occur goes back to crayfish being ectotherms. Being ectotherms, the crayfish are temperature conformers which means their internal body temperature is dictated by the temperature of the environment they are in [Stoffels: 2016]. So for the crayfish in room temperature water their body temperature ended up being about 22° and then for the crayfish in 12°C their internal body temperature was just about 12°C. As mentioned in the introduction, body temperature has a direct relationship with metabolic rate because it provides heat energy to the organism thus allowing it to perform its metabolic processes faster and take up more oxygen [Gillooly: 2001]. If the crayfish had been endothermic then it could have maintained its own body temperature, keeping its body temperature constant through metabolic processes rather than deriving heat energy from the environment [Gremillet: 2005]. So hypothetically speaking if the crayfish was an endotherm its specific metabolic rate would not change from being in the room temperature in comparison to being in the 12°C water since its internal body temperature would not change and that is a factor that has a bearing on metabolic rate [Gremillet: 2005]. One might be skeptical and think the opposite of the results since in colder water there is more oxygen present and therefore with the increased oxygen presence around them the crayfish will increase its oxygen consumption [Gillooly: 2001]. This did not happen because the metabolic processes were still slower in the crayfish when it was in cold water, as shown in Figure 1, so it could not utilize the greater oxygen concentration around it. The experiment we conducted is similar to another experiment that was done in which the researchers studied the effects of temperature and size on the metabolic rates of various animals including ectothermic fish [Gilooly: 2001]. In this experiment they put the ectothermic vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles) in varying environments of different temperature and saw how both their body masses and temperatures affected their metabolic rate [Gillooly: 2001]. What they found was that there was a direct relationship between temperature and metabolic rate and at the same time there is a direct relationship between body mass and metabolic rate as well [Gillooly: 2001]. This related to our study because it was essentially the same study except they used other ectotherms in their experiment and took into account how body mass affects metabolic rate as well. Their results were the same as ours and therefore enhanced the validity of our experiment. Furthermore, to our knowledge there was no evidence of error and therefore no sources of error. The only thing that could have affected it was that we did not do anything to hinder the locomotion of the crayfish so that could have had a slight effect on the metabolic rate data, although the overall result would have been the same, since the crayfish could have moved more in one of the temperature than the other increasing its oxygen consumption. To compensate for this, we should maybe tie the crayfish down when in the test chamber or maybe anesthetize them and then perform the same experiment.
