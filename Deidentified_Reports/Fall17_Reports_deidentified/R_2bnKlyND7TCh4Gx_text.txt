Title: Observation of aggressive behaviors in male Betta splendens in the presence of another male with and without the stimulus of food

Abstract:
Male Betta splendens are known to be very aggressive, especially when in the presence of other male Betta splendens. These aggressive behaviors include tail flashing, red maning, and darting. The purpose of this study was to determine whether male Betta fish would change their aggression level in the presence of another male if the stimulus of food in the tank was added. In order to objectively quantify the behaviors of these fish, point values were assigned to each aggressive behavior, and the results found that the aggressive behaviors did decrease with the addition of the food stimulus. This is most likely due to the allocation of resources of these fish; it is more beneficial to the fish to take advantage of the available energy from food rather than expending more energy with the aggressive behaviors and forgoing the food. 


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior and the Betta splendens, or the siamese fighting fish, have intraspecific behavior. Broadside movements occur when a fish turns its side to an opponent and includes behaviors of pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing (Johnson). Facing movements also increase in aggressiveness, from facing opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading opercula, and protruding branchiostegal membranes (red mane). Other agonistic (aggressive) behaviors include raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, darkening skin, darting, biting and nipping (Johnson). A study by Yvonne Yau and Marc Potenza looked into the effect of food on eating behavior. Food is used in a reward system with animals, and when they eat food dopamine is released in the brain (Yau). Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that triggers pleasure impulses in the brain, and when those neurotransmitters are released the animals may be less likely to exhibit aggressive behaviors. In addition, the male betta fish have to allocate limited energy resources to exhibiting aggressive behaviors. The fish’s instincts will likely have evolved due to strong directional natural selection so that the fish that choose to eat food at every available opportunity will be favored and therefore will be the most common fish in the population. This is because eating the food is evolutionarily beneficial to the betta fish and is more important than the tradeoff of spending more energy on the displays of aggression. In short, the betta fish will be distracted by the presence of the food because of the effect that food has on their brains, and in addition will be more inclined to pass up the opportunity to be aggressive when food is present because this is more wise for the fish’s future survival. We will be identifying the behaviors that we have found to be most common, and quantifying them to determine levels of aggression. We will be adding the independent variable of the presence of food in the tank in order to determine whether this added stimulus affects the levels of aggressive behavior in the betta fish. The biological alternate hypothesis is that the male Betta fish (Betta splendens) will be more aggressive with the stimulus of seeing the other fish, but this aggression will subside when the presence of food is introduced. 
Variables
In this experiment we will be studying the dependent variable of level of intensity of aggressive behaviors by manipulating the independent variables of presence of another male and presence of food. 


Materials and Methods:
You will need 4 male betta fish, normal betta fish food, and a tank with 3 separate compartments and 2 glass and 2 opaque partitions. 
Methods
We placed two male betta fish in a tank. One fish remained through each trial and was not be observed for behaviors, and the other was removed and replaced after each trial and its behaviors analyzed. We kept them separated to allow them to habituate to the water and then removed the partitions. For five minutes, we recorded the behaviors of pectoral fin flickering, tail flashing, red maning, and darting when the fish is isolated and cannot see the other male Betta fish. Next, we removed the opaque partition so that the fish were able to see each other through the glass.  For five minutes, we observed and recorded for the same behaviors in the fish and record the aggressive behaviors. Next we replaced partitions and allowed five minutes of rest time to prevent habituation. Then we removed the opaque partition again (the glass stays in place) and placed regular pet fish food on the side of the fish whose behaviors we were observing. We observed for five minutes and recorded aggressiveness of behaviors. Then we remove the fish that we were observing and removed any remaining fish food from the tank. We then replaced that fish with another male Betta fish and repeat all procedures. We repeated everything again to have 3 trials with 3 different male Betta fish being observed. 
In order to determine a level of aggression in the fish, each of the four behaviors that are being observed have been given a point value that increases in order of how aggressive the behaviors are. Pelvic fin flickering receives one point, tail flashing receives two, red maning three, and darting four. Multiply the point values by the frequency of behaviors to give each fish a point value for each of the three situations. To analyze behaviors a paired T-test will be used because we are analyzing different populations for multiple different behaviors, and therefore several behaviors need to be quantified for each of the three male fish. 



Results:
The results of this experiment were that the three fish received an average aggression scores of 4 with no stimulus, 28.3  with the stimulus of seeing the other fish, and 5 when they could see the other fish but had the additional stimulus of food. 


The P value from the paired T test is 0.121. 


Discussion:
The results from this experiment supported the hypothesis that the fish would become more aggressive when they could see each other through the glass, but those aggressive behaviors would reside if food was also introduced. The P value is 0.121, which means that the differences between the levels of aggression with food and without was not statistically significant. However, the results did show a trend that the food stimulus decreased aggressive behavior. In a study conducted by Sofyan Alyan, it was found that male betta fish are equally aggressive when they are shown another male through a glass divider whether they knew the fish previously or not. This experiment was conducted by conducting separate trials on different days in which the fish were able to view each other through a glass divider, and their display of aggressive behaviors were counted and observed by researchers. In the second day of trials, the experimental group were introduced to the same fish as the previous day and the control group was shown another strange fish. The control did not differ from the experimental group in the level of aggression displayed, which shows that male betta fish are inherently aggressive and territorial and will exhibit aggressive behaviors when in the presence of another male betta fish. This in addition to the evidence from Yau’s study about the neurochemical components of fish eating behavior show that there is strong evidence for the hypothesis.
