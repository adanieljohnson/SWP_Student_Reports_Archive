Title: The Effect of Blue Colored Light on the Agonistic Behaviors of Anabantoidei,  Belentiidae 

Abstract:
The effect of blue light was studied on the agnostic behavior of Betta splenden fish. Male Betta Splenden were exposed to white light and blue light while placed in a tank with another male fish. The number of gill flares, a specific agnostic behavior characteristic of betta splenden, were recorded as well as the number of any additional agnostic displays of behavior. It was predicted that the number of agnostic behaviors would increase when the Betta fish were exposed to blue light in their tank. However, our hypothesis was not supported as the results showed no significent difference between the number of agnostic behaviors in white light versus blue light.

Introduction:
Animal behavior combines natural observations from nature and laboratories with theories from ecology, evolutionary biology, and knowledge of genetics to produce understandings of animals. It is for this reason that ethologists attempt to assign a physiological mechanism to a behavior to understand how behavior has been shaped by selection. Animal behavior is often considered to explain the perception of an animal's own world. Intraspecific agnostic behavior is a type of threat behavior that is displayed between members of the same species [Todd: 2008]. Visual cues that can be detected indicate social interactions between members. Anabantoidei, Belentiidae, also known as Betta Splenden fish, are known for their characteristic displays of colorful and aggressive behavior when placed in the presence of other members of their own species [Todd: 2008]. Typical agnostic behaviors of betta fish are broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing while facing movements include facing with erect pectoral fins, opening of the gill covers, the opercula, and the opening of the branchiostegal membranes underneath the opercula to create the illusion of a mane [Todd: 2008]. Additional behaviors not categorized include arching of the back, changing color, quick darts, raising fins, and biting [Todd: 2008]. In this lab, the intraspecific behaviors displayed by Betta fish will be observed in relation to exposure to blue and white light. The number of gill flares and additional sporadic behaviors displayed by fish exposed to the white light versus the  blue light will demonstrate comparison between these two environments. We hypothesize that the betta splenden exposed to the blue light will display an increased amount of quantifiable agnostic behavior due to their natural agnostic intraspecific response to blue male betta splenden. 


Materials and Method:
Three blue male betta splenden were placed into a tank divided into three sections by partitions. A light was positioned to aim at the tank. To start the first set of observations, the partition was removed, however the fish remained separated by a clear wall. Once the partition was removed, the light was switched on to create the “white” light environment. One of the fish was then observed for five minutes. The number of gill flares and the number of sporadic movements of the specific betta fish were recorded during this time period. After five minutes, the partition was replaced and the fish were given a five minute rest break. Then, the same procedure with the same fish was repeated, however, a blue film was placed over the light to create blue light shining on the tank. Once the procedure was completed with the blue light, the entire procedure was repeated with two new fish. Afterwards, this was then repeated for a third time with two new fish. After all data had been collected from the three fish that were observed in both white and blue light environments, a two tailed t test was run to calculate the statistical results from this experiment. 


Results:
Our results from the two tailed t test ( 0.378, 2, 4.303) show that there is no significent difference between number of gill flares displayed by fish in white light and blue light. Our results from the two tailed t test (0, 2,4.303) show that there is no significent difference between number of other sporadic movements displayed by fish in white light and blue light. In both tests, the p value is greater than 0.05. Additionally, the data did not appear to follow any observable trends. 

Discussion:
Our results do not support our hypothesis that male betta splenden will display an increased amount of agnostic behaviors when exposed to blue light. There was no significent difference between the data collected from the behavior of the fish exposed to white light versus blue light when considering specifically gill flares and all additional sporadic movements. We had expected an increase in sporadic movements under blue light due to other male betta splendins common blue color. As there was no significent difference, it is possible that the color of male betta splenden is not what triggers agnostic behavior between males, but rather a different signal. The influence of color may be different in that is used by betta fish to distract males rather than to cause agnostic behaviors [Doutrelant: 2001]. In one study done, it was concluded that the social environment a betta fish is exposed to is important when determining the dynamics and outcomes of aggressive contests [Matos: 2003]. In future experiments, it may be helpful to test other colors of varying shades of color to see if there is no connection between color and triggering the agnostic behavior. However, if the objective is to determine what aspect of a another male betta fish triggers the agnostic behavior between these members, it would most likely be beneficial to run a different experiment completely. Additionally, it would be useful to determine when Betta splenden begin to display agnostic behavior. A study was completed to show how betta fish differences in oxygen consumption when agnostic behavior began [Castro: 2006]. The allocation of resources shifts when agnostic behavior takes place, and the cost of using resources for engaging in fights often affect the fish after. It would be interesting to determine how betta splenden differentiate between male and female and what causes them to display the first observable agnostic behavior and decide that it is worth giving up resources to engage in this behavior.
