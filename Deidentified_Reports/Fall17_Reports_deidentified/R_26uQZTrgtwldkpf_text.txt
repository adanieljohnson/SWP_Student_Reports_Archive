Title: The Effect of Nicotine on Signal Amplitude(V) of Muscle Contractions in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The objective of this lab is to study the effect of nicotine, an acetylcholine agonist, on signal amplitude of muscle contractions in the thigh muscle of a frog. Electrodes will be connected to the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens. Three frogs will be used for this study and their signal amplitude will be recorded before and after the injection of 1 ml of nicotinic solution. The alternative hypothesis was supported with a p-value of 0.02, meaning nicotine did increase signal amplitude after injection. This shows how there is an increase in reception of acetylcholine and its agonist, allowing greater depolarization of the T-tubles in muscle fibers, releasing more Ca2+, leading to muscle contractions. Future studies could study the long-term effect of nicotine on acetylcholine receptors. 

Introduction:
When a motor neuron becomes depolarized above the threshold of the membrane potential, action potentials run through the axon of a neuron to the presynaptic membrane. This is where synaptic transmission begins. The depolarization of the terminal opens voltage gated Ca2+ channels, causing an influx of Ca2+ ions. The flow of these ions moves vesicles full of acetylcholine towards the presynaptic membrane. Once the vesicles fuse with the membrane, the neurotransmitter flows into the synaptic cleft, where they attach to receptors on a muscle fiber. This is called the neuromuscular junction. The acetylcholine does not directly contract muscles though. The receptors activated by it then depolarize T-tubules in the muscle, which activate receptors that allow Ca2+ ions to flow out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These ions are what cause muscle contraction. 
	Acetylcholine is the body’s natural neurotransmitter for muscle movement, but a molecule that is the same shape of acetylcholine could be used to mimic its function and attach to an acetylcholine receptor. These similar molecules are called agonists, and nicotine can serve as one. It could have to potential to be stronger than acetylcholine. As T.M. Egan says in his research paper, nicotine increases the rate of action potentials, but has the same effect as acetylcholine. [Egan: 1986] From Egan’s study, it can be concluded that both acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate muscle contraction through a similar process. They both bind to receptors on muscle fibers that eventually cause release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which contracts muscles. 
	To see the effect of nicotine, we will inject the agonist into the leg of a Rana pipiens and measure signal amplitude of the contractions. This species of frog is favorable to our experiment because we can locate and stimulate it through the sciatic nerve to see its effect on the gastrocnemius thigh muscle. The twitches are easily observable and there is a simple method to measuring the signal amplitude, using electrodes. The null hypothesis for this experiment is that nicotine’s effect on signal amplitude will not differ from that of acetylcholine. Our hypothesis is that nicotine will increase the muscle signal amplitude after injection of nicotine into the leg of a Rana pipiens, despite T.M. Egan saying there would be no difference. The reason for this is that we believe a combination of the acetylcholine pumping through the leg and the nicotine we inject will mean increased reception, allowing greater depolarization of the cell. 


Materials and Methods:
Materials that will be needed for the experimental setup are three frog legs, Ringer’s solution, 1 mg/ml nicotinic solution, connector box, computer program to record data, syringe, string, scissors, pins, and a stand.
1.	Carefully peel skin off all three frog legs using scissors, and rinse with Ringer’s solution to keep leg moist. They will serve as your control, and then your treatment group after you inject them. 
2.	Cut a piece of string a tie it around the frog leg, to hang it from the stand. This will be used to apply just enough tension so it does not hang, but rest on the dissection container.
3.	Once the frog leg is hanging at the right amount of tension, locate the sciatic nerve above the gastrocnemius muscle, and hook it up to the sleeve electrode connected to the connector box. Make sure the box is off at this moment. 
4.	Make sure the leg is in place by pinning it to the dissection container. Hook up another electrode to the gastrocnemius muscle. 
5.	Turn on the connector box, and open the Lab Scribe computer program on your laptop.  
6.	Set up the settings on the computer program as follows, “1 amp, 5 pulses, 5 W, and 1 Hz.” Keep this consistent throughout the experiment. 	
7.	Start recording, and stop it after 5 pulses. Calculate the signal amplitudes for each of the five myograms that appear. This will be “pre-injection.”
8.	For “post-injection,” start off by recording five normal myograms. After these five myograms, the program will keep recording in the background. This is when you will inject 1 ml of nicotinic solution with a syringe. You will let the program keep recording until the signal amplitude levels off. 
9.	Once it levels off, you will start recording five myograms. You will calculate the signal amplitude for them. In order the calculate the true signal amplitude for post injection, you must add the highest signal amplitude from when nicotine was injected. This will mean you should go back in the graph and find the peak. This will be known as B1. You will add this to the signal amplitudes of the five myograms post injection. 
10.	Repeat this process with the next two frog legs. 
Once all data has been recorded, a one tailed t test will be used to find out if the data was able to reject null hypothesis. The significance level for this study is 0.05. 


Results:
Figure 1 shows a major difference in signal amplitude before and after the injection of nicotine. The error bars also do not seem to show a large standard deviation, meanign there were no major outliets. The mean for preinjection was 0.257 V, and the standard deviation was 0.118. the mean for postinjection was 1.259 V, and the standard deviation was 0.139. The degrees of freedom were 14, and the t-value was 00.022876. The alternative hypothesis is that there would be a greater signal amplitude for post injection. After conducting a two sample one-tailed t-test with the signal amplitudes of all 15 myograms(five for each frog), a p-value of 0.982. This must be subtrated from 1 because it is one tailed, so the real p-value is 0.018, which is lower than the significance level. This means the data is significant. 



Discussion:
As the one-tailed two sample t-test shows, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is supported. The nicotine does cause greater signal amplitude in muscle contraction than actetylcholine. The nicotine has this effect on the muscle because it overflwos the synaptic clefts of the neuromuscular juction with acetylcholine agonists, cause more depolarization of the T-tubules in the muscle fibers. This allows more Ca2+ ions to be released for msucle contraction.  Before injection, there was only acetlylcholine being released, which was not overflowing the synaptic clefts. After injection of nicotine, there was an increase in the rate of action potentials with both acetylcholine and nictoine attaching to receptors. This supports what T.M. Egan said from his study. 
	The results of this study further proves how nicotine serves as an acetylcholine agonist. The short term affect of the nictone was increased signal amplitude with muscle contractions, but a further study could see the long term affect. The increased reception and overflow of acetylcholine and its agonists could potentially desentisize the receptors, making it a neccessity. This is similar to how cocaine causes the down regulation of dopamine recepetors. This means there is less dopamine being made and recepted by the body, meaning only cocaine can help the user be happy. This leads to an addiction, which would potentially be why nictoine is addictive. This can be tested in humans with bad smoking habits and test their sensitization of acetylcholine receptors somehow.
