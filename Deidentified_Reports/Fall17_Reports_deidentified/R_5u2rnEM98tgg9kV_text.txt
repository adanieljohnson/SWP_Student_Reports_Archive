Title: The Lack of Effect from Saline Solutions on Photosynthetic Rate in Spinacia oleracea and in Rosmarinus officinalis  

Abstract:
All organisms need a form of energy harvesting or consumption to obtain the energy needed to carry out cellular processes.  One of the most important cellular process among plants is photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis can be affected by many different factors including salt as a major one.  Too much salt can be detrimental to a plant’s survival, so it is important to understand the effects that come with it.  This can be tested by comparing the effects of salt on photosynthesis through a mechanism involving DCPIP, an electron carrier that changes from blue to colorless when electrons are accepted in photosynthesis.  Control groups for these different plants were used to determine the effects salt has on the plants.  If salt is introduced into both plants, there will be a predicted decrease in photosynthetic rates for the spinach and a no apparent change in the photosynthetic rate for the rosemary plant.  The key results showed no significant difference for either salt induced plants compared to their control group.  These results indicated further research needed to be conducted, but the results showed trends that could be correlated with the hypothesis.  Overall, photosynthesis is an important process that should be monitored to better understand various plants.

Introduction:
All living organisms need a source of energy to survive and perform metabolic processes on both the cellular level and as an organism.  There are multiple ways of obtaining energy such as harvesting varying forms of energy such as chemical or light energy or by consumption of other organisms. The most common form of energy harvesting among plants is a process known as photosynthesis.  This process is important because it allows plants to harvest raw light energy and convert it into a form of energy storage, which in this case is photosynthesis.  
	The photosynthesis process is first activated by means of light energy absorbed in chloroplasts by chlorophyll. Excited electrons are then captured within the chloroplasts and leave their excited carriers.  The high energy electrons are then stored in the form of NADPH and the proton gradient then drives the synthesis of ATP by ATP synthase.  This process is important because it stores and creates energy that will be needed to reduce carbon dioxide into a storage molecule.  The next step in photosynthesis is to use the NADPH and ATP generated from the previous steps to produce glucose as the final product [Johnson: 2016].  Photosynthesis is affected by many different factors in a plant’s surrounding environment.  A few of these factors are pH, temperature, amount of light, salinity, and many others.  Salt concentration in the soil and water is important for necessary ions to enter the plants and be used in other cellular processes; however, too high of salinity levels can cause the plants’ cells to shrink due to water leaving the cells to attempt to neutralize the high salt concentration [Ashraf and Harris: 2013].  Since the amount of photosynthesis is difficult to measure through the amount of glucose produced in the plants, this can be tested through the use of the electron transport chain.  2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), an electron acceptor, is blue when oxidized, but turns colorless when reduced by accepting electrons [Johnson: 2016].  When this is introduced to a system, the electrons from the light can be accepted by DCPIP which will turn the solution colorless if photosynthesis occurs. 
Spinacia oleracea, or more commonly known as spinach, is a common plant which makes it ideal for study in photosynthesis.  In addition, the leaves from spinach are cheap and small which makes obtaining and storing easy and allows multiple trials to be run if need be.  The second plant being studied is Rosmarinus officinalis is another commonly found plant with small leaves which are relatively cheap making it another ideal plant to study.  In addition to this, rosemary plants are salt resistant in their abilities to maintain photosynthesis and other cellular processes [Tounekti et al: 2011].  The purpose in testing the difference in salinity and plants types is important on a global scale as plants need the ability to be able to adapt in varying changes to their environment which could include salt if located near salt water.  The absorbance is the dependent variable which measures the effects of both plant type and salinity concentration.  If the two different plants are tested for difference in absorbance based on photosynthesis, then there is expected to be a difference in absorbance based on different plant type.  If salt concentrations are tested for each plant individually, then the rosemary plant is expected to continue photosynthesis in salt concentrations while the spinach plants are expected to slow down in terms of photosynthesis.  Given these hypotheses, we would expect the absorbance, and thus photosynthesis, to be lower in the experimental salt group compared to the control group and the absorbance to have no significant change between the control and experimental group for rosemary.


Materials and Methods:
Four spinach leaves and thirty rosemary leaves were collected.  They were separated into two different mortar and pestle and two 200mL beakers and 6 50mL centrifuge tubes were collected.  The leaves were grinded up in their separate mortars with 10mL of 400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer (pH 8) until a thick paste was formed.  10mL of more buffer was then added and grinding continued for each solution.  Each mixture was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into their separate 200mL beakers.  These solutions were then transferred into separate 50mL centrifuge tubes labeled “S-A” for Spinach Solution A and “R-A” for Rosemary Solution A.  Both solutions were then centrifuged at 200 × G (1200rpm) for 3 minutes at 4 °C.  The solutions were then transferred into centrifuge tubes labeled “S-B” and “R-B” leaving the solid at the bottom of tubes A out.  These solutions were then centrifuged at 1000 × G (2800rpm0 for 10 minutes at 4 °C.  The supernatants from “S-B” and “R-B” were then transferred into centrifuge tubes “S-C” and “R-C” while keeping the pellet inside of tubes B.  20 mL of buffer solution was then added to each “S-B” and “R-B” and stirred gently.  These solutions were then used in the hemocytometer to determine the concentration of chloroplasts in each plant by using a phase microscope.  15 test tubes were then obtained and filled with the appropriate amount of solution: a Blank for spinach and rosemary with 8mL of water, 100 µL of appropriate chloroplasts, and 2mL of reaction buffer.  The three controls were made for each with 6mL of water, 2mL DCPIP, 100 µL of appropriate chloroplasts, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The three salt concentration were made the exact same as the controls but with 0.5mL of 1.06M NaCl included.  After the test tubes were filled, initial absorbance values were recorded by transferring a small amount of the solution from each test tube into a cuvette and using a spectrophotometer at 600nm to record the absorbances.  The rest of the 15 test tubes were then placed in a rack and exposed to artificial for 10 minutes.  This process was then repeated until 30 minutes had passed. After the data was collected, an AVOVA one factor statistical test was run to determine significance between the two groups of salinity or plant type.  

Results:
The important tests from the ANOVA test were there was not a significant difference between the initial absorbances for the control and salt concentrations in the spinach leaves.  There was also not a significant difference between these groups after thirty minutes of sitting in light.  The overall trend for each of these groups in spinach was an overall increase in the amount of total absorbance but decrease in rate. For the rosemary plants, there was a significant difference between the initial absorbances for the control and the salt concentrations in the spinach leaves.  There was not a significant difference in the absorbances for these two groups after thirty minutes of absorbing light.  The overall trend for rosemary showed and overall higher rate of absorbance for the salt induced chloroplasts than for the control rosemary group.

Discussion:
According to the ANOVA test, there was not a significant difference between the initial absorbance for the control spinach and the salt concentration spinach which is important for this experiment as it was testing to see if there would be a final difference in absorbance between the two; however, according to the ANOVA test, there was not a significant difference between the two groups after 30 minutes of photosynthesis occurred.  This result does not support our hypothesis that the salt induced spinach would have a higher final absorbance and thus a lower rate of photosynthesis.  However, by analyzing figure 4. the data suggests there is a decrease in absorbance rate of change as time goes on, and this is indicative that photosynthesis could be occurring at a slower rate in the salt solution as time goes on.  As far as the rosemary plant is concerned, there was a significant difference between the initial control group and the initial salt group.  After the 30 minutes, there was not a significant difference between the two groups which indicates that the salinity solution might need a salt solution to thrive more and undergo photosynthesis at a higher rate.  This is better represented by figure 5 as it shows the percent change in absorbance is higher than the control group and stays higher than the control group throughout the 30 minutes.  The difference between plants absorbances can be explained by a different concentration of chloroplasts in the appropriate plants; rosemary having a higher density than spinach.  Some possible sources of error in our experimentation could be not giving the solutions direct and equal sunlight for photosynthesis to occur, 
	In comparison to other experiments, Delfine and other lab coordinators set up an experiment dealing with spinach plants trying to recover from salt stress and the amount of CO2 was being recorded.  RUBSICO was used as was used as an alternate form of testing for photosynthesis rates.  In the results of this experiment, the plants submerged in saline solution showed a significant decrease in photosynthetic processes with the plants.  This is important due to the relation with this experiment as the initial hypothesis stating that salt solution would cause a decrease in photosynthesis within the chloroplasts.  Even higher salt concentrations were tested and the relationship between salt concentration and photosynthesis was found to be inversely proportional [Delfine: 1999].	
As far as future experimentation is concerned, this experiment could be run again but with varying amounts of salt concentration with both lower and higher salinity levels.  This is important because it can truly test the effects of salinity at varying levels which applies to the purpose of this experiment: to test the photosynthetic ability of varying plants in various salinity levels.  In nature, the salinity level can be unpredictable due to more water coming through and taking away salt ions in the water and soil or a breakthrough of salt water can come into contact with the plants’ soil and cause more uptake or salt in water.  If an experiment were run to test these various salinity levels, scientists could have a better understanding of certain plants when put under salt deprivation or salt stress.  In this future experiment, a larger sample size would be used to determine and get rid of outlying data.  In addition to the increase in different salinity levels, an increase in plant variety could be useful too such as plants that are able to adapt to salt concentrations as well as plants that do not thrive well in salinity.  The same hypothesis could be used but with varying changes dependent upon which plants and salt concentrations are added.  An even more interesting concept that could be tested would be the effect of multiple factors such as salinity and pH at the same time because this is a more realistic due to soil having different factors involved in its contents besides just salinity.  
	Overall, photosynthesis is an important process that occurs in plants and is necessary for all organisms to be able to live on Earth.  Experimentation with salinity can allow scientists to understand how this affects photosynthesis in salt environments and possibly see how plants will adapt to this and help if a salinity disaster occurs in a certain region.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1.
This figure illustrates the overall change in absorbance in Spinach solution for both the control and the salt solution. The overall trend for both groups includes a decrease in absorbance which indicates photosynthesis occurred in both groups.
Figure 2.
This figure illustrates the overall change in absorbance in Rosemary solution for both the control and the salt concentration.  The overall trend for both groups includes a decrease in absorbance although it is ever so slight which indicates photosynthesis occurred.
Figure3.
This figured shows the trend in percent change in absorbance for Spinach solution overtime compared to the original absorbance.  There is an obvious increase in both groups as the overall trend although the salt concentration appears to be a slower rate.
Figure 4.
This figure shows the derived data in percent change in absorbance in Spinach which is based from each time interval to the next.  The overall trend shows that the control group had a steady rate of decrease in absorbance but the salt concentration shows a gradual decline in the absorbance which could lead to further analysis of this data.
Figure 5.
This figured illustrates the overall trend for change in absorbance for each time interval compared to the original absorbance at time = 0.  The overall trend described here shows that the percent change was actually higher for the salt concentration than the control but both show an overall increase in photosynthesis rate overtime.   Standard error is so small that it does not appear for the experimental group. 
Figure 6.
This figure illustrates the overall trend in derived data for the percent change in rosemary which is based on a comparison of one time interval to the next.  The overall trend for both groups shows photosynthesis rate could have stopped changing after the 20-minute mark.
