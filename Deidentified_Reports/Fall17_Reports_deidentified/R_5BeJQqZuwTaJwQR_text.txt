Title: The Effect of Oxygenation on Betta Splendens

Abstract:
This was a study of the effect of oxygenated water on betta fish (Betta splendens) aggression. The fish were shown to one another through a transparent surface and their aggressive behaviors were recorded and calculated into a coherent scoring system that determined whether or not a higher level of oxygen made them more aggressive. We believed that with access to more resources the Betta splendens would become more agitated with one another, and after performing the experiment we found that the results supported our hypothesis. Hostile behavior greatly increased when the fish were presented with higher oxygen levels.

Introduction:
In the animal kingdom being able to compete for mates is amongst one of the most important things a male can do. Without the ability to secure a lineage, a male is considered a genetic failure and lacking in fitness. The importance lies in the transmission of genetic material. Some creatures do this by engaging in intricate mating dances, making noise, or fighting. Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) are a species of fish which can be found swimming through most inland bodies of water throughout Asia. They exist in incredibly small habitats. Some even thriving within puddles made by terrace farms. They exist on a diet of small insects and algae that fall into their territory. They are small, and due to their mating habits are incredibly aggressive. Male to male aggression is extremely common, and often deadly for one of the parties involved.(Sturgeon D. 1968) This aggression is geared exclusively towards males, as in the presence of a female the male bettas will maintain a puffy appearance while approaching slowly in an attempt to impress and copulate. A study performed by the department of zoological behavior in Copenhagen found that not only do males become aggressive in the presence of another male, but the more males that are present, the greater the aggression becomes. (Matos, RJ) Knowing this about the bettas we wanted to test what other factors spur their aggression. The independent variable we would be introducing would be a bubbler to oxygenate the water. By quantifying the aggressive behaviors listed above we measured and scored the bettas as they viewed each other through glass. We hypothesized that the bettas in the bubbling water would be more aggressive towards their opposition than the control fish. The hope was that if we indeed found oxygen to be a limiting factor in betta fish aggression than that would imply that the inverse could also be true. If we were to somehow remove oxygen from the tank then it would lead the fish to a more relaxed or conservative view of one another. This would finally make cohabitation of betta fish possible.

Materials and Methods:
We began by placing a single male betta fish in one tank with three separate sections. Opaque partitions obstructing view of each other were in place, and beside that was a transparent barrier. After they had been given proper time to adjust to their new environment we removed one opaque partition at a time so that two bettas could see each other at once. We then used the scale shown in Image one to measure their aggressiveness. It first began with a display from both males. It was a combination of two categories of display: facing and broadside. Broadside aggression consisted of three motions: Pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail flashing. The facing displays consisted of three motions also: erecting the pectoral fin, spreading of the gill covers (opercula), and protruding of the branchiostegal membranes (this gave the appearance of a red “mane” forming on the chin). These behaviors in both categories each signified increasing aggression consecutively. For each behavior shown we added the proper amount of points. Once five minutes had passed we replaced the opaque partition and allowed the fish time to relax. We repeated this once for each possible pairing of fish, allowing each one to see the others. The results were recorded and we repeated the entire process again, but this time we oxygenated the water of the two interacting fish with an oxygen bubbler.

Results:
Graph 1 displays the relationship and standard error of our data. When the fish were tested a second time in the oxygenated water, the number of hostile reactions were much higher than they were previously. For all fish the agonistic score increased by approximately 10-15%. The mean agonistic score with the bubbler was close to 42, whereas without it the score sat near 33. The standard error for the experimental data was approximately 22 points in either direction, and control was only 14.3.  

Discussion:
Watching the bettas interact with and without the bubbler made it very clear that they were far more active  and aggressive towards each other when the water was being oxygenated. It does, however, beg the question of whether or not the oxygenation was acting as a stressor for increased aggression, or if the presence of the bubbler nozzle was what was aggravating to them. We are aware that interaction and stimulation from the outside can cause a more visceral reaction from the Betta splendens. The experiment performed by the zoological department in Copenhagen shows the potency of these stressors. It is entirely possible that they misinterpreted our bubbler for another hostile life form. (Matos, RJ) They never came into direct, aggressive contact with it, but the constant flurry of bubbles seemed to make them more prone to lashing out. We also are aware of the fact that the bettas began to familiarize themselves with one another throughout the trials. This may have increased the hostility or started the habituation of our test subjects as we moved to the experimental phase. Even so the data speaks to an increase in aggression as the result of higher oxygen levels in the water. It does beg the question: if the water was less oxygenated, would the bettas refuse to waste energy on hostile interactions? The maning of the bettas actually limits their ability to breath, because of its interference with the their gills. This halts cellular respiration and can kill the betta in extreme circumstances. If we limit oxygen to an even greater extent then aggressive behaviors would cost more resources than they would be worth. This could be the key to having multiple male bettas share a habitat.

Image 1: Each agonistic behavior was given a specific score based on its associated level of aggression e.i. maning is more aggressive than pectoral fin extension, thus it receives a higher multiplier.
