Title: The affects of caffeine on the amplitude of the Anura gastrocnemus muscle.

Abstract:
In this experiment, we will be looking at the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle of two Anura legs. Anuras, commonly known as frogs, are considered to be the most diverse of the three amphibian orders. Anurans can be found throughout the world, in nearly every region. They are exceptional jumpers with long, powerful legs (Heying 2003). We will be observing their legs and how caffeine affects muscle contraction. In order to do this, we will need to attach the sciatic nerve of the leg to the BNC connector which will be linked to a stimulator and computer software (LabScribe). We will stimulate the nerve with increasing frequencies in order to observe the amplitude differences. The amplitude is the speed/force of contraction of the leg. Next, we will determine the effects of injecting each gastrocnemus muscles with 0.1Ml of caffeine utilizing amplitude testing with the same intervals as the controlll.  We hypothesize that the caffeine will increase the amplitude of the muscle contraction because previous experiments explore the ergogenic effect of caffeine during exercise (Jenky 1995).

Introduction:
The Anura is the ideal organism for visualizing muscle contraction because its large gastrocnemus is easy to manipulate. It’s muscles are similar to that that of a mammalian muscles (Department 2002). Frogs also have large extensor muscles that they use during jumping. The gastrocnemus muscle, found in the leg, is composed of many muscle fibers. All of these fibers have their own unique threshold. Threshold is the voltage of a stimulus eliciting a physical response. Not all muscle fibers are stimulated at the same voltage. When voltage is higher than the threshold, more and more fibers are stimulated. Eventually, the fibers will reach a constant stimulation at a certain threshold. We will be using software to determine the amplitude, difference in voltage, between frogs with and without caffeine.  Caffeine is a natural stimulant often found in beans and leaves. For hundreds of years, people have created drinks using caffeine in order to feel more “awake” and “alert.” Caffeine can be consumed in energy drinks, coffee, tea, etc. It is a legal, unregulated, psychoactive substance that is becoming more and more popular around the world. Because of this, we believe that caffeine not only affects neurotransmitters and the brain, but it also affects skeletal muscles in the body. We want to know have caffeine affects muscles, including our own. We hypothesize that the isolated Frog Sciatic Nerve – Gastrocnemius Muscle will show that the muscle amplitudes are increased when exposed to caffeine. We will attempt to prove this by comparing amplitude before and after the injection of caffeine in the gastrocnemus. 

Materials and Method:
We started the experiment by putting gloves on. We placed the leg of the Anura in a dissecting pan. Next, we grabbed the skin on top of the leg with our hands and slowly pulled it towards the foot. We moistened the leg with frog Ringer’s solution periodically to keep it from drying out. With our hands, we separated the inner thigh muscles until we saw the white sciatic nerve and blood vessels. We freed the nerve from its attaching connective tissue. Next we pinned the muscle on the dissecting pan to keep it place. We tied a string tightly to the top of the leg, close to the upper joint. Then we looped the string onto the hovering hook so that the leg is stretched vertically. The, we laid the nerve on the wire. We put the BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes attached to the BNC-banana adapter on the stimulator output of the IWX/214. We set everything to zero (0), increasing the voltage in 0.1V increments until you see the leg physically move (threshold). Next, we set the frequency (F(Hz)) to 2 Hz, the number of pulses (# pulses) to zero (0), and the pulse amplitude (Amp) to the lowest value that still gave strong contractions (threshold). We placed the pulse width (W) at 5ms and clicked the apply button. We recorded until we saw the effect of stimulating at a certain frequency. The we typed 2 Hz in the mark box to the right button. We clicked record to stimulate the nerve and click the mark button to mark the recording. We stopped the recording after 5 seconds. The we changed the stimulus frequency to 4 Hz. We repeated the mark and record cycle. Afterwards, we continued the recording for stimulus frequencies of 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 Hz. We clicked the Save button to save the file. We injected the same leg with 0.1Ml of caffeine and waited 5-10 minutes. Then we repeated the same process as above now that the leg had caffeine. 

Results:
As one can see, the general trends in both legs are that of increasing amplitude with the caffeine treatment. Figure 1 and 2 show that the treated legs have an amplitude nearly double of the untreated. The amplitude average of both legs display this even more so. To statistically test the data, we ran a two-sample T-Test so we could compare the means of both legs. After doing so, we found a P-value of 0.0422 which means the difference is significent and the null hypothesis is not accepted. Physically, we observed that the treated legs felt very hard and swollen.

Discussion:
Between the raw data, averaged data, statistical test and physicality of the frog legs with caffeine, we can say with confidence that caffeine increases the amplitude and strength of the contraction of skeletal muscles in the frog leg. For every interval in both of the Anura legs, the treated legs had higher amplitudes. The caffeine did have an affect on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Anura. Our hypothesis proved to be correct in this experiment. Caffeine is widely consumed because it can act as a stimulant. In this study, we found that a large dose of caffeine increases the force of contraction. Biologically, caffeine causes an dosedependent increase in release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Olorunshola and Achie 2011). The calcium then binds to troponin which, in turn, allow myosin to bind to actin. This process allows the filaments to slide past each other and the sarcomere is shortened. A shortened sarcomere contracts the muscle. For our experiment, we only used two legs because the third leg’s sciatic nerve was damaged. In the future, it would be best to use more legs because the data collection would be greater. The LabScribe software can be confusing as well. I would suggest using an easier software in the future. Besides that, the experiment ran very smoothly.
