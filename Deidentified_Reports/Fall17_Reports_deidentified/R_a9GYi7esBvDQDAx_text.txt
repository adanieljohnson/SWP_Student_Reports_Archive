Title: Acidic pH decreases specific metabolic rate in Procambarus sp. Crayfish

Abstract:
In this study, the effect of an acidic pH on the metabolic rates of Procambarus sp. Crayfish of different sizes was measured. It was hypothesized that the placement of the crayfish in an environment of pH 3.08 would decrease the oxygen consumption and therefore the metabolic rates of the crayfish. Three crayfish of similar size were each placed in a control environment of pH 6.2 and an experimental environment of pH 3.08. The oxygen consumption of each crayfish in each environment was measured with a probe in five-minute increments until they were submerged for a total of 20 minutes, and specific metabolic rates were calculated for each respective crayfish. The amounts of oxygen in the water per unit volume for the control crayfish (0.73 mg/L, 0.98 mg/L, 0.59 mg/L) were all much lower than the changes for the experimental crayfish (0.12 mg/L, 0.22 mg/L, 0.27 mg/L). The specific metabolic rates for the control crayfish (0.00085 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish), 0.0014 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish), 0.00048 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish)) were all much higher than those for the experimental (0.00014 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish), 0.00031 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish), 0.00034 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish)). The results supported the hypothesis with a P-value of 0.064 for the specific m

Introduction:
In this lab the metabolic rate of a crayfish was found. Knowing about the steps of respiration, both aerobic and anaerobic, allowed for the metabolic rate to be estimated by measuring the oxygen consumption of the Procambarus sp. crayfish. In summary, in the mitochondria glucose is split into pyruvate which is converted to acetate which is then converted to carbon dioxide. From that, electrons are released, and they travel between molecules on the electron transport chain, which uses energy from the released electrons to generate ATP. Electrons finally go to the oxygen and form, and the extra ATP is what produces the carbon dioxide. This experiment was performed in order to find the relationship between pH, specifically acidic conditions, and metabolic rate in the Procambarus sp. species of crayfish. Knowing that decreased oxygen uptake describes a hypo-metabolic response to low pH, and acidic environments depress the aerobic and anaerobic systems in the crayfish, oxygen consumption should decrease and result in a decreased metabolic rate (Ellis and Morris: 1994). Acidic conditions will be tested using 100 mL of a 3.08 pH buffer solution diluted with 900 mL water. It is predicted that acidic conditions for the crayfish will decreased their metabolic rates.

Materials and Methods:
Students were given three Procambarus sp. crayfish of similar size. Crayfish were numbered 1 through 3 to ensure they were not mixed up throughout the experiment, and each was weighed. A pH probe was placed into a container of neutral water in order to get the exact neutral pH for the control environment, and the probe stabilized to about 6.2 pH. An acidic solution was made with 100 mL of a buffer solution and 900 mL of water, a probe was place in to measure the pH, and the resulting acidic pH found for the experimental environment was about 3.08. One chamber was filled with neutral water and the first crayfish was placed in along with the probe. Dissolved oxygen concentration values were taken every 5 minutes for a total time of 20 minutes in the chamber. The water from the chamber was then poured into a graduated cylinder in order to record the total volume of liquid. This same was placed into a chamber full of the acidic solution and the same procedure was followed, taking and recording a new dissolved oxygen concentration from the probe reader every five minutes for a total of twenty minutes. These steps were followed for each crayfish, and specific metabolic rates were calculated using the change in oxygen concentration, volume of liquid in the chamber, time in the chamber, and weight of each crayfish. A two-tailed paired t test was run to determine how statistically significant the difference between specific metabolic rates for crayfish in a neutral environment and crayfish in an acidic environment was.

Results:
The experimental treatment had a significant effect. The changes in oxygen consumption for the control crayfish (0.73 mg/L, 0.98 mg/L, 0.59 mg/L) were all much lower than the changes for the experimental crayfish (0.12 mg/L, 0.22 mg/L, 0.27 mg/L). The specific metabolic rates for the control crayfish (0.00085 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish), 0.00139 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish), 0.00048 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish)) were all much higher than those for the experimental (0.00014 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish), 0.00031 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish), 0.00034 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish)). The average specific metabolic rate for the control group of 0.0010 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish) was higher than the average of 0.00026 mg of O2 / min * g (crayfish) for the experimental group.

The P-value for the data was 0.06388 with a t-value of 3.764 and 2 degrees of freedom.



Discussion:
The hypothesis that the specific metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, would decrease in an acidic environment was supported by the data, but not statistically due to a sample size of only three crayfish. The average specific metabolic rate in water after the full twenty minutes was about 4 times the specific metabolic rate in the lower pH environment, and this difference was statistically insignificant with a p-value of 0.064 in the two-tailed paired t-test. Decreased oxygen uptake describes a hypo-metabolic response to low pH (Ellis and Morris: 1994). Acidic environments depress the aerobic and anaerobic systems in the Procambarus sp. Crayfish, and therefore oxygen consumption decreases, which creates a decreased metabolic rate. In a previous experiment, it was shown that acidic environments produce stress-induced hyperglycemia in Cherax destructor (Ellis and Morris: 1994). The decrease in specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. in an acidic environment is an effort to conserve ATP. Higher glucose levels mean that glycolysis has decreased and there is a slowed movement of glucose to match that decreased rate, and this all accounts for the slowed rate of oxygen consumption (Ellis and Morris: 1994). It would be interesting to do an experiment in the future with varying calcium ion levels using a Ca2+ inhibitor or activator, because calcium concentrations, in the case study, had a very large effect on metabolic rate. Specifically, low environmental calcium concentrations have been proposed to increase the energy expenditure required for homeostasis, and the acclimation of a species to low Ca2+ water at neutral pH would significantly increase metabolic oxygen levels.
