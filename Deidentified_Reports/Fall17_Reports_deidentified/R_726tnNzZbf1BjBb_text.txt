Title: Cold temperature increases chloroplast activity in both Spinacia oleracea (spinach) and Fragaria ananassa (strawberry) 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process of converting solar radiation into chemical energy, including both light dependent and independent reactions. In this experiment, we test how hot, cold, and room temperature affect Spinacia oleracea (spinach) chloroplast and Fragaria ananassa  (strawberry) chloroplast activity. We can measure the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC), which passes electrons to other electron acceptors, releasing energy. We predict that a cold temperature will produce the greatest chloroplast activity in both spinach and strawberry leaves. We tested this by measuring light absorbance’s of chloroplasts in a spectrophotometer (a reflection of activity), that have been in hot (35° C), cold (1°C), and room temperatures, all under the same amount of lamp light. We created two chloroplast mixtures, and recorded absorbance in 0, 10, 20, and 30 minute intervals in both spinach and strawberry chloroplasts. At 30 minutes in cold temperature, spinach chloroplasts had a 6% increase and strawberry chloroplasts had a 13% increase, producing the most activity overall. Cold temperatures probably maintain proper protein functioning for the electron transport chain, and/or maintain correct partial pressures of carbon dioxide (and oxygen), which is necessary for photosynthesis.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process of converting carbon dioxide and water, into glucose, energy, and oxygen [Johnson: 2017]. This method is used by plants and autotrophs that turn solar radiation into chemical energy. The first two stages of photosynthesis are light dependent (photosystems II and I- PSII, PSI), using photons of two different wavelengths to produce reducing power in the form of NADPH. It also uses a proton gradient to drive ATP synthesis. The last stage is a light independent reaction, called the Calvin cycle; it enables RUBISCO to use ATP and NADPH to convert a one-carbon carbon dioxide and a 5-carbon ribulose phosphate, to produce a 6-carbon glucose. Certain conditions affect photosynthesis, particularly chloroplast activity, including factors like herbicides, light, and temperature [Johnson: 2017]. In this experiment, we test how hot, cold, and room temperature affect Spinacia oleracea (spinach) chloroplast and Fragaria ananassa  (strawberry) chloroplast activity. Since it is hard to measure ATP production as a product of photosynthesis, we take advantage of the Hill reaction. In doing so, we can measure the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC), which passes electrons to other electron acceptors, releasing energy. In our experiment, we use DCPIP as the electron acceptor, which is a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light at a maximum of 600 nm. According to Sonoike, of the University of Tokyo, spinach chloroplast activity decreases with increased temperature, which he explains may be attributed to “the enhanced electron flow from PSII in
Spinach thylakoid membranes to PSI” [Sonoike: 1995]. The increased flow of electrons may cause a build up of reduced electrons in photosystem I, which means that energy is not being released from these electrons that should be oxidized. The oxidation and release of energy sets up proton gradients that power ATP synthase to produce ATP. As a result, there is a decrease in chloroplast activity. We predict that a cold temperature will produce the greatest chloroplast activity in both spinach and strawberry leaves. We will test this by measuring light absorbance’s of chloroplasts (a reflection of activity), that have been in hot, cold, and room temperatures. 

Materials and Methods:
We used two types of leaves, four Spinacia oleracea (Spinach) and seven Fragaria ananassa  (strawberry) to separately test the affects of temperature on chloroplast activity. To test Spinach, we first began by chilling a mortar and pestle, beakers, and centrifuge tubes on ice. Four Spinach leaves were de-veined, and grinded up in a mortal using 10 mL of pH 8.0 grinding buffer, until no large chunks were left. Another 10 mL of grinding buffer were added to the mixture, which was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth, and poured into a centrifuge tube. The tube was centrifuged at 1200 RPM (20 x G) for 3 minutes at 4°. The solid was left at the bottom of the tube, and the liquid was then transferred to another tube to centrifuge at 2800 RPM (20 x G) for 10 minutes at 4° C. Another 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the liquid, and 200 uL were removed to check chloroplast density under a microscope. We then set up the test tubes: one positive control, three tubes to be tested in cold temperature (an ice bath at 1° Celsius), 3 tubes to be tested at room temperature, and 3 tubes to be tested in hot temperature (a hot water bath at 35° Celsius). The positive control tube had 6 mL water, 2 mL DCPIP, and 2 ML of reaction buffer. The remaining tubes each had 6 mL water, 2 mL DCPIP, 2 mL reaction buffer, and 100 uL of the spinach mixture chloroplasts. The tubes are all tested at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes in the spectrophotometer (600nm) to check for chloroplast activity. At the start (0 mins.), all tubes are recorded in the spectrophotometer in room temperature, and then immediately placed in their respective environments to be checked again for the next few 10-minute intervals. All tubes are under the same amount of light (lamps). This same process is repeated, except that seven strawberry leaves replace the four spinach leaves in the beginning of the procedure. 
	We used an ANOVA, with one-way analysis of variance to determine the statistical significance of the data.


Results:
Though the data is not statistically significant between groups in either spinach or strawberry chloroplasts, there is still some biological significance. In spinach chloroplasts, the ANOVA shows a mean change in absorbance of -5.81 at room temp, 2.74 at cold, and -11.16 at hot (p=0.326, variance=22.1%, df=2). There wasn’t too much of a change between groups at 10 minutes. Hot and cold had the highest percent change in absorbance (activity) around 3% increase, while room temp had a 3% decrease. At 20 minutes, the cold dropped to -0.8%, room temp increased to 0.4%, and hot had a particularly large decrease by -17% in activity. At 30 minutes, the cold had a 6% increase and the overall largest absorbance, room temp had a 14% decrease, and hot temp had a 19% decrease, which showed the greatest decline in chloroplast activity. The density of spinach chloroplasts was “good,” about 5 per square. 
	In strawberry chloroplasts, the ANOVA shows a mean change in absorbance of 1.48 at room temp, 7.48 at cold, and -4.98 at hot (p=0.251, variance=20.13%, df=2). At 10 minutes, room temp and hot temp had a 6.8% and 4.5% increase, while the cold had a 1.4% decrease. At 20 minutes, the cold temp peaked in activity, with an 18.8% increase, whereas hot temp and room temp had 9% and 2.5% decreases in activity. At 30 minutes, the cold temp decreased again by 5%, though it was still producing the most chloroplast activity overall. The room temp had no change from it value at 20 minutes, and the hot temp had a 10.4% decrease, producing the least amount of activity. The density of the strawberry chloroplasts was also “good”; they were about twice the size of spinach chloroplasts. 


Discussion:
Though the statistical tests indicate that the data is insignificant, the data can still be taken as biologically significant. In general, both the graphs of the spinach and strawberry chloroplasts show that the lowest temperature (cold), produced the greatest increase in chloroplast activity, and the hot temperature produced the lest, as predicted. It appears that chloroplasts have ideal functional temperatures for several reasons. One may be that the proteins of the electron transport chain can only function at certain temperatures, before they are denatured. Even though adding some heat to a system may increase the energy of electrons, it often doesn’t take much more to negatively affect the proteins that move electrons in the ETC. Douglas Bulthuis performed a study in 1986, testing the effects of temperature on photosynthesis and growth of seagrasses. What he found was that at the approach of high temperatures, the rate of photosynthesis was reduced. He explained that this was due to a disruption in the photosynthesis-irradiance curve, as well as the functional integrity at the chloroplast level, associated with proteins in the electron transport chain [Bulthuis: 1986]. Temperature can also have an affect on the partial pressure ratios of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the chloroplast, which are necessary for proper functioning. At the Australian National University, A. Brooks, and G.D. Farquhar performed a study to test the affect of temperature on the ratios of carbon dioxide/ oxygen partial pressures in chloroplasts. They obtained statistically significant results that showed that an increase in temperature decreases chloroplast activity. They explained this, stating that temperature causes differences in the ratio between carbon dioxide and oxygen, which could causes resistance to transport of carbon dioxide between the chloroplast and the intercellular spaces, or affect the solubility [Brooks and Farquhar: 1985]. This seems probable, since carbon dioxide is a necessary component of photosynthesis. At the 30 minute mark of our experiment, both strawberry and spinach chloroplasts showed the greatest increase in activity with cold temperature. This indicates that the cold temperatures probably maintain proper protein functioning for the electron transport chain, and/or maintain correct partial pressures of carbon dioxide (and oxygen), which is necessary for photosynthesis. If we were to perform this experiment again, it would be good to do it over a period of several hours to see if chloroplasts could adjust and adapt to their drastic changes in temperature. In terms of the agricultural world, it is very important to keep plants in their ideal temperatures. Failing to do so can drastically decrease chloroplast activity, which is necessary for ATP and glucose production. If we want to feed the world’s population effectively, we must understand how chloroplasts function, especially in their optimal temperatures.
