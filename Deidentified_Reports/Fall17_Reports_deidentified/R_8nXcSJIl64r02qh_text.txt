Title: The Effect of A23187 on Tetanus in the Northern Leopard Frog’s Neuromuscular System

Abstract:
Muscle contractions are the point in which action potentials are fired and reach the inside of the cell. Without calcium, this process would not be able to occur throughout the neuromuscular system in an organism. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of A23187 on tetanus in the gastrocnemius muscle in frogs. It was hypothesized that the presence of A23187 would reduce the time it takes for a muscle to reach tetany. This prediction is based on what is known about calcium’s importance in muscle contractions and action potentials. To test the hypothesis 3 frog legs were used and at first, they were tested as a control. After control testing they were injected with 2mL’s of A23187. The hypothesis was rejected after testing due to a high P-value. 

Introduction:
In this lab, the effects of tetany on a frog’s neuromuscular system was observed.  The frog we are testing on is the Northern Leopard Frog, or the Rana Pipiens.  The frog leg gives a model that can be tested and observed with the naked eye. We are using this particular frog leg because of the similarities it shares with a human leg muscle. In the experiment, the independent variable is the amount of hertz used to test tetanus. The dependent variable on the other hand is the achievement of tetany. We were observing twitches in the frog leg which is equivalent to an Action Potential being fired. An action potential is generated from the neurons and then sent down the neuromuscular pathway so that it can travel down t-tubules and cause a muscle twitch or movement. The effects that electrical pulses have on muscles were observed through this testing procedure. Muscles can reach a point called tetany which is described as “a state of maximal sustained contraction.” (Johnson,2017) In this lab, we are testing to see at what frequency tetany occurs in the muscle and then comparing those results to when we add calcium channel activator (A23187) to the muscle. It was hypothesized that when adding the calcium channel activator, the muscle would achieve tetany quicker. We suspect it will achieve tetany quicker because calcium is responsible for neurotransmitter release which tells the next neuron to prepare to fire an Action Potential. 

Materials and Methods:
In the beginning of the experiment we received three Northern Leopard frog legs and we had to begin by preparing them for testing. To prepare the frog leg we begin by peeling back the skin and keeping it moist with frog ringer solution. We then cut the Achilles tendon and hung the gastrocnemius muscle from the stand on force transducer. After hanging the frog, we took pins and pinned down the rest of the frog leg so that when electricity hits it the leg does not move around. While the muscle is suspended with a small amount of tension on it, we inserted the electrical probes so that the frequency can be directly inserted into the muscle. We then recorded shocks at different frequencies in Hz. We used 4-20 Hz in increments of 1 until tetany was observed. We then injected 2mL’s of A23187 into the muscle and then started the initial procedure over again beginning with 4Hz and the same parameters until we reach tetany with the A23187. This was repeated with all three frog legs with the control being done first and then using the same parameters injecting A23187 and comparing the results. With our results, we used the paired T-test, which is most useful for us because we are comparing multiple data sets taken from the three controls as well as the three experimental groups. 

Results:
	The three experimental frog legs showed a decrease in the amount of Hertz needed in the experimental groups using the calcium activator (post-injection of 2mL’s). In the control of frog legs, one and two 14 hertz was needed to reach tetany. After the injection of frog leg one, it showed a small decrease in hertz needing only 12 to achieve tetany. Frog leg two also had a decreased amount of hertz needed to achieve tetany with number two achieving it at ten Hertz post-injection. Frog leg three pre-injection reached tetany at a slightly higher number of hertz than legs one and two with fifteen hertz. Post-injection for frog leg three needed only 9 hertz to achieve tetany. The paired T-test showed a P-value of 0.07418.

Discussion:
In our experiment, we had statistically significant results between the control and the calcium channel activator. Our P-value of 0.07418 and the overlap in the error bars confirmed that we had results that were not statistically significant. Having results that were not statistically significant rejects our alternative hypothesis and supports the null. The three control legs we tested had about the same amount of hertz needed in order to achieve tetany. Post-injection we can see a noticeable decrease in amount of hertz needed to have tetanus.	Our rational for our hypothesis was based on calcium’s role in generating action potentials and passing them through the synapses. (Bolton, 1979) Calcium is the key to muscle contractions and depolarization on the cellular level. With an increase in calcium’s presence, it makes more neurotransmitter release and ultimately is the cause of a muscle contraction. With the calcium at normal levels, we see It took about fourteen hertz to cause tetany. When we add calcium activator and allow more into the cell we see it drops four hertz down to ten Hertz. In the future, we need to have more testing on more legs to further confirm or disprove our hypothesis again. Based on the amount of testing we have done in this experiment we can say with a fair amount of confidence that when you add Calcium channel activator there will be less hertz required to reach tetany but it is not statistically significant enough to say it was due to the A23187.
