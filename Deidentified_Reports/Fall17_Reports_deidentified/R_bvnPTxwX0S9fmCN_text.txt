Title: Raphanus sativus biomass allocation due to differing humidity 

Abstract:
This study investigates the effects of humidity on radish, Raphanus sativus, biomass growth. The energy allocation in radishes was measured through the use of root to shoot weight and length ratios. We hypothesize that if a radish is exposed to more humidity, it will have a lower root to shoot ratio than those placed in a less humid environment. To determine this, we used 120 radish seeds, which were placed evenly in two aquariums for three weeks and watered daily. One aquarium had water at its base to mimic a humid environment, while the other did not.  It was found that those growing in a lower humidity environment would have on average a higher root to shoot ratio than those in the more humid one for both weight and length. This could be due to the fact that plants need to grow more expansive root networks to get the water they need.


Introduction:
As the climate changes and more water leaves its solid stateinto the air and oceans, it is important to understand the effects on plant growth. Abiotic factors in the environment, such as humidity in the air, may lead to a limitation of resources (if the air is less humid, then water may be less readily accessible to a plant). In response to this environmental cue, a plant may have a tradeoff, whether to allocate its energy to one part or another, in order to optimize its energy use. The plant would invest more energy into certain areas depending on where resources are more or less accessible (Rosenvald et al. 2014). This investment will maximize the plants fitness and ability to live long enough to get its genes to future generations (Bennett et al. 2012). Resource allocation as an attempt to optimize energy use and fitness in response to humidity may be seen through a root to shoot ratio of biomass (Johnson 2017). If exposed to a more water plentiful environment, then a plant may not need to grow as much root biomass to absorb water out of the ground.  This phenotypic plasticity may be seen in radishes, Raphanus sativus, when placed in different humidity’s. Radishes, small sprouts when young, have measurable weights and lengths for both their roots and their shoots. We hypothesize that if a radish is exposed to a higher humidity environment, then it will have a lower root to shoot ratio than those placed in a lower humidity environment, which will in turn have a higher one.


Materials and Methods:
We used 120 radish seeds for this study. They were divided into six 5x5 pots, 20 seeds in each, placed about an inch apart with three inches of vermiculite. Three were put into each of the two air tight aquariums and watered daily. One of the two aquariums had two inches of water in the base with the three pots on stilts; this was to simulate a high humidity environment. The water at the base was marked with tape and kept the same over the course of the study. After three weeks of watering, the newly grown sprouts were taken out of the greenhouse and removed from the soil. Keeping the high humidity plants separate from the low humidity ones, we randomly pulled five from each pot set. These were measured (mm) and weighed (g) as wholes, then their roots and shoots were measured and weighed separately. We only took the maximum length from each set of five to find the average of the three pots root-shoot lengths. After finding the averages for lengths and weight of both roots and shoots, we determined the two root to shoot ratios for weight and length and their standard deviation. A two tailed T-test was performed and a p-value was found from the data collected to determine its statistical significance and how it varies in each direction.


Results:
In this study, we found that radishes grown with higher humidity have a smaller root to shoot ratio for both weight and length than those of a lower humidity. The average root to shoot weight of radishes grown with high humidity was 0.2183 with a standard deviation of +/- 0.0213. There is a root to shoot length ratio of 1.0287 deviating +/- 0.1225. When exposed to low humidity, there was a root to shoot weight ratio of 0.2983, with a standard deviation of +/- 0.0716. Their root to shoot length ratio of 1.3226. This had a standard deviation of +/- 0.2293. The ratios and standard deviations can be seen in figure one. The data found from the high humidity group and the low humidity group can be represented through t = 1.8532 and 1.9581 with a df = 2. For the root to shoot weight ratios of the high and low humidity’s, the p-value = 0.1735; for the root to shoot length ratios, the p-value = 0.1218. 


Discussion:
After gathering the data from the two humidity groups and comparing them using a one tailed T-test and bar graph we found that our hypothesis was not confirmed. The Radish plant, Raphanus sativus, of lower humidity may not grow more shoot mass and length compared to root mass and length than the one of higher humidity, which would have less. We observed that the root to shoot weight and length ratios of high humidity were 0.2183 and 1.0287 while they were 0.2983 and 1.3226 for low humidity, however their statistics were not found to be significant. Even though there is no statistical difference, there is an observable one, showing a change in phenotype. These results and reasoning coincide with other humidity-plant allocation studies. One study, on the effects of humidity on silver birch and hybrid aspen biomass allocation and accumulation found that increased humidity significantly impeded the growth of the aspen plant, resulting in smaller shoot size and above ground biomass (Rosenvald et al. 2014). Even though these results were considered to be significant, unlike ours, they still show the trend in data. While unlikely to have affected the results, it is important to note that there may have been errors in the study. The plants may have not been watered equally, causing one aquarium to grow better than the other. They may not have been exposed to exactly the same amount of light, as well. While notable, we attempted to make these errors less influential by putting them directly beside each other in the greenhouse, so that they are exposed to roughly the same amount of light, and watering them for the same amount of time each. Of course, there may be some human error in time spent watering, but that was counteracted by giving them the same number of counted seconds each.  This data may be helpful in the future when attempting to grow plants in environments with different humidity’s than they are used to. If a plant is grown in an area with lower humidity than the environment that it evolved to fit, then it may possibly grow less biomass above ground than below. If put in a more humid environment, such as a greenhouse, it may grow more above ground mass, due to water in the soil being more easily accessible and decreased water flux affecting the nutrients in the air.
