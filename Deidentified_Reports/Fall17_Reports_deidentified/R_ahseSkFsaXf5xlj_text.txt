Title: Effect of Saline on Chloroplast Activity.

Abstract:
The response of isolated spinach leaf Chloroplasts to water and saline (35mg/mL NaCl), both in light and dark over a short term was investigated. There was no significant difference in chloroplast activity, as checked every 10 minutes for half an hour between saline and water conditions. This was true both in light and dark. The possible explanations for this reaction are discussed, as well as the potential mechanisms and relations to other studies.

Introduction:
Plant cells use glucose in much the same process as animal cells, but they differ greatly in how they power glucose synthesis, and the by-products they produce doing so. Plants depend on photosynthesis, which uses chloroplasts – unique to plant cells – to harness solar radiation to produce ATP for glucose synthesis. Photosynthesis is an essential process to most life on the planet, since it produces O2 as a waste product, which most other organisms depend on for their most essential processes like the production of ATP.
Glucose, light and water are not the only requirements to complete photosynthesis. There is an intake of six Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and twelve water (H2O), and the output is glucose (C6H12O6), six water (H2O), and Molecular Oxygen (O2). The process begins with the absorption of solar radiation in chloroplasts, exciting electrons that cleave water, pushing protons across a membrane to create a gradient as well as replacing the electrons that just left the chlorophyll [Johnson: 2017]. It is around this point that we hypothesize saline is a problem for plants. The uptake of too much NaCl, an ionic compound may split within the plant into its components Na and Cl. Cl may be toxic to plants on its own and lead to cell death, or the uptake of too much Na may upset the balance of the TCA cycle and prevent NADPH gradient. The variables we plan to test for are: Salinity of water, in which one single concentration will be used across tests. Another metric we plan to test is the difference between light and dark conditions. 

Materials and Methods:
 We believe there will be significant statistical difference, although we are unsure of the directionality, so we will use a two-tailed T-test.
The procedure itself is straightforward: Using a chilled mortar and pestle, grind 4 medium sized spinach leaves after removing their veins. Add 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to turn the ground remains into paste. Add an additional 10mL after you have a paste and stir into a slush or slurry. Strain it through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Transfer 200 μl of the filtered liquid from the beaker into a microtube labeled “Sample of A”, & store it on ice. Transfer the remaining green liquid to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spin it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4oC. Be sure to include a balance tube in the centrifuge. Pour the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. Be careful not to transfer the debris pellet at the bottom of tube “A”. Now remove 200 μl of the liquid from the 50 ml tube marked “B”, place it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B”, & store it nearby to be chilled. Centrifuge the 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC. Pour the supernatant, into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C”. Be careful not to disturb the pellet. Place tube “B” to be chilled. Add 20 ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. The pellet does not need to float, some of its contents will be suspended. Transfer 200 μl of this resuspended pellet into a microtube labeled “Sample of B Pellet”, & store it to be chilled, as with the rest. Use your B-pellet sample for the remainder – we already know it is the most chloroplast dense sample.  
When you are ready to begin the assay, add 100 μl of the B-pellet chloroplasts you prepared in Exercise #1 to the blank tube, and to 6 tubes with 6 mL of saline, and 6 with 6mL of water. Mix each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts. Transfer the mixtures to pre-numbered spectrophotometer cuvettes. Quickly blank the spectrophotometer using Tube 0. Then immediately measure the absorbance of all the samples (these are your Time Zero data points). Place samples half the samples (including the blank) in a rack on a sunny windowsill, or under the grow light. Place samples the other half in a dark drawer. After 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer with Sample 0. Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. After recording absorbance, return the 6 dark samples back in a drawer after each measurement. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) in light or dark, blank the spectrophotometer. Then measure the absorbances a second time for each sample. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) blank the spectrophotometer and measure absorbances one more time for all 16 samples.


Results:
Our results were straightforward, comparing the percent change in absorbance over time in the four different samples: Saline-water Chloroplasts in dark, Saline-water Chloroplasts in light, Water Chloroplasts in dark, and Water Chloroplasts in light. Four T-tests were conducted to compare the four variables. Saline-water Chloroplasts in light (SCIL) was compared to Saline-water Chloroplasts in dark (SCID) and Water Chloroplasts in dark (CID) was compared to Water Chloroplasts in light (CIL). Then the samples with light were compared (SCIL and CIL) and the samples in dark. (SCID and CID). The experimental groups were the Saline based chloroplasts. When comparing SCIL vs SCID and CIL vs CID, the P values were .038 and .046 respectively, indicating both were significant.

Discussion:
Our data did not reflect our hypothesis. In the end there was little observable difference between the percent change chloroplasts in saline or in water. This was observed both in light and in dark, with saline and without saline. The samples exposed to light experienced a far greater increase in the percent change in absorbance across, as expected [Anderson: 1976]. We predicted some change in the absorbance due to chloroplast damage from Saline. Our data seems to suggest that is not the case, and that saline will have an effect on other parts of the plants [Munns: 1986]. This seems to suggest that saline inhibits growth of leaves and roots because it reduces the plant as a whole’s ability to uptake water [Munns: 2002] and [Parida: 2005]. If this is the case it means singular chloroplasts can make use of salt-heavy environments or saline. Some of the potential applications include off-shore creation of oxygen via photosynthesis using separated chloroplasts, although there are quite a few logistical issues involved with this. Overall, our experiment reflected previous trends, produced significant data, and may lead to potential increased oxygen production worldwide without using precious farming land.
