Title: Affects of a Colder Environment on a Orconectes sp

Abstract:
Global Warming is changing environments all across the world and subjecting living organisms to different environments. With this in mind, we wanted to observe how the Specific Metabolic Rate of an ectotherm, Orconectes sp, varies when subjected to a colder environment. We hypothesize that if the Orconectes sp is exposed to a colder environment, then the specific metabolic rate will be lower than the specific metabolic rate at room temperature. We observed this by measuring the oxygen consumption of a Orconectes sp, a Crayfish, over 20 minutes in a two seperate closed water chamber, at 10 and 32 degrees Celsius. We then calculated the Specific Metabolic Rate for each Crayfish from the amount of oxygen consumed. However, our data does not have enough statistical evidence to make a conclusions, which results in the rejection of our hypothesis. Our first crayfish had a significent decrease in Specific Metabolic rate, our second crayfish showed a decrease in Specific Metabolic Rate as well, but our third crayfish showed a higher Specific Metabolic Rate. 

Introduction:
With the controversy of global warming changing the environments across the world, scientists are wondering how that will affect the region's inhabitants. One study found that many ectotherms in regions that are experiencing a rise in temperatures, are expending more energy which is an increase in their Specific Metabolic Rate [Dillon 2010]. We were then hoping to see if this positive correlation between temperature and specific metabolic rate would translate to lower temperatures and lower specific metabolic rate. We can measure the specific metabolic rate easily by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed by the ectotherm. When a closed environment has a certain amount of dissolved oxygen, we can measure the amount of oxygen consumed by the Orconectes sp., commonly known as the crayfish, by taking the difference between the initial and final amount of dissolved oxygen in the closed environment.   This is important because the amount of oxygen consumed is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended by that ectotherm. The amount of energy expended by the ectotherm is the specific metabolic rate. These findings of other scientist sparked our curiosity and made us wonder if we cooled the environment to below room temperature, then would we see a lowering of the metabolic rate. We hypothesized that if we make the environment 10 degrees celsius, than the specific metabolic rate will be less in the colder environment than the room temperature environment. Lastly, we chose to use the Orconectes in our lab because they are readily available and have noticable changes in metabolic rates in different environments.

Materials and Method:
First we weighed the Orconectes sp., crayfish, and placed him in the water chamber overflowing with saturated room temperature water. We placed the dissolved oxygen probe in the chamber and recorded the initial dissolved oxygen levels and then at the 5, 10, 15, and 20 minute mark. 
We then took the crayfish out of the water chamber, measured the volume of water and placed the crayfish in the water chamber that was overflowing with saturated 10 degree Celsius water. We again measured the dissolved oxygen at the initial time, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minute mark. 
We lastly took out the crayfish and measured the volume of the water chamber and calculated the Specific Metabolic rate for the crayfish in the two different environment. Then we repeated each of these steps for the two other crayfish.


Results:
Seen in Figure 1, the average Specific Metabolic Rate was 0.0042 O2g-1min-1at room temperature and 0.0038 O2g-1min-1at 10 degrees Celsius. We observed that this experiment showed a very low standard deviates of 0.00086 in the controlll experiment and then a bit higher standard deviation of 0.00195 in the Cold water experiment. Lastly we found a P-Value of 0.81021 (T-stat=0.2734 d.f.=2). We were able to detect a trend between the specific metabolic rate at room temperature and then in the cold environment. We noticed that there was a noticeable decrease for each crayfish in specific metabolic rate when it was subjected to the cold environment. 


Discussion:
With the data that we collected, we do not have have enough statistical evidence to support our hypothesis. With a P-Value that is over 0.05, we do not have enough statistical evidence to reject our null hypothesis. There are other experiments that have supported our hypothesis though, for example Andrew Clarke’s experiment states that their tropical fish, the Teleost Fish,  consumes 6 times less oxygen at 0 degrees celsius than 30 degree celsius. This resembles the results we found for two of the three crayfish where we also observed a lower oxygen consumption which translates to a lower Specific Metabolic Rate. There were a couple flaws that we experienced during our experiment, for example, it was very hard to keep the cold environment the same temperature for each Crayfish. This could have affected our data because a change in 1 or 2 degree Celsius can have an affect the amount of the oxygen consumed by the crayfish. Another flaw that we experienced was that our official readings of the initial dissolved oxygen levels have not been as accurate as I would like. It took a while for the Dissolved Oxygen probe to read the dissolved oxygen in the environment and during that time the Crayfish was breathing and lowering the amount of oxygen in the chamber. For future research I want to increase the number of crayfish we use, this will give us more accurate results. Lastly, I would like to run the experiment with a water chamber that can regulate a cold environment instead of having to regulate the temperature with ice. This will give us a more consistent environment between each Crayfish, which will give us more precise data. Finally this research is relevant because with the change of environments due to global warming, many ectotherms will be exposed to changing environment. This research will demonstrate how Crayfish, an ectotherm, is able to adapt to a different environment.

Figure Legends: 
Effects of the Specific Metabolic Rate, (O2g-1min-1), for the Orconectes sp. in the controlll temperature and then the 10 degree Celcius temperature. At room temperature, the Specific Metabolic Rate was 0.0042 O2g-1min-1 and at the cold temperature, the Specific Metabolic Rate was 0.0038 O2g-1min-1. The error bars show that we were precise when measuring at room temperature, but fairly unaccurate when measuring at the cold temperature.
