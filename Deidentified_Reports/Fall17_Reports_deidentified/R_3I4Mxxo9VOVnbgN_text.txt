Title: The Effect of Magnesium on Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
The main goal of this experiment was to determine the role magnesium plays in photosynthetic processes. Photosynthesis is a process carried out by all plants that creates cellular energy, in the form of adenosine triphosphate, from sun energy. Magnesium is an important element needed in these processes, and the chlorophyll in plant cells relies on magnesium to carry out photosynthesis. By using a centrifuge, the chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll of Spinacia aleracea were isolated. The isolation allowed for absorbance to be calculated using a spectrophotometer. The controlll contained 130 mM of DCPIP, a chemical compound that is blue when oxidized. The blue color is absorbed at 600 nM, which we used for the spectrophotometer. The experiment aimed to see how varying concentration of magnesium (MgSO4 solution) affected photosynthetic rate. Concentrations included a high concentration of magnesium (100 mM magnesium concentration), a medium concentration of magnesium (10 mM magnesium concentration), and a low concentration of magnesium concentration (1 nM magnesium concentration).  Our initial hypothesis of a direct relationship between % change and increased concentration was not supported by the experiment, and no trend was found in data. 


Introduction:
All organisms need energy, and plants obtain this energy by capturing the sun’s rays and converting them into chemical energy in a process known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is one of the most important metabolic process carried out by organisms [Johnson: 2017], and during the process, energy is converted from sunlight into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, an energy currency that the organism can use for various processes. Photosynthesis is a 3-step process, where the first two steps of the reaction are light-dependent, and the third step is light-independent. During the light-independent reactions, magnesium plays a role in the oxidation-reduction. [Levitt: 1954]. Magnesium is a chemical element in the periodic table that is a shiny gray solid. Magnesium is integral in photosynthetic processes. Without magnesium, chlorophyll would not be able to capture the sun’s energy needed for the processes to occur. Magnesium is located in enzymes like Ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, commonly known as RuBisCO. RuBisCO is an enzyme involved in carbon fixation, which converts carbon dioxide into energy-rich molecules. [Patterson: 2012]. Not only is it involved in carbon fixation, but magnesium is also bound as the central atom of the porphyrin ring in chlorophyll [Sircus: 2009]. Because magnesium is utilized in photosynthesis, varying amounts of it will potentially alter rate of activity. Additionally, when magnesium is deficit, plants begin to die. 
It was hypothesized that an increased amount of magnesium would increase photosynthetic rate, thus altering absorbance to be higher and creating a higher percent change. We postulated that a direct relationship would be seen between concentration of MgSO4 (high, medium, or low), and percent change.  


Materials and Method:
The lab began with grinding Spinacia oleraca using a mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of 400 nM sucrose in Tricine, a grinding buffer. The spinach was ground until it was a paste. An additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added, and the mixture was strained through 3 layers of cheesecloth. The liquid was then transferred into a microtube to be centrifuged. The liquid was spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The centrifuge process was completed a total of 3 times to suspend the pellet. The supernatant was removed from the tube each time. The following tubes were created, and we completed the experiment using triplicates. (Refer to Table 1 to see reaction tubes created).
The spectrometer cuvettes were labeled and mixtures were transferred into cuvettes, for a total of 13 cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was immediately blanked using the Blank. Absorbance was measured for all of the samples at 600 nm.  Absorbance was recorded at four separate times: at time zero, after 10 minutes, after 20 minutes, and after 30 minutes. Percent change was calculated after the 30 minutes passed. A one-way ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis. The ANOVA test was used to determine whether there was any statistical significent difference between the groups. 



Results:
Refer to Figure 2 for statistical analysis. It was observed in the experiment, from the one-way ANOVA test, that our results were insignificent. We saw no significance if any of the relationships. This could be the result because of the small sample size of three that we used for each category. It could also be the case if the concentration difference wasn’t large enough to make a large enough difference. We were expecting to see a direct relationship between concentration and % change. The groups were compared on themselves, as evident in the figure. Each group was tested with each other test group. With a P-value of 0.19, the results were far from significent.  As you can see in Figure 3, no trend was noted with the different concentrations, and the error bars are large. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not match our initial hypothesis of a direct relationship, nor did they show a trend. It has been confirmed in many scientific experiments that magnesium has an influence on photosynthesis. Additionally, magnesium deficiency can also have significent effects on photosynthesis. When magnesium is deficient in sunflowers for example, [Farhat : 2016] that other ions like Calcium and Potassium are in excess. This does not help the photosynthetic processes, and the lower amount of magnesium can affect many other parts of the plant, including the roots and shoots. Additionally, magnesium depletion results in photosynthetic inhibitions, carbohydrate accumulation in source leaves, and root growth reduction. [Marschner: 1994]. By these sources, it is evident that a lack of magnesium has major effects on photosynthesis, as well as overall plant health. Therefore, we assumed that additional magnesium would ensure that magnesium did its job probably within the system and that an access could help promote photosynthetic activity. Since we saw no trend at all, we recognize that more testing should be done on this subject. Not only could this experiment be done with a much larger sample size, but could also be done with more drastic changes in magnesium concentration. The same experiment could also be done on more than plants. Since we only tested on spinach, it is hard to generalize for all plants that go through photosynthesis. 
	This experiment is important in terms of the agricultural industry. Many farmers rely on soil being rich in the nutrients plants need to survive and grow. Depletion of magnesium can have major effects on plant development and could potentially lead to plant death. Since magnesium is the powerhouse behind photosynthesis, obtaining magnesium is an important part of plant growth. Additional magnesium in the soil could potentially help with the uptake of sun energy and the conversion to cellular energy.
