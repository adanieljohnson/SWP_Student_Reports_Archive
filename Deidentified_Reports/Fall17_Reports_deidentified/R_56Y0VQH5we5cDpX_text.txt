Title: Increasing Light Intensity Increases the Growth of Vigna Radiata and their Root to Shoot Ratios

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the process organisms use to grow, survive, and reproduce efficiently throughout their lifetimes. For plants, allocation goes towards their roots or shoots, and allocation is often affected by light, soil nutrients, and other above-the-ground nutrients. The effect of three different light intensities, 0%, 50%, and 100%, was studied as applied to the growth of vigna radiata. After two weeks of growth in their respective light intensities, it was determined that increased light intensity contributed to a higher root-to-shoot mass and length ratios, supporting the hypothesis that increased light intensities would contribute to an increased root-to-shoot ratio. This suggests that when increasing resources either above-the-ground or below-the-ground, resource allocation will work to invest its resources in the area of the plant in the least resource present environment.

Introduction:
Resource allocation is the mechanism used by organisms to establish how their internal resources will be put to use in terms of growth, survival, and reproduction. With respect to plants, each plant allocating resources towards growth will allocate towards their roots or shoot, two parts of the plant that grow in different environments, therefore providing access to different resources necessary to the plant’s survival [Johnson: 2017].  Typically, a plant growing in full sunlight will invest its resources in strong roots, for the excess sunlight indicates that the plant does not need to grow a long shoot to access the sunlight, but perhaps needs longer roots to reach below the ground resources. Similarly, plants growing in dark or shady climates invest more resources towards longer shoots, for the increased moisture and nutrients below the ground make longer roots unnecessary, but a longer shoot may be needed in order to grow long enough to access the resources that come from sunlight [Johnson: 2017]. 

Previous scientific experiments show a positive correlation between light and plant growth. A recent study of the effects of shade on grass weeds shows that increasing the degree of shade consequently decreased the length, flowering, number of leaves, and overall plant growth due to the increasing lack of available sunlight [Muhammad: 2017]. This goes to show that larger amounts of sunlight are crucial to successful plant growth. Additionally, in a study performed by the Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science, increasing the concentration of nitrogen in the soil consequently decreases the root-to-shoot ratio of spruce seedlings, primarily because above-the-ground resources grow more due to a lack of nutrients, and grow longer than the roots [Eckhart: 2000].

This experiment investigates how manipulating sunlight influences root-to-shoot ratios. The experiment will test how 0% light and 50% light conditions affect the germination, growth, and root-to-shoot ratios of mung beans (Vigna radiata) in comparison to mung beans growing in 100% greenhouse sunlight. Each variable light intensity should yield a different root-to-shoot ratio that will explain how resource allocation worked in each environment. In addition, mung beans were chosen due to their rapid growth rate [Lorensen: 1981].  

Given what is known about resource allocation and how it worked for alfalfa plants, if the root-to-shoot ratios of mung beans growing in full sunlight have a higher root-to-shoot ratio than those of the 0% and 50% light conditions, it can be determined that as sunlight increases, so does root growth.

Materials and Methods:
Three large trays were amassed and labeled either 0% light, 50% light, or 100% light. Nine smaller pots, or replicates, were filled to the brim with soil and fifteen mung bean seeds were added and dispersed throughout the soil of each pot. The nine pots were divided among and placed inside the three large trays. Once assembly was completed, the 0% light tray was placed into a dark cabinet in the lab room, the 50% light tray was placed under a dark, semi-transparent screen in the greenhouse, and the 100% light tray was placed in the greenhouse under full sunlight conditions. Every day, a group member watered all nine pots, filling up a watering can fully and equally dividing the water among each pot. This process repeated every day for two weeks. 

After allowing the mung beans to grow for two weeks, the number of leaves on each mung bean plant was recorded in addition to noting the general color of the plant and the number of plants that germinated out of the fifteen seeds that were planted. In order to record root and shoot masses and lengths, the soil and plants were removed and placed into a bucket of water to help separate the soil from the roots of each plant. It is important to keep the plants from each pot remain grouped together within their replicate for further measurements when separating the plants from the soil. 

After washing each individual mung bean plant, the length of each whole plant was recorded in addition to the mass of all the plants in a pot. Then the length of each plant’s root was recorded in addition to the mass of all the roots in a pot once the roots were separated from the shoots. 

Using the collected root and shoot data, averages and standard deviations were determined for the mass and length root-to-shoot ratios of each light intensity. In addition, a two-tail t-test was performed to compare the 0% and 100% light intensity groups, and p-values were calculated in order to determine if the collected data was statistically significant.

It is important to note that while recording the length and mass data, all replicates for 0% light and 100% light intensities were recorded separately, then averaged down to one single mean value for each intensity. However, while recording the length and mass data of the 50% light intensity mung beans, instead of recording the data of each replicate separately and then averaging the three replicate values down to one, all three replicates were combined into one large group with one single mean value. Because of this, for the 50% light intensity data, there is no standard deviation because instead of three replicates that can be compared, there is only one large replicate that cannot be compared to anything.

Results:
The root to shoot mass and length ratios of the mung beans did increase as light intensity increased, as expressed in Figure 1 and Figure 2. 

After performing a two-tailed t-test comparing the replicate data of the 0% and 100% mass and length ratios, it was confirmed that the data were statistically significant.  The mass ratios had a p-value of 0.002, t-value of 6.97, and a degree of freedom of 4 for mass ratios, and the length ratios had a p-value of 0.004, t-value of 5.67, and a degree of freedom of 4. 

In addition, as light intensity increased, so did the average germination rate of each replicate, as shown in Figure 3.  Lastly, as light intensity increased, so did the pigmentation of the mung bean plants. The mung beans grown in 50% and 100% light conditions were a healthy shade of green, while the mung beans grown in darkness were a sickly, white-yellow tone. 


Discussion:
 The experiment went as expected. The experimental results supported the hypothesis that increasing light intensity would subsequently increase root-to-shoot ratios among the mung bean plants. In addition, the data reject the null hypothesis and confirm that the data was not achieved by chance and is actually different.

Due to the excess above-the-ground resources, or sunlight, each mung bean plant could instead allocate its resources towards longer and more massive roots in order to access below-the-ground resources that were lacking. In terms of common plant growth, this goes to show that wherever resources are plentiful, either in above-the-ground or below-the-ground environment, the counterpart will flourish in length and mass in order to attempt to make up for the lack of resources in that environment.

Similar results have been obtained through other scientific studies and support our conclusion. In a study by the Department of Forestry and Agricultural Experiments, when testing the effect of shading on a cluster of oak trees, while the root-to-shoot ratios had delayed noticeable differences among the conditions, the trees grown in the shade exhibited lower overall growth while the trees grown in sunlight grew taller and more massive [Gottschalk: 1985]. In addition, an Annals of Biology experiment that tests ryegrass growth in dark and light conditions also determined that higher light intensities contribute to higher root-to-shoot ratios than their counterparts grown in darkness, which exhibited less growth overall. [Burnett: 1973].
In relation to mung bean germination and color, these data show that light is crucial to successful and healthy plant growth, since the germination rate increased as light intensity increased. In addition, the yellow color of the mung beans grown in darkness can be attributed to the fact that if a plant cannot perform photosynthesis, it cannot produce chlorophyll, which is responsible for the green color of many plants [Big: 1943].

Additionally, while this experiment shows that increased sunlight will improve the growth and overall health of mung beans, the next step could be to identify at which point increasing sunlight intensity would begin deterring the growth of the mung beans. A follow-up experiment could be carried out by testing multiple variables, not solely sunlight. Excess water and soil nutrients could be tested as well. Many experiments strive to identify the most optimal environments for plant growth, therefore it could be interesting to investigate at what point resources that make plant growth optimal begin to harm the plant’s success.

In conclusion, experimenting with light intensities contributes to a larger understanding of why sunlight is so crucial. Being surrounded by plant biodiversity on an everyday basis, if there was a terrestrial shift in climate that would decrease the sun’s light intensity on Earth, plant growth could be severely damaged and pose a gradual yet serious threat to global health. For example, the build up of carbon emissions and pollutants in the atmosphere could contribute to a gradual decrease in the light intensity available to plants, consequently bringing about a decrease in plant growth and function. Since plants produce oxygen, decreasing sunlight could gradually affect a plant’s ability to produce oxygen, which could decrease the health of further biodiversity.
