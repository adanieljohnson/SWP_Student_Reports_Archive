Title: Higher Aggressiveness Level of Betta Splendins while Competing with Competitor with Large Body Size

Abstract:
In this experiment, we want to understand what determines the aggressive level of male betta splendins. According to the previous study, we’ve already known that the magnitude of the competition of other fish species is related to phenotypic traits, such as the sizes of competitors and behavioral interactions between them [Nakayama: 2010]. Our hypothesis is male betta splendins would show a higher level of aggressive while facing competitors with a large body size. Betta splendins would show two kinds of aggressive behaviors under competition: broadside movement and facing movement. Today, we would qualify the aggressiveness level of betta splendins by measuring the time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” while facing large competitor with the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” while facing small competitor. Our result shows the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” while facing large competitor is longer than facing small competitor. This result supports our hypothesis. 


Introduction:
This experiment studies the aggressive behavior of betta splendins under intra-species competition. We want to understand what determines the aggressive level of male Betta Splendins. We want to know how their aggressiveness changes as on their competitors’ body size vary. Betta splendins are also known as Siamese fighting fish. They are common aquarium fishes which are originated in southeast Asia. Male Betta splendins would present aggressive behavior under competition with other each other. Intra-species competition of betta splendins would result in two kinds of aggressive behaviors: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movement includes pelvic flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. These three patterns are in order of aggressiveness. There are also kinds of three facing movements, again in increasing aggressiveness. Among them, the most aggressive one is creating a red “mane”. A male Betta splenden would protrude its branchiostegal membranes which are located underneath the opercula [Johnson: 2016]. Comparing with other species, betta splendins would show obvious aggressive behaviors which are easier to qualify. In this experiment, red “mane” behavior is what we use to evaluate the aggressive level of betta splendins. According to the previous study, we’ve already known that the magnitude of the competition of other fish species is related to phenotypic traits, such as the sizes of competitors and behavioral interactions between them [Nakayama: 2010]. Betta splendins would also perform the different level of aggressive behavior facing different competitors. There are many factors that might influence their behaviors, such as color, local biomass and body size. In this experiment, we would qualify how the body size of competitor would influence the aggressiveness of male betta splendins. Our hypothesis is male betta splendins would show a higher level of aggressive while facing competitors with a large body size. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we want to qualify how a male betta splenden would present different level of aggressive behavior while facing competitors with different body size. We selected six medium-sized betta splendins as the subjects. We would observe and qualify the aggressive behavior of these subjects. In additional to the subjects, we selected one small male betta splendins and one big betta splendins. The big splenden is approximately two times the body size of the small betta splenden. The big betta splenden is slightly bigger than the subjects. The small betta splenden is a lot smaller than the subjects. We first put one subject with the big competitor in one tank and separate them with a glass for 5 minutes. During this 5 minutes, we recorded the time interval of the subject when it shows red “mane”. The longer the time interval is, the higher the aggressive level is. After 5 minutes rest, we put the subject with the small competitor for 5 minutes. We repeat this process with six subjects. We made sure there was always a five-minute break between two groups. We used the t_test to evaluate how the subjects behaved differently while facing the small competitor and the big competitor. We used one-tailed t_test because this is a two-sample t_test. If the resulting p_value is smaller than 0.05, there is a significent difference between subjects’ aggressiveness while facing competitors with different body size. If the p_value is greater than 0.05, we can’t decide the aggressiveness of the subjects is related to the body size of competitors. If the p_value is smaller than 0.05, we would take a look at the bar chart showing the time interval of the subjects when they show red “mane” behavior. We would compare the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” while facing a large competitor with the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” while facing small competitor. We would use the average of the time interval in this statistic test. 


Results:
The time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior is recorded to qualify the aggressiveness of male betta splendins. Among the six subjects, subject 1 and subject 3 barely response to either large competitor or small competitor. Thus, we neglect these two groups of data for statistic test. We did the t_test to the time interval of the subjects of showing red “mane” while facing small competitor and the big competitor. The resulting p_value is 0.04975, which is smaller than 0.05. That indicates there is a significent difference between the time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior while facing large competitor and small competitor. The difference is shown in figure 1. According to figure 1, the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior while facing large competitor is longer than the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior while facing small competitor. That means male betta splendins would show a higher level of aggressiveness while facing large competitors than facing small competitors. 


Discussion:
Basing on the result of this experiment, the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior while facing large competitor is longer than the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior while facing small competitor. As the time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior indicates the aggressiveness of beta splendins, the result of this experiment supports our hypothesis that male betta splendins would show a higher level of aggressive while facing competitors with a large body size. That is because a competitor with large body size is a bigger threat to male betta splendins than competitors with small body size because a betta splenden with large body size would do better in attracting females [Clotfelt: 2006]. However, body size is not the only phenotypic traits that would decide the aggressiveness level of betta splendins [Nakayama: 2010]. A future experiment needs to be done to evaluate how the color would decide the aggressiveness level of betta splendins.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This figure shows the average time interval of subject male betta splendins showing red mane behavior. This figure shows the average time interval of 4 subjects. The average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior while facing large competitor is longer than the average time interval of the subjects showing red “mane” behavior while facing small competitor.
