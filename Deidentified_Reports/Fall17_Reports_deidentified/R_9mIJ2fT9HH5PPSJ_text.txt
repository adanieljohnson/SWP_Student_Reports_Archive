Title: The Effect of Carbonation on Metabolic Rate

Abstract:
Procambris sp. specimens were tested in this lab to observe the effects of water carbonation on metabolic rate. Oxygen consumption over the course of 20 minutes was measured and recorded in both regular and carbonated water, and these results were used to calculate specific metabolic rate of each crayfish tested. The SMR values when compared did not show a clear trend; it was hypothesized that the SMRs of the crayfish would increase in carbonated water, as they would have to expend more energy (which is directly proportional to oxygen consumption) to obtain oxygen from the polluted water. The first test subject did follow this trend, but the other two did not. A paired t_test confirmed with a p value of 0.549 that the results of the experiment were not statistically significent. 


Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to observe the changes in metabolic rate of crayfish between regular and carbonated water at room temperature. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to metabolic rate1, allowing for the conversion of consumption value to specific metabolic rate. Crayfish live in fresh water environments and are extremely susceptible to pollution2; it has a drastic negative effect on the growth and bodily functions on the organisms, particularly pollution that causes a decrease in the pH of the surrounding water. CO2 when it is dissolved in water produces carbonic acid, a decently strong acid that would bring the pH of the environment lower than the normal, tolerable pH that the crayfish thrive in. The organisms would have to exert more energy in obtaining oxygen to supply their normal functions, thereby increasing the specific metabolic rate. It more strenuous for the crayfish to obtain the same levels of oxygen, and this is represented in a higher oxygen consumption level. By placing the crayfish tested in this experiment in carbonated and therefore more acidic water, it is hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. subjects will be higher than in the normal water. 


Materials and Method:
Three medium to large specimen of Procambris sp. are placed in holding chambers of regular water. A testing chamber consisting of a large mason jar and an oxygen probe is filled with filtered, room temperature water to the point where it is slightly overflowing. A crayfish is placed in this chamber, and the top is securely screwed on without allowing air into the jar. The chamber is then placed into a bucket of room temperature water up to the neck. The oxygen probe is connected to a dissolved oxygen instrument, and the oxygen consumption level is recorded every 5 minutes for up to 20 minutes. Once this time has elapsed, the water from the chamber is poured out into a graduated cylinder to obtain its exact volume. If possible, the crayfish is kept inside the chamber using a net.
	100 Ml of room temperature carbonated water from a can is poured into the chamber, and the remaining 900 Ml is filled with regular filtered water. The same process is carried out again in the carbonated water, with the oxygen consumption recorded every five minutes up to 20 minutes and the volume of the water in the chamber measured in a graduated cylinder. After the completion of this second step, the crayfish is returned to its holding chamber. This entire process is repeated three times, each with a different crayfish. 
	


Results:
The specimen weights, O2 changes in water, volume of water in chamber, and time elapsed in experiment were recorded and utilized to calculate the specific metabolic rates of each crayfish.
The SMR for specimen one in regular water was 0.0015, which was compared to the SMR in carbonated water, 0.0023. This increase was expected and hypothesized before the experiment was conducted. The other two specimens produced more questionable results. The SMR for specimen two in regular water was 0.0013 and 0.0024 for specimen three. The rate significently dropped to 0.0006 in carbonated water for specimen two and 0.0008 for specimen three, the opposite trend than what was previously expected. 

A paired t_test was conducted to verify the correlation of the results. The p_value came out to be 0.549, which indicates that the results had no clear correlation or significance. 


Discussion:
Upon analyzing the results of the experiment, conflicting data in support of and against the proposed alternate hypothesis was found. The first specimen experienced a rise in specific metabolic rate when placed in the carbonated water, which is in support of the alternate hypothesis. In a test on freshwater prawns, a species similar in structure and function of the crayfish studied, test subjects placed in water adjusted with lower pH experienced impaired function in feeding, growth, and activity3. This experiment found that the metabolic rate of the prawns increased, and it was hypothesized in this study that this result was due to difficulty of absorbing oxygen from the acidic water, causing greater energy expenditure. The SMR for these organisms increased, as their oxygen consumption and energy used increased. This was the result expected from all three specimens tested in the carbonation and regular water. 
In contrast with the first crayfish, specimens two and three showed a drop in metabolic rate compared to their performance in the regular water. Their oxygen consumption decreased in the carbonated, more acidic and polluted water, which contradicted the hypothesis that they would expend more energy to compensate for the water quality. This outcome may have been the result of multiple errors. The amount of carbonated water poured into the test chamber may have been too high, and this could have caused a shock to the system of the animal or could have driven specimens two and three to exhaustion trying to keep up and increase their SMR. In a future study, the number of crayfish used in the experiment should be significently increased, as there was so much variation in the results of this experiment. More test subjects would have provided more data to view a trend, and would reduce speculation into personal error that could have occurred during the lab.
