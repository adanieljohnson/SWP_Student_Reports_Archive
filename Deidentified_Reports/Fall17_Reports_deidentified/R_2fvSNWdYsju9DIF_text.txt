Title: The Effects of Temperature Shift on the Rate of Photosynthesis of Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
Plants exhibit a variety of physiological responses to various environmental stresses. Information about a plant’s responses to stress can elucidate the mechanisms which it is protecting. This experiment studied the effects of temperature extremes on spinach (Spinacia oleraca) chloroplasts. We used an artificial electron acceptor for the hill reaction that changes color when oxidized and monitored photosynthetic activity with a spectrophotometer. Three groups were tested at temperatures 0ºC, 25ºC, and 35ºC for 30 minutes, after which the average percent change in photosynthetic activity was calculated. We predicted that the 25ºC group would have significently higher photosynthetic activity because it has been shown heat stress and chilling can both induce photosynthetic inhibition in spinach chloroplasts by way of interacting with the protein complex photosystem II. The 25ºC group had significently higher photosynthetic activity than the 0ºC group as well as the 35ºC group. Our findings show that the ideal temperature for photosynthesis is around 25ºC, and that temperature related inhibition can occur in photosystem II at extreme temperatures. 


Introduction:
All plants rely on photosynthesis to produce the sugars necessary to support metabolism. A key step at the beginning of photosynthesis is the evolution of oxygen from water, which also supplies a high-energy electron for the electron transport chain (ETC). This evolution of oxygen occurs within photosystem II (PS II), a protein complex found in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. [Gregor: 2005] This evolution of oxygen is part of the more general Hill reaction in which an electron acceptor is reduced, typically NADP+.  Proper function of the electron transport chain and PS II is critical in plant photosynthesis. If a plant cannot evolve oxygen, it cannot provide the electron transport chain with electrons, or oxygen, a terminal electron acceptor. Previous studies have shown that the 33 kDa manganese-stabilizing protein, located in the membrane of PS II, is critical for the evolution of oxygen at the start of the ETC. [Gregor: 2005] In vitro tests on spinach chloroplasts have found that heat stressed (25-50ºC) PSII membrane fragments will release the 33 kDa manganese-stabilizing protein, which then loses its manganese ion. [Yamane: 1998] After this protein is lost from the membrane, PS II can no longer evolve oxygen and the ETC and photosynthesis halt. 
It has been shown that heat stress can induce photosynthetic inhibition in spinach by causing light-harvesting system II within PSII to aggregate as a protective mechanism to help the plant dissipate excess excitation energy. [Tang: 2007] Additionally, research has found that photo-inhibition of spinach chloroplasts at chilling temperatures (1ºC) was fully reversible. [Somersalo: 1990] 
Considering these findings, we studied the effects on photosynthesis of spinach chloroplasts at 25ºC, as well as “chilling temperatures” (0ºC) and under “heat stress” (35ºC). Spinach was chosen for this experiment due to the ease of obtaining its chloroplasts and its relatively high chloroplast density. [Lilley: 1975; Steup: 1983] We indirectly measured the rate of photosynthesis using DCPIP, an artificial electron acceptor for the Hill reaction that absorbs light in the visible region when oxidized. We predicted that 25ºC would be the optimum temperature for photosynthesis, and the 25ºC have significently higher photosynthetic activity than the other groups. 


Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis, we used store-bought spinach (Spinacia oleraca) that was refrigerated until use. First, we isolated chloroplasts from the spinach leaves. After de-veining four medium sized spinach leaves, they were ground with a mortar and pestle in 10Ml of grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to a uniform consistency. 10 Ml of grinding buffer were added again, and the mixture was strained through 3 layers of cheese cloth into a 50-Ml centrifuge tube. The tube was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes (all centrifuging was kept at 4ºC). The resulting supernatant was transferred to another tube and centrifuged again at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant from the second tube was transferred to a third tube, and 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the second tube to suspend the chloroplast-rich pellet creating the “enriched chloroplast solution”. 
The chloroplast electron transport chain has been shown to pass electrons to compounds other than NADP+; so after isolating an enriched chloroplast solution, we tested photosynthetic activity indirectly by measuring the rate of the Hill reaction with an DCPIP, an artificial electron acceptor. [Dean: 2003] DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) is a highly-conjugated molecule, and when oxidized it absorbs light in the visible range around 600nm. After being reduced by electrons from the ETC, DCPIP is colorless. [Dean: 2003] This change in visible light absorbance allowed us to measure photosynthetic activity indirectly via the absorbance of light by the mixtures that contained DCPIP and the enriched chloroplast solution. 
We prepared a controlll with 8 Ml H2O, 100 µL enriched chloroplast solution and 9 tubes with 6 Ml H2O, 2 Ml reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), 2 Ml 130 mM DCPIP, and 100 µL enriched chloroplast solution. After shaking all tubes, contents were transferred to cuvettes labeled correspondingly. After blanking the spectrophotometer with the controlll at 546 nm, we recorded the absorbance of each of the other cuvettes. Three cuvettes were placed in a 0ºC ice bath, 3 in 25ºC room temperature air, and 3 in a hot water bath at 35ºC. All groups received 1300 lumens of light for 30 minutes. Absorbance was measured at time 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes. The percent change in photosynthetic activity for each cuvette was determined by the change in absorbance between time points t=0 and t=30 and was calculated according to the formula:
 % Change= (Absorbance at t=0 – Absorbance at t=30 minutes) ÷ Absorbance at t=30 minutes, where t=elapsed time from start of experiment (minutes)
The photosynthetic activity for each group was compared via a one-tailed, two-sample t_test assuming equal variances to determine significance of data. (α=0.05) 


Results:
The 25ºC group had significently higher photosynthetic activity than both the 0ºC and 35ºC groups (0ºC to 25ºC: t(4)=-2.54, p=0.032, 25ºC to 35ºC: t(3)=3.15, p=0.026). The 0ºC had non-significently higher photosynthetic activity than the 35ºC group (t(3)=1.52, p=0.112). Figure 1 represents the total average percent change in photosynthetic activity.


Discussion:
The data support our alternate hypothesis. Subjecting the chloroplasts to 0ºC and 35ºC both significently lowered the photosynthetic activity. This is similar to previous research that found that heat stress can induce photosynthetic inhibition in spinach by causing light-harvesting system II within PSII to aggregate as a protective mechanism to help the plant dissipate excess excitation energy. [Tang: 2007] The optimal temperature for spinach chloroplasts’ photosynthesis is around 25ºC. These findings support previous research showing that heat stress and chilling temperatures can both inhibit photosynthesis. [Tang: 2007; Gregor: 2005; Boese: 1990]
A possible source of error is that the 25ºC group likely was much colder than 25ºC at time 0. The enriched chloroplast solution came out of the centrifuge at 4ºC, and the rest of the components that went into the cuvettes were stored on ice. Additionally, the temperature of the lab in which this experiment was performed was 20ºC.This could be corrected by placing the 25ºC group in a water bath to ensure the proper temperature of the 25ºC group. Since water has a much higher heat capacity, it would ensure that the 25ºC group attained this temperature quickly. [Abdulagatov: 1998] 
	Somersalo and Krause (1990) found that the site of chilling-induced photosynthetic inhibition was PS II, and as mentioned previously, Yamange (1998) and Gregor (2005) both found that heat stress, defined as exposure of a spinach plant to 25-50ºC, caused photosynthetic inhibition in spinach related to the loss of proteins from the membrane of PS II. Tang et al. (2007) found that the rate of assimilation of CO2 of the spinach leaves was significently lower at temperatures higher than 35ºC. We predict that at chilling temperatures, the substrate-protein interactions are significently slowed, specifically in the 33 kDa manganese-stabilizing protein which is responsible for the evolution of molecular oxygen necessary for photosynthesis. [Gregor: 2005]
Photosynthesis begins with the evolution of oxygen from water, a step that occurs in PS II. [Gregor: 2005] If this step is inhibited in anyway, the result is either partial or total photosynthetic inhibition, and the plant is not able to perform photosynthesis. Our results show that there is an optimum temperature for photosynthesis, and that photosynthesis can be inhibited at temperatures extreme relative to the optimum temperature. These results suggest that at temperature extremes, a critical part of PSII is significently impaired either as a protective mechanism of plant, or damage. 
In future studies, we would like to study the reversibility of the temperature treatments performed in this experiment. If the plant can restore normal photosynthetic activity, then the inhibition is likely a protective mechanism and not damage.
