Title: Evaluating blue light as a way to increase Betta splendins aggressive behavior through a quantitative analysis

Abstract:
Betta fish (Betta splendins) are an extremely aggressive species of fish. They have a number of physiological responses towards other bettas, some of which being sporadic movements, gill flares, and increased brilliance of their coloring. We are interested in seeing if the color light, blue, affects the aggressiveness of the fish when exposed to a combatant. To quantify this aggressive behavior, we counted the number of gill flares and sporadic movements of three different test fish when in the presence of a controlll fish under both blue and white light. We had hypothesized that the blue light would make the fish act more aggressively than the white light, which was found to be incorrect. Observationally, we found that the fish had more sporadic movements under white light, yet the data collected was found to be statistically insignificent. Coloring of the light may not have a large effect on a fish’s aggression due to it not being an important stimulus for the hoped-for response. 


Introduction:
Betta splendins, Betta fish, are an extremely aggressive species of fish. This aggression may be due to male-male competition or the need to defend one’s territory (Eisenreich et al. 2017). When a betta fish exhibits aggressive behaviors toward another fish, their operculum, dorsal fins, and anal fins flare and the fish becomes more vibrantly colored. When a potential combatant exhibits aggressive behaviors, such as becoming vibrant colored, a fish’s frequency of aggressive behaviors is positively affected (McDonald et al. 2004). Betta fish are a prime example of agnostic fish due to their visible signs of hostility, like their coloring. These vibrant colors are a stimulus that influences the fish’s intensity of response. We extrapolated that this exposure to a colorful stimulus may lead to the same responses if it is light in general rather than just the coloring of the opponent fish. The betta fish in question have a brilliant blue when aggravated, thus we used blue light for our study. We hypothesis that if a betta fish is exposed to blue light while in visible proximity to another blue betta fish, their agnostic behavior will be intensified. This is due to the increased intensity of an aggression stimulus. 


Materials and Method:
We used four fish for this study. We recorded the behaviors of three different fish when exposed to the fourth, with and without blue light. Two fish were placed in a tank at a time with an opaque divider between them. After lifting the divided, leaving just the transparent glass separating the fish, we exposed them to white light. We recorded the number of gill flares and sporadic movements for five minutes, then reintroduced the nontransparent divider. After giving the fish five minutes to habituate, we removed the opaque divider again, this time introducing a light with a blue film over it. We recorded the number of gill flares and sporadic movements again, subsequently giving the controlll fish a few minutes of rest while switching out the test fish. This process was repeated with three different test fish. From the data collected, we performed a two tailed T test and found the degrees of freedom, P-value, and T-value. 


Results:
Generally, we found that Betta fish had more sporadic movements when exposed to white light rather than blue. The number of gill flares in white versus blue light showed no obvious trend. The mean number of sporadic movements in white light was 9.667 with a standard deviation of 5.033, while the mean for blue light was 6.667 with a standard deviation of 5.033. The degrees of freedom are four, T-value = 0.729996, and P-value = 0.505845. The mean number of gill flares under white light is 2.333 with a standard deviation of 2.082, whereas the mean under blue light is 1.667 with a standard deviation of 1.528. This had a DF = 4, T-value = 0.447214, and a P-value = 0.677869. Refer to graphs one and two to see the means and their standard deviations for both white and blue light. 


Discussion:
This data did not support our hypothesis either statistically nor observationally. We observed that there were more sporadic movements under white light, yet not enough to be statistically significent.  There was not obvious difference in number of gill flares for white versus blue light. P-values for both the number of sporadic movements and gill flares were greater than .05 (0.505845 and 0.677869), meaning there was no significent difference between white versus blue light. 

These results may be because the added blue light clouded the brilliance of the other blue betta that the fish was exposed to. The added light may have made the blue of the opposing fish less intense or noticeable to the test fish, likewise, decreasing their amount of aggressive behaviors to an observational level. Additionally, the difference in light color may have not played that drastic of a role on the aggression of the betta fish, making the light color not significent. 

The difference may have been found insignificent due to a possible error. When recording data, we crowded around the fish tank to count the gill flares and sporadic movements. It was found that a betta fish may alter their aggression due to external cues (Dzieweczynski et al. 2005). By potentially shaking the table the tank was on, making loud noises near the tank, and moving around outside of the tank we may have affected the behavior of the fish, altering our results in the process. 

Moving forward, one may try different color light films to confirm and expand upon our results. Betta fish can also be a brilliant red, like blue. Thus, someone may choose to use a red film, instead of blue, with red fish to see if there are similar findings. They could also want to use a red film with a blue fish or vice versa to see if there is less of an observed response due to the added light dulling the intensity of the fish’s coloring. 

This study, and future studies building on it, can be used to decrease or increase the aggressiveness of betta fish. Betta fish have been artificially changed over time to hold their brilliant colors even when not in an aggravated state. These findings could be used to determine other ways to change the intensity or characteristics of aggravation.
