Title: Betta splendens Aggression Towards Stimuli that Resembles Male Betta splendens Versus Stimuli of Non-Male Betta splendens

Abstract:
Betta splendens (Betta) have only a few ways to display their aggression. All male Betta fish display the same kind of aggressive actions to males of the same species. However, Betta’s respond differently to certain conditions and stimuli and may have the same or none of the same reactions to a different species. We predict that the male Betta fish will act more aggressively to a model fish with a normal color and shape. We also predict that the Betta will act less aggressively towards a fish model of a color that is not natural to a Betta and even less aggressively towards a model that is not a fish but that has a natural Betta color. We will test three male Betta fish against three different stimuli: a model red Betta fish, a black model Betta fish and a small blue foam square. Each fish will get five minutes with the stimuli and then we will score them based on our aggression scale. Our results supported our hypothesis. All tests were not significant and shape had a larger aggression mean score than color. The male Betta fish acted the most aggressively to a model fish with a natural Betta color and less aggressively towards the black model fish and the blue foam square.

Introduction:
Animals participate in aggressive behavior because it is the way in which they acquire and defend limited resources [Romano et al.: 2017]. Betta splendens (Betta), also known as the Siamese fighting fish display aggressive behaviors to fight off other males for both mates and food resources. Betta are a good reliable species that we can use to study behavior. When Betta fish are exposed to other Betta fish, intraspecific behaviors will be present [Johnson: 2016]. Betta males have very aggressive displays towards males of the same species [Romano et al.: 2017]. Male Betta fish show certain behaviors at certain levels of aggression. Betta’s respond differently to certain conditions and stimuli and may have the same or none of the same reactions to a different species [Johnson: 2016]. Betta fish, like any organism has to recognize the stimulus as either an intruder or prey and then successfully perform the task [Eisenreich, Szalda-Petree: 2015]. Dummies and decoys have been used in ethology for a long time to study how animals display certain behaviors as a response to a proposed stimulus [Romano et al.: 2017]. We predict that the male Betta fish will act more aggressively to a model fish with a normal color and shape. We also predict that the Betta will act less aggressively towards a fish model of a color that is not natural to a Betta and even less aggressively towards a non-fish model in a natural Betta color.

Materials and Methods:
We did three tests to see how male Bettas responded to certain conditions and stimuli. We tested three male Betta fish against three different stimuli: a model red Betta fish, a black model Betta fish and a small blue foam square. The Betta fish had five minutes in the tank with the stimuli and then five minutes of rest. We created an aggression scale to score the fish during their five minutes with the stimuli in the tank. Broadside movements such as pelvic fin flickers, tail beating and tail flashing can be present to show aggression [Johnson:2016]. Betta fish also display facing movements such as erect pectoral fins, spread gill covers and red “manes” to show aggression [Johnson: 2016]. In the aggression scale we created, one point was awarded for pelvic fin flickers and facing the opponent with pectoral fins erect. Two points was given for tale beating and spreading its gill covers. Three points was for tail flashing and showing a red “mane.” The most points were given for displaying a red “mane” because it is a valid indicator that Betta fish are ready to fight [Verbeek et al.: 2007]. The red “mane” was also given the most points because it is the most honest sign of aggression because this display is costly to the fish because it limits its ability to extract oxygen from the water [Verbeek et al.: 2007]. We tallied the amount of times each of these aggressive behaviors were shown during the five-minute intervals. We then compared the experimental groups by using three two-sample one-tailed t-tests with Alpha, or the significance level of 0.05.

Results:
The mean of the aggression score of the control after the two-sample one-tailed t-test of control and shape is 20+/-7.07 (Figure 1). The mean of the aggression score for shape is 6 +/- 1.41 (Figure 1). The degree of freedom is 2 (Figure 1). The t-value is 2.75 (Figure 1). The P-value is 0.11 (Figure 1). The P-value is larger than Alpha so this test is not significant.  
The mean of the aggression score of the control after the two-sample one-tailed t-test of control and color is 20+/- 7.07 (Figure 2). The mean of the aggression scale for color is 2.5 +/- 3.54 (Figure 2). There are 2 degrees of freedom (Figure 2). The t-value is 3.13 (Figure 2). The P-value is 0.09 (Figure 2). The P-value is larger than Alpha so this test is not significant. 
The mean of the aggression score of shape after the two-sampled one-tailed t-test of shape is 6+/- 1.41 (Figure 3). The mean of the aggression score for color is 2.5+/-3.84 (Figure 3). There are 2 degrees of freedom (Figure 3). The t-value is 1.30 (Figure 3). The P-value is 0.32 (Figure 3). The P-value is larger than Alpha so this test is not significant. 
 The third fish was excluded from our results because it did not respond to any of the stimuli. The control had the largest mean values (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The aggression mean score of the control was larger than both color and shape (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Shape had a larger aggression mean score than color (Figure 3). All experimental tests were not significant (Figure 1, 2 and 3).


Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis. We predicted that the male Betta fish would act the most aggressively to a model fish with a normal fish color than to the other two stimuli. We also hypothesized that the male Betta fish would act less aggressively to a fish model of a color not natural of a Betta, such as the black model fish. We also see our prediction supported in the last test in that the Betta fish acted the least aggressively to the blue foam square. The male Betta acted the most aggressive towards the red model fish because it most resembled a live Betta fish because of both the color and shape. Our results show us that Bettas act more aggressively when exposed to stimuli of the right shape (Figure 3). As seen in a study by Verbeek, the fighting fish that he tested responded significantly more aggressively to a video of an aggressive male than to a video without a male in it [Verbeek et al.: 2007]. Verbeek’s study supports our experiment in that male Bettas acted the most aggressively to a model or image of another aggressive male fish more than the Betta fish reacted to an object that does not represent an aggressive male. In our experiment and in Verbeek’s experiment, the male fish acted aggressively towards a model of another male Betta because the male thought it needed to fight the fake male for females. In Romano’s study, he also shows us that fish replica shape is necessary for Betta fish to respond with significant aggressive responses [Romano et al.: 2017]. Romano’s study supports our data that shape is the most important factor in Bettas responding to stimuli.  Romano’s study supports all of our tests of aggression of the male Betta with the red fish model and the black model. The reason that the Betta responded somewhere in between to the black model fish is because it was still the right shape of a male Betta but not the right color. According to our tests, shape has a larger mean than color which means that shape is more important with stimulus recognition than color (Figure 1 and 2). The Betta was responsive but not super responsive to the black fish model because the male Betta knew that this black model could be a threat but most likely was not. Romano explains that Betta fish alter their aggressive level of fighting based on perceived stimuli, from the fish replica, and then determine whether the model fish is a potential opponent or not [Romano et al.: 2017].  The Betta did not see a threat from the blue foam square so it did not feel the need to respond to the stimuli with any type of aggressiveness. In our experiment, we see that shape is very important in Betta aggression because the mean value of shape is larger than color (Figure 1 and 2). As Romano explains in his test, decoys or dummies, like the model fishes and blue foam square that we used, do not deliver many cues to the Betta fish and results in usually weak or partial responses from the test subject [Romano et al.: 2017]. One of the errors is that the Betta fish kept seeing himself in the glass and would get distracted by himself, and this resulted in the fish paying more attention to himself than the stimuli.  Another way to test male Betta aggressiveness would to do the same test but then use a camera and record the male Betta fish to better measure their aggression [Verbeek et al.: 2007].  Also, instead of using models that don’t move, we could repeat our test and use a robotic Betta fish to better measure aggression [Romano et al.: 2017]. Through aggression behavior tests like ours, ethologists can try to make sense of why animals behave the way they do. Our experiment helped to explain intraspecific competition and how animals act when they must compete for limited resources. Animals participate in aggressive behavior because it is the way in which they acquire and defend limited resources [Romano et al.: 2017]. Male Betta fish have varying levels of aggression depending on who or what they have to fight for food, mates or other valuable resources. Animals have been participating in aggressive behavior forever and have thus created stable strategies for conflicts between species over time through evolution [Romano et al.: 2017]. Male Bettas have been displaying the different levels of aggression over time and have evolved to best warn and fight off potential threats so they can reproduce. Our experiment shows that that if there was a real threat the male Betta fish would be able to respond and try to defend his resources.
