Title: Shorter Rest Periods Increase Intraspecific Agonistic Behavior in Betta Splendens 

Abstract:
Agonistic behavior is characterized as fighting behaviors used by many species in order to compete within or amongst other species for resources, territory, or mates. There are many forms of agonistic behavior that range from threatening to physical aggression. Lack of habituation and increased stress can increase agonistic behavior. Betta fish (Betta splendens), also known as Siamese fighting fish, are particularly known for their aggressive behavior between males- intraspecific agonistic behavior.  In this experiment, we introduced two male betta fish to one another with a glass barrier between them to prevent injury in order to analyze if increased or decreased resting periods between interactions raise or lower aggressive behavior, quantified by the number of times either fish struck the glass barrier.  We hypothesized that the fish would display higher levels of aggression when exposed to one another after shorter rest periods. When we ran the linear regression against the collected data, we found a negative correlation (-4.5) between rest periods and the number of times the fish hit the glass. The r^2 value of 0.3352 demonstrated a roughly linear relationship between rest periods and aggression, helping to support the hypothesis. 


Introduction:
Animal behavior helps scientists analyze species’ behavior, their ecology, and relatedness toward each other. Male betta fish (Betta splendens) are characterized by their intraspecific agonistic behavior, defined as male-male aggression within the same species. Intraspecific behavior is beneficial to the Betta splendens in that it can help males obtain a mate and therefore pass on his genes to future generations. However, such behavior can be dangerous, and more aggressive, physical altercations can result in severe injury or death. Studies have tested different influences on such aggression, including one that found that male Betta splendens display more aggressive behavior when exposed to mirrors, even when in the tank without another male Betta splendens [Dore, Ducharme, Lefebvre : 1978].  Another study found a relationship between habituation and the decreased intraspecific agonistic behavior between Betta splendens [Figler, Klein, Peeke : 1978]. The purpose of this experiment was to test whether or not longer or shorter rest periods between male-male interactions increases the rapidness of agonistic behavior. We predicted that shorter resting periods (in this experiment, 1 and 3 minute rest periods) increase male-male agonistic behavior. 


Materials and Methods:
Two male Betta splendens were exposed to each other with a glass barrier to prevent physical injury. The number of times the fish aggressively behaved, quantified by the number of times either struck the dividing glass, was recorded. Each exposure, no matter the rest period time, lasted for one minute. There was then a rest period of one minute of complete isolation before the fish were reintroduced. This process was repeated for increasing rest periods of 3 and 5 minutes. A linear regression of the data was run to test the correlation between time and aggression, in addition to calculated averages and standard deviations. 


Results:
The average number of physical strikes for the rest periods of 5, 3, and 1 minutes were, respectively, 35.333, 45.333, and 53.333 strikes, +/- 1 standard deviation. (Fig 1). There was a negative correlation between the data, valued at -4.5. The r^2 value of 0.3352, meaning that the resting periods accounted for roughly 33% of aggressive variants, coupled with the averages and regression line, is enough data to demonstrate a roughly linear relationship between male Betta splendens aggression and resting period.It also supported the hypothesis that shorter rest periods increase aggression.  The p-value between resting periods was 0.102. 


Discussion:
Our results, including the -4.5 correlation and r^2 value of 0.3352, were significant enough to support our hypothesis that shorter resting periods between male-male Betta splendens exposure increase intraspecific agonistic behavior.  This relationship could be due to the fish’s lack of habituation and higher stress when given shorter resting periods between male-male exposure. Habituation to certain exposure, even to other fish of the same species, can help reduce aggression, but a lack of habituation will quickly irritate the fish and provoke intraspecific agonistic behavior [Figler, Klein, Peeke : 1978]. Similarly, less time to habituate to one another can lead to higher stress levels in the fish and again provoke aggression [Bronstein : 1984]. Future studies regarding Betta splendens and interspecific agonistic behavior could include more fish samples and even more resting periods to better statistically show a strong relationship between quantified aggression and resting periods.  It would also be very interesting to run a study of male-male Betta splendens aggression when the male fish are exposed to a female Betta splendens. One study did not find an increased pattern of agonistic aggression when male Betta splendens were exposed to females [Bronstein : 1984] , but it would be interesting to analyze such interactions when resting periods are increased or decreased.
