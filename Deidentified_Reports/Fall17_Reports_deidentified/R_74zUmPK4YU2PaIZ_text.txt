Title: Comparing Root:Shoot Ratio in Vigna radiata Exposed to Colored vs. Natural Light

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the color of light changes the resource allocation of mung bean plants. It was hypothesized that the plants under green light would have different root:shoot ratios because green light has different wavelengths than sunlight, and that energy will be different and therefore the allocation of that energy will turn into different root:shoot ratios.  


Introduction:
Light exists on a spectrum, and the color of light affects its absorption. We are attempting to research the way that plants respond to light, and how the color of the light affects the way they allocate resources (Lab Manual). Because of the ways plants respond to light and their production of chlorophyll and the color of chlorophyll, green light may have specific effects on the growth of plants, therefore affecting the root:shoot ratio. Green light is said to enhance chlorophyll production (Thiele). However, green light does not drastically affect the growth of plants like blue light does. Plants located in the understory as opposed to the canopy may have a greater difficulty absorbing green light, as the canopy affects the access to light provided to the understory. This experiment will investigate whether plants will allocate their resources differently when exposed to a different color of light. The biological null hypothesis is that both plants will have a similar root:shoot ratio of length and weight regardless of the light they are exposed to. The biological alternate hypothesis is that if plants are exposed to green light, they will have a smaller root:shoot ratio than a plant exposed to natural solar light. 
The statistical null hypothesis is that both plants will have a similar root:shoot ratio regardless of the light they are exposed to: H0 : Green Light R:S Ratio = Natural Light R:S ratio. The statistical alternate hypothesis is that the natural light root:shoot ratio will be greater than the green light root:shoot ratio: H1 : Green Light R:S Ratio < Natural Light R:S Ratio. Variables
	We will be manipulating the color of the light that the plant is exposed to. We will be then testing/measuring the root:shoot ratio for plants exposed to both colors of light. We will control for temperature, nutrients of soil, water, and amount of available light. 



Materials and Methods:
Materials	
Materials required for this lab are 6 black containers of mung bean plants, clear plastic film, green plastic film, larger plastic trays, and 8 sticks. 
Methods
Plant a handful of mung bean seeds into a plastic black container of vermiculite. Place 3 Mung bean plants in a larger tray. Place sticks in all four corners of the tray and tape them together at the top to for a pyramid. Wrap clear plastic film around the sticks and tape it down so that the entire tray is covered and no natural light can get it. Cut a flap in the film to allow for watering, but keep this covered at all other times.  Repeat two previous steps for the second set of mung bean plants, but use green plastic film this time. Place two trays of mung bean plants side by side in an indoor greenhouse so that the plants have the same access to sunlight. For two weeks, water plants until saturation at the same time every day. After two weeks of watering, remove the plants from the clear plastic tray. Place them individually in a bucket of water and separate out the shoots, making sure to keep the roots attached to each shoot as you separate between them. Choose ten shoots at random from each container, being sure to keep them separate. Dab each shoot dry with a paper towel. Weigh the entire shoot and record data. Take the length of the shoot in cm and record. Cut the roots off of each shoot, being sure to cut at the same place on each one. Weigh the roots. Measure length of the roots and record. Repeat for the two remaining trays of the natural light plants, and then repeat the procedure for all of the green light plants. Use a 2 sample T test to compare the root:shoot height ratio and the root:shoot weight ratio of the two groups in order to determine if the difference between the root:shoot height and weight ratios was statistically significant. 


Results:
The results of the experiment showed that the average R:S weight ratio for green light plants was 0.379, and the average for natural light plants was 0.390. 
After conducting the 2 sample T test, it was determined that the P value is 0.901, which means that there is a 90% chance that the differences between the green light and natural light were by chance. 
	The results of the experiment showed that the average R:S length ratio for green light plants was 0.328, and the average for natural light plants was 0.318. 
After conducting the 2 sample T test, it was determined that the P value is 0.780, so there is a 78 percent chance that the differences between the green light and the natural light. This P value is also very high and shows that the color of light did not have a statistically significant effect on the weight of the roots and shoots. 


Discussion:
Both P values were very high and they showed that the independent variable, or the color of light, did not significantly affect the length or weight of the mung bean plants. The graphs also show that the averages between the green light and natural light plants are very similar. This shows that the color of light does not change its resource allocation or affect the chlorophyll in the chloroplasts of plants. This is interesting because according to Wang, responses in plants to green light are typically low-light responses (Wang), which suggests that the green light would slightly change the resource allocation, but the experiment showed that there was no significant difference at all, which would mean that this article is false.
