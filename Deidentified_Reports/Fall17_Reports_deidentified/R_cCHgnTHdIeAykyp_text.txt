Title: Effects of salinity on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salinity on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. The hypothesis was that the specific metabolic rate would increase with salinization. Three different Procambarus sp were used, each its own control and experimental group. The subjects were first placed in jars filled with room temperature water and their oxygen consumption measured at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes. They were then removed and placed in jars filled with water, into which 100ml of 6.5% NaCl was added. Oxygen consumption measurements were taken at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes. The oxygen consumption is directly related to specific metabolic rate and was used to calculate the specific metabolic rate. The control and experimental specific metabolic rates were compared. For specimen one, the control specific metabolic rate was 0.00018 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.00057 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental. For the second specimen, the control specific metabolic rate was 0.00033 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.00031 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental. For the third specimen, the control specific metabolic rate was 0.00099 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.0017 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental. When comparing the three specimens together, the paired t-test 

Introduction:
This study examined the effects of salinity on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. The Procambarus genus includes many different species of crayfish, although the physiological mechanism involved in this study is the same throughout the genus. The Procambarus sp typically lives in fresh-water environments and gets its oxygen from diffusion across the two sets of gills on its cephalothorax. In aquatic animals, substances other than oxygen diffuse across the gills, and create imbalances in the internal fluid of the organism. The organism must then exert metabolic energy to excrete or conserve water and salts in a process called osmoregulation (Sedava: 2016). The Procambarus sp osmoregulates like most fresh water fish. Because the Procambarus sp lives in freshwater, its internal fluid has a higher osmolarity, or higher concentration of solutes including salt, making it hypertonic to its environment. Due to this, water moves osmotically from the water to the Procambarus sp and salts diffuse out of the Procambarus sp and into the water. To maintain water-balance, the Procambarus sp must keep salts in its internal fluids by actively transporting sodium and chloride ions into its internal fluid through pumps. This transportation requires energy in the form of ATP, therefore the Procambarus sp is constantly expending energy to maintain water-balance (Sedava: 2016). In a high enough concentration, the addition of NaCl to the surrounding water environment of the Procambarus sp will make the Procambarus sp hypotonic to its environment and salt will diffuse into its internal fluids. As a result, the Procambarus sp will have to actively transport the increased salt out of its internal fluid, expending energy. In a similar study using Procambarus clarkii, it was confirmed that increased salinity increased the energy expenditure, and thus the specific metabolic rate of the specimen (Feng: 2009). We hypothesize that the introduction of NaCl to the surrounding environment of the Procambarus sp will increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. 


Materials and Methods:
For this study, we used three separate specimens of Procambarus sp and each acted as its own control and experimental group. To measure the specific metabolic rate, this study used an apparatus that measured oxygen consumption, which directly proportional to specific metabolic rate. First, one Procambarus sp was weighed and then placed into a jar containing room temperature (22C) water. The jar was then placed in a bath of room temperature water and the apparatus used to measure oxygen consumption was placed in the jar and the jar sealed. Measurements of oxygen consumption were recorded at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes and then the jar was removed from the water bath. The jar was then emptied and the volume of water in the jar was measured and recorded. Next, the crayfish was placed in the same jar, this time with room temperature water that had been salinized with 100mL of 6.5% NaCl solute. The concentration of the salinized water varied per Procambarus sp and can be found in the results section. The oxygen consumption apparatus was then placed into the jar and the jar sealed. Measurements of oxygen consumption were recorded at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes and then the jar was removed from the water bath. The jar was then emptied and the volume of the salinized water was measured and recorded. This same procedure, beginning with the placement of the Procambarus sp in the jar, was repeated for the remaining two specimens. The collected data was then used to calculate the specific metabolic rate for each control and experimental using the following equation - [O2 (mg/L) x volume H2O (L)] / [Time (min.) x weight (g)]. A paired t-test was run on the data to determine statistical significance. 





Results:
The average specific metabolic rate for the control was 0.0005 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.00086 mg O2*g-1*min-1 of the experimental group. The standard deviation for the control group was 0.00043, and 0.00074 for the experimental group. The paired t-test yielded a value of p = 0.230. 


Discussion:
After conducting the physical section of the study and analyzing the results, our hypothesis was rejected; the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp did not increase with the addition of NaCl to the surrounding water. The average specific metabolic rate of the control group was a little more than that of the experimental group. However, the paired t-test yielded a value of 0.230, which is not statically significant. The standard deviations for both the control and experimental groups show a large deviance within each testing group. In fact, the standard deviations were not far from the actual averages of the groups. There are limitations and possible errors in the study that are important to recognize. Human error may have accounted for inaccurate values of H2O volume measured from the jars, as spillage occurred when transferring water from the jar to a graduated cylinder. Although unlikely, the experimental specific metabolic rate for the second specimen being lower than the control could be accounted for by errors with the oxygen consumption apparatus or readings by the researchers.

There are many possible reasons as to why this study’s hypothesis was not supported by the results. Interestingly, a previous study conducted on red-claw crayfish found that salinity from 0-20ppt did not have a significantly increase the specific metabolic rates (Meade: 2002). The average concentration of NaCl for the experimental group was 0.725% NaCl, or 7.25ppt. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that the concentration used in the study was not high enough to increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. A similar study confirmed that at a 0-10ppt salinity range, the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus clarkii, a member of the species used in this study, did not increase significantly (Meade: 2002). There are a few possible reasons as to why the specific metabolic rate did not change at the salinity of our study. One explanation is that the Procambarus sp did not need to expend much more energy to retain its internal salts. This could have happened if the osmolality of the salinized water was a value higher than the osmolality of the Procambarus’ sp internal fluid. If this value was close to the difference between osmolality of the Procambarus sp and the osmolality of the water before the addition of NaCl, then the specimen would have to work just as hard to excrete the excess salt (experimental) as it would have to keep the salts in (control). Another study raises the important point that there are many other factors that could influence the rate of oxygen consumption and therefore the specific metabolic rate. If the Procambarus sp was stressed or had some sort of nutritional deficit there is the possibility that it consumed more oxygen unrelated to the effects of salinity in its water. 

If this study was to be performed a second time, the first step would be to increase the sample size. As the results show, the standard deviation for both the control and the experimental are close to the averages of the group. With a much larger sample size, one could hope that the standard deviation would be lower and the data would be more reliable for interpretation. Another method to try and make the control group data less deviated would be to use specimens that are extremely similar. This is because there are internal factors that affect respiration rate. For example, size, which would increase of decrease the very respiration rate we use to compare our results to. In our experiment, the specimen with lower mass exhibited a dramatically higher basal specific metabolic rate, which affected the average and thus standard deviation of the control group as a whole. Next, it would be essential to increase the concentration of NaCl in the solution. In addition, it would be necessary to use the same concentration of solution for each Procambarus sp, as the concentrations varied slightly in this study. Additionally, one study found that beyond 10ppt of NaCl, the oxygen consumption rates of Procambarus clarkii were highly variable (Meade: 2002). It would be interesting and valuable to increase the concentration and attempt to determine the specific ranges in which specific metabolic rate increases past 10ppt.
