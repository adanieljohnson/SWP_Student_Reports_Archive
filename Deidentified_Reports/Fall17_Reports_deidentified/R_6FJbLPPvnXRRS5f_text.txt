Title: The disturbing of the species Procambarus after being exposed to darkness resulting in their increased oxygen consumption and therefore increased specific metabolic rate

Abstract:
The experiment and statistical analysis of this study attempt to examine the effect of light on specific metabolic rate of the species Procambarus, an ectotherm and a type of common crayfish. We hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate would decrease after being exposed to darkness, being higher in the light conditions. This was done by measuring the oxygen consumption, a direct indicator of energy consumption, of three Procambarus specimens with an oxygen probe, while exposing each to light and then to darkness for a set amount of time. Metabolic rate of ectotherms has been experimentally observed to be higher while being exposed to light rather than being exposed to darkness, yet our results did not support this finding as the average of the metabolic rates of the specimens was higher in the dark than in the light. This is shown in our t-test p-value of 0.849253 being higher than 0.05, and therefore makes our data insignificant.


Introduction:
Metabolism is used to describe the entire process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells and overall in organisms. This is maintained through the conversion of glucose to energy, which releases high-energy electrons that are transferred to the electron transport system and give up energy that is used to convert ADP to ATP, which can then be used to carry out biological processes necessary to sustain life. If the electrons at the end of this sequence are not removed from the mitochondria, ATP production stops [Sadava: 2016]. Organisms use oxygen to remove these electrons, allowing us to use oxygen as a direct measure of energy production which can be used to calculate specific metabolic rate. We used the species Procambarus for this experiment as they are easily contained and consume oxygen in water for respiration. Ectotherms, such as the species Sceloporus undulatus, have been observed to operate with higher metabolic rates in the summer than in the spring where there is much less sunlight available [Angilletta Jr: 2001]. This was found to be due to the increased temperature of the water during the summer than in the spring. This species of the eastern fence lizard is found terrestrially, along forest edges on rotting logs, stumps and rocks. This is different from the species in this experiment, as the Procambarus specimen is found in deep water. Light availability is therefore different among these two organisms, and the goal of this experiment is to observe the effects of temperature and availability to light on aquatic animals rather than terrestrial animals. However, both specimen are ectotherms and adjust their body temperatures, and therefore specific metabolic rates, to the temperatures of their environments. The independent variable is the light/dark conditions while the dependent variable is the amount of oxygen consumed. We hypothesize that the specific metabolic rate and oxygen consumption of Procambarus exposed to darkness will be lower than that of Procambarus that are not exposed to darkness.


Materials and Methods:
Three Procambarus specimen were obtained that had previously been kept in a controlled, lab environment. The first Procambarus will not be exposed to darkness, serving as the first control group. The Procambarus specimen was placed in a large screw-top glass testing chamber, which was then filled to the brim with water saturated with air. The top was then screwed onto the testing chamber, allowing some of the water to overflow, and then placed in a plastic dishpan filled with water. A dissolved oxygen probe was then placed into the testing chamber through the top of the screw-top lid for recording dissolved oxygen concentration. The instrument was turned on and the reading was allowed to stabilize. The baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration was recorded. This was recorded again after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Then, the probe was removed and the water volume of the testing chamber was measured by pouring it from the chamber and into a graduated cylinder. The chamber was then refilled with air saturated water and the same specimen. Then, the chamber was placed back into the plastic dishpan and the probe was inserted through the top of the lid. A sheet of tinfoil was wrapped around the testing chamber as to simulate darkness, serving as the first experimental group. Again, a baseline reading of dissolved oxygen was recorded along with readings after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. After this time, the water volume of the chamber was measured and the specimen was returned to its original holding pen. The chamber was then refilled with air saturated water and these steps were repeated with two more specimens. All information was entered into a chart, along with each of specimens’ weights in grams. The specific metabolic rate for each specimen in each group was calculated using the formula: 

Specific metabolic rate = [∆O2  (mg/L)  * volume H2O (L)] / [Time (min)  *  weight (g)]

A paired t-test was used to compare the average of the specific metabolic rates of the control group to that of the experimental group.


Results:
The average of the specific metabolic rates for the Procambarus specimens exposed to darkness, 0.000470203 mg  min-1  g O2-1, is higher than that of the Procambarus specimens not exposed to darkness, 0.000437797 mg  min-1  g O2-1, as shown in Figure 1. This is also indicated in the data’s p-value of 0.849253 being much greater than 0.05, concluding in the insignificance of the data. The standard deviations of the light and dark groups respectively are 0.000365315 and 0.000363653 respectively. 


Discussion:
The results do not support our hypothesis that specific metabolic rate decreases with exposure to darkness, as the average of the specific metabolic rate for three Procambarus specimens increased after being exposed to darkness. This is puzzling as studies have shown that the metabolic rate for a species of fish, Oreochromis, was observed to be “higher during the light phase” of a photo-mediated metabolic cycle than during the dark phase [Biswas: 2001]. This was not observed for the specimen in this experiment. The specimen from this study were exposed to full day/night durations of time while the specimen in this experiment were only monitored in the light and in the dark for a total of twenty minutes for both. The difference in results could be due to the fact that the specimen in our experiment were not exposed to the environmental conditions for enough time, preventing them from adjusting their breathing rate accordingly. Many Procambarus specimens are troglobitic, or live in caves, while members of the Oreochromis species typically live in shallow waters like in streams and rivers. The difference in these results could be because of how the Oreochromis species is subjected to more light for longer amounts of time throughout the year than Procambarus specimen that are exposed to more darkness throughout the year as they live in caves. Since the Procambarus specimen experience a more constant duration of darkness, and the Oreochromis specimen live under more varying conditions throughout the year, the Oreochromis specimen could be more adapted to responding metabolically to changes in temperatures of water influenced by sunlight, which could explain why they demonstrated a lower specific metabolic rate in the darkness than in the light. Additionally, the specimens in this experiment were rather large and were crowded by the oxygen probe when submerged in the chamber. This caused them to flail around during the experiment. The increase in metabolic rate after covering the chambers with tin foil could be explained by any panic instincts triggered by the darkness induced by the tin foil, causing them to breath more rapidly and increase oxygen consumption. Specific metabolic rate is the energy expenditure of an organism at a physically and psychologically undisturbed state, which was not achieved by these organisms, explaining the reason for the increased metabolic rate after inducing darkness. Improvements of the experiment include allowing the specimens to have more room in the chamber as to not induce any panic instincts, using a more secure sheet than tin foil as some light still reached the chamber, and allowing the specimens more time than 20 minutes to adjust to the darkness. In a further study, I would choose to examine the effects of temperature on metabolic rate of ectotherms compared to that of endotherms as such is relevant to observing energy expenditure of the different organisms in our ecosystem.
