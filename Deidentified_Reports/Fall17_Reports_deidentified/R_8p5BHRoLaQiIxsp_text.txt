Title: Effects of exercise on the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp.

Abstract:
Specific metabolic rate is the amount of energy used by all physiologic processes in an animal at rest at a given time. The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether or not exercise increases the specific metabolic rate and oxygen consumption of the crayfish Procambris spp. To do this, we measured the oxygen consumption of three Procambris spp. for 20 minutes at rest and for 20 minutes after two minutes of stimulated exercise. Although our data looked consistent from a human eye, in which the controlll trials had higher specific metabolic rates than the treatment trials, the resulting data was inconclusive due to an insignificent P-value of 0.116858. The controlll group was not significently different from the treatment, so our hypothesis was not supported. This may be a result of a small sample size of three tested crayfish, so a suggestion for future study would be to conduct a larger scale study to create more of a trend in results.


Introduction:
The process of breaking down glucose to build energy in the form of ATP in the crayfish Procambris spp. Involves the intake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide. Glucose break down causes a release of high energy electrons that bind to FAD+ and NAD+ to be taken down the electron transport chain. This allows the high energy electrons to give off energy and convert ADP to ATP to be used in metabolic processes. Oxygen is needed in order to allow ATP to exit the mitochondria and go wherever it is needed. The amount of energy produced by the breakdown of glucose is almost directly proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed. Because the amount of carbon dioxide released is relatively equal to the amount of oxygen consumed, it is also directly proportional to the breakdown of glucose. The crayfish Procambris was used as a model organism in this experiment because it is easy to monitor its oxygen consumption. Crayfish are ectotherms, or an animal that is dependent on the environment as its heat source, making it easier to manage/maintain their body temperature and in turn, affect their specific metabolic rate in other ways. Specific metabolic rate is known as the amount of energy produced in an animal at rest. Exercise in an animal increases the amount of energy needed, also increasing its metabolic rate [Johnson: 2017]. According to a study on oxygen uptake and lactate in the blue crab, the amount of oxygen consumption at the start of exercise dramatically increases in crustaceans due to their immediate need for more energy, resulting in a higher metabolic rate. Although the amount of lactate production increases with prolonged exercise due to anaerobic respiration, the immediate response to the need for an increased metabolic rate is an increased uptake of oxygen for aerobic respiration [Booth: 1982]. Because more oxygen is needed and the breakdown of glucose must be faster, we hypothesized that exercise in the Procambris spp. will increase the specific metabolic rate and therefore increase its oxygen consumption.


Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis, we measured the oxygen consumption of the Procambris sp. using an oxygen probe in a confined container of water with the crayfish. We tested three different crayfish, comparing their resting oxygen consumption for 20 minutes and their consumption after two minutes of exercise. The controlll of this experiment were water temperature (room temperature). During the controlll phase of each trial, we filled the chamber with room temperature water and set it in a dishpan filled with some water. We weighed the crayfish and placed it into the chamber filled with water. We then put the cap with an oxygen probe on the chamber. We allowed the probe to stabilize and recorded the baseline oxygen consumption of the crayfish. We recorded the controlll consumption at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. We then poured the water from the chamber into a graduated cylinder to measure its volume. We placed the crayfish into a dishpan with some water and poked it around to stimulate exercise for two minutes. Procambris was then placed back into the chamber with new room temperature water. We recorded the oxygen consumptions again at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. We followed this two-step process for each crayfish. Out of these records, we calculated the specific metabolic rate of the controlll and treatment phase of each trial. We then performed a one-tailed two sample t_test in order to compare the specific metabolic rates of the controlll data and the experimental data.


Results:
The results of our experiment had a consistent pattern, in which the oxygen consumptions of the Procambris gradually decreased throughout the 20 minutes after exercise. Oxygen consumption seemed to be highest in the initial readings of the controlll trials. However, after the 20-minute period, two out of the three crayfish had a higher oxygen consumption than that of the controlll. The first trial crayfish was the only one that resulted in a lower treatment oxygen consumption. The oxygen consumption of the controlll crayfish decreased faster over the 20 minutes than that of the treatment trial crayfish. The specific metabolic rates of the crayfish were also consistent in the respective controlll and experimental trials. The specific metabolic rates of the controlll trials were consistently higher than that of the experimental trials. However, according to the one-tailed two sample t_test run to compare the specific metabolic rates of the controlll and treatment trials, the results are not statistically significent. The P-value was 0.116858, and since it is higher than 0.05, the results of our experiment were insignificent.


Discussion:
Out hypothesis was exercise will increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. crayfish. Because the P-value was 0.116858, the statistical results of the experiment were insignificent, or there is no significent difference between the controlll and treatment groups. Our hypothesis was not supported by our statistically insignificent results. This is most likely due to the small sample size of crayfish that we had. Looking at the results, we could see a trend in which the experimental trials had lower specific metabolic rates than the controllls. Our first crayfish, however, did not follow the same exact trend as the other two crayfish. If we had tested more crayfish, a significent trend would have been established so that there was a significent difference between the controlll and treatment trials. In a study on crustaceans and controlll of responses to hypoxia and exercise, it was determined that at a point in exercise, animals will increase their anaerobic processes in order produce energy. Anaerobic respiration transforms ADP to ATP without the use of oxygen, so when anaerobic respiration increases, overall oxygen consumption decreases [Taylor: 1982]. This would explain why in our results, the experimental trials had less oxygen consumption and therefore lower specific metabolic rates than the controlll trials. Anaerobic respiration is not as efficient as aerobic, and creates less ATP, so the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish that have exercises would be lower than those at rest. In addition, in extended periods of exercise, crustaceans, along with other animals, increase their lactate levels. Lactate is a product of anaerobic respiration that builds up in animal muscles, ultimately creating the pain that is commonly known as soreness [Booth: 1982]. Increased lactate production demonstrates the takeover of anaerobic respiration, which explains why after two minutes of exercise, the oxygen consumption of the Procambris sp. decreased. For later studies, it would be beneficial to test a greater sample of crayfish in order to test whether the controlll trials have greater specific metabolic rates than the exercise trials. A larger sample size would allow trends that we can see in our data to be expanded in significance.
