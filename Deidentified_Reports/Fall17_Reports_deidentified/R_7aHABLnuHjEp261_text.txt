Title: Effect of 100mM Tetraethylammonium Chloride on the Amplitude of Gastrocnemius Contractions in Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
This report details the effects of injecting a potassium channel blocker, Tetraethylammonium Chloride, on the amplitude of contractions in the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. Our experiment was done in one class setting and included four frog legs that were each their own controlll, and later injected with two milliliters of 100 mM Tetrraethylammonium Chloride. This report also details the results of our experiment that matched the research done prior by scientists — showing that there is a decrease in the amplitude of muscle contractions after the addition of a potassium channel blocker. A paired t_test was run on our results, which gave our p_value of 0.003. Due to our p_value being below our set alpha of 0.05, our results were found to be statistically significent. This showed that the potassium channel blocker did lead to a change in the amplitude of muscle contractions between our controlll and experimental trials.


Key Words: Tetraehtlyammonium Cl (TEA), Action Potential (AP), Acetylcholine (ACh)


Introduction:
The neuromuscular junction, or synapse, releases Acetylcholine (ACh) after a nerve signal arrives from the motor neurons. The ACh binds to the receptors on the post-synaptic membrane of the muscle fiber which causes ion channels on the motor end plate to open. More specifically, this binding stimulates the opening of sodium channels due to depolarization. An action potential is then generated, which releases calcium ions. The muscle fibers become activated and a muscle contraction results. Due to ACh and calcium ions being difficult to measure, a myogram is used in order to measure the force of a contraction.
	Along with that, the sodium-potassium pump allows for there to be a balance between sodium and potassium ions. This functions to transport three sodium ions into the cell and two potassium ions out of the cell. A nerve signal is then transmitted and a muscle contraction is induced. More importantly, the potassium channel plays a crucial role in the repolarization of the muscle. With additional sodium ions flooding into the cell, the membrane becomes very positive and stimulates the opening of the voltage-gated potassium channels. The potassium ions then rush out the cell and allow the membrane to become negative — resulting in repolarization, or muscle relaxation. 
	In an experiment done by P. R. Stanfield in 1970, the impact of Tetraethylammonium on the muscle conductance of a frog was tested by controlllling the membrane potential and approximating the membrane current. As a result, the potassium channel blocker overall decreased the amplitude of the muscle contraction. Following that, the amplitude of currents recorded during both depolarization and hyper polarization were reduced by 88% when 150 mM Tetraethylammonium was added to the frog skeletal muscle [Stanfield: 1970]. In 1995, researchers M. T. Nelson and J. M. Quayle conducted an experiment on the effects of a potassium channel blocker in arterial smooth muscle. Through their experiment, it was found that the muscle experienced vasoconstriction and caused a decrease in the amount of blood flow [Nelson and Quayle: 1995]. 
	For our experiment, we used Rania pipiens because they are a good muscle model which have fast twitch fibers that will undergo greater contractions since a frog often has to jump great distances. With the knowledge provided from prior experiments combined with our knowledge in regard to the role of potassium channels in muscle contractions, we developed a hypothesis primarily based off the experiment done by Nelson and Quayle. We predicted that by adding a potassium channel blocker, there would be an increase in the amplitude of muscle contractions due to the muscle being unable to repolarize. So — in theory by the muscle staying constricted — we assumed that the muscle would have a higher amplitude until the potassium was no longer being blocked, and the muscle could properly relax. 

Materials and Method:
To start, the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve must be revealed so the electrode from the myogram can be properly connected and an accurate reading can be obtained. Therefore, the skin must be peeled away from the frog leg muscle. It is important to make sure the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve are hydrated with Ringer solution, thus the solution must be doused over both the muscle and nerve every 5-7 minutes. Following that, the frog leg must be properly set up with the muscle hanging at a ninety degree angle by a string and clamp. The sciatic nerve needs to be pulled away from the muscle and crossed over both the metal wires on the electrode in order for the experiment to work correctly.
	Once the myogram and muscle have been constructed properly, it is time to set the lab scribe specifically for the experiment — the amplitude is set to one volt, the number of pulses is  set to five, and the frequency is set to one Hz. After this is all completed, the first frog leg without any potassium channel blocker is stimulated and the data is recorded. This serves as the first controlll — it is important to keep in mind that each frog leg serves as its own controlll for this experiment — therefore, the same frog leg is later injected with two milliliters of 100 mM Tetraethylammonium Chloride through a syringe and stimulated with the same setting as the controlll. This process of setting up the frog leg and the stimulation of the muscle is repeated six additional times — three being the controlll and the other three being the experimental. All results are then recorded into separate data tables and averaged for each stimulation. 
	The 100 mM Tetraethylammonium Chloride serves as our independent variable, and the amplitude of the contraction is our dependent variable. Once the experiment was completed in one class setting, a single-tailed paired t_test was conducted in order to determine whether a statistical significance was present among our controlll and experimental results.

Results:
Our first frog leg displayed an expected increase in the amplitude of contractions after the potassium channel blocker was added. However, the remaining three frog legs, depicted an unexpected decrease in the amplitude of muscle contractions post-addition of the potassium channel blocker. Our averages for the controlll frog legs were 0.6134 V, 0.3894 V, 0.1174 V, and 0.6934 V. Our averages for the experimental were 0.7046 V, 0.115 V, 0.016 V, and 0.304 V. Through a single tailed paired t_test, our p_value was determined to be 0.003 which is less than the standard alpha value of 0.05. 
	Generally, most of our data showed a decreasing trend in the amplitude of muscle contraction after the injection of the potassium channel blocker, with the exception of the first trial. Since we performed five pules for each stimulation at 1.0 volt, there was an excess of raw data present. Therefore, in Figure 1, our results of each stimulation are averaged so the difference in amplitude among our frog legs are displayed more clearly. As seen in Figure 1, the first trial presented results that conflicted with the other three frog legs, but coincided with our hypothesis.

Discussion:
Based on our results being statistically significent, we reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis is not supported. Our p_value was calculated to be 0.003 after running a single tailed paired t_test. Due to the p_value being less than the standard alpha value of 0.05, this means there is a statistical significance between the results of our experimental and controlll. Since, the p_value was less than the alpha value but because majority of our results showed a decrease in the amplitude, opposite of our hypothesis was true. Based on the experiments we evaluated, our results are accurate in terms of the second, third, and fourth frog legs due to their decrease in amplitude after injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with a potassium channel blocker. 
	Amplitude in this experiment is measuring the force of the contraction. Our results tell us that the potassium channel being blocked made for a weaker contraction. This is because the muscle was not able to properly repolarize. Without a potassium channel blocker, the sodium ions rushing into the cell causes the membrane to become positive and opens the voltage-gated potassium channels; thus allowing the potassium ions to rush out of the cell. This process results in a negative membrane and repolarization. However, with the addition of a potassium channel blocker, we prohibited the voltage-gated potassium channels from opening. Therefore, we restricted the potassium ions from leaving the cell and repolarization from occurring. Without proper repolarization, the muscle cannot contract again since another action potential cannot take place due to the excess amount of sodium and potassium ions inside the cell. This caused for an improper stimulation to occur — which is why we saw little to no muscle contractions in frog legs two, three, and four with the addition of the potassium channel blocker.  
	By looking at the research done in 1970 by Stanfield, and in 1995 by Nelson and Quayle, we would expect for all our trials to show a decrease in the amplitude of muscle contractions with a potassium channel blocker present. However, the first frog leg displayed an increase in the amplitude of muscle contractions. Considering our experiment only consisted of four frog legs, it is impossible to conduct an outlier test on such a small data set to determine the first frog leg as an outlier. It is possible that the first frog muscle was defective or there was an error made on our part while conducting the experiment. For instance, the Tetraethylammonium Chloride may not have been injected thoroughly throughout the muscle, causing the potassium channels to not be completely blocked and for repolarization to actually occur. This could also explain why there was such a variation in our results from the first frog leg to the rest of the trials. For our third frog leg, we conducted an outlier test within the experimental group. We found the fifth pulse to be an outlier since it was more than two standard deviations away from the mean.  
	We would prefer to run the experiment again with multiple trials in order to gain a larger data set. This would then allow us to run an outlier test and possibly obtain an explanation for the odd results from our first trial. Ultimately, we do not fully trust the results from this experiment since there was such a large variation among our results when comparing the first frog leg to the other three Rania pipien legs.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. In total, we used four frog legs, with each being its own controlll and later being injected with the potassium channel blocker. We stimulated five pulses at 1.0 volts for each frog leg and trial. The graph shows the averages of the amplitudes of contractions (V) for our controllls — the Rania pipiens without the potassium channel blocker; and the averages of the amplitudes of contractions (V) for our experimental groups — with the addition of  2 Ml of 100 mM of Tetraethylammonium Chloride. Our averages for the controlll frog legs were 0.6134 V, 0.3894 V, 0.1174 V, and 0.6934 V. Our averages for the experimental frog legs were 0.7046 V, 0.115 V, 0.016 V, and 0.304 V. The standard deviations for our controlll frog legs were 0.088, 0.043, 0.015, and 0.087. The standard deviations for our experimental frog legs were 0.011, 0.012, 0.008, and 0.008. After conducting a single tailed paired t_test, the p_value was calculated as 0.003. An outlier test was done on frog leg #3 (experimental) which showed that the fifth pulse was more than two standard deviations away from the mean — indicating it as an outlier and was disregarded when calculating the standard deviation for frog leg #3 (experimental).
