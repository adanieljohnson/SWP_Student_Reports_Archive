Title: Effects of caffeine on neuromuscular function in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to better understand the effects of caffeine on neuromuscular function in a severed Rana pipiens leg. We hypothesized that there would be an increase in voltage due to potentiated calcium release caused by the treatment and were testing against a situation where there would be no significant change in force of muscle contraction before and after the caffeine was introduced. The voltage inside the gastrocnemius was recorded before and after a one mL, 200 mM sample of caffeine was injected into the muscle. We found a significant increase in the amplitude of the treated measurements in relation to the control. Both p-values for leg 1 (p=7.51E^(-8)) and leg 2 (p=1.57E^(-8)) were under the set significance point of p< .05. We concluded that the calcium release is much more active after caffeine.

Introduction:
Caffeine is an extremely prominent drug and is the most commonly used psychotropic drug in the world, so studying its effects is a very important topic of research (Gilbert: 1984). The samples we tested were severed legs of Rana pipiens, an abundant, US native frog. The legs of the Rana pipiens were ideal for our research because of the easily accessible gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve through the “degloving” process. The main question we are seeking to answer is- Does caffeine increase neuromuscular efficiency or not? In order to identify the answer, we must devise a plan to measure the amount of voltage the leg experiences when delivered electrical stimulants with and without caffeine being introduced. When there is a muscle contraction an action potential travels down the T-tubule inside the muscle and causes a electrically-gated ion channel to release calcium. This calcium 2+ ion flows out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and binds to the actin filaments inside the sarcomeres. Once this happens the myosin heads are able to bind with the actin, pulling the muscle together, or, contracting it [Sadava et al.: 2017]. Therefore, when there is an increase in calcium, there should be a more forceful contraction due to a higher amount of myosin heads being able to bind to the actin filaments. To study this phenomenon, our independent variable will be whether or not caffeine is injected and the dependent variable will be the force of muscle contraction we measure in the leg. Due to the fact that caffeine increases calcium ion release we expect there to be an increase in the amount of voltage measured in the leg after injection (Gubareff, Sleator: 1965). Therefore, if caffeine is injected into the leg, then there will be a significant increase in the force of muscle contraction.

Materials and Methods:
To begin, the necessary equipment to perform this experiment is a myogram machine, which is a graphical representation of muscle contraction, a severed Rana pipiens legs, a sample of 200mM caffeine, a syringe, and any common lab stand capable of holding the gastrocnemius muscle upright. After we organized our equipment we began by degloving the frog legs in order to expose the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle. Then, the leg was situated in a way where a string attached to the lab stand held the calf muscle at a 90-degree angle while reasonably taut. After the leg was in place, the two probes connected to the myogram were pierced through the calf muscle to induce electrical pulses while measuring the total voltage. Once everything was prepared we programmed the myogram to send electric currents that would stimulate an action potential five times each separated by one second. The amplitude was measured for each individual stimulus. The same procedure was done before and after the injection of the caffeine. In each trial .1 millliliter of 200mM caffeine was introduced directly into the calf muscle immediately following the first five stimulations. To determine the difference in voltage before and after the caffeine in one frog leg, a paired t-test was used.

Results:
After being injected with one milliliter of 200mM caffeine, each frog leg showed a significant difference in amplitude. Only two sets of data were recorded due to a poor injection for the second leg. However, data shown in figure 1 shows there was a significant increase between mean amplitude in the first leg (Before: x ̅=.9106 =.01872, After: x ̅=1.7732 =.001924) with a p-value of 7.51E^(-8)   and the second leg (Before: x ̅=.5622 =.01406, After: x ̅=1.317 =.01542) with a p-value of 1.57E^(-8).

Discussion:
In conclusion, there is very significant data showing us that caffeine, a calcium ion facilitator, increases the amplitude of voltage in the muscle to which it was injected. This observation makes biological sense because when caffeine is introduced into a system it potentiates calcium release, therefore, many more electrically charged ions will be flowing through the muscle which explains the higher voltage measurement (Lee: 1993). Since there is a significant difference in amplitudes for each leg, our hypothesis is supported. During the experiment we had to reduce the amount of legs we tested to two because on the second trial the injection of caffeine was not performed properly. This reduced our sample size, but we were still able to produce two significant sets of data with the first leg and the third leg. Furthermore, another side effect of so much electricity being in the muscle is that it caused one continuous contraction. The muscle became hard and bulged around points of injection showing that the calcium release was most prominent around the sites with the most caffeine. 
	In a separate experiment, caffeine’s effects on neuromuscular function was studied in humans (Kalmar, Cafarelli: 1999). Kalmar and Cafarelli’s data did not show a significant increase in amplitude or threshold. However, they did not inject caffeine at the site like we did with our frogs. Instead they administered a double-blind test where subjects would either be taking a pill with the treatment or a placebo in the days preceding the test. Building off this, I decided to, first, instead of injecting the treatment into a severed leg, I would introduce the caffeine for the experimental group while the subject was still alive. Secondly, rather than measuring amplitude, I would measure the threshold for an action potential because this would display the phenomenon more accurately. Lastly, I would have to use a two-sample t-test because I would not be recording before and after data in one frog. To summarize, the field of study including commonly used drugs and smaller, less noticeable side effects that each of them have is extremely important and a broader understanding of this information should be something that is sought after in the scientific community.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This bar graph shows the average amplitudes in volts measured by the myogram in the two respective calf muscles before and after the caffeine was introduced. Error bars show the possibility for variability in our data. The treatment groups are clearly shown to have a higher average amplitude than the control. This data shows significance in that the force of contraction increases with the treatment.
