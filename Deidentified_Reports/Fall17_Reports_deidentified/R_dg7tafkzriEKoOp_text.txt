Title: Measuring effects of salinity on metabolic rate of Procambris sp crayfish resulting in statistically significent difference between crayfish in freshwater and saltwater

Abstract:
Metabolic rate is the measure of the amount of energy expended by an organism to complete physiological processes. Different factors in the environment can affect metabolic rate, especially for crayfish including salinity and the purpose of this lab was to test the effects of increased salinity on the metabolic rate of Procambris sp crayfish. It was hypothesized that increased salinity would decrease the metabolic rate because less ions would be passively diffusing out of the crayfish at higher salinities so the crayfish would not have to put in as much work to retain the ions, thus reducing the metabolic rate. A crayfish was placed in a testing chamber with an oxygen probe and oxygen levels were taken initially and every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. The crayfish was then put in a testing chamber in saltwater and the process was repeated. This was repeated on two more crayfish. It was found that the metabolic rate of crayfish in saltwater was significently smaller than in freshwater.

Introduction:
Metabolism is the amount of energy expended by an organism to carry out all physiological processes, and is the process of balancing energy capture, transfer, and conversion within an organism [Johnson: 2017]. Metabolic rate is the measure of this energy. Salinity is important for aquatic organisms because it can determine in which bodies of water they can live. In this study, the focus was the effect that salinity has on the metabolic rate of Procambris sp crayfish. Crayfish were good to use as the model organism for this study because they are cheap and easy to obtain as well as sensitive and respond relatively strongly to changes in their environment. Species of crayfish have been found to be able to survive in water with a salinity up to 80 percent salinity, but the ability to colonize is still restricted to water with lower levels of salinity [Holdich: 1997]. Crayfish were found to have a high tolerance to high salinities but recovery is delayed once exposed to these high salinities. Heart rate and stress index were found to increase after an increase in salinity [Kozák: 2010]. In fresh water ions passively diffuse into the surrounding water so crayfish have to work to keep these ions in their bodies but in freshwater they don’t have to work as hard to keep the ions [Kirschner: 2004]. The fact that crayfish would have to expend less energy on keeping ions could indicate a lower metabolic rate. In addition to this, it was found that there were reduced osmoregulatory abilities in high salinity as well as reduced maximal swimming performance which suggests activity may be constrained by high salinity [Swanson: 1998]. This could indicate a lower metabolic rate if they are not exerting as much force. The amount of energy produced from glucose being broken down during physiological activities is directly proportional to consumed oxygen so oxygen consumption was measured and used to calculate the metabolic rate [Johnson: 2017]. The independent variable was the level of salinity or whether there was salt or no salt in the water, and the dependent variable was the metabolic rate of the crayfish. With the knowledge that crayfish are able to survive in higher salinity but that these higher salinities affect biological functions of crayfish as well as the fact that crayfish have to work harder to keep ions from diffusing out in fresh water rather than in salt water, it was hypothesized that increased salinity would decrease metabolic rate.

Materials and Method:
First, a crayfish was put into a testing chamber and the chamber was filled to the top with oxygenated water and placed in a dishpan filled with water. Then the top of the chamber was screwed on and an oxygen probe was placed into the chamber. The oxygen reader was turned on and a baseline reading of dissolved oxygen concentration was taken. Dissolved oxygen concentration was also recorded at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes. After these were taken the probe was taken out and the volume of water in the testing chamber was measured. The same crayfish was put in another testing chamber filled with oxygenated salt water. The testing chamber was placed in the dishpan of water and the oxygen probe was placed in the chamber and the top was screwed on. Once again, a baseline reading of dissolved oxygen concentration was taken as well as readings at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. The volume of this testing chamber was also recorded. This was repeated on two more crayfish. The average salinity of the salt water solutions was 0.733%. The amount of oxygen consumed was used in an equation to calculate the metabolic rate of each crayfish in both conditions. The crayfish were kept in separate containers with room temperature freshwater when not being tested. A one-tailed paired t_test was used to compare the metabolic rates of the crayfish in freshwater to their metabolic rates in saltwater.

Results:
The first trial recorded by the research group indicated a higher metabolic rate for the crayfish in salinity than in freshwater, which was against the general pattern found so the data was discarded and data from another lab carrying out the same study was used to supplement this missing trial. In the second trial, the metabolic rate of the crayfish in the saltwater was calculated over 15 minutes rather than 20 minutes because the initial reading of oxygen concentration was less than the reading after 5 minutes and the reading after 20 minutes, but oxygen should decrease since the crayfish are taking it in so the initial reading was thrown out. A one-tailed paired t_test was performed and a p_value of 0.019 was found. As can be seen in Figure 1, in each trial the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish was lower in salinity than in freshwater.

Discussion:
The p_value from the data, 0.019, was below 0.05 so the findings were statistically significent, meaning that the null hypothesis was rejected. This hypothesis was created based on a study that found that ions in fresh water passively diffuse into the surrounding water so crayfish have to put in more work to retain these ions but in saltwater the ions don’t diffuse as rapidly so the crayfish don’t have to put in as much work, meaning the metabolic rate would not be as high in saltwater [Kirschner: 2004]. However, while these findings were statistically significent, upon further research it was found in one study that, on average, maintenance oxygen consumption was greatest in sea water and least in fresh water for three groups of fish that were tested [Febry: 1987]. As well in another study it was found that more energy was used in higher salinities, meaning a higher metabolic rate, in other types of fish, but this was also attributed to other metabolic processes that could have been affected by changes in salinity [Morgan: 1991]. As there is conflicting research on the effects of salinity on metabolic rates of crayfish and fish in general, more research must be done to truly understand the effects of salinity on metabolic rate. Also, there are some other factors that should be kept in mind such as the idea that salinity can have an effect on the behavior of crayfish, thus affecting the metabolic rate in other ways [Swanson: 1998]. It may not be a direct relationship. Understanding the effects of metabolic rate on crayfish is important because higher metabolic rate indicates higher stress meaning the crayfish most likely shouldn’t stay in the situation they are in, thus letting researchers know what conditions crayfish should be in.
