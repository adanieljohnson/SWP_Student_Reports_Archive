Title: The Effects of Salinity on the Metabolic Rate of the Procambris sp

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to determine whether increasing the concentration of salinity would increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. The hypothesis for this investigation is that if salinity is increased to a concentration of 6.5 parts per thousand, then metabolic rate will be statistically greater for the experimental group compared to the controlll group. The procedure for this experiment requires each of the three crayfish to be put in a chamber with water and find the O2 consumption every 5 minutes over a 20-minute interval, and repeat this process but with the water having a concentration of 6.5 parts per thousand salinity. In addition, we found that there was no statistical difference in specific metabolic rate between the two groups because the p_value of 0.09542 was not less than the alpha of 0.05. Lastly, some extensions of the experiment (trying stronger concentrations of salinity) should be made to truly determine the relationship of salinity and specific metabolic rate because the controlll and experimental groups did show some difference.

Introduction:
Metabolism is the entire process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells or an organism. However, it is very difficult to measure energy transfer directly, so to understand this concept fully it is important to comprehend the major reactions of metabolism. First, when an organism converts glucose to energy, the carbon and oxygen atoms that are present in glucose are converted through a series of reactions into CO2 gas. These same reactions release high energy electrons that are captured by NAD+ and FAD, that then transfer the electrons to the electron transport chain. As electrons move between the transport of the chain they give up energy, which is used to convert low-energy ADP into high-energy ATP. Therefore, the amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose during physiological activities is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed. With this being said, oxygen consumption can be used to estimate metabolic activity. In an experiment, investigators Allan and Froneman dealt with this process and looked at the effects of salinity on a caridean shrimp’s (Paelaemon peringueyi) metabolic rate by measuring their oxygen rate at different salinities. They found that the oxygen rates of their shrimp species increased with increased salinities [Allan and Froneman: 2006]. With this being said, we wanted to create an experiment that measured the effects of salinity on a different crustacean, the Procambris sp. (crayfish). The Procambris sp. was selected because of its unique physical properties; for instance, it is an ectotherm, so their bodies absorb salt very quickly and their size makes them easy to manage as well as measure their metabolic rate. Our hypothesis is that if the independent variable salinity is increased to a concentration of 6.5 parts per thousand, then the dependent variable metabolic rate will be statistically greater for the experimental group compared to the controlll group. We predict this to happen because the crayfish will have to work harder to regulate their ion balance (salinity), which requires an increase in oxygen intake, thus increasing their specific metabolic rate. 

Materials and Method:
To set up this experiment, collect three similar sized Procambris sp. crayfish. Keep the three crayfish in three separate personal fish tanks filled with room temperature water. Weigh the first crayfish, gently place it into the test chamber, fill the test chamber with room temperature water, and screw on the top. When the top is secure, insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber. Next, turn on the instrument and take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Read the oxygen concentration measurement again at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.  Remove the probe. Now, measure the volume of water that was crayfish was in during the experiment. Do this by carefully pouring the water from the test chamber through a funnel into a graduated cylinder and record the volume. Once that is finished, make a 6.5 parts per thousand solution by using the ratio 1:9 (NaCl:Water). Afterwards, fill the test chamber with this solution and repeat the above process that was done with water. Again, repeat both the O2 consumption with water and with the solution for the two-remaining crayfish. Also, a one tailed paired t_test with a directionality saying that the controlll would be significently less than the experimental was used to compare the means of the specific metabolic rates (SMR=[∆O2(mg/L) *volume H2O(L)]/Time(min)*weight (grams)) of the experimental and controlll groups.

Results:

The graph shows the averages of the metabolic rates for the controlll and experimental groups. The specific metabolic rates of the crayfish increased as salinity increased. For instance, the controlll had a much smaller average specific metabolic rate at 0.00240 O2/(g*min) compared to the experimental average specific metabolic rate of 0.00277 O2/(g*min). Furthermore, the average standard deviation of the controllls was 0.0007695 O2/(g*min) and average experimental standard deviation was 0.000949438 O2/(g*min) which means the controlll had less variation in its data points then the experimental group. The t-value calculated using a one-tail paired t_test was found to be t=3.000873 and the p_value that translates to that is p=.09542. An alpha level of 0.05 was chosen as the benchmark to compare to for significance. 


Discussion:
After analyzing the results, our hypothesis that if the independent variable salinity is increased to a concentration of 6.5 parts per thousand, then the dependent variable specific metabolic rate will be statistically greater for the experimental compared to the controlll cannot be statistically supported. The results that the controlll group would have a lower specific metabolic rate than our experimental group fit our prediction. However, the difference was not great enough to yield significance because the p_value of .09542 was not less than the alpha value of 0.05. Moreover, each individual crayfish saw an increase in their specific metabolic rate meaning that the increase in salinity may have slightly altered their physiological process (O2 intake). In addition, with our sample size only being three, the sizes of individuals varying, and having a p_value relatively close to the alpha level it is tough to tell if there is truly no significent relationship between salinity and specific metabolic rate without further testing. Our results differ from the study performed by Allan and Froneman because they found that as salinity increased so did the metabolic rates of Paelaemon peringueyi this may have occurred because the shrimp experienced some form of osmotic stress which would increase physiological activity, subsequently increasing O2 consumption and specific metabolic rate [Allan and Froneman]. Conversely, our results did not show any significent difference between increased salinity and metabolic rate. Some possibilities of why are results differ from their study are: they used a stronger salinity concentrations (15-35 parts per thousand) which could have made a larger impact on the individuals ion regulation. Also, their species differs slightly from ours meaning their shrimp’s metabolic rate could be more easily disturbed. In the future, we should perform more trials of this experiment testing different salinity concentrations and have more replicates to get a better understanding to see if salinity really has an effect on specific metabolic rate.
