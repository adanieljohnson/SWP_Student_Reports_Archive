Title: The Effect of 25mM Lidocaine Solution on Frog Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The skeletal muscle controllls the movement of animal bodies. The sodium channels in the muscle is an important part in action potential transduction. The function of sodium channels can be blocked by lidocaine solution. In this paper, we investigated the effect of 25mM lidocaine solution on the gastrocnemus muscle. We hypothesized that if 25mM lidocaine solution is injected into Rania pipiens leg, then the ability of muscle contraction will reduce. Our results showed that the difference between the group without lidocaine injection and the group with the lidocaine injection was not significent (t (2) =1.33, p=0.127, p>0.05). Hence our hypothesis was not supported by our data. However, we found past literature which contradicts our findings, and we determined that further study is needed to reinsure our hypothesis. 


Introduction:
Muscle is a kind of soft tissue found in animals including humans. There are three kinds of muscles in the human body: cardiac, smooth and skeletal. The skeletal muscle allows the animals to accomplish all types of movement: bending legs, arms, wings and therefore, running, swimming and even flying. It also allows us to breathe and stay in shape on a subtler scale. The nervous system is also a vital system inside animals’ body. With the long axons in nerve cells, signals from the brain or spinal cord are transferred either electrically or chemically. The chemical signals are transferred by action potential—a process of membrane potential rising up and down, opening channels and spread the depolarization to nearby areas. As this is an all-or-none process, the signal can be transferred. (Sadava:2016)    
Only by combining the two system can we move our bodies by wish. The system is the so-called neuromuscular system. Skeleton muscle is connected with motor neurons that form the neuromuscular junctions. The action potential travels down the axon to the presynaptic terminal, and by spreading neurotransmitters, activating the action potential in the muscle membrane. From there, T tubule carries the AP down for muscle contraction. (Sadava:2016)    
What will happen if we block or remove one of the steps in the neuromuscular system when the AP is being conducted? To solve this problem, we need to have a simple and similar-to-human neuromuscular system. In frogs, Rania pipiens, their legs are similar to that of a human’s. They have sciatic nerves and gastrocnemus muscle that is easy to separate and gain access to. Lidocaine is often used for anesthesia in the medical field. Also, it is also a chemical that blocks the sodium channels, an important part in AP transduction in cells. A previous study about lidocaine carried out by Bainton and Strichartz focused on the concentration dependence of lidocaine-induced irreversible conduction loss in frog nerve. They soaked the frog’s sciatic nerve in different concentrations of lidocaine solutions and discovered that lidocaine induces the nonreversible damage to the sciatic nerve beginning at the concentration of 40mM. (CR: 1994)    
Sodium channels are located not only in nerves but in muscle as well (Marban: 1998). We want to test and know the effect of the specific 25mM lidocaine solution on the gastrocnemus muscle instead of the sciatic nerve in order to understand the importance of sodium channels in the neuromuscular system and thus understand why lidocaine can reduce muscle contraction. We are injecting the Rania pipiens legs with 25mM lidocaine solution, and expect to see less contraction of muscle through stimulus after injection according to the amplitude of contraction that muscle generates. Our hypothesis is that if 25mM lidocaine solution is injected into Rania pipiens leg, then the ability of muscle contraction will reduce. 


Materials and Method:
First, we placed the frog leg in the tray, and carefully peeled the skin off it. We made sure to spray some Ringer’s solution to keep them wet. Second, we cut through the thin membrane between the gastrocnemus muscle and the bone and cut the muscle off the bone towards the toes with some tendon on it. Next, we tied the tendon with thread, and tied the other end of the thread to the iron stand, making sure that the gastrocnemus muscle is perpendicular to the tray with appropriate tension. Then, we inserted two electrodes into the gastrocnemus muscle and connected the wire to the iWorx TA stimulator box. Also, we connected the iron stand to the stimulator box for measuring the contraction amplitude. We used Labscribe 3 to set and record data.    

First, we measured the threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle contraction and the pulse amplitude (voltage) of maximum contraction before lidocaine injection. Next, we applied the pulse amplitude five times to the muscle and recorded the amplitudes that the muscle generated after each stimulation. Then, we injected the leg with 0.1Ml 25mM lidocaine solution and waited for 5 minutes. The threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle contraction and the pulse amplitude (voltage) of maximum contraction were taken again before measuring the amplitudes of the muscle contractions for another 5 times.  

We repeated the procedures three times with the three frog legs. We used a one-tailed paired t_test to determine the result. 


Results:
There was a decreasing trend after the injection of lidocaine in the frog gastrocnemus muscle. The mean amplitude of muscle contraction of the No injection group is 0.3824 ± 0.118 SD, and the mean amplitude of muscle contraction of the Lidocaine injection group is 0.2414 ± 0.092 SD. However, result from the one-tailed paired t_test indicated that our data did not support the hypothesis that the injection of lidocaine would significently reduce the contraction strength of frog’s gastrocnemus muscle (t (2) =1.33, p = 0.127, d.f. = 2).


Discussion:
According to the experiment results, our hypothesis was not supported. Hence our hypothesis that if 0.1Ml 25mM lidocaine solution is injected into Rania pipiens leg, then the ability of muscle contraction will reduce was not supported. However, as interpreted by Cummins, injected lidocaine binds to voltage-gated sodium channels, which are also located on the muscle (Marban: 1998), in a 1: 1 manner and prevents sodium ions from flowing through the channel (Cummins:2007), which stops action potential from being transmitted. Thus, as AP can’t be conducted throughout the muscle, its contraction ability decreases.  When we looked into each trial of the data, the results showed that the amplitude of contraction drops for all of them after the 25mM lidocaine solution is injected. However, when we ran the t_test, the result is insignificent (p>0.05). Then, we looked into some extraneous factors. First, the possible reason will be significent variance between the average of amplitude for each trial. The average amplitude of contraction of the third leg is 0.223 and 0.138, which is substantially smaller than both of the means in leg 1 and leg 2. We proposed that this is because the third frog legs’ gastrocnemus muscle is a lot smaller than the other two, resulting in the smaller amplitude of contraction recorded both before and after the lidocaine injection. Besides, we didn’t stimulate the sciatic nerve to do the experiment. Instead, we inserted the electrodes directly to the muscle. It was possible that after 5 minutes, the lidocaine hadn’t spread throughout the muscle so that only parts of the muscle were stimulated. (Bainton: 1994) For the best result, we should stimulate the nerve instead of the muscle as it controllls the whole muscle. We should pick frog legs of the similar size to prevent large variation in results. Also, in the future study, we want to test the effect of the lidocaine on the sciatic nerve. To do so, we will need to stimulate the sciatic nerve before and after we soak the nerve in the lidocaine solution. We predict that the result would be the lidocaine solution will reduce the ability of nerve transducing action potential, and thus resulting in the reduction in muscle contraction ability.
