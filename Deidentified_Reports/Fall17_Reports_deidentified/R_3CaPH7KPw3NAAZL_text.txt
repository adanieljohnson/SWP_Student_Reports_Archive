Title: The Effects of Salinity on the Absorbance and Photosynthetic Activity of Chloroplasts in Spinacia oleracia

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a process that takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells and is required in order to produce energy. Chloroplast activity, and therefore photosynthesis can be determined by looking at the absorbances of solutions that contain enriched chloroplasts in different environments. A very common environment that plants may be found in is one with high levels of salinity. The effects of salinity on the chloroplast activity of and rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracia were tested by comparing the overall percent change in absorbances of chloroplasts in a salt solution and in a solution without salt. It was hypothesized that the percent change of the absorbances for the chloroplasts in the salt solution would increase while the absorbance itself would decrease. The data did not support the hypothesis because it was shown to be insignificant with a p-value of 0.4364.


Introduction:
Cellular processes require energy in order to be fully carried out. Outside factors are often used as a source of energy in plants, including chemical energy from covalent bonds, energy stored as redox potential, and/or an electrochemical gradient across a lipid bilayer. Plants are able to obtain these three types of energy from the sun through photosynthesis, and then it is further processed through glycolysis and respiration. Photosynthesis can be summed up with the equation 6CO2 + 12H2O → C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2. One of these products is glucose, and this is used by plant cells as food and goes through glycolysis and the Kreb’s Cycle to be converted into energy for the plant. Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of the cells of the plant. By taking the absorbance rate of a solution of chloroplasts in plants such as Spinacia oleracia and looking at the percent change over a period of time the chloroplast activity can be seen. In order to see if the chloroplasts had photosynthetic activity, Hill’s Reaction must be considered. Hill’s Reaction is the general process of electron transfer that happens when there is the presence of light, active chloroplasts, and DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol), which acts as an electron acceptor. DCPIP reduction is measured as a decrease in absorption at 600nm, which ultimately indicates photosynthetic activity [Johnson:2017]. Photosynthesis is affected by various cofactors including light and chlorophyll. Photosynthesis cannot proceed without the presence of light, and it also requires chloroplasts to convert the light energy to glucose which can be used for further processes in the cell. The number of chloroplasts present in the cell is an important factor when considering photosynthesis. When there are more chloroplasts present, there is a larger area for photosynthesis to take place, and therefore the rate of photosynthesis increases. Another factor that influences photosynthesis is salinity in relation to the chloroplasts. When there are more Na+ and Cl- ions present in the cell, this causes the stomata to close and inhibits the flow of CO2 into the cell. CO2 is required for photosynthesis to begin, and therefore when NaCl is introduced into the cell a decrease in photosynthesis is expected [Brugnoli, et. al.: 1991]. It is hypothesized that when a 10% saline solution is introduced to Spinacia oleracia the observed absorbance will decrease and the percent change of the absorbances will increase, indicating that the rate of photosynthesis has also decreased. 

Materials and Methods:
Four leaves of Spinacia oleracia were deveined and washed then placed in a mortar and pestle along with 20mL of grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Once it was ground up, the mixture was strained with a cheesecloth and the liquid was collected. The liquid was transferred into a centrifuge tube and then centrifuged at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4℃. This liquid was then poured into a second tube and centrifuged again at 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4℃. Again, the liquid was poured into a third tube, while carefully ensuring that the pellet was not disturbed. 20mL of grinding buffer was added to the tube with the pellet. Based on earlier experimentation, it can be assumed that this last samle, “B Pellet,” had the most chloroplasts present and was therefore used for the rest of the experiment. 10 test tubes were used - 1 blank, 3 with no chloroplasts, 3 with chloroplasts, and 3 with chloroplasts and the saline solution. The blank received 8mL of water, and 2mL of the reaction buffer. Tubes 2-7 contained 6mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL of the reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Tubes 8-10 contained 5mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, 2mL of the reaction buffer, and 2mL of the 10% salt solution. Tubes 4-10 and the blank then received 100µL of the enriched chloroplasts. Each test tube was mixed immediately. Each of the mixtures was then transferred into cuvettes and the absorbances were taken on the spectrophotometer beginning with the blank. The samples were then placed in the light for 10 minutes before retaking the absorbances. This was repeated twice more after intervals of 10 minutes, resulting in a total of 30 minutes before the final absorbance was taken. From here the percent change of the absorbances for each test tube could be calculated. Once the raw data was obtained, a two sample one-tailed t-test was ran to compare the chloroplast solution without the salt solution and the chloroplast solution with the salt solution.

Results:
The chloroplasts introduced to a saline environment showed a lower percent change in absorbance than the chloroplasts in a non-saline environment after letting both sets sit under a light for 30 minutes. The chloroplasts in the salt solution as well as the chloroplasts without the salt solution had an overall increase in absorbance rate, with the chloroplasts in the salt solution showing a slightly larger increase. This is evidenced in Figure 1, where it can be seen that the control group which had no salt solution had a percent change of approximately 95% and the group with the salt solution introduced had a percent change of approximately 85%. There was a p-value of 0.4364 for this data and a calculated t-stat of -0.1672, meaning that the data was not statistically significant.


Discussion:
The experiment did not support the hypothesis that the absorbances of the chloroplasts in the salt solution would decrease and the percent change of the absorbances would increase. Along with this, the calculated p-value was very high at 0.4364, meaning that the data was not significant. The negative t-stat value of -0.1672 indicated that the sample mean was less than the hypothesized mean, which contradicts our hypothesis. This is also a very low number, which also shows that the data is not significant. Because of this, no conclusions can be drawn from this experiment regarding how salinity affects the absorbance rate of chloroplasts, and therefore rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracia. A previous study testing photosynthesis in the leaves of salt stressed spinach leaves provided similar results, stating that salinity does not greatly decrease the photosynthetic ability in leaves of spinach. This study was also able to account for stomatal inhibition by the NaCl in determining their conclusions by using a leaf disc O2 electrode [Robinson, et. al.: 1983]. Another study looked at the effects of salinity on various factors including photosynthetic ability, but it argued that photosynthesis is not directly impacted by higher levels of salinity. Instead it states that salinity quickens the process of death in the plant’s leaves, which causes the leaves to fall off and lose a portion of its important hormones and structures, therefore affecting growth [Munns : 1993]. This could provide a different explanation for the overall effects of salinity on plants disregarding photosynthesis, which would potentially explain why there was not a significant difference in the data that was obtained since it only looked at chloroplast activity and therefore photosynthesis. In future studies to improve the experiment, it could be carried out with a higher concentration of NaCl solution, such as 40% or 50% in order to see a greater change between the control and the variables. In addition, the experiment could be carried out with various different concentrations of NaCl such as 10%, 25%, and 50% to see how the rate of photosynthesis is affected differently. Another study looked at the effects of Selenium when introduced to salt-stressed tomato plants. It was concluded that Selenium has the ability to aid in maintaining and raising the rate of photosynthesis in this particular plant, which is a potential follow-up experiment that could be done to see how Selenium may affect salt-stressed spinach [Diao: 2014]. This experiment has important larger-scale implications because the data would be able to indicate where geographically is best to grow certain plants, such as spinach, based on the salinity in the soil and the plant’s response to salinity in regard to photosynthesis.   By producing plants that have high rates of photosynthesis, the overall plant health and growth will increase, which in turn provides agriculturists with better crops to sell to the public.
