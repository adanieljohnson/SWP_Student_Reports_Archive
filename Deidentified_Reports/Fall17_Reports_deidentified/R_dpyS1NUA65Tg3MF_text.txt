Title: Comparing Metabolic Rate in Procambarus spp in Distilled and Carbonated Water

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to study how different aqueous environments affect the specific metabolic rate in Procambarus spp, or the common crawfish. This experiment involved the use of 3 Procambarus spp, and measured their oxygen consumption in a normal room temperature water solution, and a solution that had been diluted with 100 mL of carbonated water. It was hypothesized that when in the solution with carbonated water, the Procambarus spp would experience an increase in specific metabolic rate, as the increased molecular presence in the water makes it more difficult for the Procambarus spp to pull oxygen from the surrounding water across their gill membranes. However, the results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis and were instead highly inconclusive. Only one group supported the hypothesis, while the other 2 groups did not. This suggests that there was some form of researcher error in the experiment and that it needs to be redone in order to produce more accurate results. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we are observing metabolic rate in Procambarus spp, and how it changes in different aqueous environments. Metabolic rate will be determined by measuring oxygen consumption, determined by measuring the change in oxygen consumption of the system. This lab will compare the metabolic rate of Procambarus spp in normal room temperature water, and water that has been diluted with 100 mL of carbonated water. This phenomenon of elevated CO¬2 content in water, or hypercapnia, is being observed all over the world, making this experiment relevant to our current society (Pörtner et al). Hypercapnia is becoming more common as CO2 content of the atmosphere is rising due to global warming, causing the CO2 content of water to also rise. 
Oxygen consumption is the most accurate way to measure metabolic rate, as oxygen is required for cellular respiration, and its intake is directly proportional to energy expenditure. Hypercapnia leads to reduced performance and movement in organisms, causing them to expend more energy in order to the same tasks (Dissanayake). While this has not been studied before directly in Procambarus spp, it is believed that these same effects should be seen in this experiment. Therefore, it is hypothesized that increasing the CO2 content of the water will cause metabolic rate to rise, as the Procambarus spp has to work harder to pull oxygen from the surrounding water and diffuse it across its gill membranes (Haak). 


Materials and Methods:
	Gather 3 crawfish of about equal size and weigh them.
	Take one crawfish and place it in a full mason jar of room temperature water. 
	Seal off the mason jar entirely with the oxygen reader inside, and read the starting O2 content. 
	Read the O2 content of the water every 5 minutes for the next 20 and record the results. 
	When 20 minutes has passed, record the volume of water in the mason jar. 
	Repeat steps 2-5 for the other two crawfish. 
	Then, take the first crawfish again and place him a mason jar filled with 100 mL of carbonated water and the rest filled with room temperature water. 
	Once again, seal off the system entirely with the oxygen reader inside and read the initial O2 content of the water. 
	Read the O2 content of the system every 5 minutes for the next 20 and record the results. 
	After 20 minutes has passed, record the volume of liquid in the mason jar and determine the carbonated water content of the system. 
	Repeat steps 7-10 for the other 2 crawfish. 
	Once all results are recorded, calculate specific metabolic rate in each crawfish for the control and experimental procedures. Specific metabolic rate will be calculated using the formula SMR=((∆O2 × Volume H2O (mL)) )/((Time × Weight (g))
	Run a paired t-test to determine the statistical difference between the control and experiment group.


Results:
The results of this experiment are highly inconclusive. The paired t-test produced a p-value of 0.511. This p-value shows that there is a minimal correlation between the control and experiment groups and that increased carbon dioxide content of the water may not necessarily lead to a higher metabolic rate.

Discussion:
As can be seen in Table 1, Table 2, and Figure 1, the results of this experiment are highly inconclusive. While crawfish 1 supported the hypothesis by experiencing a higher specific metabolic rate when in the carbonated water, both crawfish 2 and crawfish 3 produced results that did not. In fact, crawfish 2 and crawfish 3 had significantly lower specific metabolic rates after being placed in the carbonated water solution. Crawfish 1 is also the only experiment that produced results conclusive with other research, as the increased CO¬2 content in water should cause an increase in metabolic rate, as it is more energy is required for cellular respiration (Pörtner et al). 
The error in crawfish 2 and crawfish 3 could have occurred for a variety of reasons. The most likely is that there was a leak in the system that allowed excess O2 to enter, affecting the O2 content of the water. If this error occurred, it is on the researchers. More trials need to be carried out in a more vigilant manner in order to prevent this type of error from occurring. The only other way that O2 may have entered the system is if there was an issue with the oxygen reader and the cap on the mason jar that allowed O2 to leak into the system. Regardless, future experiments should test more crawfish and be done in a more careful manner to ensure more accurate results and the elimination of any researcher induced error.
