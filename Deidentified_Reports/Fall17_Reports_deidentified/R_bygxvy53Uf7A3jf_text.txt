Title: Carbonated Water does not create a significent difference in the Oxygen Consumption of Procambris When Compared to Aerated Water 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied how two different environments would affect the standard metabolic rate of Procambris, specifically, oxygen consumption. The independent variables used were room temperature aerated water and carbonated water. We hypothesized that if the respiratory medium changed from room temperature aerated water to room temperature carbonated water, there would be a change in the rate of metabolism in Procambris. The experiment involved each of the three Procamabrus being put in a test chamber with either the aerated water or the carbonated water for 20 minutes. During that time, the chamber was set in a dishpan filled with either aerated water or carbonated water respectively.  We recorded the amount of oxygen that was consumed at five-minute intervals for 20 minutes using an oxygen probe. After, completing the experiment we conducted a two-tailed t_test and found that the p_value was 0.2107 and thus there was no significent difference found between oxygen consumption in aerated water and carbonated water. 


Introduction:
This experiment was an independent study done in order to study how different respiratory mediums would affect the oxygen consumption of Procambris.  Before completing this lab, my group and I looked at how different sizes of Procambris metabolic rate would be effected by changes in water temperature. Afterwards, we decided to conduct a similar experiment, however instead of studying changes in temperature, we studied changes between different respiratory mediums: room temperature aerated water and room temperature carbonated water. We know that metabolic rate is affected by changes in temperature—as the environmental temperature increases, the rate of metabolism in ectotherms increases. However, we want to know if being put in carbonated water will affect the metabolic rate. According to an article that looked at the effects of increased carbon dioxide in fish, high levels of carbon dioxide in water led to reduced mortality and grown rates (Baumann: 2012). As one’s mass increases their metabolic rate increases. However, if the growth rate decreases then the standard metabolic rate will decrease. It must be noted that a different time scale was used in this experiment versus the one used in our experiment. However, based on this information, we hypothesized that if changed the respiratory medium was changed from room temperature aerated water to room temperature carbonated water, there will be a change in the rate of metabolism in Procambris. 


Materials and Method:
1.	Obtain 3 crayfish 
2.	Begin with room temperature aerated water 
3.	Fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that had been saturated with air then set the test chamber into an empty plastic dishpan 
4.	Weigh a crayfish then gently place in the test chamber and screw the top 
5.	When top is secure, gently fill the container with water so the top overflows slightly 
6.	Place the entire tank set up to the neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature water 
7.	Insert the dissolve oxygen probe into the top of the chamber
8.	Turn on the instrument and let the reading stabilize 
9.	Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration 
10.	At 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes, read the oxygen concentration again then remove the probe
11.	Determine the volume of water the crayfish was in during the experiment by pouring it into a graduated cylinder 
12.	For carbonated water, refill the chamber with carbonated water and submerge the chambers in a carbonated water bath 
13.	Repeat steps 6-11 for the Procambris in the carbonated water 
14.	Repeat this experiment 3 times twice on each Procambris with both types of water 
Clean up the area and calculate the specific metabolic rate 

Results:
When initially putting the Procambris into the chamber, the starting oxygen (in mg/L) for the three in aerated water were: 8.49, 8.86, and 8.16. For the three in carbonated water, the starting oxygen (in mg/L) were: 7.87, 8.26, and 8.23. After 20 minutes, the oxygen consumption for the Procambris in aerated water was: 8.15, 8.05, and 7.89. For the three in carbonated it was: 7.51, 7.83, and 7.75. Additionally, we found that the specific metabolic rate in aerated water for the 3 Procambris were 0.00049, 0.00111, and 0.0015 respectively. In carbonated water, the specific metabolic rate was 0.000521, 0.000583, and 0.000831 respectively. The dilution concentration of carbonated water for the 3 Procambris were 11.2%, 11.4%, and 11.2% respectively. Finally, after completing the two-tailed t_test we found that the p_value was 0.2107 meaning there was no significent difference found between the oxygen consumption of the Procambris in aerated water and carbonated water. 


Discussion:
	While there was a change in the oxygen consumed between the two respiratory mediums, there was not enough for there to be significent difference because the p_value was 0.2107. However, between still water and carbonated water, carbonated water had a lower starting oxygen consumption and ending oxygen consumption. Furthermore, the specific metabolic rate was lower when the Procambris was in the carbonated water. This was true among all 3 Procamabrus. According to an article that reviewed the effect of carbon dioxide on microbial growth, carbon dioxide has negative effects on biochemical pathways.  High levels of carbon dioxide interferences are thought to constitute a stress on the system and lead to a slowing growth rate (Daniels: 1984). This means that increased amounts of carbon dioxide could affect the respiratory system, which could impact oxygen consumption. This is what is observed in our experiment, a reduced oxygen consumption with the Procambris in the carbonated water. However, there was just not a large amount of change for it to be considered significent 
	We had two limitations in our experiment. The first was that instead of using carbonated water from a new can every time, we used the same can for the first 2 Procambris. This could have led to a loss of carbonation since it was exposed to the environment. The second limitation was when in the carbonated water, the Procambris seemed to be under a lot of stress, which could’ve affected the oxygen consumption.
	If we were to do another experiment, I would change the independent variable to darkness and see how the oxygen consumption would change then. This would allow us to compare how different changes in the environment impact the Procambris oxygen consumption.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The figure above illustrates the difference between the specific metabolic rate among the 3 Procambris in the 2 respiratory mediums. The numbers at the top of each bar is the specific metabolic rate. There was no significent difference between the oxygen consumption in aerated water and carbonated water since the p_value was greater than 0.05.
