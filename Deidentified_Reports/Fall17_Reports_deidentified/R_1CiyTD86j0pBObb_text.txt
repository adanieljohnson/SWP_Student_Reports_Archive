Title: The Effects of an Acidic Environment on the Metabolic Rate of Procambris Sp.

Abstract:
The specific metabolic rate of three Procambris sp. is measured in an approximately neutral environment with a pH of 6.2 and in an acidic environment with a pH of 3.0708. To measure the specific metabolic rate, the oxygen consumption of each crayfish is measured. The researchers expected a lower rate of oxygen consumption and lower specific metabolic rate in the acidic environment. The average specific metabolic rate after twenty minutes in water is 9.99 * 10-4 mg of O2/(min *g of crayfish). The average specific metabolic rate after twenty minutes in an acidic solution is 2.63 * 10-4 O2/(min *g of crayfish). The average specific metabolic rate after ten minutes in water is 1.02 * 10-3 mg of O2/(min *g of crayfish). The average specific metabolic rate after twenty minutes in an acidic solution is 3.02 * 10-4 mg of O2/(min *g of crayfish). Between the two groups there was no statistical difference in specific metabolic rate after ten minutes which had a p_value of 0.0865. There was also no statistical difference in specific metabolic rate after twenty minutes which had a p_value of 0.0649. The controlll group was the crayfish in a neutral environment and the experimental group was the crayfish in an acidic environment.

Introduction:
Metabolism is the process of capturing, converting, and transferring energy. ATP synthesis is directly related to this energy transfer. ATP synthesis occurs through converting glucose into energy which produces COâ‚‚ and also releases electrons into the electron transport system. These electrons turn ADP into ATP and the amount of ATP formed is directly proportional to oxygen consumption. Therefore, oxygen consumption is directly proportional to metabolic rate. [Sadava: 2017] In a previous experiment, researchers measured the impact of various pH levels on the metabolic rate of the freshwater crayfish, Cherax destructor. These researchers found that in a more acidic environment the oxygen intake and therefore metabolic rate decreased. [Ellis: 1994] The researchers are examining the relationship between acidity of the environment that the Procambris sp. is in and the crayfish's specific metabolic rate by measuring oxygen consumption. The independent variable is the acidity of the crayfish's environment and the dependent variable is its oxygen consumption and subsequently its specific metabolic rate. The researchers believe that acidic conditions will decrease oxygen consumption and the specific metabolic rate of crayfish.

Materials and Method:
The researchers are going to measure the specific metabolic rate of crayfish exposed to two different pH levels at room temperature. To vary the acidity, the researchers will be using 100 Ml of a 3pH buffer solution and mixing it with 900 Ml of water. A probe will be used to test its pH. To measure the specific metabolic rate, oxygen levels will be measured in a test chamber. The oxygen consumption of three crayfish will be measured first in approximately neutral water with a pH of 6.2 and then the oxygen consumption of those same three crayfish will be measure in an acidic solution with a pH of 3.0708. To compare the controlll group (the specific metabolic rate of crayfish in a neutral environment) and the experimental group (the specific metabolic rate of crayfish in an acidic environment) a two-tailed paired two test was used.

Results:
For the first crayfish after twenty minutes the specific metabolic rate in water was 6.08 times its specific metabolic rate in an acidic solution. For the second crayfish after twenty minutes the specific metabolic rate in water was 4.53 times its specific metabolic rate in an acidic solution. For the third crayfish after twenty minutes the specific metabolic rate in water was 2.20 times its specific metabolic rate in an acidic solution. On average, the specific metabolic rate of crayfish after twenty minutes in water was found to be 3.81 times their specific metabolic rate after twenty minutes in an acidic solution. The difference in specific metabolic rate between the neutral environment and the acidic environment after twenty minutes had a p_value in the two-tailed paired t_test of 0.0649. For the first crayfish after ten minutes the specific metabolic rate in water was 2.20 times its specific metabolic rate in an acidic solution. For the second crayfish after ten minutes the specific metabolic rate in water was 3.45 times its specific metabolic rate in an acidic solution. For the third crayfish after ten minutes the specific metabolic rate in water was 4.34 times its specific metabolic rate in an acidic solution. On average, the specific metabolic rate of crayfish after ten minutes in water was found to be 3.38 times their specific metabolic rate after ten minutes in an acidic solution. The difference in specific metabolic rate between the neutral environment and the acidic environment after ten minutes had a p_value in the two-tailed paired t_test of 0.0865.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that acidic conditions will decrease oxygen consumption and the specific metabolic rate of crayfish, was supported by the experiment, but not statistically supported as it is hard to achieve statistical significance with only three pairs. On average, after twenty minutes, specific metabolic rate in water was 3.806 times the specific metabolic rate in an acidic environment. The difference in specific metabolic rate between a neutral environment and an acidic environment after twenty minutes was shown to be statistically insignificent as the p_value in the two-tailed paired t_test was 0.0649. Additionally, on average, after ten minutes, specific metabolic rate in water was 3.375 times the specific metabolic rate in an acidic environment. The difference in specific metabolic rate between a neutral environment and an acidic environment after ten minutes was also shown to be statistically insignificent as the p_value in the two-tailed paired t_test was 0.0865. The researchers believe that the acidic environment slowed the aerobic and anaerobic pathways. In a previous experiment it has been shown that an acidic environment produces stress-induced hyperglycemia in Cherax destructor. The decrease in the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. in an acidic environment is used to conserve ATP. Higher levels in glucose means that glycolysis has decreased and that movement of glucose has to slow to match this slowed rate. [Ellis: 1994] This accounts for the slowed rate of oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate. The next step in this experiment might be to investigate the effects of a basic environment on the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp..
