Title: The Effect of Light Intensity on Photosynthetic Rate in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal light intensity for the highest rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea.  Based off of previous studies, the hypothesis was that if spinach chloroplasts were placed in different light intensities, than there would be an optimal light intensity for photosynthetic activity, and this intensity would not be the highest nor the lowest tested.  This was tested by placing centrifuged chloroplast solutions from Spinacia oleracea in conditions varying in light intensity, and measuring their percent change in absorbance every 10 minutes over a span of 30 minutes.  After experimentation the percent change in absorbance of the chloroplasts increased as the light intensity of the conditions increased, which caused the hypothesis to be rejected.  However, previous similar studies had results that we predicted, so further testing should be conducted.  

Introduction:
The organism Spinacia oleracea belongs to the kingdom Plantae; it is a common crop grown in cool-weather and either full sun or partial shade, and is used as a food source [Bonnie Plants: 2011].  Since Spinacia oleracea is a plant, it contains cells that carry out photosynthesis, the process through which select light energy, water, and carbon dioxide are used to synthesize glucose.  These cells carry out photosynthesis in an organelle called the chloroplast.  Chloroplasts contain flattened sac-like structures called thylakoids, and the membrane of these thylakoids contains a number of protein complexes, including photosystems I and II.  To initiate the first step of photosynthesis, the light reactions, the chlorophyll pigment in photosystem II called P680 absorbs photons of light, which excites electrons that are passed down to the other protein complexes through an electron transport chain and eventually contribute to producing ATP and NADPH.  These products from the light reactions are then used as energy sources in the dark reactions of photosynthesis to make glucose [Iwasa and Marshall: 2016].  
As seen in a study by Dr. Bohning and Dr. Burnside, there is an optimal light intensity for the rate of photosynthesis in sun plants such as Spinacia oleracea.  Furthermore, they found that as light intensity increases the photosynthetic rate increases until a certain optimal value, after which the photosynthetic rate plateaus and eventually decreases.  [Bohning & Burnside: 1956].  
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the optimal value of light for the highest rate of photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleracea.  This will be determined by varying the independent variable, the light intensity the chloroplasts are exposed to, and using the percent change in absorbance of chloroplast activity as a measurement for photosynthetic activity of the organism’s chloroplasts, the dependent variable.  Based off of previous findings such as Bohning and Burnsides, the hypothesis is that if spinach chloroplasts are placed in different light intensities (the independent variable), than there will be an optimal light intensity for photosynthetic activity (the dependent variable), and this intensity will not be at the highest and lowest value tested.    

Materials and Methods:
 The spinach leaves were bought from the local grocery store and refrigerated for 24 hours before beginning the experiment.  First, the mortar and pestle, the beaker and the centrifuge tubes were set on crushed ice, while four spinach leaves were deveined.  These spinach leaves were then ground in a mortar and pestle with 10 mL of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0).  An additional 10 mL of grinding buffer was added to the mixture and it was ground until it became soupy with no precipitate.  This liquid mixture was then poured into a centrifuge tube and was centrifuged for 3 minutes at 200 x G (1200 rpm).  Then, the liquid from the centrifuge was poured into a different centrifuge tube and centrifuged again for 10 minutes at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm), and the resulting supernatant was set aside.  
After centrifuging, fifteen test tubes were labeled 1–15.  Then, the following mixture was added to these test tubes: 6 mL of water,  2 mL of DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5).  In this experiment, DCPIP is the reactant that allowed us to obtain visual results.  When DCPIP enters the electron transport chain of the chloroplasts, it accepts the electrons excited by the light, causing it to become reduced.  This reduction causes the DCPIP to turn from blue to colorless, and this color change is can be detected by a spectrophotometer [Harrison, R.P: 1989].  Another test tube mixture was made with 8 mL of water and 2 mL of the reaction buffer which served as a blank for the spectrophotometer and was labeled accordingly.  
After all of the test tubes were prepared 100 μl of the prepared supernatant containing the chloroplasts was added to each test tube using a micropipette, and each test tube was immediately shaken.  After being shaken the mixtures were each poured into a separate cuvette about three quarters full and starting with the blank their absorbance was taken with a spectrophotometer set at 600nm.  These values were recorded as an initial value and the cuvettes were placed in the following conditions: cuvettes 1–3 were placed under the 1630 lumen bulb, cuvettes 4–6 were placed under the 890 lumen light, cuvettes 7–9 and the blank were placed in the room’s light as controlled conditions, cuvettes 10-12 were placed under a lamp of 690 lumens weaker than the room’s light, and cuvettes 13-15 were placed in complete darkness.  Every 10 minutes the absorbance of each cuvette was taken until 30 minutes passed.  After the 30 minutes had passed the percent change of each cuvette was calculated using formula 1.  Finally, the results were recorded and analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired t-test.  

Formula 1. Percent Change of Absorbance (%)
Percent Change (%)=[(Absorbance at time ‘N’)/(Absorbance at time zero)]x100%




Results:
The chloroplast percent change in absorbance of light was highest at 1630 lumens with an average increase of 85.74% ∓ 15. 36, the second highest was at 890 lumens with an average increase of 77.17%∓27.56, the third was at 600 lumens with an average increase of 69.86%∓1.067, the second lowest at the room lighting with an average increase of 50.26%∓4.761, and the chloroplast absorbance was lowest in the dark conditions with an average decrease of 3.567%∓1.413.  The statistical analysis through the t-test resulted as follows: the 1630 lumen group was statistically significant with t(4)=3.99, p=0.016, the 890 lumen group was statistically insignificant with t(4)=2.64, p=0.057, the 600 lumen group was statistically significant with t(4)=6.96, p=0.002, and the dark group was statistically significant with t(4)=-52.6, p=0.000.  


Discussion:
The results found rejected the biological hypothesis that there would be an optimal light intensity for photosynthetic activity that was neither the highest nor the lowest light intensity.  As seen in Figure 1, the percent change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in increasing order were: the dark conditions, the chloroplasts in the room’s lighting, the chloroplasts under 600 lumens, the chloroplasts under 890 lumens, the chloroplasts under 1630 lumens. Therefore, the chloroplasts under the highest light intensity had the highest rate of photosynthesis. 
The results did not correlate with the hypothesis nor with the results from Bohning and Burnside’s study, which stated that photosynthetic rate plateaus and decreases after a certain optimal intensity in multiple species of sun and shade plants [Bohnig and Burnside: 1956].  However, Gauslaa and Solhaug’s study found that at a high enough light intensity, in their experiment 1000µmol photons, or 820, 000 lumens, the chlorophyll was bleached, or damaged by the light and in result could not function, causing the decrease in rate of photosynthesis seen in Bohning and Burnside’s study [Gauslaa and Solhaug: 2000].  Likewise, another experiment studying photobleaching in spinach found that photobleaching can begin to occur around 650µmol photons, 324, 000 lumens [Yamashita et. al: 1968].  
The findings on photobleaching found in these studies may have accounted for a source of error in our experiment.  The highest light intensity used was only 1630 lumens, which was not high enough to cause photobleaching in the chloroplast, resulting in the chloroplast under the highest light intensity having the highest rate of photosynthesis rather than what was predicted.  
Another unexpected finding was that the cuvettes turned clear after only 20 minutes rather than the expected 30 minutes, which caused the experiment to end early since the spectrophotometer could not pick up on any more absorbance changes once the solutions were clear.  This may also have served as a source of error in our experiment since the chloroplasts were only exposed to the light for 20 minutes rather than 30, which may not have been enough time for photobleaching to occur.  Lastly, the data from the 800 lumens group was found to be insignificant due to an outlier, which made the results less reliable.  
In order to obtain more accurate results, the experiment should be repeated with the chloroplasts exposed to the light for a longer period of time and the highest light intensity used should be above 320, 000 lumens.  With the results from this future study photosynthetic rate can be manipulated using light intensity.  This may allow further experiments on the effect of photosynthesis in spinach to be done efficiently or may allow spinach to be grown in conditions for optimal growth.
