Title: The Effect of Food Presence on the Aggression Levels of Betta splendens

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied the impact of food presence on the aggression behaviors and levels in Betta splendens, more commonly known as ‘Betta fish’. Betta fish display broadside and facing movements in the presence of other male Betta fish in order to intimidate and express aggression levels. Focal fish and a long-term opponent fish were exposed to each other (with a glass divider) for a time period and then separated by an opaque divider. A rest period was given and then food was introduced to the focal fish sector and the opaque divider was removed for the fish to display aggressive behaviors to each other, yet out of physical contact. We believed that the presence of food will affect the quantity of aggressive behaviors displayed in the male focal fish. The data was quantified by keeping a count of the quantity of each broadside aggressive behavior displayed and then multiplied by an ‘aggression level factor’ depending upon the behavior. Averages and standard deviations across food inclusion conditions were calculated. The results show that aggression levels decreased in the presence of food, concluding that the presence of food does indeed affect aggressive behaviors in Betta fish.


Introduction:
In this particular ethology lab, we focused on the animal behaviors of Betta splendens, more commonly known as ‘Betta fish’ or ‘Siamese fighting fish’. These organisms are particularly intriguing as the males are well known for their involvement in agonistic, intraspecific behavior. The two categories of movements that the fish utilize for intimidation and aggression purposes are broadside movements and facing movements. The broadside movements occur when a fish turns its’ side to an opponent and consists of pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements on the other hand occur head on and include erect pectoral fins, a spread opercula, and a protruding branchiostegal membrane producing a ‘red mane’. With this experiment, we tested how the absence and presence of food affects levels of aggression in males. We believed that the presence of food will indeed affect the quantity of aggressive behaviors displayed in the male focal fish as they will be focused on their resource of food and either prioritize it over territory or become protective of it and aggressively defend it. A previous study similar to ours contained reinforcers, including food, for swimming through a ring and down a runway [Hogan: 1967].


Materials and Methods:
Fill a tank with water and insert two sets of adjacent glass and opaque dividers, splitting the tank into three sections. Place three male betta fish of comparable size and color in each section. Remove one of the opaque dividers so the long-term opponent (middle) fish and one of the focal (adjacent) fish can see each other. Observe and record the quantity of the agonistic, broadside movements of the focal fish for five minutes. Replace the opaque divider and give the fish a five minute rest period. At the conclusion of the five minutes, give food to the focal fish and remove the opaque divider. Observe and record the quantity of the broadside behaviors of the focal fish for five minutes. Replace the opaque divider, implement a new focal fish, and give the fish a five minute break. Repeat this process with the same long-term opponent fish but implement a new focal fish each time (up to three total focal fish).

Results:
The following graph depicts the data collected from our experiment. We calculated the total number of aggression points for each broadside movement (multiply the quantity of pelvic fin flickering by one, tail beating by two, and tail flashing by three) for each fish. We then found the average of aggression points for the fish with food and the average of the fish without food. We also calculated the standard deviation of the averages along with the p-value of 0.031 using a two-tailed, two-sample t-test.


Discussion:
Following the conclusion of our experiment, we discovered that our hypothesis was supported by our data collected. The average aggression level (in points) of the focal fish in the presence of food (5.75 pts.) was in fact lower than when food was absent (28 pts.). Our p-value of 0.031 supports our findings in that our data is statistically significant. A variety of studies have been conducted to further the research behind animal behaviors and patterns, particularly involving Betta fish. In relation to our study regarding aggressive behaviors, one study dealt with female Betta fish and their aggressive behaviors in the presence of their own reflection (which they perceived to be another female competitor) [Elcoro: 2008]. Other studies could be carried out that place both fish in the presence of the same food or utilizing a female fish as a variable with the two males.
