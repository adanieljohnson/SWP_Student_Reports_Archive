Title: The Effect of Lidocaine on the Neuromuscular Control of Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
The organism that was used in this experiment was R. pipiens. It was hypothesized that since the opening of the sodium channels causes the membrane to depolarize, the force of muscle contraction post-injection would be less than the force of muscle contraction pre-injection of lidocaine. This would happen because the chemical would cause the sodium channels to open at a slower rate, cause the muscle to lose its ability to generate action potentials. This was accomplished by injecting a solution of 25mM Lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle of the R. pipiens, stimulating the sciatic nerve with electricity, and recording a baseline myogram. The hypothesis was not supported, but the trends in our data show that what we predicted would occur, as the chemical affected the amount of voltage that was needed to produce a threshold twitch of the muscle. The statistical test used for this was a paired t_test. 


Introduction:
The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of a sodium channel blocker on the neuromuscular controlll of Rania pipiens, a northern leopard frog [Encyclopedia Britannia: 2007]. R. pipiens was chosen for this experiment for a few reasons. This organism is ideal because it is small enough to fit a general myograph setup but is also big enough to be dissected fairly easily with human hands. It also provides easy access to the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle, which are two anatomical parts necessary for this experiment. The skeletal muscles of this organism are attached to the bones by connective tissue and are easily manipulated, as they lie close to the outside of the frog body. They are innervated by motor neurons that exist in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Throughout muscle contractions, many different structures of the neuron function to make contraction as effective and efficient as possible. The contraction of any muscle begins with an action potential that occurs at the muscle’s surface, travels from the neuron to the muscle’s outer membrane, through the membrane’s gated sodium channels, then into the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2017]. These sodium channels are opened by the binding of a ligand called Acetylcholine (ACh), which is released from the synaptic terminals in the neuron. This process changes the concentration gradient of the membrane in the gastrocnemus muscle. ACh binds to ligand-gated sodium channels on the sarcoplasmic membrane and helps to fire action potentials previously mentioned. Lidocaine is a known sodium channel blocker, which means that without it, the concentration gradient will not change and the membrane will not be able to further depolarize, and the action potential will not occur [Kovacs: 1985]. Therefore, slowing down the muscle contraction in the frog leg. Since Lidocaine is a chemical that would block the sodium channels on the membrane from opening, the membrane would not be able to release calcium. Therefore, the membrane will depolarize at a slower rate, which will in turn cause slower contractions in the gastrocnemus muscle of R. pipiens. For this reason, it was hypothesized that the muscle of R. pipiens will take longer to reach threshold contraction, after lidocaine is injected into its gastrocnemus muscle. 


Materials and Method:
In terms of materials, this lab required three different legs from R. pipiens, a myogram and a computer to run it on, and the chemical of choice (in this case: 25mM Lidocaine). First, we began by skinning the frog and peeling off the skin, revealing the muscles in the leg. Next, the triceps femoris and biceps femoris (two thigh muscles) were split in half, exposing the sciatic nerve. The Achilles tendon was then cut, but the gastrocnemus muscle was left attached.
A string was attached to the Achilles tendon, and the gastrocnemus muscle was attached and suspended to the force transducer and a ring stand, at a ninety-degree angle. The frog was then pinned down so that it would not fly around when the gastrocnemus muscle was stimulated and the contraction started. The first part of the contraction portion of this experiment that was necessary was to determine the threshold stimulus, the minimum stimulation needed to produce a twitch response in the leg. This was determined by isolating the sciatic nerve, and laying a stimulator electrode on the sciatic nerve in the frog leg, and sending electricity from a stimulator/amplifier through it. To determine threshold, the frog leg was stimulated at the lowest voltage possible (0.1V), and then increased by 0.1V until a twitch was seen. Next, the myographs were created to gauge when a response was produced in the muscle. To do this, the force transducer was connected to a computer program. 
Three baseline myographs in one leg were recorded (without the chemical), and then three more myographs were recorded after the muscle was fluid loaded with a chemical called Lidocaine, 25mM solution sodium channel inhibitor, which was prepared by dissolving 0.6g of lidocaine in 100Ml Ringer’s solution. Then we stimulated the leg with 0.4 volts of electricity, because that was stimulation required for threshold to occur. The threshold was found in the frog leg first without injecting lidocaine, and then after the lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle. These steps were repeated in two other frog legs. The myographs were compared and the amplitude of threshold contraction was noted and compared. A statistical paired t_test was performed to compare for each leg to determine significance of the data produced. 


Results:
The two frog legs that were tested showed that an increase in stimulus voltage was necessary for contraction to occur with the experimental group (post-injection of 25mM lidocaine solution). Pre-injection, the second leg needed 0.2 volts of stimulus to reach a contraction. Post-injection for the second leg, the stimulus was increased to 15V and still did not show any signs of contraction or threshold twitch. Pre-injection, the third leg displayed a threshold contraction at the same stimulus amplitude of 0.2V. Post-injection of lidocaine solution, the third leg required a stimulus voltage of 1.0V to reach a threshold contraction. The paired t_test showed that the P-value was 0.055052, the degrees of freedom was 5, and the t-value was 2.491619. This shows that the results are not statistically significent because the percent error is greater than 0.05. Graph 1 shows that the trends in our data show that what we predicted would occur, even though our results were not statistically significent. There are no error bars on the graph, because it is a line graph, and each is a single data point, which you don't use error bars for. 


Discussion:
The trends seen in the contractions of the second two legs show that what we predicted did in fact occur. The threshold voltage was found at a lower amplitude in both legs one and two, before the lidocaine was administered. For example, in the controlll group of the first leg, (stimulating the sciatic nerve without loading lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle), a twitch was seen with only 0.2V of stimulation. On the other hand, the experimental group in the first leg (stimulating the sciatic nerve after loading the gastrocnemus muscle with lidocaine) was not found. The stimulator/amplifier was only to stimulate up to 20V of electricity at one time, and even the highest stimulation amplitude did not produce a twitch of any kind in the frog leg. We think this is because the fluid loading of the lidocaine into the muscle, caused the sodium channels to open at a slower rate, which slowed down the rate of contraction. The closing of the channels caused the nerve to need a higher stimulus to cause contraction than it did pre-injection of the lidocaine, which explains why a threshold twitch was seen in the controlll groups of both legs, but not in the experimental groups of either leg. 
This belief is backed up in a study about the effects of sodium channel blockers on electrical field stimulation in guinea pigs. The study stated that the influx of sodium into the cell across the membrane is closely related to the release of Acetylcholine into the synapse, which eventually results in contraction of the muscle [Nakashima: 1990]. The sodium channels in the membrane are opened by the binding of a ligand called Acetylcholine (ACh), which is released from the synaptic terminals in the neuron. This process changes the concentration gradient of the membrane in the gastrocnemus muscle. ACh then binds to ligand-gated sodium channels on the sarcoplasmic membrane and helps to fire action potentials previously mentioned. So, if the sodium channels were blocked, the ACh must have also been slowed down, to slow down the muscle contractions of the frog leg as a whole. 
The first thing that must be discussed was the problem with the first leg we attempted to produce a contraction in. The threshold value was determined easily when the lidocaine was not present in the muscle. However, in the experimental group of the first leg, the stimulation produced a muscle amplitude almost twice that of the controlll group, at a lower voltage. This should not have happened, and could have happened for a couple of reasons. Possibly, because the tension on the string that was connected to the amplifier was too tight, and therefore oversensitive. It could also have been due to a problem with the way the lidocaine was loaded into the muscle, or because of a hypersensitive sciatic nerve. Therefore, we had to scrap the first leg altogether, and use the other two legs for our data. 
However, after the paired t_test was performed, it was revealed that our results were not statistically significent, as the P-value acquired from the statistical analysis was 0.055052. This is because the percent error is greater than 0.05. This means that our hypothesis was supported, and our data was right, but the results aren’t statistically significent because there wasn’t enough data for it to be relevant and fully prove our hypothesis. This means that our hypothesis was not supported, but trends in our data show what we predicted would occur did occur, so more data is needed to prove this. Those are the reasons why our data was statistically insignificent.

Figure Legends: 
Graph 1: shows the increase in stimulus voltage necessary to achieve a threshold twitch of contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of both frog legs. For leg 2, there is no value for contraction post-injection because it was stimulated as high as the force transducer would allow (15V) and still did not contract. Leg 3 showed an increase in stimulus voltage to achieve threshold from 0.2V to 1.0V.
