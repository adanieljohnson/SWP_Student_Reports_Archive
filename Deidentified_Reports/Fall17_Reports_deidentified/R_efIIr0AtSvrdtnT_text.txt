Title: How body size of betta splendins would affect the level of aggressive in behavior when male Betta fish encounter other male fish through measurement of the behavior in term of the lasting time of the aggressive behavior since the male fish noticed each other. 

Abstract:
Siamese fighting fish would show aggressive behavior toward territorial intruders. In order to determine whether body size would affect the level of aggressiveness of the behavior, we conduct an experiment to see if fish would show more aggressive behavior toward larger body size fish. The results show the mean of the small body size is statistically significently less than that of the mean of the large body size. Take that together, the hypothesis is supported by the data and Betta fish tend to show more aggressive behavior as longer lasting time toward larger body size fish.


Introduction:
Betta splendins, also called Siamese fighting fish, would present aggressive behavior toward territorial intruders. In our last experiment, we conclude that male Betta fish would show aggressive behavior more towards other male fish than female fish. Female fish, on the other hand, would not engage in aggressive behavior like male Betta fish do. Males were more aggressive towards male than female intruders and the level of aggression changed significently between reproductive phases. Gill flaring, the more energetically costly display, was the dominant initial display towards male and female intruders in BB, AS, AH phases. (before (BB) and after bubble nest building, and after spawning (AS), and hatching (AH).) [Forsatkar: 2017] 
This suggests the same as the previous experiment that we did that male fish would engage in gill flaring, protruding the branchiostegal membranes, when they encounter with other male fish. The results suggest that Siamese fighting fish use gill flaring as an acute response in order to defend their territory; this response may be replaced by fin spreading as a chronic response, probably to reduce the energetic costs during the contest. [Forsatkar: 2017] This suggest a good way to quantify the behavior between male Betta fish – the lasting time of aggressive behavior since they see each other and marked the gill flaring as the starting point. This time, we interest in how body size would affect the level of aggressive in behavior and with the above quantifying behavior method.


Materials and Method:
We wanted to see if there are tendency that betta fish would display aggressive behavior more often on a larger body size fish than a relatively smaller body size. We would use three kinds of fish in our experiment - small body size, medium body size, and large body size. Each larger body size is 15% larger than the smaller one. In order to rule out the factor of color, we use only blue Betta fish for this experiment. We take 6 medium size fishes (subject 1-6), one small fish, and one large fish. We focus on the medium size fish to see if there is a tendency to show aggressive behavior toward smaller size fish. Then, we conduct the experiment with each medium fish engage with both the small fish and the large fish physically separate with each other. We observe the lasting time of the aggressive behavior (often start with protruding the branchiostegal membranes) since two fish saw each other as a measurement of quantify behavior. We will run each trail in a transparent glass water tank with a glass in between two subjects for 5 minutes and have a rest of 5 minutes after each fish has a trail to prevent habituation. After collecting the data, we would use a paired t_test to process the data. The null hypothesis would be that the mean of aggressive behavior toward small body size fish is not statistically significently different than the aggressive behavior toward large body size fish. The alternative hypothesis would be the mean of aggressive behavior toward small body size fish is greater than the mean of aggressive behavior toward large body size fish.


Results:
Subject 1 and subject 3 show almost no interest in engaging aggressive behavior toward either smaller or larger body size fish. Therefore, we rule out their data when we do the statistic test. The p_values of paired t_test of the lasting time of the aggressive behavior toward relatively small size fish and relatively large size is approximately 0.098325 when we don’t take subject 1 and 3 out of consideration. When we take them out of the account, the p_values of the paired t_test is approximately 0.047508. With significance level being 0.05 and p_values being 0.047508, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean of lasting time of aggressive behavior toward the small body size fish is statistically significently less than that of the mean of lasting time of aggressive behavior toward the large body size fish. In short, our data supports the alternative hypothesis.


Discussion:
The outcome of the experiment is surprising because it seems on the opposite of the common sense. This brings us more interesting topic for the future study. Since Betta fish now tend to show higher level of aggressiveness in behavior toward larger body size fish, other factors could be accounted for such situation. Forsatkar suggests that temperature may be one of those factors. Those individuals exposed to increased temperatures reduced their latency to leave the release area (area I), spent more time in area III (farthest from release area), and were more active overall; together we infer these behaviors to reflect an increase in general ‘boldness’ with increased temperature. [Forsatkar: 2017] In this experiment, we rule out the factor of color. However, there are still differences between parts of the fishes. We don’t know what part of fish will other fish notice first when they choose to engage in aggressive behavior with the other fish. For further study, we could take down color into different body parts for consideration of the level of the aggressiveness in behavior.
