Title: The Effects of Visibility on the Agonistic Displays of Betta splendens

Abstract:
 Much of what we know about the behavior of Siamese fighting fish or Betta splendens is based on observations of interactions in high visibility conditions. However, Betta splendens’ original native habitat is not a fish bowl but rather the slow moving or stagnant water of flood plains and canals. This study is focused on learning more about Betta splendens behavior in a more real world environment. We selected Betta splendens for their obvious displays of aggressive or agonistic behavior. We hypothesized that the visibility of the environment will impact the agonistic behavior in male-male Betta splendens interactions. We found that low visibility environments significantly reduced agonistic behavior displays (t-stat=3.193, df=4 , P=0.017). We conclude that the visibility of the environment decreases aggressive behavior in Betta splendens.

Introduction:
Animal behaviors are able to reveal much about the way organisms have evolved and how their physiological features make them suitable for their niche. Observing how animals interact with other members of their species, intraspecific behavior, is useful in understanding the factors and environments that impact the animal’s fitness. In this study we will be using Betta splendens as a model for studying the impact of environment on agonistic or aggressive behaviors. Betta splendens have been artificially selected for their aggressiveness and bright colors and are often referred to as “fighting fish”. This makes Betta splendens an Ideal choice for studying agonistic behaviors since they have exaggerated agonistic behaviors that are easily observed. Betta splendens behavior is classified into two types: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are comprised of pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing each more aggressive than the last. Facing movements are conducted head on with an opponent rather than displaying a side and consist of erect pectoral fins, spreading of opercula, and the protrusion of branchiostegal membranes to form a red mane. Other agonistic behaviors exist outside of these categories as well such as darting biting opponent [Johnson AD:2017]. Betta splendens exhibit their agonistic behavior when stimulated by seeing another Betta splendens [Thompson:1965]. In the absence of any visual stimuli, Betta splendens typically do not display any aggressive behaviors. Our hypothesis states that the visibility of the environment impacts the aggressive behavior in male-male Betta splendens interactions.


Materials and Methods:
We used three male Betta splendens of similar color and size for this study. These Betta splendens were stored in a three chambered tank with removable opaque and clear glass divisions and clear room temperature water. The Betta splendens behavior was then observed by removing one of the opaque divisions allowing two of the fish to see each other through the clear glass divider but not physically interact. The interactions went as follows: subject 1 & subject 2, Subject 2 & subject 3, and subject 1 & subject 3. The interactions lasted for 5 minutes and a 10 minute rest period of no stimulation was given between them. We used a weighted point system to quantify the Betta splendens interactions. A tail flash was worth one point, opening of Branchiostegal membrane was worth two points, and biting at the glass divider was worth 3 points. We assigned the points based on the observed aggressiveness of each behavior in previous experiments. The lower points were given to behaviors that we observed done with less stimulation and therefore less aggressive (e.g. the Betta splendens were observed tail flashing almost immediately after seeing another male through glass but didn’t open branchiostegal membranes or start biting until they had more stimulation from the encounter and often didn’t make it to those agonistic displays). Each of the three behaviors observed are considered the most agonistic in their category. We defined overall aggressiveness of the interaction as the sum of points from both Betta splendens. 
	After conducting the control interaction in the clear water the Betta splendens were moved to a tank of murky water. The murky water was prepared by mixing 40ml of dirt with 4 liters of room temperature water and stirring. The murky water was then added to a similar three chambered tank and the Betta splendens where moved into their chambers and given 10 minutes to acclimate to the new conditions. We then repeated the interactions done in the clear water and used to same weighted point system to quantify their agonistic behavior. We used a two-sample t-test of the average points in clear vs murky water for statistical analysis. 


Results:
Our two-sample t-test resulted in (t-stat=3.193, df=4 , P=0.017). The data shows more agonistic behavior in the clear water interactions, average of 114±50, than in the murky water, average of 1±1.41 (figure 1). In two out of the three murky water interaction neither of the Betta splendens displayed any of the three agonistic behaviors we were quantifying. 


Discussion:
Our data supports our hypothesis that environment visibility affects the agonistic behavior of male-male Betta splendens. Our Two sample T-test resulted in signifigance at an alpha value of 0.05 (t-stat=3.193, df=4 , P=0.017). This is likely the result of the lower visibility decreasing the visual stimulation of Betta splendens. Lower visibility makes colors appear less vibrant as light is blocked by dirt particles. Betta splendens are known to react to color especially the vibrant colors of other Betta splendens [Craft BB:2007]. The murky water also made it difficult for the Betta splendens to initially see each other. The time they had to interact was reduced because it took up to several minutes before they seemed to notice each other. Two of the Betta splendens appeared to either not notice each other or remain indifferent to the presence of the other in murky water. While the murky water did make it difficult for the Betta splendens to see the other’s color there was still enough light for the shape of the other male to be seen clearly. Fish shapes have been shown to elicit agonistic responses in Betta splendens it is possible that this might have been the cause of the agonistic display in the murky water [Romano D:2017]. However, our results suggest that shape alone is not a very impactful stimulus for Betta splendens. Another potential explanation of the decreased agonistic behavior is that the dirt particles in the water somehow impacted the Betta splendens ability to intake oxygen. Dirt entering their branchiostegal membranes or making it difficult from them to breath at the surface might have caused mild asphyxiation and reduced their ability to display aggression.
	A potential source of error in our study arises from our preparation of the murky water. Soil and water had to be thoroughly mixed which might have introduced increased dissolved oxygen into the water. This likely didn’t have a drastic effect on the experiment however since higher oxygen should make agonistic behavior easier to display. This could be addressed by measuring oxygen levels between the clear and murky water and letting them sit long enough to reach similar concentrations.  Further research could be conducted to determine if the dirt particles in the water impacted the Betta splendens oxygen uptake. This would allow us to determine how important visual stimuli are for aggression in Betta splendens. The effects of environment visibility on the behavior of aquatic life has relevant implications. Pollution and water treatment wastes entering aquatic ecosystems decreases the overall visibility of the water. While Betta splendens may not be an ideal model for wild aquatic life they do demonstrate that murky conditions can impact animal behavior. This study focused on aggressive behavior but reduction in other behaviors such as mating could be detrimental to aquatic life. The effects of environment visibility on aquatic life should be researched further. Specific studies such as the impact of environment visibility on mating and predation could be conducted on relevant model species to determine how aquatic species are being effected by pollution and how this may influence their future populations.
