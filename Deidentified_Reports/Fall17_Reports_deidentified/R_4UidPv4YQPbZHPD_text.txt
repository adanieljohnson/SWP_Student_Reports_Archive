Title: Effect of Temperature on Photosynthetic Rate Trends 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a metabolic reaction in which carbon dioxide and solar radiation are converted into glucose by a series of chemical reactions. In an experimental setting it is possible to determine photosynthetic rate using the Hill Reaction associated with the use of DCPIP which acts in place of NADPH as an electron carrier molecule. In photosynthesis NADPH is reduced and when DCPIP is reduced it goes through a color change, which allows changes in absorbance to be measured. It was hypothesized that the further the temperature was from room temperature the lower the rates of photosynthesis. The cold environment resulted in a nearly significent difference with a large difference in average absorbance after 30 minutes, while the hot environment was not significently different. Issues with lighting and duration of the incubation were  valid explanations for the lack of significance of the hot environment. It was concluded that cold temperatures had a greater effect on photosynthesis with a large decrease in rates, while heat did not have as great as an effect but should have based on primary research which lead to the conclusion that another test would need to be done to reach conclusions about heat’s effect on photosynthetic rate. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis, the process which converts light energy and carbon dioxide into glucose, is a process that relies on many different factors. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts use the green pigment chlorophyll in order to absorb solar energy, excited electron from the solar energy are then trapped by carrier molecules such as NADPH. These electrons are then transported to the electron transport chain which generates a proton gradient and regenerates electron carriers. ATP synthesis is powered by the proton gradient and the electrons from NADPH and ATP is used in chemical reactions that make glucose from carbon dioxide [Johnson: 2016]. In an experimental environment the chemical DCPIP can be used in place of NADPH in order to determine photosynthetic rate increase or decrease [Neumann: 1967]. This reaction is used because DCPIP is originally blue when added to solution but as it gets reduced the color fades, so when measuring absorbance’s, a decrease in absorbance’s signals an increase in photosynthesis because higher photosynthetic rates will result in more reduction of DCPIP [Johnson: 2016]. Because photosynthesis relies on many different chemical pathways as well as enzymatic reactions, it is logical to conclude that changing temperature would have an effect on photosynthetic rates. Previous research shows that photosystem II is the most heat sensitive part of photosynthesis so it is reasonable to test what the exact effects of varying temperatures is [Song: 2014]. To study the effect of temperature on photosynthetic rates, cold, hot and room temperature will be used, with a hypothesis that the further from room temperature, the more photosynthesis will decrease. The hot water bath will be at or above 43C because previous research indicates this temperature will affect photosynthesis [Song: 2014]. Spinach leaves will be used because chloroplasts are easily extracted from them. The independent variable is time with the absorbance of the DCPIP solution as the dependent variable. 


Materials and Method:
Initially in this experiment the central veins of four spinach leaves were removed, and then a chilled mortar and pestle was used in addition to 20 Ml of grinding buffer in order to create a thick paste of the spinach. The spinach was strained over cheese cloth and the resulting liquid was centrifuged once at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C, and the resulting supernatant was again centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. The pellet from the second centrifuge was re-suspended in grinding buffer. Ten test tubes were then labeled and in each tube 6 Ml of water was added, 2 Ml of 10 mM DCPIP (with exception of the blank tube), 2Ml of reaction buffer and 100 microliters of chloroplast solution (with exception of the negative controlll). The absorbance at 600 nm was recorded for each tube. The blank, negative controlll, and tubes 4-6 remain in room temperature (23 degrees Celsius), tubes 1-3 are put on ice (zero degrees Celsius), tubes 7-9 were put in a hot water bath (43 degrees Celsius). Every ten minutes for 30 minute the absorbance was recorded and the percent change was calculated between each time increment. Averages of each temperature tube and their standard deviations were calculated as well as a paired t_test. 


Results:
The results showed a large percent difference between time zero and time 30 at 35.09% difference, while both hot and room remained relatively constant as demonstrated in Figure 2. The average difference and standard deviations between the hot, cold and room temperature absorbance’s is shown in Figure 1. The paired t_test showed that the p_value between hot and room temperature was .2324 (t=.4852, d.f.=3). The paired t_test between the room and cold temperature resulted in a p value of .0656 (t=2.8401, d.f.=3).


Discussion:
The data partially supported the original hypothesis, with the p value for cold environment compared to room temperature being .06 which is very close to statistically significent, while the comparison between room temperature and hot environment was not statistically significent with a p value of .23. There are a few sources of error and potential changes that could result in statistically different data. The first being the lack of light on the hot tubes for the first ten minutes due to a lack of lamp, which could result in lower rates of photosynthesis which is demonstrated by the slight increase in absorbance. Also the samples were only chilled or heated for 30 minutes while in previous studies with statistical differences the samples were incubated for two 12 hour periods [Song: 2014]. The greatest decrease in photosynthetic was rates was evident in the cold environment which was predicted in the hypothesis and supported by other research. It had been found that chilling has a great effect on many aspects of photosynthesis including the electron transport chain, the carbon reduction cycle and controlll of stomatal conductance [Allen, 2001]. However, other studies also found significent difference in photosynthetic rates in extreme heat due to the heat’s effect on metabolic reactions within the pathway, which was not evident in this study but this lack of significance can be attributed to previously described errors [Ruelland: 2010]. In the future repeating this experiment with a longer incubation time with standard lighting conditions would produce more significent results backed by other studies. This study can be amplified to study the potential effects of climate change on plants across the globe. With temperatures rising and more bizarre extreme weather, temperature changes are now a matter of life and the more extreme they become, a large effect on photosynthesis could be seen as demonstrated in this experiment as well in the primary literature. If this experiment was taken further and the exact manner in which temperature change effected photosynthesis was studied, research as to genetic modifications that could create more temperature change resistant plants could also help ensure plant success in a changing climate or allow different plants to be grown in new places in the world.
