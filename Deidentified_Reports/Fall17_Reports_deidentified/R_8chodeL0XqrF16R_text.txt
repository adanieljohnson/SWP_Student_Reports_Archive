Title: Lidocaine Testing on The Rania Pipiens

Abstract:

	We did a study on the Northern Leopard Frog (Rania pipiens) to test the frequency at which the gastrocnemus muscle would twitch with and without lidocaine. We hypothesized that with lidocaine in the gastrocnemus muscle, the muscle would not twitch due to the blockage coming from lidocaine. To achieve this, we had to find a controlll frequency and tetany for the three frog legs and then test how they reacted when adding lidocaine to the gastrocnemus muscle. From injecting lidocaine to the gastrocnemus muscle, our hypothesis was supported that the lidocaine would block the muscle from twitching. From this we concluded that when lidocaine is injected into the muscle of the Rania pipiens, it was a muscle blocker

Introduction:
	The organism we did a study on was called the Northern Leopard Frog (Rania pipiens). The gastrocnemus muscle of this frog leg is good to work with because this muscle on the frog is strong and large. (Sadava, Hillis, Heller, Hacker) The neuromuscular system is different from hormone based system. Neuromuscular systems respond quicker within a few milliseconds rather than seconds to days as hormone based systems do. (Johnson 19). Skeletal muscles proper is formed by multiple myofibers that are bound together by connective tissue. When acetylcholine (ACh) with a nicotinic receptor on the muscle fiber’s membrane, it opens a sodium channel that will create an action potential. Voltage gated sodium anion channels open when there is depolarization between the fluid inside the axon and the extracellular fluid. When the channels open, sodium flows into the negatively charged axon and creates action potential. This is the pathway that nerve cells send chemical signals from cell to cell. Sodium channel blocker lidocaine, helps block sodium channels by binding to the said channel. By doing this study we wanted to know how lidocaine would affect the tetany of the frog muscle. When an electrical signal is put into the gastrocnemus muscle we expected the leg to twitch. By adding the lidocaine, we expected it to do its job as a sodium blocker and cause the leg to not twitch.


Materials and Method:
	Our group was given three frog legs, the frog legs were then being placed in a dissecting pan. For each pair of frog leg, we used the forceps grasps the skin at the top of the frog leg and slowly and carefully pull the skin towards the feet. Lay the skinned leg one by one on the dissecting pan and moisten with Ringer’s solution. Check on each of the three legs periodically and continue to add Ringer’s solution. Gently use the dissecting probe to separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper knee and extending to the knee. Gently free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue, using the dissecting needle and forceps. Keep exposed tissues moist (not drowning) in Ringer’s solution. To get the controlll of the three frog legs, we had to determine the twitch threshold by direct stimulation. We then extracted the sciatic nerve from the muscle of the frog leg. We connected the sciatic nerve to a sleeve electrode and connected that to the adaptor that would send the pulses to the frog leg. We did tests to determine the twitch threshold by direct stimulation. Threshold voltage was determined when we would increase the increments of stimulus voltage by 0.1V. Then we injected the frog leg with 0.2Ml of lidocaine. We then let the frog leg rest for five minutes. Continue the same process for the two other frog legs. Test the legs after the lidocaine was injected repeating the same steps and record the data as you go.


Results:
When we had to test the tetany for the controlll of the frog legs, one frog leg had the amplitude threshold of 0.5V and threshold tetany at a frequency of 10Hz. Frog leg two had an amplitude threshold of 0.5V as well and reached tetany at a frequency of 10Hz. Frog leg three had an amplitude threshold of 0.2V and reached tetany at a frequency of 10Hz. When we were testing the experimental tetany, frog leg one had an amplitude threshold of 2.500V and reached tetany at a frequency of 2.5Hz. Frog leg two had an amplitude threshold of 3.00V but did not reach tetany. Frog leg three had an amplitude threshold of 3.00V and did not reach tetany either.


Discussion:
	When testing the controlll for all of the frog legs, all three of our frog legs reached tetany in the gastrocnemus at low frequencies. When we injected the frog legs with lidocaine we noticed that none of the three frog legs muscles fully stopped showing a twitch in the feet, but the muscle where the actual lidocaine was injected it did not twitch or move. We noticed when testing the controlll for the frog legs that two of the three frog legs were usually consistent. By this I mean that the numbers were the same for frequency and tetany for at least two of the frog legs. When injecting the lidocaine to the gastrocnemus muscle, our hypothesis that the lidocaine would block the muscle and stop it from twitching was supported when the muscle had no twitch or movement when injected with lidocaine. The only physical error we faced was with the first frog leg we tested was taking a lot of voltage to twitch. After a while of trying we gave it time to rest while we worked on the next two frog legs. When coming back to frog leg one it started to twitch correctly. That was the only physical problem we faced. The only other problem we had was with the technology but we eventually figure that all out.
