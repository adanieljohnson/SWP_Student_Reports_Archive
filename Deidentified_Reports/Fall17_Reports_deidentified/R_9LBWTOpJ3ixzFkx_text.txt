Title: Better Fish Aggression and the presence or absence of Food

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment was to determine if the presence of the valuable resource of food would influence the level of aggression between two male betta fish. A common idea is that behaviors such as aggressive behaviors to some extent have an evolutionary basis. Because of this, aggression may have evolved as a mechanism for increasing the chances of acquiring more food or more mating opportunities. For this experiment, two male betta fish were placed in two conditions; one with food and one without food. In these two conditions, six major aggressive movements were observed, recorded, and later quantified using an “aggression score”. It was hypothesized that in the condition where food was placed in the tank with the fish, aggression level would be higher when compared to the condition where no food was present. The null hypothesis was that the presence or absence of food in the tank would have no effect on aggressive behaviors in betta fish. The results of the experiment supported the null hypothesis and demonstrated that the difference in mean aggression scores in the condition with food (0.48 ±  0.41) and without food (0.93 ±  0.94) was not statistically significent. It was concluded that this could be a result of flaws in methodology or a result of betta fish aggression 


Introduction:
Behavior, in a biological sense, can be defined as how an organism interacts with its environment and other organisms within it. To some extent, behavior is innate, has a genetic basis and can be explained through evolutionary concepts (Mayr: 1974) (Skinner: 1984). In addition, behavioral research often times attempts to predict and explain patterns and forms of behavior in order to better understand it in the context of larger biological processes. The behavioral interactions of an organism can generally be separated into two different categories; intraspecific and interspecific behaviors. Intraspecific behaviors are those which occur between members of the same species while interspecific behaviors are those which occur between members of a different species.
The experiment conducted will focus specifically on intraspecific aggression in relation to betta splendins or betta fish. Aggressive behaviors are characterized as being hostile and often times violent toward another organism. Many different animals exhibit aggressive behaviors towards members of their own and different species. A study by Wilson hints to the fact that aggression in animals may have evolved as a mechanism of increasing access to resources such as mates and food (Wilson:2014).  
Betta fish, when found in the wild, change colors to a dark blue or red when engaging in aggressive behaviors with other males of the same species. However, once they were domesticated, artificial selection produce males which retained these colors despite having no potentially hostile stimuli in the environment. Because of this, whenever two males are placed within the same tank, it is expected that they will exhibit a series of aggressive behavior patterns. These behaviors can be separated into broadside and facing movements and then further separated into six aggressive positions. For broadside movements, a betta fish may exhibit pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. These are stated in increasing order of aggressiveness with tail flashing being the most aggressive. Facing movement positions include erection of the pectoral fins, the spreading of gill covers, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes. 
The aim of this experiment will be to determine if the presence of the valuable resource of food will influence the level of aggression between two male betta fish. It is hypothesized that in the condition where food is placed in the tank with the fish, aggression level will be higher when compared to the condition where no food will be present. This is because the presence of food would increase intraspecific competition in which the males will need to compete over the food source. The null hypothesis is that the presence or absence of food in the tank will have no effect on aggressive behaviors in betta fish.

Materials and Method:
In order to study if the presence of food influences aggressive behaviors, six male betta fish were used. These six fish were separated into three groups of two and within each of these groups, two conditions were observed. In the first condition, the two male betta fish were placed in the same tank and then observed for five minutes without the presence of food. However, within some experimental trials, the two betta fish had to be separated before five minutes in order to reduce or avoid physical harm. Following this, they were then given a ten-minute break in order to give them time to recuperate and also to avoid habituation. In the second condition, a single tablet of betta food was placed in the middle of the tank between the two betta fish. Their aggressive behaviors were then observed for five minutes or for however long the aggressive behaviors did not cause physical harm. Next, they were allowed to rest for ten minutes. This procedure was repeated two more times with groups 2 and 3. 
An independent measures design type was used in which each trial involved a new set of fish. This was done to increase validity and generalizability. In order to quantify the aggressive behaviors, an “aggression score” was developed. This scale quantified aggressive behaviors, both broadside, and facing movements, by assigning a numerical value of 1-3 to the six aggressive displays mentioned previously.  For broadside movements, pelvic fin flickering was assigned the value of 1, tail beating the value of 2, and tail flashing the value of 3. This was done in increasing order of aggressiveness with 1 or pelvic fin flickering being least aggressive. For facing movement positions, the same pattern was followed. The erection of the pectoral fins was assigned the value of 1, the spreading of gill covers was assigned the value of 2, and the protruding of the branchiostegal membranes (red mane) was assigned a value of 3. Next, the display of each behavior was timed in seconds and then divided by the total amount of time the two betta fish were allowed to interact. These two numerical values were then multiplied together to give each fish an “aggression score”. For example, a betta fish was observed displaying tail flashing, which has a numerical value of 3, for 5 seconds out of a period of 300 seconds or 5 minutes. Its aggression score in relation to tail flashing could then be calculated using the following equation: aggression score for tail flashing =3 x 5/300=0.05. The total aggression score of a fish would furthermore be calculated using the formula exhibited in example 1. 
After results were collected a paired t_test was conducted on the data. The paired t_test was selected because it allowed for the comparison of the data from one fish with and without food to the other groups of fish.   


Results:
The results of the experiment did not support the hypothesis that in the condition where food was placed in the tank with the fish, aggression level would be higher when compared to the condition where no food was present. For group 1, both fish 1 and fish 2 exhibited more aggressive behaviors in the condition without food and were given the scores of 1.69 and 2.36. In the condition with food, fish 1 was given a 0.78 and fish 2 was given a score of 0.087. For group two, fish 1 and 2 were given aggression scores of 0 in the condition without food. In the condition with food, fish 1 was given a score of 0.21 and fish was given the score of 0.05 (table 2). Finally, in group three, the aggression score with food for fish 1 and fish 2 was 0.88. In the condition without food, the aggression score for fish 1 was 0.84 and 0.70 for fish 2 (table 3). The average aggression score in the condition with food was 0.48 ± 0.41 while the average aggression score in the condition without food was 0.93 ± 0.94 (table 4) (figure 1). This demonstrates that in the condition without food aggression scores were higher. However, through a paired t_test this difference or relationship was shown to be statistically insignificent (t_stat=1.34, d.f.=4, P=0.25). Because of this, the hypothesis was rejected and the null hypothesis retained.


Discussion:
   The results of the experiment did not support what was hypothesized in that aggression scores were not higher in the condition where food was present in the tank. In fact, the results demonstrated that the difference in average aggression scores in the condition with food (0.48 ±  0.41) and without food (0.93 ±  0.94) was not statistically significent. The high standard deviation in both of these conditions demonstrates that the data is more widely spread around the mean and hence likely less reliable. However, it does support the null hypothesis in which the presence or absence of food does not influence aggression in betta fish. This may hint to the fact that betta fish aggression was not evolved as a result of competition over food but rather a result of competition over mates.
 A study by Doutrelant supports this premise and found that intraspecific aggressive behaviors in betta fish increased when a female was also present in the tank (Doutrelant: 2001). While other organisms such as crabs have been shown to become more aggressive towards other species and members of their own species when exposed to food, these results are not necessarily generalizable to betta fish (Tran: 2014). Because of this, further research about food and intraspecific betta fish relations would have to be studied to determine more reliably if there is no correlation between aggressive behaviors and the presence or absence of food.
When conducting further research several different experimental flaws should be noted. Human error is especially relevant in relation to behavioral observations. This became especially true when observing the six primary aggressive behaviors of betta fish and recording the amount of time the behavior was exhibited. It is likely that the amount of time a behavior was exhibited was at best a vague approximation and hence variability such as that shown by the large standard deviation for the mean values would be expected. To fix this, more than one individual should observe the same fish and after this is finished results should be compared to increase objectivity. Another experimental flaw was that only six betta fish were used. This is a very small sample size; therefore, it would be unlikely that any meaningful or significent trends could be identified or generalized to the larger betta fish population. A larger sample size should hence be collected during follow up research. Despite these flaws, the results of this study are likely valuable when describing what does not motivate betta fish aggression. Aggression is a complex behavior that can occur as a result of many different biological or environmental influences. While male on male betta fish aggression may have a large number of evolutionary explanations, the results of this study do not support the premise that competition over food is one of them. 
    Studying animal behaviors in relation to evolution can help determine how certain behaviors become prevalent within a population or a species. In addition, understanding that certain behaviors occur as a response to specific stimuli can allow for more in-depth analysis on the trade-off between survival and reproduction.
