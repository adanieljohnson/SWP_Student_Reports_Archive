Title: The Effect of Oxygenation on Betta Splendins

Abstract:
This is a study of the effect of oxygenated water on betta fish (Betta splendins) aggression. The fish will be shown to one another through a transparent surface and their aggressive behaviors will be recorded and calculated into a coherent scoring system that determines whether or not a higher level of oxygen makes them more aggressive. We believe that with access to more resources the Betta splendins will become more agitated with one another, and after performing the experiment we found that the results supported our hypothesis. Hostile behavior greatly increased when presented with higher oxygen levels.

Introduction:
Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins) are a species of fish which can be found swimming through most inland bodies of water throughout asia. They exist in incredibly small habitats. Some even thriving within puddles made by terrace farms. They exist on a diet of small insects and algae that fall into their territory. Due to their high metabolic rate bettas must eat often to sustain themselves. They are small, and due to their mating habits are incredibly aggressive. Male to male aggression is extremely common, and often deadly for one of the parties involved.(Sturgeon, D.) It first begins with a display from both males. This is a combination of two categories of display: facing and broadside. Broadside aggression consists of three motions: Pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail flashing. The facing displays consist of three motions as well: erecting the pectoral fin, spreading of the gill covers (opercula), and protruding of the branchiostegal membranes (this gives the appearance of a red “mane” forming on the chin). These behaviors in both categories each signify increasing aggression consecutively. This aggression is geared exclusively towards males, as in the presence of a female the male bettas will maintain a puffy appearance while approaching slowly in an attempt to impress and copulate. A study performed by the department of zoological behavior in Copenhagen found that not only do males become aggressive in the presence of another male, but the more males that are present, the greater the aggression becomes. (Matos, RJ) This behavior likely stems from a lack of female choice since bettas grow in very small habitats.  Knowing this about the bettas we wanted to test what factors spur their aggression. We hoped through our research to find a way to subdue them to allow for cohabitation. The independent variable we would be introducing would be a bubbler to oxygenate the water. By quantifying the aggressive behaviors listed above we measured and scored the bettas as they viewed each other through glass. We hypothesized that the bettas in the bubbling water would be more aggressive towards their partner than the controlll fish. 

Materials and Method:
The materials required for this lab are as follows: a tank with 3 transparent partitions (creating 3 separate tanks within one large one), oxygenator (bubbler), and 3 removable opaque partitions. We began by placing a single male betta fish in each separate tank with the opaque partitions obstructing view of each other. After they had been given proper time to adjust to their new environment we removed one partition at a time so that 2 bettas could see each other at once. We then used the scale shown in Image 1 to measure their aggressiveness. For each behavior shown we added the proper amount of points. Once 5 minutes had passed we replaced the opaque partition and allowed the fish time to relax. We repeated this once for each possible pairing of fish, allowing each one to see the others. The results were recorded and we repeated the entire process again, but this time we oxygenated the water of the two interacting fish.


Results:
After running our tests we can conclude that the data does in fact support our hypothesis. Graph 1 displays the relationship and standard error of our data. When the fish were tested a second time in the oxygenated water, the number of hostile reactions were much higher than they were previously. For all fish the agnostic score increased by approximately 10-15%.


Discussion:
Watching the bettas interact with and without the bubbler made it very clear that they were far more active when the water was being oxygenated. It does, however, beg the question of whether or not the oxygenation was acting as a stressor for increased aggression, or if the presence of the bubbler nozzle was aggravating to them. We are aware that interaction and stimulation from the outside can cause a more visceral reaction from the Betta splendins. The experiment performed by the zoological department in Copenhagen shows the potency of these stressors. It is entirely possible that they misinterpreted our bubbler for another hostile life form. (Matos, RJ) We also are aware of the fact that the bettas began to familiarize themselves with one another throughout the trials. This may have increased the hostility or started the habituation of our test subjects as we moved to the experimental phase. Even so the data speaks to an increase in aggression as the result of higher oxygen levels in the water. It does beg the question: if the water was less oxygenated, would the bettas refuse to waste energy on hostile interaction? The maning of the bettas actually limits their ability to breath. If we limit oxygen to an even greater extent than these behaviors would cost more resources than it would be worth. This could be the key to having multiple male bettas share a habitat.

Figure Legends: 
Image 1: Each agnostic behavior was given a specific score based on its associated level of aggression e.i. maning is more aggressive than pectoral fin extension, thus it receives a higher multiplier.


Graph 1: Shows the agonism score of each fish during both the controlll and experimental. The error bars have slight overlap as they account for a miscount of score. (The P value for A,B,C is as follows: .518, .156, .403 consecutively)
