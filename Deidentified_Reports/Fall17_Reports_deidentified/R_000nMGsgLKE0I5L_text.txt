Title: The Effects of Lidocaine on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
This experiment done on Rania pipiens frog legs was performed to explore the effect of certain drugs on muscle contraction. The sciatic nerve of the leg was stimulated to produce muscle contraction, and this was done before and after lidocaine injection. The independent variable in this experiment was lidocaine, a discrete variable. The dependent variable was the voltage, which was also continuous. The amplitude of the contractions was dependent but discrete, as the muscle after lidocaine injection did not reach a threshold at the voltage inputted from the determination of the threshold before injection but did with increasing voltage. After recording the data, it is clear that the lidocaine affected the muscle significently. The amplitude of contraction at the same voltage for the unaffected muscle and the lidocaine-injected muscle was drastically different in value for all three frog legs, and a T-test was performed on this data to ensure significance. These findings support the proposed alternate hypothesis, that lidocaine would slow nerve impulse (action potential) propagation by inhibiting the ability of sodium ion channels to recover after depolarization. This would decrease the amplitude of contraction for the same voltage for contraction in the initial stimulation.

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to observe the effects of lidocaine on muscle contraction. This will be done by stimulating the gastrocnemus muscle from a frog leg through the sciatic nerve, which enters the muscle through the base. The frogs used will be lab-raised Rania pipiens, and we will repeat the experiment with three different legs to ensure a statistically relevant set of data. The threshold of contraction will be measured for each leg once before the lidocaine injection, and once after for comparison. When an action potential is fired in a neuron, sodium ion channels that are voltage sensitive are triggered to open and allow the influx of Na+ ions, causing depolarization. This will travel down the axon and cause the opening of calcium channels and release of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, leading to contraction of the postsynaptic muscle (Johnson: 19-35)1. Lidocaine is a numbing agent, a local anesthetic, used mainly for anesthetic purposes in the medical field. The molecule will bind to amino acids near the sodium inactivation channels in the presynaptic cell, and will cause the channels after an action potential to recover much more slowly than a normal refractory period for an Na+ channel after depolarization (Bennett et al.: 1995)2 and the inability for the neuron to fire action potentials in rapid succession. This could cause a loss of feeling in the area where the lidocaine was injected, therefore the numbing qualities of the substance. The effects on a molecular level suggest that lidocaine interferes with the efficiency of electrical conduction, which would have an effect on a stimulated nerve in a neuromuscular junction and the force of contraction it generates. It is hypothesized compared to the amplitude of contractions of the legs before injection, the amplitude of contractions after injection will be a lower voltage (IE much weaker contractions).


Materials and Method:
This experiment was performed on three individual frog legs, kept moist with frog ringer. Once the achilles tendon was cut with forceps, the gastrocnemus muscle was tied with a string and hung from a hook at a 90º angle. An FT302 transducer machine was utilized to generate the charge sent by the experimenters through the LabScribe software installed prior to the experiment. After the first pulses sent through the muscle to determine threshold contraction, 0.025 M lidocaine (~2 Ml per leg) was injected into the gastrocnemus muscles and the experiment was repeated. 

 The skin was removed from the frog leg to expose the gastrocnemus muscle. The inner thigh muscles were separated to expose the sciatic nerve, which was carefully pulled away from the muscles for stimulation. The achilles tendon on the ankle of the Rania pipiens leg was clipped, and the leg was tied up loosely at a 90º angle. A banana electrical stimulator was secured onto the sciatic nerve, and beginning with 0.1V and increasing in 0.1V increments, the threshold amplitude was determined. Once the threshold was reached, the voltage was increased by 1.0V without exceeding 5.0V to observe amplitudes of contraction of the muscle. Amplitudes were recorded.
After this process, ~2 Ml of 0.025 M lidocaine was injected into the middle and base of the gastrocnemus muscle and was left to sit unstimulated in the muscle for 3-5 minutes. Once the muscle has rested with the injected lidocaine, the entire process is repeated, recording the threshold amplitude and amplitudes of contraction up to 5.0V. This experiment was repeated once on each of the three frog legs, and a T-test followed to show statistical differences between the controlll thresholds and the experimental data. 



Results:
The results collected of the amplitudes from each frog leg before and after lidocaine injection for the same voltage are averaged into one table. 

The T-test p value performed on the averaged results of the experiment shows a statistically significent comparison between the controlll and experimental values. 


Discussion:
The data collected shows a statistically significent effect of lidocaine on the threshold of contraction of the gastrocnemus muscles of the Rania pipiens legs. Before the injection of lidocaine, the thresholds of all three muscles were reached at an input of 0.3V, with an average amplitude of 0.4934V. After injection, for the same input of 0.2V, the average amplitude of all three legs recorded at 0.0125V. The same trend was observed at each increased voltage inputted through the LabScribe program. The T-test produced a p value of 0.0112, a value less than 0.05, indicating a statistically significent result. Every test performed produced a significent result, and no outliers or obvious areas of error were observed. After finding that lidocaine is an effective inhibitor of muscle contraction, this study can be applied to other experiments and uses. Lidocaine could be used to treat a spastic muscle condition in addition to its use as an anesthetic (Smith: 1976).
