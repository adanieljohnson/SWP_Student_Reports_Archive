Title: The effect of increased salinity in the surrounding environment on the specific metabolic rate of Orconectes sp. 

Abstract:
Osmoregulation is an important process in the aquatic animals that regulates the flow of water and ions into and out of the organism. Changes in the environment effect osmoregulation and generally will put an animal in greater stress, resulting in increased metabolic rates because the organism will consume more oxygen and expend more energy in order to accommodate to the changing and stressful environment. Oxygen consumption can be used to determine specific metabolic rate (SMR), a measure of the amount of energy expended by all physiologic processes. In this study we introduced freshwater Orconectes sp. to salinized water in order to determine the effect of salinity in the environment on the SMR of the Orconectes sp. The SMR of Orconectes sp. was compared between normal water and saline water conditions. The results showed no statistically significant difference in SMR between the two water conditions (p=0.296), which suggests that increased salinity in the water did not have an effect on SMR in Orconectes sp. at the concentration of ions used in this experiment. The slight average increase in SMR in saline water could imply that our fish were consuming more oxygen and expending more energy, but further research is required. 

Introduction:
Osmoregulation is an important process in aquatic animals that balances the water and ion concentrations in the internal environment of the organism depending on the specific external environment. Freshwater fish, for example, are hypertonic to their environment, meaning that the concentration of water is higher in the surrounding environment and lower internally. As a result, osmoregulation works to pump water into the fish so the fish must produce a large amount of urine to excrete the large amounts of water. However, this large amount of urine also carries ions with it and those ions have to be replaced. In order to replace the ions that are lost, these fish have chloride secretory cells in the gills that actively transport ions from the surrounding environment into the fish [BBC: 2104]. Osmoregulation is an activity that requires the organism to expend energy, and the amount of energy that the organism expends by all physiologic processes (such as osmoregulation) is the metabolic rate. There are many environmental factors that affect metabolic rate. Generally, any changes in the environment will put an animal in greater stress, resulting in increased metabolic rates because the organism will consume more oxygen and expend more energy in order to accommodate to the changing and stressful environment [Johnson: 2017]. 

In order to test how changes in the environment affect metabolic rate, we can measure the specific metabolic rate (SMR) of an organism under normal environmental conditions and compare that to the SMR of that same organism under non-normal (stressful) environmental conditions. In order to study the effects of environment on freshwater organisms, we used the Orconectes sp. as our test subject. We chose this organism because the Orconectes sp. are freshwater organisms that are easy to handle and are an appropriate size to measure oxygen consumption and calculate SMR. In this experiment, the amount of energy consumed is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended, so if more oxygen is consumed over a period of time, more energy is being expended by that organism. By altering the environment of the Orconectes sp. and measuring oxygen consumption in the different environments, we can determine the effect of the environment on the SMR.  

In this experiment, we introduced freshwater Orconectes sp. to salinized water in order to determine the effect of salinity in the environment on the SMR of the Orconectes sp. Previous studies have shown how increased salinity generally increases the SMR of freshwater organisms. In a 2014 study, researcher Xiao and his team determined that the basal metabolic rate of Corbicula fluminea in two salinities (0.3% and 1.8%) where significantly different, with higher metabolic rates observed in the higher salinity conditions. This difference was only observed in the large and medium sized clams [Xiao: 2014]. A different study showed that there is a threshold for oxygen consumption at varying salinities. Tsuzuki and his team showed that oxygen consumption in Odontesthes hatcheri and O. bonariensis increased with increasing salinity (which corresponds to increasing SMR) until the salinity was so that oxygen consumption decreased most likely as a result of decreased activity and ineffective osmoregulation [Tsuzuki: 2008]. In our experiment, we do not expect to cross the threshold, thus if our Orconectes sp. are introduced to saline water, we expect that the metabolic rate of the Orconectes sp. will be higher than normal water in order to accommodate for the increased concentration of ions in external environment. The Orconectes sp. will have to consume more oxygen because they need to expend more energy to maintain homeostasis, and thus have higher metabolic rates.  


Materials and Methods:
Normal Water Conditions:
Three small (~4-8g) Orconectes sp. were used in this experiment. Each Orconectes sp. was weighed and then placed in a container completely filled with normal water. The oxygen consumption of each individual Orconectes sp. was recorded, using a dissolved oxygen meter, at baseline and in five minute intervals for 20 minutes. The volume of the water in the container was then measured using a graduated cylinder. 

Saline Water Conditions:
The same three Orconectes sp. were used again in the saline water conditions. 10mL of 6.5% concentrated saline solution was diluted in 900mL of normal water to obtain a concentration of 0.65%. The same procedure was followed for saline water as was for normal water conditions (as previously described). 

Calculating Specific Metabolic Rate: 
SMR was calculated using the equation from [Johnson: 2017], where O2 is the change in oxygen consumption, volume H2O is the volume of the container, time is measure in minutes, and weight is weight of the organism. 

Statistical Analysis: 
In order to test if the results are significant, a paired-two-sample t-test was applied to the SMR. We determined if there were significant differences between the SMR of Orconectes sp. in normal water conditions compared to saline water conditions. Statistical significance was determined if p0.05.


Results:
The SMR of each Orconectes sp. was calculated in normal water conditions and saline water conditions. The average SMR of the Orconectes sp. in normal water conditions was 0.0018 mgO2/g*min while the average SMR in 0.65% saline water conditions was 0.0025 mgO2/g*min (Figure 1). The SMR for the Orconectes sp. in 0.65% saline water was higher than in the SMR for Orconectes sp. in normal water. This also shows that oxygen consumption over the 20-minute period was on average higher for the Orconectes sp. in the saline water, so the Orconectes sp. were expending more energy. However, there was no statistically significant difference in SMR between Orconectes sp. in normal water and 0.65% saline water (sample size = 3, t-statistic=+/- 1.40001391, df=2, p=0.296). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that increasing salinity of the water will increase the SMR of the Orconectes sp. was not supported because there was no statistically significant difference in the SMR of the Orconectes sp. in normal water compared to saline water conditions (p=0.296). There are several reasons that can help explain the results of this study. First, the salinity of the water (0.65%) may not have been high enough to drastically alter osmoregulation in the Orconectes sp. The 2008 study by Tsuzuki showed that at low salinities, oxygen consumption was not very high for the freshwater fish, but increased with higher salinities [Tsuzuki: 2008]. It may very well have been that the increase in ion concentration was so slight that that it only took a small amount of extra energy to pump out less water and pump in less ions in order to maintain a constant internal environment. If we look at it another way, the increased ion concentration in the environment may have also increased the ion concentration inside the organism (by pumping out more water, by osmosis, and taking in more ions), but the imbalance in the internal environment of the fish may have been too slight to alter the SMR of the organism. It would be interesting to see, then, how an even higher concentration of ions in the environment would alter the SMR of the Orconectes sp., if at all.  

Second, the effects of increased salinity alone sometimes are not enough to dramatically change the SMR of an organism. Instead, the effects are usually seen when coupled with other variables like size of the organism. In the 2014 study where Xiao and his team determined that the basal metabolic rate of Corbicula fluminea in two salinities (0.3% and 1.8%) were significantly different, with higher metabolic rates observed in the higher salinity conditions, only the large and medium sized clams has significantly different metabolic rates between the two salinities [Xiao: 2014]. Since our experiment used the small Orconectes sp., it could explain why there was an increase in SMR, but no statistical significance in the difference. It would be interesting to see if the same phenomena can be observed with the Orconectes sp. in order to determine if increasing size of the organism will have an effect on how much more energy the organism will need to expend (or how much more oxygen the organism will need to consume) in response to increasing salinity.
