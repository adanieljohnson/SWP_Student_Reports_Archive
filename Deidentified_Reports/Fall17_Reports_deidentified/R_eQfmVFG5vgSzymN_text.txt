Title: The Effects of the Presence of Calcium on the Contractions of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The leg of a Rana pipiens is stimulated until its threshold is found and at that threshold the contractile forces and periods are compared for each leg with and without A23187, a calcium channel activator. The researchers expected no difference in force, but a longer contractile period. The average force was larger in the presence of A23187 two out of three times and the average contractile period was smaller in the presence of A23187 two out of three times, There were no statically significant differences between contractile force or contractile period the control group, a normal leg of a Rana pipiens, and the experimental group, a leg of a Rana pipiens injected with A23187.

Introduction:
Calcium causes excitation in nerve cells and muscle cells. In the neuromuscular system, the opening of calcium channels and subsequent release of calcium ions causes the troponin to move the tropomyosin out of the way allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin and results in the power stroke. The thick and thin filaments in each sarcomere to slide closer together and overlap more. This occurrence in each sarcomere causes the contraction of the muscle. [Sadava: 2017] Another experiment conducted used caffeine to investigate the effects of calcium on the nervous systems of rabbits. This study found that the contractions were dependent on extracellular calcium. [Daher: 2009]  To see the effects of a calcium channel activator on the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens, the researchers are stimulating the sciatic nerve with and without the presence of A23187. The researchers predicted that applying A23187, a calcium channel activator, will result in the same contractile force, but a longer contractile period. This is expected because the calcium will be present at all times due to the calcium channel activator rather than just present following the stimulus that opens the calcium channels. The independent variables are the presence of or lack thereof of A23187 and the voltage applied to the frog leg. The dependent variables are the contractile time period and contractile force.


Materials and Methods:
Using the IXTA the researchers stimulated three different sciatic nerves and gastrocnemius muscles of the legs of Rana pipiens as the control group and found the threshold voltage of each leg before applying A23187 to each leg. The researchers then used the threshold already found for each leg to stimulate them after the A23187 was applied and comparing the force and duration of the contractions to the force and duration of the contractions of each frog leg before the A23187 was applied. The A23187 was 100mM. The researchers are using a paired t-test to compare the duration and force of the contractions once the calcium channel activator was applied verses on the same frog leg before the calcium channel activator was applied. 

Results:
In the first frog leg the average force of the A23187 frog leg was slightly greater than the average force of the normal frog leg. In the second frog leg the average force of the A23187 frog leg was almost twice as great as the average force of the normal frog leg. In the third frog leg the average force of the A23187 frog leg was about one sixth of the average force of the normal frog leg.The difference in contractile force was shown not to be statistically significant as the p-value in the paired t-test was 0.5738. In the first frog leg the average contractile period of the A23187 frog leg was much greater than the average contractile period of the normal frog leg. In the second frog leg the average contractile period of the A23187 frog leg was somewhat less than the average contractile period of the normal frog leg. In the third frog leg the average contractile period of the A23187 frog leg was much less than the average contractile period of the normal frog leg. The difference in contractile period was shown also not to be statistically significant as the p-value in the paired t-test was 0.4476.

Discussion:
The contractile force, although not statistically significant, was more often than not greater in the presence of A23187. The researchers believe that the greater amount of calcium allowed to go through due to the calcium channel activator allowed more sarcomeres to contract than would under the conditions of the control and produced a stronger force. The contractile period, although also not statistically significant, was more often than not less in the presence of A23187. The researchers believe that the greater amount of calcium allowed to go through due to the calcium channel activator allowed the troponin in the sarcomeres to move the tropomyosin out of the way more quickly allowing for a shorter contraction. [Sadava: 2017] The larger presence of calcium seems to produce stronger contractions, but shorter contractions. However, only three frog legs were used in this experiment and statistical significance is hard to achieve with only three legs and the procedure should be repeated on more frog legs. It would be interesting to see the effects of a calcium channel inhibitor and if it had the exact opposite effect on contractions: weaker, but longer.
