Title: The Effect of Salinity on Metabolic Rate of Procambarus specie

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to test if salinity effected the specific metabolic rate of three large Procambarus specie. The hypothesis tested was if the salinity of the environment would increase the metabolism, and hence specific metabolic rate, of the crayfish than of that measured in a control non-saline rich environment. This was done by placing the specimen in a sealed test chamber with a dissolved oxygen probe on top, and recording dissolved oxygen values every 5 minutes over a 20-minute interval. The study resulted in the support of the null hypothesis and rejection of the alternative hypothesis described above (as shown by the provided paired t-test with a p-value > 0.05). This led to the overall conclusion that the salinity of the environment did not impact the metabolic rate and suggests that the intake of extra Na+ and Cl- does not impact metabolic processes. 

Introduction:
This study was conducted to determine the metabolic rate of three large crayfish (Procambarus specie) in room temperature water in both saline rich and non-saline rich environments. This will be conducted using three large crayfish, because their larger mass would show more noticeable differences in specific metabolic rate (Gilloly, 2001). The Procambarus specie is most effective for this experiment because they are poikilotherms, so their body temperatures adjust depending on the environment and hence so do their metabolic rates. Furthermore, they are durable, easy to maintain, and cheap to purchase. The measurement of oxygen is most effective for determining metabolic rate because the amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose during routine physiological activities is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed, or the amount of CO2 excreted. (Johnson 2017). It was predicted that the addition of saline to the room temperature water environment the crayfish were placed in would decrease metabolic rate slightly since the surrounding water would have a greater osmolarity than the crayfish (Swanson 1998).

Materials and Methods:
To begin, fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air. Then set the empty test chamber into an empty plastic dishpan.  Weigh a crayfish, gently place into test chamber, and screw on the top. When the top is secure, gently fill the container with water so the top overflows slightly. Place the entire tank set-up to the neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature (22°C) water. Insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber (some water will overflow when the probe is inserted), but make sure the chamber is completely filled with water. Next, turn on the instrument and let the readings stabilize (this may take 30 seconds to a minute). Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. At 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes read the concentration again. Remove the probe, and determine the volume of water crayfish was in during experiment by carefully pouring the water from the test chamber through a funnel into a graduated cylinder and record the volume. For the saline-rich environment measurements, you will use the same crayfish. Refill the chamber with saline rich (0.65%wt after dilution) saturated water this time. Then submerge the chamber in the same room temperature dish pan. Once again, take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen. Then read the concentration after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. When you are finished, unseal the chamber and measure the volume of water used. Then return the crayfish to the holding pen. Refill the chamber with fresh room temperature water, and repeat the procedure with other two crayfish and repeat procedure using saline-rich water.  

Results:
After examining the recorded values as seen below, it is evident that there was not a significant noticeable change between the control and experimental O2 consumption. Furthermore, there were no data points that differed greatly from the general trend. Even in Figure 2, the difference in the average specific metabolic rate is only 0.000059 mgO2/min*g.

Discussion:
Overall, these results indicate that the addition of saline to the environment of the Procambarus specie did not significantly impact the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. A paired t-test was run and resulted in no statistically significant difference between the control oxygen consumption and experimental oxygen consumption (t-stat= 3.464, df=2, p-value= 0.074). Therefore, the null hypothesis is supported. However, the data was approaching significance based on the size of the p-value, so a bigger sample size should be tried in future experiments since significance would have indicated that the salinity content of the water did in fact affect specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in a statistically significant way.  This is further confirmed knowing that fresh water creatures tend to lose most of their ions via diffusion since their body has a higher osmolarity than the surrounding water. So, when placed in an environment with a higher ion concentration there is even less exchange going on to maintain homeostasis. It has also been tested as to whether salinity effects routine metabolic rates, growth, activity, etc and the findings showed that salinity only minimally impacted the routine metabolic rates of milkfish, and higher concentrations tend to decrease it (Swanson, 1998).

Displays a comparison of the calculated average specific metabolic rate values for both the control and experimental group. However, a paired t-test confirmed with a value of 0.074 that the difference is in fact not statistically significant.  Figure 3.
