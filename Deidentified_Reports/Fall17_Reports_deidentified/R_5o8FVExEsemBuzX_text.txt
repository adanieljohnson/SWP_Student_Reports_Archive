Title: Effects of pH on Photosynthetic Activity on Spinacia /oleracea/

Abstract:
The mass burning of fossil fuels has changed the mixture of gases in the atmosphere, and caused acid rain to become much more common. It’s imperative that we understand what effect this has on our local environment.  Although it is known that acid rain has negative effects on plant growth and development, past experiments have shown discrepancy in the effect of acid rain on plant photosynthesis. This experiment was completed to discover the effects of acid rain on photosynthesis rates in the chloroplasts of Spinacia Oleracea. It was hypothesized that changing the pH around chloroplasts would cause a change in photosynthetic activity. To simulate the conditions of normal rain and acid rain, pH buffers of 5.5 and 4.0 were used. A pH buffer of 7 was used to simulate standard water. When the pH of the environment around chloroplasts was changed to 7, 5.5, and 4, photosynthetic activity was found to be not significantly different. This provides more evidence that acid rain does not affect photosynthesis rates, and that the hindering of plant growth and development from acid rain is not from a decrease in photosynthetic activity. 


Introduction:
Acid rain refers to the acidification of precipitation brought about mostly by sulfuric and nitric acids. [Likens: 2004].  Where normal rain as a pH of about 5.5, acid rain has been found with a pH anywhere between 3.0-4.5 [Likens and Bowman: 1974]. The widely accepted negative impact acid rain has on full ecosystems has been investigated extensively, but the few studies regarding its specific effects on photosynthesis rates are conflicting. It’s been shown that O2 production in soybean plants increase at low pH [Ferenbaugh: 1976], and gross photosynthesis rates increase in the presence of acid rain [Irving: 1980]. In contradiction to that, a separate experiment shows that net photosynthesis decreases in the presence of acid rain [Neufeld, 1984]. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants obtain their energy. Energy from the light is used to convert NADP+ to NADPH, and to drive proton pumps which create a proton gradient. This proton gradient is then used to synthesize ATP [Geraid: 2015]. This experiment hopes to further reveal what impact acid rain has on the rate of photosynthesis in plants. Spinacia Oleracea will be used because of its high levels of chloroplasts. It is hypothesized that changing the pH (independent variable) of the surrounding environment will create a noticeable change the rate of photosynthesis (dependent variable).  To measure the rate of photosynthesis, we will use DCPIP, which mimics NADP+ in the electron transport chain, and turns colorless when it accepts electrons. The higher rate of photosynthesis will cause a larger decrease in color, which can be measured by a spectrophotometer. 

Materials and Methods:
The lab began by getting 4 spinach leaves, removing the veins, and grinding the leaves with a mortar and pestle. As a grinding buffer, 10mL of 400mM sucrose in tricine was added. The green solution was then filtered through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. This solution was then centrifuged at 200x gravity for 3min at 4°C. The supernatant was split into three separate tubes. The first tube acted as acid rain and contained 6mL of pH 4 buffer. The control group simulated the standard conditions chloroplasts function by adding 6mL of pH 5.5 buffer. The third was standard water with 6mL of pH 7 buffer.  The three samples were then centrifuged at the same settings as before. Each resulting supernatant was divided into three tubes, giving a total of 9 samples, three at each pH. Tubes 1-3 contained 2mL of pH 4 buffer, and 2mL of DCPIP. Tubes 4-6 contained 2mL of pH 5.5 buffer, and 2mL of DCPIP. Tubes 7-9 contained 2mL of pH 7 buffer, and 2mL of DCPIP. Absorbances were then recorded every 10min for half an hour.  Two paired T-tests were ran to compare the rate of photosynthesis in normal acidity (pH 5.5) to the rate in more acidic (pH 4), and less acidic (pH 7) conditions. 


Results:
Chloroplasts in the pH 4 showed a mean absorbance of 0.276nm ±0.216nm,  and had a 79.4% decrease in absorbance over 30min. Chloroplasts in pH 5 showed a mean absorbance of 0.300nm ±0.207nm and had a decrease in absorbance of 77.5%. Chloroplasts in pH 7 showed a mean absorbance of 0.318nm ±0.185nm, and a percent decrease in absorbance of 70.0%. The positive control group showed an 85% decrease in absorbance, and the negative control showed 0% decrease in absorbance. The mean value of the control group (pH 5.5) was not statistically significantly different than that of either experimental groups. (pH 4: t Stat=-2.64, df=3, p=0.08 ,  pH 7: t-stat=1.507, df=3).


Discussion:
As shown in figure 1, decreasing the pH of chloroplasts causes a slight increase in their photosynthetic activity over time, but not enough to be significantly different than in standard conditions. This could be because increasing the concentration of H+ only makes a more favorable proton gradient between the chloroplast stroma and thylakoid membrane for ATP synthase to use. This denies the hypothesis that changes in pH influence photosynthesis rates. These findings are consistent with experiments done on other plants (Ferenbaugh, 1976 and Irving, 1980) in that acid rain does not negatively impact photosynthetic activity. This study also indicates that the hindering of plant growth and development seen in acidic conditions (Neufeld, 1984) is not the result of a decrease in photosynthesis rates. One possible error that could explain the lack of change in photosynthesis rates is not testing the effects of lower acidity. The result show acidity has no effect on photosynthesis rates, but pH levels lower than 4 were not tested. To improve this, another experimental group at a lower pH should be added to see if there is a threshold of acidity in which photosynthesis rates would be altered. Further research must be done on plant growth and development in acid rain to discover why plants suffer in acidic conditions. Clearly a biological system or function is being impaired by acid rain, and this study shows it is not photosynthesis. Logically, the next step is testing the effect of pH on nutrient transport and storage. This study shows chloroplasts are still producing proper amounts of sugars, but it is possible that transportation or storage of those sugars is not occurring properly under acidic conditions, and that would explain the impaired growth of plants in acidic conditions. Finding this explanation would give solid evidence that burning fossil fuels is harmfully impacting our environment, and would hopefully incentivize alternate energy sources.
