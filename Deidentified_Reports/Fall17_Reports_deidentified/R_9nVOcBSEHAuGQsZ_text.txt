Title: Analyzing the Effect of an External Threat on the Metabolic Rate of Crayfish

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to explore the effect of a predatory threat on metabolic rate, characterized by oxygen consumption. This was tested by measuring the oxygen consumption of three crayfish with and without the presence of a larger, more aggressive crayfish. A paired t_test was used to measure the results which produced a p value of .014, which makes the results statistically significent. This is consistent with the trend which showed that oxygen consumption increased in the presence of the large crayfish in all three trials. This is not a surprising result as it’s well documented that a “fight or flight” reaction increases respiratory and circulatory function.

Introduction:
In order to test the effect of an external stressor on oxygen consumption, cray are a good subject for testing as they are easy to handle, and their metabolic rate can be easily measured as they’re aquatic organisms. The stimulus chosen for this experiment was an external threat from a larger crayfish. Crayfish are highly aggressive by nature and have been observed killing and eating smaller organisms of their own species. Placing a large crayfish in the view of a smaller subject should illicit a “flight or fight” response which should in turn affect metabolic rate. The “fight or flight” response is a reaction fundamental in all animals in response to an immediate threat. The response is characterized by the fast-acting release of epinephrine and other hormones and the increase of heart and lung function which allows for a near immediate response to the perceived stressor. This response should be seen and measured in the small crayfish test subject. In order to measure whether aggression has an effect on crayfish metabolism, crayfish oxygen intake, the dependent variable of this experiment, will be measured with and without the presence of a threat, the independent variable. Oxygen gas consumption is used as the primary measure of metabolic function as it is directly correlated to the amount of energy expended by an organism. O2 is an essential molecule in the major metabolic reactions. Essentially, oxygen “pulls” electrons down the electron transport chain with its charge, converting ADP to ATP and subsequently remove the electrons from the mitochondria. The removal of electrons from the mitochondria forms water. Water and CO2 are then removed from the organism as waste products. This background information is supported by a 2009 study in which researchers studied the oxygen consumption of tadpoles when in the presence of a predator. It was found that over a short-term period there was a significent increase in oxygen consumption “consistent with the ‘fight-or-flight’ response observed in many organisms” [Steiner: 2009]. This is almost an identical experiment, so it sets a strong precedent for the outcome of the experiment when performed with crayfish rather than tadpoles. Based on this information it can be hypothesized that exposing a smaller crayfish to a larger more aggressive crayfish will increase the smaller crayfish’s metabolic rate due to the aggressive nature of the species in addition to the relationship between metabolic rate and the inherent “fight or flight” response. 



Materials and Method:
To perform this experiment, a small crayfish was weighed and placed in a mason jar filled with slightly oxygenated water. After an initial reading, for twenty minutes, the oxygen content of the surrounding water was recorded in five minute increments using a dissolved oxygen probe. After twenty minutes, to determine specific metabolic rate of the crayfish, the volume of water was measured using a graduated cylinder.  Specific metabolic rate:   ΔO2 (mg/L) * Volume H20(L) Time(min) * Weight(mg) The water was then replaced, and the same steps were taken, with the addition of a large crayfish in a tray of water surrounding the jar. A wall was placed in the tray in order to confine the larger organism next to the jar, guaranteeing some level of indirect contact between the two crayfish. This paired test was repeated two more times with two new small crayfish subjects. The large crayfish was the same for every test. To test the statistical significance of the collected data, a paired T-test was used as the experimental and controlll groups contained the exact same crayfish and mean was being tested.

Results:
   As seen in Figure 1, there was a clear trend displayed in the data as the oxygen intake increased for all crayfish when in the presence of an external threat The statistical null hypothesis for this experiment was Ho = μt – μc = 0 and the sample size used was n = 3. The paired T-test resulted in a p value of .014.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment supported the alternative biological hypothesis and the statistical hypothesis. All subjects displayed an increased metabolic rate, as seen in figure 1, and the results of the statistical test suggests that the discrepancy between the groups was not due to chance. Each trial showed a consistent trend of increased metabolic rate characterized by an increase in dissolved O2. This trend produced supports the notion that an external threat leads to an increased respiratory rate. In addition, there was clear difference in behavior between the controlll and treatment groups. When the subject was in a jar by itself, it was sedentary. However, when the large crayfish was introduced to the environment, the small crayfish moved seemingly to avoid the threat. This supports the notion that the “fight or flight” reaction was initiated in the subject, which would support the biological trend that metabolism increased.  Although the connection between metabolic function and predation is impractical when applied to useful scenarios. Understanding factors which influence the metabolic rate of marine organisms can be applied to select industries, such as farming. Raising aquatic animals in confinement has risen in prevalence over conventional fishing techniques as it allows for efficient mass production. Predatory threats could potentially be prevalent in marine animal farming as even indirect contact between a predator and possible prey could lead to greater oxygen intake by the organism which would be prey in a natural scenario. For example, a study on crayfish and freshwater crabs showed that the oxygenation of water greatly influences metabolic rate, so improper oxygen levels caused by outside factors could absolutely affect the health of the product [DeJours: 1977].  This could potentially be helpful in the growing marine animal farming industry. If predator and prey are placed next to each other with a transparent barrier, at least for an adjustment period of time extra oxygen may need to be added to the water of the weaker organism to negate the effects of increased oxygen consumption. By keeping the oxygen rate in the artificial environment consistent despite the presence of external threats to smaller organisms, perhaps farmers could raise healthier animals.

It can be observed that there is a clear trend which shows an increase in metabolic rate from the controlll to the treatment.
