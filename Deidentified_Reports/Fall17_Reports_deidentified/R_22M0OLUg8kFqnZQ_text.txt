Title: The Pharysum polycephalum’s movement towards glucose with the activator, dibutryl-cAMP

Abstract:
 Cells are an essential component to life. They are in all living organisms. Cells have signaling pathways that allow them to communicate with their internal and external environment.  This lab looked at the chemotaxis signaling pathway of Physarum polycephalum. The goal of this lab was to see how the Physarum polycephalum would react with a signaling activator,dibutyryl cAMP, and an inhibitor, curcumin, of signaling. It was hypothesized that the activator, dibutyryl cAMP, will cause the Physarum polycephalum to move towards the glucose since glucose is a food source for Physarum polycephalum. This experiment was ran by using 2% agar plates soaked in 4Mls of curcumin or dibutyl cAMP for 10 mins. Then 1cmx1cm block of Physarum polycephalum was placed in each agar plate with a 1cmx1cm block of glucose. The hypothesis was not supported. There was no significance between each treatment group and the controlll group. The dibutyryl-cAMP did not make the Physarum polycephalum move more mm towards the glucose than the controlll.


Introduction:
Cells have signal transduction pathways that allow cells to respond to their internal and external environment. The model organism is the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. Physarum contains  many nuclei within a single plasma membrane. When stresses like light or heat are present along with lack of food, it responds by starting its reproductive cycle. Physarum also have several other common behaviors like cytoplasmic streaming,phototaxis,chemotaxis, gravitaxis, and structural reorganization. This lab will look at the chemotaxis response of Physarum polycephalum in a 2% agar plate soaked in an activator and an inhibitor of cell signaling pathways.  For an activator we chose dibutyryl-cAMP which has been shown to be “chemotactic toward certain metabolites” in another slime mold, Dictyoselium discoideum [Smith: 1978]. Inhibitors affect the endoplasmic flow within the slime mold[Avsievich:2016]. Curcumin has been shown to inhibit tumor growth progression which can make it a viable option as a way to inhibit the movement of the Physarum polycephalum[Chen:2014]. It is hypothesized that the dibutryl-CAMP will act as an activator and make the Physarum polycephalum move towards the glucose. 


Materials and Method:
3- 2% agar plates was soaked in 4 Mls of dibutryl-cAMP for 10 mins. 3- 2% agar plates were then soaked in  4Mls of curcumin for 10 mins. After the 10 mins were up, 2 1cmx1cm boxes were cut into all 9- 2% agar plates.  One box in each plate had a 1cmx1cm box of Physarum slime mold placed in it. One box in each plate had a 1cmx1cm box of glucose placed in it.  All of the plates were wrapped in aluminum foil and labeled and placed in a 37o Celsius incubator for 24 hrs. The growth  of Physarum was measured for each of the plates. A t-Test was then ran to see if the data was significent.  


Results:
The Physarum in the 2% agar plates soaked in dibutryl-cAMP, grew towards the glucose. The Physarum on the controlll plates also grew towards the glucose. While the Physarum on the curcumin soaked plates grew away from the glucose or had no growth at all.  The data was not significent. The p value for the t_test ran between the dibutryl-cAMP and the controlll was 0.6852. While the p value between the controlll and curcumin was  0.1685. Both p values are higher than the alpha value of 0.05. 	


Discussion:
The original hypothesis was not supported. With the data not being significent it can not support the initial hypothesis that dibutryl-cAMP plays a role in chemotaxis in cell signaling. Even though this particular data collected did not support the initial hypothesis, one could still say that cAMP still helps initiate cell signaling. More tests can be done to confirm this. Schapp states that cAMP signaling organizes multicellular development in all slime molds[Schapp: 1984].  One reason why this lab may of not worked is because cell signaling is complex since cell systems “respond to multiple inputs, such as ligands of cell-surface receptors; and produce multiple outputs, such as changes in gene expression and cellular activities, including motility, proliferation, and death” [Hlavacek:2009].  With a complex concept like cell signaling it is hard for one experiment to give insight into the cell signaling of chemotaxis in slime molds.  Experiments need to be repeated with different cAMP chemicals i order to see if cAMP has a true role in cell signaling.
