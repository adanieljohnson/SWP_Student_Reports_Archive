Title: The Effect of a Calcium Channel Blocker on the Threshold and Amplitude of the Gastrocnemius in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
For muscles to contract, calcium ions must enter an axon to signal the release of acetylcholine, resulting in muscle contraction. Calcium channel blockers prevent muscle cells from depolarizing, decreasing the responsiveness of the muscle. We studied the effect of lanthanum chloride on the responsiveness of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens, the northern leopard frog, by measuring the threshold required for muscle contraction and the amplitude of contraction before and after applying the treatment. The muscle was stimulated through the sciatic nerve and the contraction was measured with a FT-302 force transducer. We hypothesized that threshold would increase and amplitude would decrease with the treatment. The thresholds before treatment were 0.051V, 0.26V, 0.12V, and 0.12V. After treatment, the thresholds were 0.082V, 0.17V, 0.17V, and 0.11V. The average amplitudes before treatment were 1.599V, 0.8358V, 0.5358V, and 0.7980V. After treatment, the average amplitudes were 0.2680V, 0.5486V, 0.1448V , and 0.8796V. Our results were inconclusive because essentially half of the data supported our hypothesis while half of the data refuted it. Thereâ€™s a possibility that lanthanum chloride is an effective calcium channel blocker, but further experiments needed.

Introduction:
Frogs are vertebrates, and all vertebrates have skeletal muscle, which is used in making voluntary motions. It is made up of muscle fibers that are made up of many individual myofibrils, which are long stacks of contractile proteins. Within each myofibril are many sarcomeres, which are the actual contractile portions of muscles. Muscles respond to motor neurons that originate in the gray matter of the spinal cord and meet the muscle at neuromuscular junctions. The threshold of muscular stimulation is the minimum amount of stimulation required for a response, and the amplitude is the response to a given stimulus. Muscle stimulation begins at the cell body of the neuron where an electrical stimulus is generated. This stimulus travels to the axon of the neuron, triggering the opening of calcium channels in the presynaptic portion of the neuromuscular junction, causing acetylcholine to be released into the synapse. The acetylcholine attaches to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic muscle cell, opening up channels for sodium ions to rush in and create an action potential in the muscle cell. This action potential triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing myosin heads to bind to actin and contract the sarcomere. When many sarcomeres contract in succession, muscle contraction is achieved. Contraction of a muscle can be hindered by calcium channel blockers. Without proper release of calcium ions, the acetylcholine cannot be released to begin the process of creating an action potential on the muscle cell and tropomyosin will still block the myosin binding sites on actin. A prior study found that at normal human neuromuscular junctions, certain calcium channel blockers prevent the muscle from having an action potential, thus preventing the muscle from firing [Protti: 1996]. This means that the calcium channel blockers must have affected the calcium channels on the presynaptic nerve cell, so the calcium channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum did not even come into play in this experiment. The calcium channel blockers would have this effect because they inhibit the channels that  bring in calcium ions from outside the nerve cell, so the acetylcholine is never signaled to be released and continue the contractile process. The experiment performed will be carried out by testing the responsiveness of the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens, also known as the northern leopard frog. The Rania pipiens was a good organism to use for this experiment because it was easy to isolate the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve for testing. The muscle will be tested under nerve stimulation both with and without a calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride. This will test the strength of the response of the gastrocnemus muscle both before and after the treatment. The hypothesis is that the gastrocnemus muscles will be less responsive with the treatment of lanthanum chloride, with the threshold of the treated being higher and the amplitude being less than the untreated leg.

Materials and Method:
Begin with four frog legs. The legs are skinned and the gastrocnemus muscle is be exposed. The gastrocnemus muscle is tied so that it is perpendicular to the table, with a little tension in the string so that contraction will be noticeable. Use the LabScribe application on a computer, connect the computer to the FT-302 iWorx force transducer, and connect the force transducer to the sciatic nerve. Occasionally spray the leg with frog ringer's solution. Parameters for the LabScribe program are set, with the number of pulses at 1, the frequency at 1, the pulse width at 5 ms, and the pulse amplitude at zero. To find threshold, set the pulse amplitude to 0.1V and stimulate the muscle. Increase or decrease the stimulus voltage in 0.01V intervals until no contraction can be observed. The lowest value at which a contraction was observed is the threshold. To find average amplitude, the pulse amplitude is set to a voltage that gives a strong response, therefore it should be above the threshold, and the number of pulses should be set to 5. Stimulate the muscle and record the amplitude at each pulse, then find the average voltage over the 5 pulses. Complete this process for each frog leg. After the controlll values of the leg have been determined, lanthanum chloride treatment is applied. About 2 Ml 0.1mM lanthanum chloride solution are injected into the gastrocnemus muscle. The leg should then should sit for at least 10 minutes so that the treatment can take effect. Once 10 minutes have passed, the same procedure that was done to find the threshold and average amplitude of the legs without the treatment is performed on the legs. The pulse amplitude should be set to the same value that it was set at prior to the treatment. One tailed paired t_tests are used to compare the responsiveness of each test before and after treatment of the gastrocnemus muscle with the calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride.The tests analyzed are threshold and average amplitude over five pulses.

Results:
For legs 1 and 3, the threshold of the lanthanum chloride treated group was higher than the controlll group, and for legs 2 and 4, the threshold of the controlll group was higher than the lanthanum chloride treated group, which went against our hypothesis. The threshold before treatment of each leg was 0.051V for leg 1, 0.26V for leg 2, 0.12V for leg 3, and 0.12V for leg 4. After treatment, the threshold of each leg was  0.082V for leg 1, 0.17V for leg 2, 0.17V for leg 3, and 0.11V for leg 4. For legs 1, 2, and 3, the average amplitude of contraction over five pulses was higher in the controlll group than the lanthanum chloride treated group, and for leg 4, the average amplitude of contraction over five pulses was higher in the lanthanum chloride treated group than the controlll group. The average amplitude before treatment of each leg was 1.599V for leg 1, 0.8358V for leg 2, 0.5358V for leg 3, and 0.7980V for leg 4. After treatment, the average amplitude of each leg was 0.2680V for leg 1, 0.5486V for leg 2, 0.1448V for leg 3, and 0.8796V for leg 4.  Using the one tailed paired t_test for both measurements of responsiveness, both had p_values greater than 0.05, 0.8881 for threshold and 0.2073 for amplitude, so neither result was statistically significent and there was not a significent difference in either measurement comparing before and after the treatment of lanthanum chloride. The null hypothesis cannot be refuted, which was that there was no difference in responsiveness in gastrocnemus muscle with the addition of a lanthanum chloride solution. The test for threshold had a t_stat value of 0.1530 with 3 degrees of freedom, and the test for amplitude had a t_stat value of 1.6030 with 3 degrees of freedom.


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not entirely support the hypothesis, as half of the data supported the hypothesis and half of the data contradicted the hypothesis. Only two of the legs experienced decreased responsiveness with regard to both threshold and amplitude when treated with calcium channel blocker, one of the legs experienced decreased responsiveness with regard to amplitude but increased responsiveness with regard to threshold when treated with calcium channel blocker, and one leg experienced increased responsiveness with regard to both threshold and amplitude. For the tests that supported our hypothesis, the results can be attributed to the calcium channel blocker functioning as expected: blocking the calcium channels on the presynaptic neuron at the neuromuscular junction. When calcium channels are blocked in this region, the vesicles that hold acetylcholine cannot be signaled to join with the cell membrane and release the acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, thus the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle cell cannot be signaled to open up and allow sodium ions into the cell to deoplarize it and create an action potential. Without an action potential, the sarcoplasmic reticulum will be unable to release calcium ions into the cell, thus myosin will be unable to bind and pull actin, so the sarcomeres will be unable to contract, which would prevent the contraction of the muscle as a whole. The reason that the muscles were less responsive instead of not responsive at all could be because the calcium channel blocker either ran out or was simply not strong enough to block all calcium channels completely. This would explain what was observed in the experiment as none of the muscles were completely unresponsive. For the tests that did not support our hypothesis, a potential reason for the gastrocnemus being more responsive after the treatment of calcium is similar to that of why the legs were not completely unresponsive: the lanthanum chloride simply wasnâ€™t strong enough. The solution was very low in concentration, 0.1 mM, which could have resulted in the calcium channel blocker not taking effect in the muscle at all. Another reason for the additional responsiveness of the treated legs is that the calcium channel blocker may have needed more time to reach the synapses at which they affect the calcium channels. The ten minute waiting period that was required could have potentially been too little time, which means that the calcium channel blocker did not have enough time to reach the calcium channels and inhibit them, thus decreasing the responsiveness of the muscle.The data found in this experiment was both supported and contradicted by the prior study, as the study found that calcium channel blockers decreased the responsiveness of muscles, and in this experiment there were examples of decreased responsiveness and increased responsiveness [Protti: 1996].Ultimately, the data found in this experiment does not allow for a clear conclusion on the effect of calcium channel blockers, particularly lanthanum chloride, on the responsiveness of muscles due to a lack of a clear common outcome associated with the treatment. A potential limitation of the experiment was a limited sample size, as only four frog legs were able to be studied. Observing the effect of lanthanum chloride on a much greater number of legs could potentially allow for a clear conclusion to be made on how it affects the responsiveness of the gastrocnemus muscle. A future study, other than repeating the experiment with more subjects, could be to see the correlation between responsiveness of the gastrocnemus from legs legs of the same frog, in essence comparing right leg to left leg to see if there is a difference in responsiveness between individual frogs or if there is actually a difference in responsiveness between individual legs, meaning right and left leg on the same frog may have different responsiveness. Legs three and four were from the same frog and displayed polarizing results in responsiveness, so it would be interesting to see if the trend is prevalent in all frogs.
