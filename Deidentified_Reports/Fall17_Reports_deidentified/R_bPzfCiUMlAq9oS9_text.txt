Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Chloride on the Time It Takes Gastrocnemius Muscle to Reach Tetany

Abstract:
In our experiment we studied the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, and the effect that the calcium blocker lanthanum chloride had on its gastrocnemius muscle`s time until tetany. We hypothesized that the lanthanum chloride will cause a decrease in the amount of time it took for the muscle to achieve tetany. Calcium channels are vital in the propagation of an action potential into a muscle as they control the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the presynaptic terminal and into the sarcolemma. To test our hypothesis we subjected three frog legs to a constant amplitude of 0.2 V but changed the frequency in intervals of 2, 4, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100, stopping when tetany was achieved. We tested control first then treatment second repeating the procedure. Our results were that for every leg the treatment achieved tetany at a lower frequency then the control and the control took twice as long to reach tetany. From these results, we can say our hypothesis stood as the lanthanum chloride (treatment) group had a decreased time reaching tetany relative to when they were the control group.

Introduction:
We are studying the time it takes for the gastrocnemius muscle of a Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, to reach tetany and how adding the Calcium blocker lanthanum chloride affects this time. The Northern Leopard Frog is an example of Krogh`s Principle as it is an ideal organism to use for this type of experiment where we are monitoring the leg muscles as the gastrocnemius muscles are very prominent in frogs, which leap in order to move. [Layne: 1993] In addition, it is a very convenient size in that it isn’t so big that it cannot be manipulated/moved with our hands and at the same time it isn’t so small that we need a microscope to observe it. We experiment with lanthanum chloride as it alters the permeability of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. [Friedman: 1998] Calcium ions are vital to action potentials and muscle contractions. Once depolarization occurs the and the action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal the calcium ion voltage gated channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum is opened allowing the calcium ions to be released into the presynaptic terminal. [Vieira: 2015] The calcium ions allow the vesicle carrying the neurotransmitter (let`s say ACh in this case) to bind to the presynaptic membrane and the neurotransmitter to, through exocytosis diffuse across the synaptic cleft to the muscle where it will bind to the receptors on the muscle causing another action potential to travel into the muscle and down the t-tubule to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. [Vieira: 2015] There the calcium ions will be released into the sarcoplasm and bind to troponin to initiate a contraction. [Vieira: 2015] The addition of lanthanum chloride would hinder the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the presynaptic terminal and sarcoplasm therefore would alter the rate at which the neurotransmitters can be transported to the effector muscle. [Vieira: 2015] Based on this, we predict that the calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride, will lower the time it takes for the Gastrocnemius Muscle to reach tetany. Our independent variable is the presence of lanthanum chloride in the frog and the dependent variable is the time it takes to reach tetany.

Materials and Methods:
We will be using a a paired t-test to analyze our results. First, we will remove the skin from the frog using a scalpel, revealing the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle. We will then connect the gastrocnemius muscle to the force transducer, and connect the pin electrode to set up our experiment. We will then have three frog legs that will each be tested as a control first and then as a treatment (0.2 mL) adding frog Ringer`s solution periodically to maintain organisms. We will perform the experiment three of the effect of the stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude. For the control test we started at a frequency of 2 Hz and then kept going up by intervals of 4, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100 stopping on whichever frequency causes tetany which is marked by the series of very close peaks on the LabScribe program. The amplitude will be kept at 0.2 V for the control and treatment tests. In between the two tests we will allow the muscle to rest for a couple minutes (about 5) so it will be fresh for the lanthanum chloride experiment. To prepare the 1 mM lanthanum chloride solution we dissolved 12 mg into 100 ml Ringer`s solution. After the muscle has rested we injected, using a syringe, the lanthanum chloride directly into the gastrocnemius muscle and waited two minutes to let it propagate throughout the muscle. We then repeated the same steps as the control and stopped stimulation after tetany was achieved. Repeat these steps for the other two frog legs. We will then determine which group, treatment or controlled, experienced tetany first based on the graph of the LabScribe program and the frequency at which each occurred. Materials include three Rana pipiens legs, dissecting pan, forceps, frog Ringer`s solution, dissecting probe, dissecting needle, laptop with LabScribe downloaded, David, pin electrodes, gloves, syringe, lanthanum chloride.

Results:
The general trends we saw that, as shown in graph 1 the bars were much higher for the control frog legs every frog and, according to the results in chart 1, the numerical values of the control group were larger than their treatment counterparts every frog. For the most part each trial/frog was the same in terms of the frequency tetany was achieved except for one treatment frog leg which was off by 1 Hz relative to the other two treatment legs. The mean frequency that tetany was achieved of the frogs without lanthanum chloride was significantly greater than its mean after the injection of lanthanum chloride (t-stat=17., df=9, P=0.003442).



Discussion:
From our results in table 1 and figure 1 we can conclude that our hypothesis was accepted as the time it took the frog legs before the injection of lanthanum chloride to achieve tetany was double the time it took the treatment frog legs which had the lanthanum chloride injected in their gastrocnemius muscle. In our hypothesis we said the lanthanum chloride would decrease the time it would take for tetany to be achieved which it did. The biological reason for this is that because of lanthanum chloride blocking the calcium channels not as many sarcomeres, in comparison to the control, will be engaged in the contraction. [Caterall: 2011] This is because there will not be as many calcium ions released because of the inhibition of the ryanodine and DHPR receptors which control the release of the calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum unto the sarcolemma and onto the myofibrils. [Caterall: 2011] Here they would bind to the troponin and allow for myosin binding to actin and initiate the contraction but again because there are not as many calcium ions in the treatment legs it would be to a much lesser extent. [Caterall: 2011] Therefore, it would reach tetany a lot faster because of the decreased force of contraction. [Caterall: 2011] In addition, the blockage of calcium channels would inhibit the speed at which the action potential is propagated to the neuromuscular junction and therefore the actual muscle (in this case the gastrocnemius) would not be able to withstand a high frequency of contractions without tetany since it cannot keep up as well and will be forced to succumb to tetany. [Caterall: 2011] This occurs because the calcium voltage gated channels in the presynaptic terminal are blocked and therefore there will not be as many calcium ions to bind to the vesicles containing the neurotransmitter (ACh) that will illicit an action potential which will lead to the contraction. [Caterall: 2011] This study we conducted is relatively reminiscent of another study where they used lanthanum chloride and tested how its inhibition on calcium channels affected the gravitropic response of Snapdragon Spikes. [Friedman: 1998] In this experiment they proposed that because the gravitropic ability of the Snapdragon was inhibited by the lanthanum chloride that the gravitropic response of the snapdragon`s shoots could be controlled through a Ca2+ dependent cascade involving the “modulation of cytosolic calcium ions.” [Friedman: 1998] This relates to our study as they were testing how the inhibition of calcium channels affects the gravitropic response while we studied its effect on the susceptibility of muscles to reach tetany. Furthermore, to our knowledge there was no evidence of error and therefore no sources of error. There is no other explanation for our results as the logic (detailed above) matched the results. The only thing that could have had some impact on the numbers but would have not altered the overall result of the experiment is that maybe the frog legs did not rest enough in between the control and treatment experiments leading to a faster tetany for the treatment. To compensate for this, we should do an experiment with six frog legs where we make three legs control, three legs treatment or we should do the experiment and give more than ample time for the legs to recover from the control experiment just to ensure validity.

Figure Legends: 
Table 1: Frequency at Which Tetany Was Achieved
The table above shows the three frogs and the frequency at which each one achieved tetany both before as well as after being injected with lanthanum chloride. The frog legs before the injection were able to maintain normal contractions until tetany at 10 Hz for every frog leg. After injection they were reaching tetany at a lower 4 Hz for the first two frog legs and then 5 Hz for the last frog leg. In between the before and after tests the frog legs were given roughly five minutes to recuperate before being injected and stimulated once again.
Figure 1: Frequency at Which Tetany Was Achieved vs. Presence of Lanthanum Chloride
The graph above is a representation of the results, comparing the frog legs` time (in terms of frequency) until they reached tetany. Standard deviation error bars were placed over the bars for each frog leg to compare the variance between the averages of the frog legs. The blue bars represent the frog legs before the injection of lanthanum chloride and the orange represent the frog leg after lanthanum chloride. Through this visual representation we can see more clearly the difference of time between the treatment group (after injection) and the control group (before injection) with the before lanthanum chloride reaching tetany at a higher frequency every leg.
