Title: An evaluation of the relationship between blue light and Betta splendens aggressive 

Abstract:
Aggression may have evolved in many animals as a way to defend ones claim to either their territory or mate. Betta fish (Betta splendens) are an extremely aggressive species of fish. They have a number of physiological responses towards other bettas, some of which being sporadic movements, gill flares, and increased brilliance of their coloring. We are interested in seeing if the color light, blue, affects the aggressiveness of the fish when exposed to a combatant. We had hypothesized that the blue light would make the fish act more aggressively than the white light, which was found to be to not be supported. To quantify this aggressive behavior, we counted the number of gill flares and sporadic movements of three different test fish when in the presence of a control fish under both blue and white light. Observationally, we found that the fish had more sporadic movements under white light, yet the data collected was found to be statistically insignificant. Coloring of the light may not have a large effect on a fish’s aggression due to it not being an important stimulus for the hoped-for response.


Introduction:
If an animal exhibits aggressive behavior, they may scare off other, potentially threatening animals. Betta splendens, Betta fish, are an extremely aggressive species of fish and a good model for the underlying concept of aggression. This aggression may be due to male-male competition or the need to defend one’s territory (Eisenreich et al. 2017).  When a betta fish exhibits aggressive behaviors toward another fish, their operculum, dorsal fins, and anal fins flare and the fish becomes more vibrantly colored. When a potential combatant exhibits aggressive behaviors, such as becoming vibrant colored, a fish’s frequency of aggressive behaviors is positively affected (McDonald: 2004). Betta fish are a prime example of agonistic fish due to their visible signs of hostility, like their coloring. These vibrant colors are a stimulus that influences the fish’s intensity of response. We extrapolated that this exposure to a colorful stimulus may lead to the same responses if it is light in general rather than just the coloring of the opponent fish. The betta fish in question have a brilliant blue when aggravated, thus we used blue light as our colorful stimulus. We hypothesized that if a betta fish is exposed to blue light while in visible proximity to another blue betta fish, their agonistic behavior will be intensified. 


Materials and Methods:
We used four fish for this study. We recorded the behaviors of three different fish when exposed to the fourth, with and without blue light. Two fish were placed in a tank at a time with an opaque divider between them. After lifting the divided, leaving just the transparent glass separating the fish, we exposed them to white light. We recorded the number of gill flares and sporadic movements for five minutes, then reintroduced the nontransparent divider. After giving the fish five minutes to habituate, we removed the opaque divider again, this time introducing a light with a blue film over it. We recorded the number of gill flares and sporadic movements again, subsequently giving the control fish a few minutes of rest while switching out the test fish. This process was repeated with three different test fish. From the data collected, we performed a two tailed T test. 


Results:
Generally, we found that Betta fish had more sporadic movements when exposed to white light rather than blue. The number of gill flares in white versus blue light showed no obvious trend. The mean number of sporadic movements in white light was 9.667 +/- 5.033, while the mean for blue light was 6.667 +/- 5.033. The degrees of freedom are four, T-value = 0.729996, and P-value = 0.505845. The mean number of gill flares under white light is 2.333 with a standard deviation of 2.082, whereas the mean under blue light is 1.667 with a standard deviation of 1.528. This had a DF = 4, T-value = 0.447214, and a P-value = 0.677869. Refer to graphs one and two to see the means and their standard deviations for both white and blue light.


Discussion:
This data did not support our hypothesis either statistically nor observationally. We observed that there were more sporadic movements under white light, yet not enough to be statistically significant.  There was not obvious difference in number of gill flares for white versus blue light. P-values for both the number of sporadic movements and gill flares were greater than .05 (0.505845 and 0.677869), meaning there was no significant difference between white versus blue light. These results may be because the added blue light clouded the brilliance of the other blue betta that the fish was exposed to. The added light may have made the blue of the opposing fish less intense or noticeable to the test fish, likewise, decreasing their amount of aggressive behaviors to an observational level. Additionally, the difference in light color may not have played that drastic of a role on the betta fish aggression as originally thought, making the light color not significant. This may be due to the fact that this external cue is not one of the aggression stimuli bettas are receptive to. It does not affect the degree of threat brought on by the opposing fish, thus, it may not be worth allocating the energy needed to pay attention to it. The difference may have also been found insignificant due to a possible error, as well. When recording data, we crowded around the fish tank to count the gill flares and sporadic movements. It was found that a betta fish may alter their aggression due to external cues (Dzieweczynski et al. 2005). By potentially shaking the table the tank was on, making loud noises near the tank, and moving around outside of the tank we may have affected the behavior of the fish, altering our results in the process.   Moving forward, one may try different color light films to confirm and expand upon our results. Betta fish can also be a brilliant red, like blue. Thus, someone may choose to use a red film, instead of blue, with red fish to see if there are similar findings. They could also want to use a red film with a blue fish or vice versa to see if there is less of an observed response due to the added light dulling the intensity of the fish’s coloring.   This study, and future studies building on it, can be used to decrease or increase the aggressiveness of betta fish. They are a perfect specimen in the study of the cause of different behaviors. This can be the framework for studying human behavior and aggression.
