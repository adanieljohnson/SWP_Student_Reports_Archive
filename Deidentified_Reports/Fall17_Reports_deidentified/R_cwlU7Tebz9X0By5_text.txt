Title: Frequency and Duration of “Red Mane” in Betta splendins of varying sizes

Abstract:
In the introduction I explained what “red mane” is, and hypothesized that red mane would occur in the observed Betta splenden more often and for a longer duration in the visual presence of a smaller fish. In the materials section I laid out the setup of the aquarium and how there would be 2 5 minute trials for each fish, with a five-minute rest period in between. In the results I summarized our data, while clarifying that the data did not support our hypothesis in the discussion. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins are notorious for their aggressive behavior when in the presence of other Betta splendins. These aggressive behaviors include an action known as the “red mane”, which is considered the pinnacle of aggressive behavior in Betta splendins. The red mane is a type of facing display in which the branchiostegal membrane of the Betta splenden expands. We had seen from previous experiments that the red mane would commonly appear in Betta splendins when they were in contact with other Betta splendins, but we wanted to see if the size of the other fish had an effect on the red mane. We wanted to test if the frequency and duration of red mane in Betta splendins differed if the fish was in the presence of a fish larger or smaller than itself. We predicted that if the observed Betta splendins was in the presence of a fish smaller than itself, then the frequency and duration of its red mane would increase. This is supported by a study that showed Betta splendins would react in an aggressive manner when in visual contact with another Betta splendins [Abante: 2010]. 

Materials and Method:
For our experiment we set up an aquarium with 3 sections divided by a physical and visual partition. We put the fish we were observing in the center section, with what would be considered a “smaller” Betta splendins on one side and a “larger” Betta splendins on the other. For each trial one of the visual partitions would be lifted so the observed fish was able to see either the “large” fish or the “small” fish for a five-minute period. After the trial the fish was given a five-minute rest period to prevent habituation. There were four observed fish in total, with each having a visual interaction with both the “small” and “large” fish. The frequency and duration of red mane was kept for each fish, even the large and small fish, although the only data used in the experiment was the one from the observed Betta splendins. We used a t_test for the data, since we were comparing the means of two different data sets, with the “small” contact fish being one set and the “large” contact fish being the other.

Results:
The data shows that the observed fishes’ frequency of red mane was the highest when in visual contact with a smaller Betta splendins, with an average frequency of 1 red mane per observation set. The duration of this red mane was also longer when the observed Betta splenden was in visual contact with a physically smaller fish, with an average duration of red mane being 22.75 seconds. Only one of the observed Betta splendins displayed red mane when it was in the presence of a Betta splendins larger than itself. The duration of this specific red mane display was much shorter than usual displays, as it only lasted for 0.7 seconds. Two of the observed Betta splendins did not display the red mane at all, or for any amount of time when in visual contact with another Betta splendins larger or smaller than itself. The p_value for the frequency of red mane was 0.391002. The p_value for the duration of red mane was 0.345488, which is shown in the figures below. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported, as our p_values for both frequency and duration were much higher than 0.05. This would indicate that the size of the opponent does not matter to Betta splendins. Part of this could be due to habituation in the Betta splendins that were used in the experiment. They had been used in several weeks of experiments and had become habituated to the presence of other Betts splendins, and thus did not view them as a threat, so they did not display red mane. This is not unusual in experiments with Betta splendins, as it was found in a previous experiment that Betta splendins stopped showing aggressive behavior in experiments that had lasted longer than 32 hours, due to habituation [Baenninger: 1966]. Other studies that avoided habituations showed that the Betta splenden did have a behavioral response, typically one of aggression, when put in visual contact with other Betta splendins, regardless of their size [Abante: 2010]. Another study even showed that Betta splendins who did not experience habituation even exhibited aggressive behavior towards mirrored images of themselves [Elcoro: 2008]. The fact that other experiments were able to observe the aggressive behaviors of Betta splendins that had been put in visual contact with one another shows that this experiment should be conducted with fish that have not been used in experiments before. I think it would also be beneficial to have more trials of this experiment to determine if there is a pattern of behavior in Betta splendins that makes them display red mane more often and for a longer duration, depending on the size of the other Betta splenden that they are in visual contact with.

Figure Legends: 
Figure one shows the mean frequency of red mane when in the visual presence of Betta splendins smaller and larger than themselves. Figure two shows the mean duration of red mane when in the visual presence of Betta splendins smaller and larger than themselves. These results were not found to be statistically significent, and thus our hypothesis was not supported.
