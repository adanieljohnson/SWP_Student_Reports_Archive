Title: The Effect of Darkness on Specific Metabolic Rate in Procambris sp.  

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to analyze the effect of darkness on specific metabolic rate in the Procambris sp.  We performed experiments using a dissolved oxygen probe place in a screw top container in order to measure the oxygen consumption of the Procambris sp. Our hypothesis was that when the organism is exposed to darkness it will have a decrease oxygen consumption and therefore a decrease in specific metabolic rate.  In our results the average specific metabolic rate for the organism when it was exposed to light was 0.000605667 O2/min(g) and the average specific metabolic rate when the organism was in darkness was higher, at 0.001488667 O2/min(g). We conclude that darkness does not affect specific metabolic rate in the Procambris s.p. because in our results the P-value was insignificent at 0.167904. 


Introduction:
The organism that is being studied is the Procambris sp. which is an ectotherm crustacean.  The Procambris s.p. lives in an aquatic environment and are a good model organism for this experiment because they consume oxygen from the water and oxygen consumption is an easy way to measure specific metabolic rate which is the focus of this study.  Darkness can play a role in the effect of specific metabolic rate in comparison to light exposure.  In an experiment done on Mus musculus (mice), the specific metabolic rate of the organism decreased when exposed to darkness in comparison to light because of the organism being more active at night and therefor more comfortable in situations of darkness [Evans, Dutcher, Dean, Gardner, 2015].  Because the Mus musculus is primarily nocturnal they are more situated in a dark environment and more relaxed.  The Procambris sp. is also a primarily nocturnal species so therefore we expect to see a similar outcome in the Procambaras s.p., as was observed in the Mus musculus, a decrease in specific metabolic rate when exposed to darkness.  It is also evident that mice are mammals while the Procambris s.p. are crustaceans, which could be a factor to cause a different outcome than our hypothesis. We expect that when we put the Procambris sp. under similar circumstances, such as complete darkness, their specific metabolic rate will also decrease.  We hypothesize that in an experiment when Procambris sp. are exposed to darkness the organism will have a decreased specific metabolic rate and, when they are exposed to light the organism will have an increased specific metabolic rate. 


Materials and Method:
Weigh Procambris sp. 1 and place in screw top container and fill with room temperature water (22 ° C) and secure the top.  Set into dishpan filled with room temperature water.  Measure the O2 concentration using the oxygen meter at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes.  Repeat the same steps but this time cover the container with aluminum foil securely so that no light can be exposed on the Procambris sp. or into the container. The use of the aluminum foil imitates darkness.  At end of 20 minutes remove the Procambris sp. and record the water volume in liters.  Repeat previous steps for all 3 Procambris sp.  Then calculate the specific metabolic rate for each Procambris sp. using the formula (change in O2 (mg/L)) x (volume of H2O (L)) / (Time (min)) x (weight (g)) = specific metabolic rate. We use this calculation because it also adjusts for weight. The organisms being used were collected from a lab.  A paired t_test was used to find the average specific metabolic rate of the organism before and after darkness. 


Results:
The P-value for our experiment, when comparing the averages of controlll and treatment groups, was 0.167904, which is not significent.  Although there is no statistical significance, the general trend for the Procambris sp. in this experiment was an increase in specific metabolic rate during exposure to darkness for all three organisms in comparison to exposure to light.  
The average specific metabolic rate for the Procambris s.p. in the controlll group, light exposure, was 0.000605667 O2/min(g) and the standard deviation was 0.000229106. The average specific metabolic rate for the Procambris s.p. in the experimental group, darkness exposure, was 0.001488667 O2/min(g) and the standard deviation was 0.000503156. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported because the specific metabolic rate did not change between the groups.  We hypothesized that a decrease in light exposure (darkness) would decrease the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. and that an increase in light exposure would increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp.  In a study done on two amphipod crustaceans, the hypogean Niphargus stygius and the epigean Gammarus fossarum, the organism epigean Gammarus fossarum had increased oxygen consumption, and therefor specific metabolic rate when exposed to darkness.  But, the hypogean Niphargus stygius had a decreased oxygen consumption, and therefor decreased specific metabolic rate when exposed to darkness.  The experiment explained this outcome based on the fact that the epigean Gammarus fossarum lives predominately in a habitat which is normally shady and with less accessible light, and the hypogean Niphargus stygius lives predominately in a habitat with shallow water with strong exposure to sunlight. The epigean Gammarus fossarum, would have a higher specific metabolic rate in the darkness because that is the organisms normal habitat and the hypogean Niphargus stygius, would react abnormally to darkness, an environment the organism is not used to, and have a decreased specific metabolic rate [Simčič and Brancelj, 2007]. This experiment provides good evidence for why the Procambris sp. have a decreased specific metabolic rate in the light not only because the hypogean Niphargus stygius and the epigean Gammarus fossarum are ectotherms like the Procambris sp., but also because the normal habitat for the Procambris sp. is one similar to the Gammarus fossarum, where darkness is a normal aspect of the environment.  Some limitations to our experiment could have been that the Procambris sp. was stressed during the lab, especially when being transferred into the container, resulting in a higher oxygen consumption for the first few minutes of the experiment.  Also, the aluminum foil could have not covered the container completely from the light exposure during the experimental procedures for darkness.  For future experiments, something to consider would be having a larger sample size, to find data that is significent, and also, to switch the order of the controlll and experimental (darkness) procedures. For example, if we did the darkness experiment for Procambris sp. 1 first and then the light exposure experiment, we could see if the oxygen consumption increased at first, in the darkness, because of the stress the organism receives in the beginning when being transferred to the container at the start of the trails.  For a future study, we could test the difference between nocturnal crustaceans’ response to darkness, such as the Procambris s.p., and diurnal crustaceans’ response to darkness, such as the hypogean Niphargus stygius.
