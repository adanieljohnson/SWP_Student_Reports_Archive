Title: Calcium Channel Activator Does Not Affect How Quickly Tetany Initially Occurs in the Gastrocnemius of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
In this study, we looked at the effects of A23187, a calcium channel activator, on tetany in the gastrocnemus muscle of a Northern Leopard Frog. We hypothesized that injecting the muscle with A23187 would decrease the frequency at which the muscle first achieves tetany. We used a muscle stimulator, a myogram and a transducer to test our hypothesis. We inserted pin electrodes into the gastrocnemus muscle and stimulated the muscle at increasing frequencies until we saw tetany. Once we found the frequency at which the gastrocnemus muscle first reaches tetany, we inserted calcium channel activator into the muscles. We then determined at what frequency tetany first occurs in the treated muscle. This process was done on three different frog legs. After running a paired t_test, we rejected our hypothesis and concluded that calcium channel activator does not have a significent effect on the frequency at which the muscle reaches tetany. It may be that 0.2 Ml of 100 mM A23187 could not open enough calcium channels in the given amount of time to significently increase the rate at which the muscle reaches tetany.

Introduction:
A neuromuscular junction is the point at which a motor neuron forms a synapse with a muscle fiber [Johnson: 2017]. A muscle contraction is initiated by an action potential in the motor neuron [Johnson: 2017]. Depolarization of the axon causes voltage-gated calcium channels to open at the end of the axon; when the channels open, calcium rushes into the cell and causes synaptic vesicles to bind to the pre-synaptic membrane [Sadava: 2017]. When synaptic vesicles are bound to the pre-synaptic membrane, they then release acetylcholine into the synapse [Johnson: 2017]. When more calcium is present, more synaptic vesicles bind and more neurotransmitter. Acetylcholine binds to receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, which opens ion channels [Johnson: 2017]. This allows cations to rush in and depolarize the post synaptic cell [Johnson: 2017]. After threshold has been reached, an action potential runs down the T-tubule of the muscle fiber and activates the DHP receptor; this activates the ryanodine receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a calcium bank located in the muscle [Sadava: 2017]. When the ryanodine receptor is activated, calcium channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum open and calcium rushes into the sarcoplasm [Sadava: 2017]. This calcium then binds to troponin, a protein found on the actin filament in a muscle; when calcium binds to troponin, tropomyosin moves, exposing actin-myosin binding sites [Sadava: 2017]. When myosin binds to these sites on the actin, ATP releases a phosphate and initiates the sliding of actin [Sadava: 2017]. This is what causes a sarcomere to shrink and allows a muscle to contract. Therefore, calcium is involved in two different parts of muscle contraction [Catterall: 1991. It must be present in the motor neuron so that synaptic vesicles bind to the pre-synaptic membrane and release acetylcholine into the synapse. Secondly, it must be present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum so that when the ryanodine receptor is activated, calcium can bind to troponin and expose myosin binding sites on the actin, initiating the shrinking of the sarcomeres [Catterall: 1991].
 One action potential activates one muscle twitch. If multiple action potentials are fired continuously, the twitches sum. Continuous activation leads to maximum contraction of the muscle. This happens because the muscle does not have enough time between action potentials to clear the calcium out of the sarcoplasm. This is referred to as tetany [Johnson: 2017]. In this lab, we want to see the effect that A23187, a calcium channel activator, has on tetany. Our independent variable is frequency and our dependent variable is whether or not tetany occurs. We will study the gastrocnemus muscle of the Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens. It is helpful to study R pipiens because it is fairly easy to remove their skin and dissect their legs in such a way that the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle are isolated. Additionally, they have well developed gastrocnemus muscles from jumping. Injecting A23187 into their gastrocnemus muscles will open more voltage-gated calcium channels in the motor neuron and on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and so we predict that the calcium channel activator will cause the muscle to reach tetany quicker. 


Materials and Method:
We obtained three frog legs and skinned each of them. Throughout the entire experiment, we kept the legs moist with Ringer solution. We gently opened the thigh to expose the sciatic nerve, then detached the gastrocnemus muscle completely by cutting at the Achilles tendon. We tied a piece of string to the junction of the gastrocnemus muscle and the Achilles tendon and then cut off the excess. We tied the lose end of the string to the hook, and adjusted the height of the hook until there was light tension on the string. We pinned the leg to a dissecting pan near the tibia and at the top of the leg so that it would stay in place as shown in Figure 1. We then inserted pin electrodes into the suspended gastrocnemus and connected the pin electrodes to the muscle stimulator. Figure 1 displays how the frog leg should look once it has been set up for the experiment. The muscle stimulator was hooked up to a computer so that we could record a myogram. We used the program LabScribe. We adjusted the settings so that the display time was set to 20 sec, the number of pulses is was set to 0, and the pulse amplitude was set to 1.0 V. We set the frequency to 4 Hz and typed 4Hz-Direct in the Mark box. We recorded muscle activity for 5 seconds. If tetany did not occur, we raised the frequency by 1 Hz and stimulated the muscle for another 5 seconds. We continued to raise the frequency by 1 Hz until the muscle reached tetany. To make 100mM A23187, we dissolved 5 mg in 10 Ml of ethanol, then diluted to 100 Ml in Ringer’s solution. We injected 0.2 Ml of 100mM A23187 into the gastrocnemus muscle, and let the muscle sit for two minutes. We set the frequency back to 4 Hz and started this process over again. Again, we stopped when we first saw Tetany. We did this whole process over again with the remaining two dissected frog legs. We used a paired t_test to compare the average frequency at which a gastrocnemus muscle without calcium channel activator reached tetany with the average frequency at which a gastrocnemus muscle with calcium channel activator reached tetany. 

Results:
We found that the gastrocnemus muscles did not reach tetany quicker after they were injected with the 100mM A23187. The average frequency at which tetany was first achieved in the muscles without calcium channel activator was 10.33 Hz, and the average frequency at which tetany is first achieved in muscles with calcium channel activator was 14.33 Hz. Figure 2 displays the frequency at which tetany was achieved in each leg before and after treatment. The mean frequency at which tetany first occurs in the gastrocnemus muscles injected with calcium channel activator is not significently lower than the mean frequency at which tetany first occurs in muscles without calcium channel activator (t_stat= 3.46, d.f.= 2, P= 0.074). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that muscles injected with calcium channel activator would reach tetany at a lower frequency was rejected. In a study similar to ours, the gastrocnemus of a frog was treated with caffeine and voltage during muscle contraction was looked at. Findings indicated that caffeine increased skeletal muscle contraction by opening more calcium ion channels [Olorunshola: 2011]. In another study, mouse skeletal muscle was injected with 5 mM caffeine. Caffeine increased the amount of calcium in the muscle during tetany. This elevated tetanic tension and decreased the rate at which the muscle relaxed [Allen: 1995]. The results of these studies suggest that our study may have skewed results due to poor execution. Although a different drug was used in both of these studies, the results suggest that opening more calcium channels will increase muscle contraction and affect tetany. It is possible that the 0.2 Ml of 100mM A23187 did not open enough calcium channels to make a significent difference in how the muscle behaves. It is also possible that we did not let the muscle sit for long enough after we injected it with calcium channel activator. In the future, we should repeat this experiment with more frog legs. Additionally, we should let the frog leg rest for longer after we inject it with calcium channel activator to ensure that A23187 has enough time to activate the calcium channels. It would also ensure that the leg is not still fatigued from the first round of stimulations. I think it would also be beneficial to run an experiment where we test if calcium channel activator has a significent effect on muscle contraction. In this experiment, we found that A23187 does not affect how quickly the gastrocnemus muscle reaches tetany. I believe that this experiment should be repeated in the future with a few minor adjustments.
