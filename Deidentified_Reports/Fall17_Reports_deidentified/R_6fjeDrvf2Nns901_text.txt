Title: Shorter Rest Periods Increase Intraspecific Agonistic Behavior in Betta Splendins 

Abstract:
Betta fish (Betta splendins), also known as Siamese fighting fish, are particularly known for their aggressive behavior between males- intraspecific agnostic behavior.  In this experiment, we introduced two male betta fish to one another with a glass barrier between them to prevent injury in order to analyze if increased or decreased resting periods between interactions raise or lower aggressive behavior, quantified by the number of times either fish struck the glass barrier.  We hypothesized that the fish would display higher levels of aggression when exposed to one another after shorter rest periods. When we ran the linear regression against the collected data, we found a negative correlation (-4.5) between rest periods and the number of times the fish hit the glass. The r^2 value of 0.3352 demonstrated a roughly linear relationship between rest periods and aggression, helping to support the hypothesis. 


Introduction:
Animal behavior helps scientists analyze species’ behavior, their ecology, and relatedness toward each other. Male betta fish (Betta splendins) are characterized by their intraspecific agnostic behavior, defined as male-male aggression within the same species. Some examples of male betta agnostic behavior include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. These behaviors can escalate to violent physical conflict and even death. Studies have tested different influences on such aggression, including one that found that male Betta splendins display more aggressive behavior when exposed to mirrors, even when in the tank without another male Betta splendins (Dore, Ducharme, Lefebvre - 1978).  Another study found a relationship between habituation and the decreased intraspecific agnostic behavior between Betta splendins (Figler, Klein, Peeke - 1978). The purpose of this experiment was to test whether or not longer or shorter rest periods between male-male interactions increases the rapidness of agnostic behavior. We predicted that shorter resting periods (in this experiment, 1 and 3 minute rest periods) increase male-male agnostic behavior. We tested this prediction by exposing three sets of male Betta splendins to one another (separated for safety by a glass barrier), counting the number of times either fish struck the glass barrier, and then increasing the rest period from 1 to 3 to 5 minutes. 


Materials and Method:
Two male Betta splendins were exposed to each other with a glass barrier to prevent physical injury. The number of times the fish aggressively behaved, quantified by the number of times either struck the dividing glass, was recorded. There was then a rest period of one minute of complete isolation before the fish were reintroduced. This process was repeated for increasing rest periods of 3 and 5 minutes. A linear regression of the data was run to test the correlation between time and aggression, in addition to calculated averages and standard deviations. 


Results:
The average number of physical strikes for the rest periods of 5, 3, , and 1 minutes were, respectively, 35.333, 45.333, and 53.333 strikes (Fig 1). The standard deviations for both of these values were 8.327, 13.051, and 15.535 (Fig 1). A linear regression was run against the data to analyze the relationship between aggression and rest periods. There was a negative correlation between the data, valued at -4.5 (Fig 2). The r^2 value of 0.3352 (Fig 2), meaning that the resting periods accounted for roughly 33% of aggressive variants, coupled with the averages and regression line, is enough data to demonstrate a roughly linear relationship between male Betta splendins aggression and resting period. It also supported the hypothesis that shorter rest periods increase aggression. 


Discussion:
Our results, including the -4.5 correlation and r^2 value of 0.3352, were significent enough to support our hypothesis that shorter resting periods between male-male Betta splendins exposure increase intraspecific agnostic behavior.  This relationship could be due to the fish’s lack of habituation and higher stress when given shorter resting periods between male-male exposure. Future studies regarding Betta splendins and interspecific agnostic behavior could include more fish samples and even more resting periods to better statistically show a strong relationship between quantified aggression and resting periods.  It would also be very interesting to run a study of male-male Betta splendins aggression when the male fish are exposed to a female Betta splendins. One study did not find an increased pattern of agnostic aggression when male Betta splendins were exposed to females (Bronstein - 1984) , but it would be interesting to analyze such interactions when resting periods are increased or decreased.
