Title: Shorter Rest Periods Increase Intraspecific Agonistic Behavior in Betta Splendens 

Abstract:
Betta fish (Betta splendens), also known as Siamese fighting fish, are particularly known for their aggressive behavior between males- intraspecific agonistic behavior.  In this experiment, we introduced two male betta fish to one another with a glass barrier between them to prevent injury in order to analyze if increased or decreased resting periods between interactions raise or lower aggressive behavior, quantified by the number of times either fish struck the glass barrier.  We hypothesized that the fish would display higher levels of aggression when exposed to one another after shorter rest periods. When we ran the linear regression against the collected data, we found a negative correlation (-4.5) between rest periods and the number of times the fish hit the glass. The r^2 value of 0.3352 demonstrated a roughly linear relationship between rest periods and aggression, helping to support the hypothesis. 


Introduction:
Animal behavior helps scientists analyze species’ behavior, their ecology, and relatedness toward each other. Male betta fish (Betta splendens) are characterized by their intraspecific agonistic behavior, defined as male-male aggression within the same species. Some examples of male betta agonistic behavior include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. These behaviors can escalate to violent physical conflict and even death. Studies have tested different influences on such aggression, including one that found that male Betta splendens display more aggressive behavior when exposed to mirrors, even when in the tank without another male Betta splendens (Dore, Ducharme, Lefebvre - 1978).  Another study found a relationship between habituation and the decreased intraspecific agonistic behavior between Betta splendens (Figler, Klein, Peeke - 1978). The purpose of this experiment was to test whether or not longer or shorter rest periods between male-male interactions increases the rapidness of agonistic behavior. We predicted that shorter resting periods (in this experiment, 1 and 3 minute rest periods) increase male-male agonistic behavior. We tested this prediction by exposing three sets of male Betta splendens to one another (separated for safety by a glass barrier), counting the number of times either fish struck the glass barrier, and then increasing the rest period from 1 to 3 to 5 minutes. 


Materials and Methods:
Two male Betta splendens were exposed to each other with a glass barrier to prevent physical injury. The number of times the fish aggressively behaved, quantified by the number of times either struck the dividing glass, was recorded. There was then a rest period of one minute of complete isolation before the fish were reintroduced. This process was repeated for increasing rest periods of 3 and 5 minutes. A linear regression of the data was run to test the correlation between time and aggression, in addition to calculated averages and standard deviations. 


Results:
The average number of physical strikes for the rest periods of 5, 3, , and 1 minutes were, respectively, 35.333, 45.333, and 53.333 strikes (Fig 1). The standard deviations for both of these values were 8.327, 13.051, and 15.535 (Fig 1). A linear regression was run against the data to analyze the relationship between aggression and rest periods. There was a negative correlation between the data, valued at -4.5 (Fig 2). The r^2 value of 0.3352 (Fig 2), meaning that the resting periods accounted for roughly 33% of aggressive variants, coupled with the averages and regression line, is enough data to demonstrate a roughly linear relationship between male Betta splendens aggression and resting period. It also supported the hypothesis that shorter rest periods increase aggression. 


Discussion:
Our results, including the -4.5 correlation and r^2 value of 0.3352, were significant enough to support our hypothesis that shorter resting periods between male-male Betta splendens exposure increase intraspecific agonistic behavior.  This relationship could be due to the fish’s lack of habituation and higher stress when given shorter resting periods between male-male exposure. Future studies regarding Betta splendens and interspecific agonistic behavior could include more fish samples and even more resting periods to better statistically show a strong relationship between quantified aggression and resting periods.  It would also be very interesting to run a study of male-male Betta splendens aggression when the male fish are exposed to a female Betta splendens. One study did not find an increased pattern of agonistic aggression when male Betta splendens were exposed to females (Bronstein - 1984) , but it would be interesting to analyze such interactions when resting periods are increased or decreased.
