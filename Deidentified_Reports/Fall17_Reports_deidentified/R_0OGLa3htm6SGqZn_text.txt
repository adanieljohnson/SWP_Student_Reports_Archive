Title: How buck wheat and oat allocate their resources differently when they are under competition.

Abstract:
Plants utilizes nutrient and resources like light and water to grow for greater chance at survival. In order to determine how plant allocate their resources more efficiently, we utilized buck wheat and oat to compare their R:S ratio in both weight and length with one under competition with the other and one that grew independently. The results show no difference between the one under competition to the one that didn’t. Take that together, we prove the hypothesis is false and competition made no effect on the survival strategies of the plants.


Introduction:
Plants have strategies for resources allocation. They do that because there are limited resources in the environment for them to utilize. Within one species, root nutrient concentration, relative growth rate, and biomass allocation exhibited the most plastic responses to nutrient availability. Woody plants respond to nutrient limitation by increasing root mass fraction, rather than by adjusting root morphology or structure. (Kramer-Walter: 2017) That is, nutrient level affects the growth of the plants, and the ratio between the root and shoot is critical to determine how the plant utilizes the resources at hand. Moreover, Morphology (i.e. plant height, branch number and leaf area), biomass allocation and physiology are important traits for plant growth. Comparisons of these traits between invasive and native species are beneficial for identifying the adaptability of plants to environmental conditions. (Pan: 2017) Based on these, we learned that plants response to resources by alternate root mass fraction and nutrient concentration, which forms different root length and shoot length and weight. Between different plant species, those traits are more important since plants are under competition. Therefore, we want to know what will happen if two plants are in competition with each other with limited resources. Using R:S ratio would be a more comprehensive way for discovering the differences. We are testing the hypothesis that plants under competition would change their resources allocation strategies and the R:S ratio would change significently for the lack of resources due to competition.


Materials and Method:
We wanted to see if there are differences between plants when they are under competition. So we chose two plants – buck wheat and oat – to compare their R:S ratio in length and weight to see if they would change their resource allocation strategies when they are under competition. We set up nine boxes of plants for observation. The first three boxes (#1, #2, and #3) were planted with 40 buck wheat seeds and three (#4, #5, and #6) with 40 oat seeds. The last three boxes (#7, #8, and #9) were planted with 20 buck wheat seeds and 20 oat seeds together. We provided each box with 50Ml of nutrient fluid and watered the plants every 24 hours. After 14 days, we collected the data of the R:S ratio in length and weight of buck wheat and oat under competition to those were not. We measured the length and weight of the shoot and root of both plants in each box and then calculated the R:S ratio in weight and length.
Statistical analysis
We used multiple two-sample t_test to examine the difference between the R:S ratio. We calculated the means of the R:S ratio of both plants in length and weight of each boxes by taking five replicates’ data, and used the means to conduct the t_tests. There are four t_tests in total – R:S ratio of buck wheat in length, R:S ratio of buck wheat in weight, R:S ratio of oat in length, and R:S ratio of oat in weight. The null hypothesis is that the first data set has no difference with the second one. The alternate hypothesis is that the first data set is different than the second date set.


Results:
The p_value of t_test of R: S weight ratio of buck wheat between the one under competition and the one that did not is approximately 0.539959. With significance level being 0.05 and p_value being 0.539959, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there’s no obvious difference between 2 data set. The p_value of t_test of R: S length ratio of buck wheat between the one under competition and the one that did not is approximately 0.576021. With significance level being 0.05 and p_value being 0.576021, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there’s no obvious difference between 2 data set. The p_value of t_test of R: S weight ratio of oat between the one under competition and the one that did not is approximately 0.871974.  With significance level being 0.05 and p_value being 0.871974, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there’s no obvious difference between 2 data set. The p_value of t_test of R: S length ratio of oat between the one under competition and the one that did not is approximately 0.087272. With significance level being 0.05 and p_value being 0.087272, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there’s no obvious difference between 2 data set. Therefore, there are no significent difference between R:S ratio of both the buck wheat and the oat in length and in weight. We failed to prove the hypothesis, so the hypothesis is false.


Discussion:
Although the hypothesis is false, we could still focus on this topic by making improvement. Our study did not success because we did not know the exact resources that are required for competition for happened. Things as nutrient level and resources limitation could be more carefully utilized to achieve the goal. Not only limited to water and nutrient, we could also take sunlight into account, even CO2. With increasing C availability, the fraction of assimilation allocated to biomass (SG + NSC + SMs), in particular NSC and SMs, increased. At low [CO2], biomass and NSC increased in leaves but decreased in stems and roots, which may help plants achieve a functional equilibrium, that is, overcome the most severe resource limitation. (Huang: 2017) This suggests that the biomass of the plant – in our study is indicated through R:S ratio – could also be affected by the availability of CO2. In future study, we could also use different plants (maybe between invasive and noninvasive species) for this experiment to test this hypothesis, because the difference might be accounted for the species’ own structure and composition.
