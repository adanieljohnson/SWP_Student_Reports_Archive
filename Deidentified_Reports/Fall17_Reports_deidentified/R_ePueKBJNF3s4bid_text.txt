Title: The Effect of Saltwater on Resource Allocation of Wheat Plants

Abstract:
Phenotypic variation is the phenomenon in which different outward appearances can be expressed by individuals of the same species based on the environmental stress that each organism is subject to. In this study, variation among phenotype was studied by measuring the root:shoot ratio (R:S) for length and weight of wheat plants under the stress of saltwater at a concentration of 0.35%. If wheat plants were placed under the external stress of flooding the soil with saltwater, then the average R:S ratio for length and weight would significantly change. The study found that average R:S ratio for weight between the salt treated and control groups was insignificant. The average R:S ratio for length between the salt treated and control groups was significant. It was concluded that salt may affect the roots ability to perform tasks like nutrient absorption resulting in more resources allocated to the root system in an attempt to increase available surface area; thus, the shoots suffered and were shorter in length than control groups.

Introduction:
Wheat is a common crop grown all over the world for food for people and animals. It is a fairly fast-growing plant that is easy to care for from germination to harvest. Wheat, like any organism, can look very different from another member of the same species if the two organisms are subject to different external environments which is an example of phenotypic variation. When studying living systems with regards to phenotypic variation, resource allocation is a biological aspect that accounts for the effect of environmental stressors on an organism’s physical appearance, or phenotype [Johnson, 2017]. Root:shoot (R:S) ratio is a measure of resource allocation in which the length, or weight of the roots are compared to that of the shoots. It has been documented that saline environments can have a detrimental effect on lateral root growth and that high salinity can prevent root growth [Duan et al, 2013]. With the popularity and importance of wheat crop, the effect of salinity on plant growth would be of interest to the agriculture industry in terms of the best growing practices. We predicted that if the soil of wheat plants is flooded with saltwater (0.35% concentration) then the root:shoot ratio for length and weight will be significantly different than if the soil was just treated with tap water. 


Materials and Methods:
We acquired six wheat plants. Three plants for the experimental group, and three for the control group. For the experimental group, the soil was flooded with 75 mL of 0.35% concentration saltwater solution. For the control group, 75 mL of regular tap water was used to flood the soil. This was completed every two days for two weeks. After two weeks, the plants were harvested and the R:S ratio was measured. Each plant had a R:S ratio measured for both weight and length. We chose ten individual plants from each pot, washed them off in water, and dried them. For weight R:S ratio, we placed ten plants on a tarred scale. The group removes them after weighing and cut each plant, separating the root from the green shoot part. Then we measured the collective weight of the roots. To find the weight of the shoots, we subtracted the root weight from total weight. For length R:S ratio, we measured the longest root (in centimeters) and divided it by the longest shoot. The group repeated this for each of the five other groups of plants.

A two tailed T-Test, which analyzes the possibility of a positive or negative effect on the experimental group, will be used to analyze the average R:S ratios for three trials to determine whether or not the saltwater caused a significant difference in R:S ratio for both weight and length. 



Results:
Based purely on observational data, the plants treated with saltwater appeared to be smaller than the plants treated with only water (as evidenced by Figure 1).  Collectively, the experimental plants were shorter in stature than the control plants who appeared to be healthier. The average R:S ratio for the control group weight was 0.45  0.11 and the average R:S ratio for the weight of the group treated with saltwater was 0.64  0.16 (see Figure 2). The average R:S ratio for the control group length was 1.06  0.14 and the average R:S ratio for the length of the group treated with saltwater was 1.65  0.04 (see Figure 3). 

A two-tailed T-test was performed to determine the significance of the difference between the control and experimental group in both cases of R:S ratio for length and weight. For average R:S ratio of weight, the difference between plants treated with water and those treated with saltwater was shown to be insignificant (t-stat = 1.74, df = 4, P = 0.16). For average R:S ratio of length, the difference between plants treated with water and those treated with saltwater was shown to be significant (t-stat = 7.14, df = 4, P = 0.002). This means that only the average R:S ratio for length can be attributed to a cause other than random chance.


Discussion:
Considering that the difference in average R:S ratio for length between the plants treated with saltwater and those treated with freshwater was significant and R:S ratio for weight was not, the hypothesis that there would be a difference in R:S ratio for length and weight can be partially supported and the null hypothesis that salt would not have an effect on R:S ratios can be somewhat rejected. The data collected showed that the shoot length for the experimental salt treated groups was considerably shorter than that of the plants treated with freshwater. This could be a result of the wheat plants allocating more resources, namely carbon, structuring and growing the roots that are more directly affected by the saltwater flooded soil than the shoots would be. This exhibits the concept of phenotypic variation among the same species in which plants under the environmental stress of excess salt in the soil may allocate more resources to the roots to compensate for the detriment caused by the salt. Studies concerning the effect of salt on cucumber plants indicate that increased soil salinity caused the roots to have less available surface area capable of absorbing nutrients [Wang et al, 2006]. To offset the decline is root productivity, plants may create more roots and, in effect, create more surface area to increase the plants survival and ability to collect resources from the soil. More resources distributed to the roots would mean that less growth would be exhibited by the shoots, which is consistent with the length R:S ratio findings of this study.  Another study, analyzing the effects of saline environments on mulberry seedlings, found that the height of plants, meaning ground-up shoot length, decreases with salt stress. It was also noted that salt stress caused a drop is water potential, which is important for plant growth [Sun et al, 2009]. This evidence might explain why the salt stressed wheat plants in our experiment had much shorter shoot lengths than that of the plants watered with freshwater. With shoots being unable to grow upward, the R:S ratio for length is impacted, which explains the significance of the data presented. A study performed on a different strain of wheat than in our experiment, found that flooding the soil with excess salt had an inhibitory effect on root growth [Ren et al, 2000]. With roots struggling to grow, the plant may allocate more carbon resources to increase the total root surface area in an attempt to maximize nutrient acquisition performance. As a result of this allocation, the wheat plants would be using less resources on the shoots, and they might be smaller is size. This assumption is seen in our experiment as the length of shoots for the salt stressed plants was smaller than that of the control. This ultimately led to a significantly different R:S ratio for average length between experimental and control groups. Even though the plants are of the same species, in the end, they varied in phenotype due to the environmental stress imposed on them. 
	In future replications of this experiment, utilizing for individual test subjects would be helpful in solidifying the effect that salt has on wheat plants. More plants would yield more data that would help statically determine the significance of salt on plant growth and R:S ratios. It may also be of interest to learn if there is a threshold at which salt starts to have a negative effect on plant growth. This could be investigated by simply flooding the soil of plants with different saltwater concentrations. In a broad sense, research like this is important to the agriculture sector with regard to optimizing the conditions that best grow certain crops. If studies show that specific salt concentrations are detrimental to plant growth, then it would be in the industry’s best interest to routinely test soil salt levels and maintain a healthy salt concentration.
