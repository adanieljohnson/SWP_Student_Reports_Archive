Title: How Salinity Affects the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambris Sp.

Abstract:
In this experiment, we measured the specific metabolic rate, which is the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass over a period of time, to determine whether saltwater (100Ml of NaCl/900Ml H2O) affected the amount of oxygen Procambris Sp, a freshwater crayfish, consumed. We hypothesized that the 100Ml of NaCl/900Ml H2O saltwater would cause a significent difference in specific metabolic rate between the treatment and controlll groups of the experiment. After performing a two-tailed paired statistical t_test, we determined that there was a significent difference in the treatment and controlll groups of the crayfish, supporting our alternate hypothesis. We think that there was a significent difference in specific metabolic rate for the controlll and treatment groups because Procambris Sp. is freshwater species, so the stressful saltwater environment caused the crayfish to reduce its oxygen intake, by decreasing movement, for survival in a high salinity environment.


Introduction:
	Organisms expend energy in order to maintain basic physiological functions, such as temperature regulation. The amount of energy utilized to break down glucose to perform basic physiological activities is proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed and can be measured in terms of specific metabolic rate, the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass over a period of time. For this experiment we utilized, Procambris sp., a freshwater crayfish, and ectotherm, to determine if salinity can affect its specific metabolic rate. The independent variable will be the addition of 100Ml of NaCl/900Ml H2O to the freshwater and the independent variable will be the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. Procambris sp is a suitable model organism for this experiment because it is an ectotherm, and ectotherms’ metabolisms can be easily altered by their environments, affecting their metabolic rates. 


Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, we began by preparing our controlll test of room temperature water, then we scooped out Procambris sp with a net, and weighed it on a scale. After taking note of the crayfish’s weight, we put the crayfish in the testing jar, screwed the cap on tightly and began testing the oxygen concentration. We tested the oxygen concentration every 5 minutes for 20 minutes and recorded the results. Next, we measured the volume of the water in the testing container by putting it into a 1000Ml beaker. After emptying out the beaker, we started testing our treatment group. We did this by adding 900Ml of room temperature water to the beaker and then 100Ml of NaCl making a 6.5% concentration of NaCl. Next, we added the water to the jar that contained the crayfish, screwed the cap with the oxygen probe and began testing the oxygen concentration for every 5 minutes. We then recorded this data and repeated these same steps using two different crayfish that were nearly the same size as the first crayfish. After the experiment was over, we conducted a two-tailed paired t_test.


Results:
While conducting the experiment the crayfish didn’t seem to behave differently between treatment and controlll groups. In both cases, the crayfish were active and moving about at the same pace. Our results are displayed in figure 1, the three trials experimented were averaged for the treatment and controlll groups. The mean of the controlll group was 0.001508(mg O2*min) and had a deviation of 0.0000798011, and mean of the treatment was 0.00079(mg O2*min) and had a standard deviation of 0.00028363. The results from the two-tailed paired t statistical test were (t_stat= 4.569818, degrees of freedom=2, P-value= 0.044699).


Discussion:
Our alternate hypothesis was supported both biologically and statistically because there was a change in the specific metabolic rate in the controlll groups and treatment groups and our p_value was 0.044699, which was less than our alpha value of 0.05 this means that our data had a great statistical difference. In the data, there was also a general trend that higher salinity resulted in a smaller metabolic rate.  We think that there is a decrease in metabolic rate as a result of salinity, because Procambris Sp. is freshwater crayfish species, and the stressful saltwater environment conditions caused the crayfish to reduce its oxygen intake, by decreasing movement, for survival in a high salinity environment.
We believe that our study had different results than the one conducted by Meade et al. in 2002 because we used higher salinity water. Meade et al. used 0-30 ppm saltwater, while we utilized 100Ml of NaCl/900Ml H2O saltwater. I think that the added stress of a higher saltwater environment caused a change in specific metabolic rate, while the weaker saltwater environment resulted in no change. Overall, if I were to further this study I would test to see if there was a threshold to how salinity can cause the specific metabolic rate to decrease. I also would test larger to crayfish to see if that would result in any differences. Also, I would maybe give the crayfish a break between trials, as I think that exhaustion could have caused our results to be skewed.

The data represents the average specific metabolic rate for each treatment group type and the error bars represent the standard deviation of the controlll and treatment groups. The controlll group’s average was 0.001508(mg O2*min) and had a standard deviation of 0.0000798011, and Treatment group’s average was 0.00079 (mg O2*min) and had a standard deviation of 0.00028363. The results from the two-tailed paired t statistical test were (t_stat= 4.569818, degrees of freedom=2, P-value= 0.044699.)
