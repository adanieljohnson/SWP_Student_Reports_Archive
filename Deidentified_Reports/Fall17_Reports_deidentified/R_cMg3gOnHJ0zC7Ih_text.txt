Title: Effect of External Stressors on the Metabolic Rate in Procambris sp.

Abstract:
The primary objective of this lab was to determine whether or not a perceived threat would have an effect of the metabolic rate of a Procambris sp., better known as a crayfish. It was hypothesized that if a small crayfish were put in a clear jar with a larger crayfish on the outside, then it would have a greater metabolic rate than if it were alone in its environment. This hypothesis is based off of the flight or fight response that the larger crayfish activates when in the presence of an external stressor. One effect of this response is an increase in oxygen consumption. Further, oxygen consumption and metabolic rate are directly proportional to one another. Therefore, we found the metabolic rate of three crayfish by comparing the change in oxygen concentrations after the crayfish were enclosed in a jar of water for 20 minutes. Overall, we found that there is a significent difference between the controlll and experimental group as the results support the hypothesis that the external threat of a large crayfish will increase the metabolism of a smaller crayfish.


Introduction:
When in the presence of a possible threat, organisms exhibit a wide variety of behaviors to respond. Vertebrates have been shows through many experiments to have an autonomic response coined the “fight or flight” response in which the sympathetic nervous system readies the internal environment. This response can be seen in the autonomic controlll of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems that regulate oxygen availability to specific target tissues, needed for a behavioral response [Johnson, 2017]. Further, it would seem that complex invertebrates, like the crayfish, would possess a similarly developed response system [Bierbower, 2009]. Crayfish are crustaceans that mainly live in freshwater. Some live in burrows on land close to a source of water and all crayfish have the ability to borrow. Most crayfish partake in nocturnal activities as they hide under rocks or logs during the daytime and are active at night [Grant, n.d.]. 
Many bodily functions are affected during a fight or flight response, including one’s metabolic rate. Metabolism is often used to describe the entire process of balancing energy capture, conversion and transfer within cells or organisms. The term metabolic rate refers to the actual amount of energy being expended by all of the physiological processes at any given time. In crayfish, an increase in heart rate is noted during defensive posturing when presented with a perceived threatening stimulus [Bierbower, 2009]. Likewise, an increased heart rate indicates an increase in oxygen consumption. Due to the facts known about metabolism and the model organism’s behaviors, we hypothesized that if a smaller crayfish was in the presence of a larger crayfish, then its metabolic rate will increase in response.


Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, we first weighed one of the three small crayfish and placed it in a clear glass jar full of room temperature water. We then attached the dissolved oxygen probe to the top of the jar and let the instrument stabilize. Next, we placed the jar in a black bucket full of room temp water. We recorded the oxygen levels every 5 minutes for 20 minutes and also recorded the total volume of water found in the jar. We then repeated those steps with the other 2 crayfish. After the controlll experiments were done, we took a 32.15g crayfish and placed it in the black bucket. We repeated these steps again for all 3 crayfish except this time they had a direct view of the bigger crayfish just outside of the jar. We calculated the change in oxygen and used that alongside the volume of water, the total time passed, and the weight of the crayfish to calculate the specific metabolic rate of each small crayfish. After the results were collected, we used a two-paired t_test to determine whether or not the results were significent.

Results:
As shown in figure 1, the experimental group in the presence of a large crayfish was seen to have a higher metabolic rate for each crayfish. After three trials, the controlll group was seen to have an average change in oxygen of only 0.23mg/L while the experimental group was found to have an average  change in oxygen of 0.49mg/L. Using a two-paired t_test, a p value of 0.018 was calculated.

Discussion:
In this experiment, it was hypothesized that the metabolic rate of the small crayfish would increase in response to a threatening stimulus in the form of a large crayfish. This hypothesis was partially based off of the study conducted by Bierbower and Cooper that supported how crayfish have a “fight or flight” response to possible threats. Using a two-paired T-test, we found a p value of 0.018, meaning the null hypothesis can rejected and our alternative hypothesis can be accepted as it is statistically significent. 
These results indicate that the external stressor truly did effect the small crayfish in a way that increased its consumption of oxygen and similarly, its metabolic rate. Our findings are also supported by an experiment conducted by Ulrich Steiner and Josh Van Buskirk who observed a fight or flight response in tadpoles when exposed to a predation threat. The short-term findings showed an increase in oxygen consumption of the tadpoles in response to the external threat [Steiner, 2009]. A possible improvement to this lab could be increasing the sample size from 3 to 10 crayfish. If we had conducted more trials and received the same results, the findings could possibly be even more statistically significent, supporting the strong correlation between increased oxygen consumption and the presence of a predator. 
This experiment shows the commonalities between vertebrates and invertebrates in how they react when introduced to a threat. Furthermore, the experiment sheds more light on the evolutionary advantages of having a fight or flight response.
