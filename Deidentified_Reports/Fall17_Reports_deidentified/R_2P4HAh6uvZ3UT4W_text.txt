Title: The Minimal Short-Term Effects of Temperature on Photosynthesis in Kale

Abstract:
After a previous experiment inadvertently revealed that the photosynthetic ability of chloroplasts significently declined after a brief period in direct sunlight, the effect of temperature variation on photosynthetic activity was studied further in kale. The rate of activity was determined using the percent change in the absorbances of chloroplast solutions combined with DCPIP, which is directly related to photosynthetic activity. It was hypothesized that the activity would be at its best at 0ºC. This experiment involved centrifuging a kale leaf to extract and enrich its chloroplasts and proceeding to react the chloroplasts with DCPIP in temperatures ranging from -10ºC to 50ºC. Initial absorbances were obtained before placing the chloroplasts in the varying temperatures under the same amount of light. Two more absorbance measurements were taken over a period of 30 minutes. The general trend showed that the chloroplasts at 35ºC had the most significent increase in activity. The ANOVA test, however, revealed that these results were insignificent. Therefore, this experiment cannot accurately confirm that the heat from the sunlight was the cause of the declined photosynthetic ability in the previous experiment.

Introduction:
In a previous experiment, it was discovered that the photosynthetic abilities of spinach chloroplasts were nearly eliminated after being left in the sun for a brief period of time. It was determined that heat had caused the chloroplasts to die. This experiment will study that phenomenon further, by determining the effects of varied temperatures on photosynthetic ability in the chloroplasts in kale. Kale was selected due to its deep green color, indicating a strong presence of chlorophyll and, consequently, chloroplasts. The effects of temperature on plants have been studied for both scientific and agricultural purposes. "Photosynthesis is known to be an extremely heat-sensitive process" [Goraya: 2017]. Specifically, the electron transport of photosystem II is prone to heat stress [Quinn and Williams: 1986]. Additionally, the amount of photosynthetic pigments in a plant is reduced by heat stress [Goraya: 2017]. However, a study done by the American Society of Plant Biologists report that when chilling stress is applied, starch grains in the chloroplasts rapidly reduce in size [Taylor and Craig: 1971]. Furthermore, published articles suggest that the freezing and below freezing environments would have eventually drastically reduced photosynthetic activity because due to the combined effects of decreased mobility of plastoquinone in the thylakoid membrane and the Calvin cycle's reduced use of NADPH, the chloroplast electron transfer chain becomes over-reduced under chilling temperatures [Stachula: 2015]. Kale specifically has become a model crop for the colder seasons due to its ability to withstand frost. A study done on spinach thylakoids revealed that when frozen, the thylakoids "were unable to form a light induced proton gradient" [Steponkus, Garber, Meyers, and Lineberger: 1977]. Therefore, there is no shortage of conflicting research on this discussion. However, because of the kale-specific ability to thrive during the winter months, it is hypothesized that the kale chloroplasts will show the most activity at 0ºC.

Materials and Method:
This experiment began with the preparation of samples made up of the extracted kale chloroplasts. The first step required that most of the equipment used be chilled in an ice bucket. This included mortar and pestle, a 200 Ml beaker, grinding buffer, and 3 centrifuge tubes. A large kale leaf was deveined and torn into small pieces. The pieces were then rinsed with water. The pieces, along with 10 Ml 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer were placed in the mortar and ground into a thick paste with no chunks left behind. 10 more Ml of grinding buffer was added and mixed in. The mixture was then strained through 3 layers of cheesecloth into the beaker, and the strained liquid was poured in a centrifuge tube. The mixture was centrifuged at 200×G, 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4ºC. The supernatant was then centrifuged once more in order to obtain the pellet from the mixture. The pellet was then placed in a centrifuge tube, to which 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added. The pellet was resuspended with the addition of grinding buffer.  Fifteen large test tubes were washed and labeled. The same mixture was added to every tube except for the blank. Every tube except for the blank received 6 Ml distilled water, 2 Ml 130 mm DCPIP, 100  L of enriched chloroplasts, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. The blank tube received a mixture of 8 Ml distilled water, 100  L of enriched chloroplasts, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. [Johnson: 2018]. Small samples of each tube were poured into cuvettes and initial absorbance measurements were taken using the spectrophotometer. The tubes were then placed into environments that varied greatly in their temperatures. The blank tube was left in the test tube rack at room temperature, 23.3ºC. Three tubes were placed in an ice bucket that had been prepared with salt to lower the temperature of the ice. A thermometer revealed the temperature in this environment was -10ºC. Another three tubes were placed into a separate ice bucket with no salt, measured to be 0ºC. The third set of tubes were left in a test tube rack at room temperature, 23.3ºC. The fourth set of tubes were placed in a test tube rack that was contained in a water bath set to 35ºC. The final set of tubes were placed in another water bath, this one set to 50ºC. Desk lamps containing the same bulbs were placed directly above each set of tubes. Every ten minutes for the next 30 minutes, the test tubes were emptied into cuvettes and the absorbance was measured. The final data was statistically tested using a one-way ANOVA.

Results:
The results of this experiment were graphed to show time vs. the percent change in absorbance of the chloroplast solutions. Generally, the chloroplasts held at 35ºC showed the most positive percent change over 30 minutes with an average percent change of -0.1328% while the chloroplasts at -10ºC showed the most negative percent change of -0.1649%. The one-way ANOVA gave a p_value of 0.797. 

Discussion:
The average percent change of the absorbances over 30 minutes revealed that the chloroplasts were at their maximum photosynthetic activity at 35ºC. The one-way ANOVA, however, gave a p_value of 0.797, rendering the results insignificent and supporting the null hypothesis. This is most likely because of the short time frame. An experiment that observed "photosynthesis, photoinhibition, and low temperature acclimation in cold tolerant plants" determined that "the photosynthetic response of plants to low temperature is dependent upon time of exposure" The authors explained that "cold acclimation requires adjustment to a combination of light and low temperature, conditions which are potentially photoinhibitory" [Huner, Oquist, Hurry, Krol, Falk, and Griffith: 1993.]. Considering the length of the seasons in which plants grow, there is ample time for the effects of the temperature change to manifest themselves in plants in nature, rather than in a controlllled environment over a thirty minute span. This suggests that if the experiment had been run for a longer period of time, more significent results would have been obtained. Previous studies suggest that the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts in freezing and below freezing environments (the ice and the salted ice) would have drastically declined because of irreversible cell death caused by the formation of intracellular ice [Stachula: 2015]. Kale, however has been known to be a cold tolerant species, which means it could be able to defend against the presence of ice in their tissues, but there will be damaging effects on plant physiology [Stachula: 2015]. Research also suggests that the chloroplasts in the extreme heat environment (50ºC water bath) would also incapacitated, due to the fact that altered structural organization of thylakoids, loss of gRania stacking, and swelling of gRania under heat stress can occur within the chloroplasts due to high temperatures. [Goraya: 2017]. Therefore, based on the previously mentioned research, it is most likely that the chloroplasts in between the two temperature extremes (23.3ºC and 35ºC) would have the most activity over time. If this experiment were to be carried out again, it would be beneficial to have a longer time span.
