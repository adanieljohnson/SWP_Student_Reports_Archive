Title: On Understanding Aggressive Behaviors in Betta Splendins vs. Artificial Fish.

Abstract:
Betta splendins was brought to the United States as a commercial product and found its role as a research subject in many experiments. This species, especially, the males are incredibly aggressive in their behaviors towards other males of the same species. Their behaviors can be grouped into many categories, with the most aggressive being the “red mane”. Our hypothesis states that there would be no significent difference in aggressive behaviors (red mane) in real vs. real interactions against real vs. fake interactions. The experiment was performed using two male Betta splendins and two fake fish and measured the number of red manes over a five-minute period. We used an ANOVA test to compare the interactions of the real and fake fish and it was found that our p_value was 0.000719. The Tukey-Kramer tests further showed that there was significance between a few of the groups in the experiment. Our hypothesis was supported by our results. Furthermore, the experiment could have been improved by recreating more “real” fake fish.

Introduction:
Betta splendins is a fish commonly found in Southeast Asia and was brought to the United States because of their beautiful coloration. After being brought to the United States, these fish began to be used in scientific research because of their simple and cheap care. The males of this species display many aggressive behaviors in the presence of other males which makes them incredible subjects in the field of animal behavior and aggression.
	These aggressive behaviors are separated into three categories based on how “aggressive” they are (Matos and McGregor 2002). These behaviors can be categorized into broadside and facing movements, and those can be further categorized into pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. The most aggressive of these behaviors is the “red mane” which is when the branchiostegal membranes are extended from underneath the opercula (BioCore 2017).
	When in the presence of other males of the same species, Betta splendins display incredibly aggressive behavior. However, when placed in a container with males from other species, they do not display these aggressive behaviors (Bisazza, A., Cantalupo, C., Capocchiano, M., & Vallortigara, G. 2000). These aggressive behaviors may also be found in the presence of fake fish. Our hypothesis states that there would be no significent difference in aggressive behaviors (red mane) in real vs. real interactions against real vs. fake interactions.


Materials and Method:
This experiment requires two male Betta splendins and two artificial fish. First, the two male Betta splendins should be placed in a tank side by side and an opaque screen should be removed allowing sight of each other through a clear screen. The act of red manes should be recorded for each fish throughout a five-minute period; this action should be repeated after five minutes of rest. Next, one of the Betta splendins should be moved to the third section and one of the fake fish should be placed in the tank. The opaque screen should be removed and the number of red manes between the real and fake fish should be recorded. Now by alternating, which fish can see the fake fish in the middle, repeat the five-minute period with each real fish and replace the fake fish after two trials for each real fish. Finally, repeat the five-minute period with each fish for the second fake fish and record your results. Then through an ANOVA test and the Tukey-Kramer test, calculate the significance between the groups individually and then an overall p_value.

Results:
Our six groups had varying results: for condition 1- 21 ± 2, for condition 2- 14 ± 2, for condition 3- 1 ± 1, for condition 4- 2 ± 1, for condition 5- 3 ± 3, for condition 6- 0 ± 0. Some general trends we can observe from the data is that the fish had less red manes when in the presence of fake fish, and the largest number of red manes occurred between the two real fish. Our ANOVA test found a p_value of 0.000719 and our Tukey-Kramer tests showed that there was significance between the blue betta and both the fake fish, the red betta and both the fake fish, and there was no significance between the real betta fish.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This is a figure representing the average number of red manes that were recorded for each fish in their experiments. The yellow bars represent the average red manes recorded for our red Betta fish and the blue bars represent the average red manes recorded for our blue Betta fish. The bars with solid fill indicate there was two real fish in the tank, the bars with diagonal stripes indicate the presence of fake fish #1 and the horizontal stripes indicate the presence of fake fish #2. The error bars are the standard deviation of the red manes recorded.
