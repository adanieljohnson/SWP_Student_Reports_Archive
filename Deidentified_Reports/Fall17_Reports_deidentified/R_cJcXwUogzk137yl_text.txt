Title: Inhibition of Photosynthesis with the Presence of Excess Ferric Acid Solution in Plants

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a process plants utilize chlorophyll pigments to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight. The process involves two phases: a light phase (electron transport) to produce NADPH, ATP, and a dark phase (Calvin cycle) to produce glucose molecules. Former experiments have investigated that the presence of excess heavy metal, namely, iron (Ferric acid solution) in plants exhibited inhibition in photosynthetic activity of plants. Thus, we hypothesized that spinach leaves under the presence of excess iron solution produced lower photosynthetic rate than the spinach leaves without iron solution present. The organism employed was Spinacia oleraca. Spinach leaves were churned and centrifuged to obtain a high density of chloroplasts. They were then added in with reaction buffer, DCPIP, an electron acceptor. 2 sample t_tests were used to compare the two sample’s photosynthetic rates. A statistical significance was shown between two samples. Photosynthetic rates of leaves with excess iron was assumed to be interrupted at cellular level of plants: potential stomatal closure, damaged chloroplasts, and photosystems being inhibited. Consequently, heavy metals in excess was supported to have negative effects to photosynthetic activities in plants. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a key function plants rely on; the gathering of sunlight, passing of excitation energy, energy conversion, ATP snythesis and a series of enzymatic reactions that gather carbon dioxide and synthesize sugar for food (Pavlović et al. 2014). Chlorophyll, a required pigment for photosynthesis, has an ability to absorb available light and send it through the electron transport chain to obtain energy (Pavlović et al. 2014). The rate of energy production in a plant can be measured through the Hill reaction (Chnadra and Kang 2015). Hill reaction measures the passage of electrons from donors to acceptors; one easily measurable electron acceptor is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) (Chnadra and Kang 2015). DCPIP reduction in the presence of chloroplasts and light can be measured through its color change from dark blue to colorless (Chnadra and Kang 2015).  This technique is often used to check chlorophyll content through absorbances, which directly influences photosynthetic rates in plants (Pavlović et al. 2014). 

Spinach leaves (Spinacia Oleracea) are a model organism for measuring photosynthetic rates under excess iron (Haughn and Kunst 2014). In the past, plant biochemists often chose spinach to be studied because spinach was easy and inexpensive to obtain, and the thin walls of spinach leaf cells could be easily broken open for experiments (Haughn and Kunst 2014). Spinach is a nutrient packed through photosynthesis, which depends upon sun light to excite electrons within the leaf's chlorophyll molecules (Haughn and Kunst 2014). These electrons are released into an electron transport chain, which generates a proton gradient used to produce ATP and ultimately glucose, which are energy sources for the plant (Haughn and Kunst 2014). Consequently, it was one of the representative species that was easy to manipulate. 


Amongst many heavy metals, a homeostatic balance of iron is a crucial micronutrient for metabolic activities in plants (Chnadra and Kang 2015). An excess amount of iron is toxic to plants in acidic soil (Chnadra and Kang 2015). When confronted with high concentrations of a heavy metal like iron, it shows adverse effects on plant growth and metabolism (Sheoran and Singh 1993). Inhibition of photosynthesis is the consequence of interference of metal ions with photosynthetic enzymes and chloroplast membranes (Sheoran and Singh 1993). In higher plants like spinach, photosynthesis is indirectly reduced by heavy metal accumulation in leaves which closes the stomata and damages the chlorophyll content (Chnadra and Kang 2015). With this knowledge, we hypothesized the following: if there is an overwhelming amount of iron in the plant leaves, then the photosynthetic rate of those leaves will be lower than the plant leaves without any iron content in the environment. Chlorophyll content dictates the productivity of photosynthesis under highly functional plant conditions mentioned above. Monitoring chlorophyll content is crucial to optimize photosynthetic activity (Pavlović et al. 2014).



Materials and Method:
    Spinach leaves (Spinacia oleraca) were obtained from a local fresh market and were stored in the fridge. The spinach leaves that appeared to look healthy with similar surface area were picked out and divided into two sets. The central veins of the leaves for both sets were isolated, and thrown away. The remaining leaves were put into two separate beakers, and were left in solutions for 20 minutes to allow diffusion to occur (one in deionized water, the other in ferric acid solution). The ferric acid (Iron III chloride) solution’s concentration of ions was 29%. They were separately grinded with mortar and pestle along with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer solution (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). 10 Ml of additional cold grinding buffer was added, having enough fluid for centrifuge. 

    The spinach solutions were strained through cheesecloth to get the remaining chunks off. Both solutions were centrifuged twice (resuspended the vial to separate supernatant from pellet) to ultimately isolate the chlorophyll pigments needed in the pellet. Initial solution was centrifuged at a speed of 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4°C. Its’ supernatant, a concentrated set of chloroplasts located at the bottom, was then centrifuged at a speed of 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet of the second centrifugation was isolated, and 20Ml grinding buffer was added to suspend the Spinach chloroplasts. The two samples were each placed in a plate to be compared for its chloroplast density under a hemocytometer. The density was relatively the same, with relatively the same amount of chloroplasts present in both samples. 8 test tubes were prepared: one for blank with the centrifuged solution (100 ul of solution without metal), three for solution without metal, one for blank with the other centrifuged solution (100 ul of solution with excess metal), three for solution with metal. Blanks had 8 Ml of deionized water, and the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) but no DCPIP. The rest of the test tubes had 6 Mls of deionized water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 100 ul of solution (3 test tubes of chloroplasts with iron solution, 3 tubes of chloroplasts without iron solution). Absorbances of the spinach chloroplasts were measured using the percent change in absorbance of 130 mM DCPIP in a reaction buffer of 100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5. Starting with the blank solution, the absorbance at 600nm was measured at the initial time of zero, and the subsequent absorbance measurements were taken at 10, 20, 30 minutes of light. To optimize the experiment, every external variable was kept constant to minimize error (light from the desk lamp, room temperature, concentration of ions, volume and healthy sample). Absorbances for each test tubes were recorded, and t_tests (critical value of 0.05) were performed to get the data graphed between solution with excess iron element and solution without it. 


Results:
Overall, the statistical results showed statistical significance (t(4)= 4.67, p= 0.009) with the critical value of 0.05. The chloroplast samples with iron solution had an average photosynthetic activity of -2.81 +/- 0.95. The chloroplast samples without iron solution had an average photosynthetic activity of 39.57 +/- 9.83. The absorbance rate for chloroplast samples with heavy metal solution stayed relatively the same, and correlated to an inhibition of photosynthesis. The absorbance rate for chloroplast samples without heavy metal solution decreased as time passed by, and correlated to a visible photosynthetic activity.



Discussion:
    With a huge statistical difference in the photosynthetic rates of two chloroplast samples, our experiment proved the adverse effects in photosynthetic activities and excess iron molecules. Thus, our hypothesis was supported. The chloroplast samples with iron solution shows that not only there was no photosynthetic activity, but there also was an aversion towards any kind of photophosphorylation within the plant. In a stark contrast, the chloroplast samples without iron solution showed that chlorophyll contents were actively photosynthesizing. Heavy metal toxicity is expected to result in critical damages and shut downs of the mechanism for photosynthesis (Sheoran and Singh 1993). Once plants reach its’ tolerance point with the interference of metal ions, photosynthetic pigments will be indirectly reduced, affecting the functioning of stomata, and the overall transpiration rate (Chnadra and Kang 2015). 

    A possible error could be accounted for our experiment. A previous study indicated that while the presence of heavy metals showed decrease in photosynthetic activity at the amount of 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm, and 200 ppm, when the concentration was 500 ppm of heavy metals in the plant, an increase higher than the controlll was observed (Chnadra and Kang 2015). Such contradicting segment of data is assumed to be the effect of mixed heavy metals being competitors in soil water medium (Chnadra and Kang 2015). Noting this, although heavy metals show adverse effects on chloroplasts, at different ppm of heavy metals, the photosynthetic rate might be altered. Whether the result was found to be an outlier or a reasonable result at molecular level is yet to be found (Chnadra and Kang 2015). 

    With such information, few future studies could be hypothesized. The study of measuring how the iron solutions at different ppm (parts per million) would affect photosynthetic activity, given that other conditions are kept the same would be an important one. It would be hypothesized that there would be a decrease in photosynthetic activity, as the ppm (concentration of ion) of the iron solution increases (Chnadra and Kang 2015). Another study could be implemented with same conditions, but using a different heavy metal, assuming it will produce similar results. A similar experiment in the past showed the effects of Cd and lead (Pb) on Brassica juncea L. The presence of such heavy metals presented a decline in several components of the leaves: growth, chlorophyll content, and carotenoids (Chnadra and Kang 2015).  They also found that Cd was found to be more detrimental than Pb (Chnadra and Kang 2015). On this notion, a replicate experiment of comparing which heavy metals are more inhibiting to plants would be a plausible one. 

    Plant photosynthesis at molecular level must be thoroughly examined to quickly determine plant’s health and their resistance to environmental factors (Sheoran and Singh 1993). A common site for blockage seems to be at the oxidizing side of PS II, along with enzyme activity and photophosphorylation sites that can have additional impact on inhibition (Sheoran and Singh 1993). Inhibition due to iron in vivo seems to have a couple of reasonings (Sheoran and Singh 1993). The immediate effect is on stomatal closure due to overwhelming amount of iron, which translates to the damaged chloroplasts (Sheoran and Singh 1993). Long-term exposure to heavy metals produce features such as the leaf growth decrease, less photosynthetic pigments, darkened chloroplast structure, and the lack of enzyme activities for CO2 take in (Sheoran and Singh 1993). Consequently, the chlorophyll content, its distribution, and the change in chlorophyll content can be thoroughly examined as it is “one of the most obvious symptoms of plant stress”; it is the most important feature in relationship to photosynthetic activity and external stressors like heavy metals.
