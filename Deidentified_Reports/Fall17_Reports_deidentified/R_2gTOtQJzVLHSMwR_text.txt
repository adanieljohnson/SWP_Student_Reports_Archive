Title: Effects of Sulfuric Acids on Photosynthesis in Isolated Chloroplasts of Spinacea oleracea

Abstract:
The administration of sulfuric acids to chloroplasts may result in destruction of the thylakoid membrane and protein gradient, ultimately inhibiting photosynthesis. It is expected that photosynthesis in chloroplasts administered a high concentration of sulfuric acid will be completely inhibited, but photosynthesis in chloroplasts given a low concentration will not be as inhibited. The administration of the sulfuric acid in combination with DCPIP, however, may cause the pH to become too acidic and bleach the chloroplasts. The chloroplasts of Spinacea oleracea were isolated using centrifugation, and they were combined in a test tube with a Hill reaction buffer, DCPIP, and sulfuric acid was added last. Results show no significant difference between test groups in any of the three groups. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a key method for obtaining energy. All organisms obtain energy from one source or another, and plants use photosynthesis to capture and store solar energy. The solar energy is absorbed by the chloroplast as chlorophyll molecules and the electrons that become excited during this process leave their carrier molecules. This triggers the cleaving of water molecules so that electrons can be released to replace the excited ones that left the carrier molecules, and it also generates a proton gradient. This gradient is what powers the synthesis of ATP, and the excited, or high energy, electrons are stored as NADPH. The electrons in both the NADPH and the ATP can then be used to produce glucose from carbon dioxide molecules. 

The proton gradient that is generated to drive ATP synthesis requires a few light-dependent reactions that take place in Photosystem I and Photosystem II. In Photosystem II, photons of light are absorbed and the energy from this process causes electrons to leave the chlorophyll molecules and move to plastiquinone. This causes the cleavage of water molecules and O2 is a resultant waste product. Additional electrons are also produced that replace the ones that left the chlorophyll molecules. The water molecules pump their protons across the thylakoid membrane and cytochrome b6f also pumps protons across the membrane, adding to the force of the gradient. During this time, the electrons are passed from molecule to molecule and ultimately end up with plastocyanin. Photosystem I picks up at the end of Photosystem II, as the electrons that end up with plastocyanin are used to replace the electrons that leave the chlorophyll molecules. When the electrons leave the chlorophyll molecules, they must first travel through a complex to NADP+ before producing NADPH. 

By measuring the electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts, it can be determined whether a plant is undergoing photosynthesis under various environmental conditions. By using 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) as an alternate electron acceptor, it will be obvious whether photosynthesis is occurring as DCPIP undergoes a color change to a dark blue when oxidized. If DCPIP is reduced it is colorless. Other factors may be manipulated such as the introduction of a chemical, in the presence of DCPIP, to determine effects on reduction reactions. 

In a 2002 study on the effects of simulated acid rain on photosynthesis in cucumber seedlings, it was determined that the presence of an acid significantly reduced the rate of photosynthesis due to a decreased photochemical efficiency in Photosystem II. However, there was significant damage of lipids and proteins in the thylakoid membrane, so the reduction in photosynthetic rate may have been due to the oxidative degradation of lipids, rather than a single effect on Photosystem II. This is because the thylakoid membrane is composed of 50% lipids and 50% proteins, and if this membrane is damaged due to acid rain, photosynthesis cannot occur because there would be no proton gradient [Jing-Quan Yu: 2002]. 

In an article in the e-Journal of Science and Technology, researchers explained the mechanisms for how acid precipitation affects plant physiology, and ultimately the ability to photosynthesize. Acid rain is precipitation that contains elevated levels of hydrogen ions, making it acidic. Sulfur dioxide is produced when fossil fuels are burned in industries, homes, fertilizer plants, and during smelting of metallic ores. Gaseous sulfur dioxide undergoes an oxidation reaction to form SO3, and when SO3 combines with water it forms sulfuric acid. This production of acidic precipitation is especially dangerous as sulfur dioxide can cause various diseases including chlorosis, necrosis, membrane damage, metabolic problems, and even death. Residents of areas surrounding coal-burning plants and industries must take caution to avoid acid precipitation [Lal: 2016]. 

	Further, a study on the effects of acid rain on agriculture in Eastern Canada explained how damaging soil acidification can be to the agricultural industry. The study focused on sulfur dioxide gas as plants and plant cells are very permeable to gases, so the effects can be seen directly. If plant stomata are open, sulfur dioxide gas can enter and absorb into the inner leaf cells. The gas can then combine with water molecules to form sulfuric acid which then damages the chloroplast, ultimately affecting photosynthesis or overall cell function [Coote: 1982]

In studying the effect of different concentrations of sulfuric acid on a plants ability to photosynthesize, it will help to determine whether a low concentration of acid is still safe for plants, or whether photosynthesis is still inhibited. It is hypothesized that by introducing a low concentration of sulfuric acid to isolated chloroplasts with DCPIP, photosynthesis will still be inhibited, but the effects will not be as great as with concentrated sulfuric acid. In the isolated chloroplasts with concentrated sulfuric acid and DCPIP, it is expected that photosynthesis will be completely inhibited and DCPIP will remain in its reduced, colorless form. 


Materials and Methods:
For the experiment, begin by chilling a mortar & pestle, medium beaker, and three 50 mL centrifuge tubes in ice. Remove the large veins from four spinach leaves, rinse them with water and blot dry with paper towels. Grind the spinach leaves in the mortar and pestle until it turns to a thick paste using 10 mL grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Add an additional 10 mL grinding buffer and filter the spinach mixture through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled medium beaker. 
Next, pour the liquid from the beaker into a chilled centrifuge tube labeled A, then spin at 200 x G for three minutes at four degrees celcius. Pour the top layer (be careful to not transfer the bottom debris) of A into another chilled centrifuge tube labeled B. Centrifuge the tube labeled B at 1000 x G for ten minutes at four degrees celcius. After centrifuging is completed, transfer the top layer into another centrifuge tube labeled C and place B on ice. 

Next, add 20 mL of the grinding buffer to the pellet that still remains in the B centrifuge tube and stir gently with a transfer pipet. Transfer all of the liquid to a beaker labeled Sample of B Pellet and chill the beaker on ice. This is the sample containing the greatest number of isolated chloroplasts that will be used for the remainder of the experiment.

Gather ten test tubes and label one of them “blank,” three of them “C1, C2, and C3” for controls, three of them “H1, H2, and H3” for the high concentrations, and three of them “L1, L2, and L3” for the low concentrations. Add 2 mL of the Sample of B Pellet to the low concentration and high concentration test tubes using a transfer pipet. Then, add 2 mL DCPIP and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) to each of the ten tubes except for the blank, which only gets 8 mL of water and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. Be careful to ensure that no water gets into the test tubes with sulfuric acid as this can trigger a violent chemical reaction, or it could further dilute the solutions. Add 6 mL of 100 mM sulfuric acid to the “high” tubes and 6 mL of 10m M sulfuric acid to the “low” tubes. Do not add any sulfuric acid to the control tubes or to the blank. The control tubes will receive 8 mL water, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and the 2mL DCPIP. 

Swirl each of the tubes and transfer them to cuvettes. Set the spectrometer to 600 nm, blank, and record absorbances for each cuvette. Place all of the cuvettes in a holder under direct light for ten minutes, then record absorbances again after blanking the spectrometer. Repeat this process of putting the cuvettes in direct light for ten minutes then recording absorbances another two times (total of thirty minutes under direct light). Graph the absorbances and run statistical tests. A one-tailed t-test should be used when comparing the high to the low concentrations of sulfuric acids, and separate two-tailed t-test should be used when comparing the control to either the high or the low concentrations. 


Results:
Results show that the control groups (chloroplasts in light) had the highest % absorption out of the three groups. The chloroplasts in light that were administered 100 mM sulfuric acid originally had the highest absorbance, but around ten minutes, the slope went downhill. The chloroplasts in light that were administered the 10 mM sulfuric acid consistently had the lowest absorbance throughout the entire experiment. A one-tailed t-test was used to compare the 100 mM sulfuric acid to the 10 mM sulfuric acid chloroplasts and the p-value for the test was 0.05847, meaning that it was not significant. Two separate two-tailed t-tests were used when comparing either the control to the 100 mM sulfuric acid or the control to the 10 mM sulfuric acid chloroplasts and the p-values for the tests were 0.45111 and 0.0847 respectively. With the significance level set at 0.5, both of these values deem it insignificant.

Discussion:
With our results showing that the data is insignificant, it is difficult to draw conclusions, but the results show that an error occurred during the experiment. Upon adding the sulfuric acids to the test tubes, both the high and low concentration tubes immediately underwent a color change to pink. After waiting for ten minutes, the tubes with the 100 mM sulfuric acid turned completely colorless, but the 10 mM tubes still had their pink color. In the low concentration tubes, the hydrogen ions interacted with DCPIP, turning it into DCPIPH (which has a pink color). In the high concentration tubes this same process occurred, but because of the higher acidity, the DCPIPH reacted with the vitamin C from spinach leaves to make DCPIPH2 (which is colorless). The initial color change when DCPIP turned from blue to pink was an indicator that the pH of the solution dropped way too low.

Ultimately, the data was insignificant because the acid was not interacting with the isolated chloroplasts, but rather it made the pH drop so much that the entire experiment could not work properly. In order to test the hypothesis, the sulfuric acid should have been added prior to the fast spin in the centrifuge, and then it should have been allowed to sit for a few minutes. This would ensure that the sulfuric acid was actually interacting with the isolated chloroplasts, and not just the DCPIP. Further, the 2002 study on the effects of acid rain on cucumber seedlings mentioned earlier described the negative outcomes of administering a strong acid directly to the chloroplasts. The acid can damage the thylakoid membrane and proton gradient, so a very low concentration of acid should be used (perhaps 10 mM and 50 mM sulfuric acid).
