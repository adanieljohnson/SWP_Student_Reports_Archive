Title: Testing the Effects of 200 mM Caffeine on Frog Leg Muscle Contraction Amplitude

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to determine if caffeine causes a significent difference in the muscle amplitude of a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle. By utilizing the Isaacson and Sandow article, “Quinine and caffeine effects on 45 Ca movements in frog Sartorius muscle,” [1967] and their research about how caffeine increases the 45Ca in a frog Sartorius muscle, we developed our own experiment testing how caffeine affects the gastrocnemus frog muscle. We hypothesized that the 200mM caffeine we injected into the frog leg during our experiment would result in an increased muscle contraction amplitude when compared to the controlll group that would not be injected. When looking at the graphs, we first believed that there was a difference in muscle contraction amplitude. However, after performing the paired t statistical test, we determined that the difference was not very significent in the controlll and treatment groups of a frog leg. 


Introduction:
Nerves help organisms respond quickly to stimuli in their environments. A frog muscle is a straightforward way to study how muscle nerves respond to stimuli because frogs are easily available to study and a frog’s muscles are sensitive to muscle stimulation. In this case, Caffeine will be the stimuli affecting the frog muscle nerves being tested. The independent variable 200mM caffeine will be injected into the frog leg, while the dependent variable will be the amplitude of the muscle contractions. In the Isaacson and Sandow article [1967], Caffeine was discovered to cause an increase in 45Ca. This increase resulted in increased muscle contraction for the frog Sartorius muscle. We used this study to develop our own hypothesis about how caffeine would affect the gastrocnemus muscle in the frog. Although the gastrocnemus muscle is different from the Sartorius muscle, we still expect that the 200mM caffeine injected into the frog leg during our experiment will result in an increased muscle contraction amplitude. 


Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, we first downloaded the iWorks software onto our computers familiarizing ourselves with its controllls. Then we pulled the skin off of the frog leg and separated the gastrocnemus muscle from the rest of the frog leg, leaving a small amount of Achilles tendon. Then, we then tied two loops around the Achilles tendon so that the muscle could be attached to the muscle holder. After checking the tension of the string connected to muscle holder to ensure stable muscle contractions, we inserted the red and blue electrodes into the gastrocnemus muscle. Next, we changed the settings in the iWorks software to allow the muscle to contract five times at 1.0V. This would be our results for the controlll group. After recording each amplitude of each muscle contraction wave, we made the muscle contract five more times at 1.0V, then injected the gastrocnemus muscle with 200mM caffeine after the last contraction. We continued recording data for five more contractions in order to obtain our results for the treatment group. We repeated this for each of the three frog legs. After the experiment was conducted we used a paired t_test to analyze the data of the controlll and treatment groups.


Results:
To obtain these results, the five muscle contractions were average for each trial in the controlll and treatment groups. In every trial, the caffeine treatment group had a larger muscle contraction amplitude than the controlll group. However, after running the paired t_test, it appears that the controlll group and the caffeine treatment group do not have a great statistical difference. (t_stat = 17.157196, degrees of freedom = 2, P-value = 0.00338)

Discussion:
When looking at the graph, the mean of the muscle contraction amplitude for the treatment group is higher than the mean of the controlll group. However, after the t_test, there is not a significent statistical difference between muscle contraction amplitude in gastrocnemus from muscles that are treated by caffeine and gastrocnemus muscles that are not treated by caffeine. This means that while the biological hypothesis in this experiment is supported, the statistical hypothesis supports the null hypothesis. I believe that there is not a large statistical difference as a result of caffeine because, after the frog muscle reaches chemical tetany caused by the caffeine, the contractions are similar to regular muscle contractions occurring in the controlll group. Based on the observation of the myograms in this experiment, there is one large jump in amplitude after the from muscle is injected with the caffeine, but after the muscle reaches a certain threshold, chemical induced tetany results, and there is not much amplitude growth when compared to the controlll group. As a result, while it appears that the treatment group has a higher amplitude, it’s not that different from the controlll group. Unlike Isaacson and Sandow, we did not see major differences as the result of caffeine being injected into the frog leg muscle. 
	To further this experiment, I would change the concentration of caffeine injected in the frog muscle. I think that if a lower concentration of caffeine were used, it may be able to prevent the chemical induced tetany allowing for longer muscle contractions and increased amplitude.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 Displays the average muscle contraction amplitude for the controlll group (the gastrocnemus muscle before caffeine injection) and the treatment group (the gastrocnemus muscle after injection). The averages for both the treatment and controlll groups were determined by first averaging the muscle amplitude of each frog leg trial, then finding the mean of all three of these trials. The data bars represent the average amplitude of each muscle contraction. The error bars represent the standard deviations of both the controlll and treatment groups.
