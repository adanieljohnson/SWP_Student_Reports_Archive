Title: The addition of an acetylcholine receptor agonist, nicotine, causes increased muscle amplitude in the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle

Abstract:
Three Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscles were prepared to analyze the effects of the acetylcholine agonist nicotine on the muscle amplitude of the muscular contraction. Each frog leg was measured three times at the threshold value with and without nicotine supplementation. Because nicotine is an acetylcholine agonist, it was thought that it would profoundly increase muscle amplitude. It was found that the muscle amplitude of nicotine-supplemented contraction was statistically significently higher than controlll values because of chemically induced contraction in the muscle. 


Introduction:
	A key distinguishing factor between plants and many animals is the presence of a muscular system. This muscular system allows many animals to engage in motile behavior which is necessary for many aspects of survival. The nervous system is responsible for initiating the aforementioned muscular movements. An essential component to this process is the transmission of the motor signal from the nerve to the muscle at the synapse between the two called the neuromuscular junction. At the neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is the primary method of chemical transmission. When an action potential reaches the end of the presynaptic neuron, acetylcholine vesicles are docked and the acetylcholine is released into the synapse. Acetylcholine then binds to receptors on the motor end plate, causing an influx of sodium ions into the cell. This voltage change in the sarcoplasm causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium to the myofibrils, which allows myosin and actin to interact and, thus, muscle contraction [Sadava: 2016]. In this experiment, the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipens was used to experiment on the neuromuscular junction. This organism was chosen because, the unique behavior of constant hopping in frogs makes its leg muscles very useful to study [Kamel: 1996]. This property makes the Rania pipiens the ideal organism to study according to Kroghâ€™s principle. Additionally, it is very easy to isolate the muscle and directly stimulate it. Because of the key role played by acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, the goal of this experiment is to identify and analyze the effects of an acetylcholine agonist supplement on muscle amplitude. Muscle amplitude, measured on a myogram, gives information about the inherent strength of a muscular contraction. It has been previously seen that the acetylcholine agonist, levamisole produces hypercontraction in nematodes (Richmond, 2008). Levamisole does this because it induces chemical excitation to supplement normal electrical stimulation, thus causing an increased contraction [Richmond: 2008]. Therefore it is necessary to see if this result is true for a broader array of acetylcholine agonists. Nicotine is a stimulant seen very commonly in the everyday world. One prominent feature of nicotine is its ability to mimic acetylcholine and, therefore, act as an acetylcholine receptor agonist. At the neuromuscular junction, there exist some acetylcholine receptors called nicotinic receptors, which respond directly to nicotine [Colquhan: 2003]. Because nicotine directly stimulates these acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, it will cause some changes when added. Specifically, the presence of nicotine should cause an increase in muscle amplitude because it basically serves as supplemental acetylcholine at the synapse. This extra acetylcholine should cause more calcium to be released in the cell for a longer period of time and, thus, a stronger muscle contraction. 


Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were each prepared identically in this experiment. First, the skin of the frog leg was removed by simply peeling it off. The sciatic nerve was then isolated from above the knee. The Gastrocnemius was then separated from the bone and the Achilles tendon was severed close to the ankle. A string was then prepared into a double loop, tied around the Achilles tendon and tightened. The excess string at the end of the knot with no loop was then cut and discarded. The string was then hung on the iWorx apparatus to suspend the muscle without too much tension. The direct muscle stimulators were then placed into two spots along the muscle for stimulation. In each frog leg it was necessary to first determine the minimum threshold of stimulation that induces contraction in the muscle. To do this, we started at 0V stimulation and went up by 0.1V until we reached the threshold. At this threshold, we then recorded the muscle amplitude of three twitches using iWorx software to serve as our controlll data [Johnson: 2017]. To determine our experimental data, we then injected the frog with .1Ml of 1mg/Ml nicotine. It is necessary to record during the injection to account for changes in muscle amplitude. Three muscle amplitudes were then measured. In order to account for the nicotine injection. These muscle amplitudes needed to be added to the voltage change which occurred during injection. The procedure for the controlll and experimental trials were repeated for three frog legs. A 2-tailed t_test was then performed to determine whether the muscle amplitudes obtained in the controlll and experimental groups were statistically different from one another.


Results:
Both of the first two frog legs showed to have a threshold of 0.4V. When stimulated at this threshold value under controlll conditions, leg one produced an average muscle amplitude of 0.1303V and leg two produced a 0.347V muscle amplitude (figures 1 and 2). The third frog leg was stimulated at its threshold value of 0.2V and produced an average muscle amplitude of 0.0347V (figure 3). As can be seen in figures 1, 2, and 3, the experimental muscle amplitudes are visually higher. When each leg was treated with nicotine, the myogram immediately spiked and the muscle very clearly initiated a continuous contraction. With this supplement, frog 1 produced a 0.216V average amplitude (figure 1), frog 2 produced a 0.142V average muscle amplitude (figure 2), and frog 3 produced a 0.168V average muscle amplitude (figure 3). Each successive trial seemed to decrease in amplitude, but the experimental amplitude in all cases was much higher than the controlll amplitude. However, because of the very low standard deviation of the data values, the data taken in each frog leg represents accurate means. The t_tests confirmed this suspicion statistically. Each frog leg produced a p_value less than .05, showing significent statistical difference. 


Discussion:
	After conducting this experiment, it is clear that the nicotine supplement produced a significent increase in muscle amplitude in each frog leg (figures 1, 2, and 3). This is most likely due to the action of nicotine before stimulation. When nicotine is first injected, the muscle immediately begins to contract without additional stimulation. This is due to a chemically induced contraction produced by the nicotine. When the nicotine is directly placed into the muscle, it causes activity in acetylcholine receptors which goes on to initiate its own contraction in the muscle. This chemically induced tetany remains in a state of constant contraction in the muscle. When normal electrical stimulation is used on top of that, it contracts again on top of this now pre-existing contraction. This mechanism is in accordance with a study analyzing chemical stimulation of muscle via phosphate injections [Kniffki and Mense: 1977]. Our results also match up with the findings in a  previous study which found that nicotinic receptors are very active in muscle contraction [Wang, Yu and Ochani: 2003]. Because of the presence of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in muscle tissue, nicotine has its own unique place to bind. Because of this, in the future it would be useful to study the effects of an analog of acetylcholine that does not have its own unique receptor. It would be useful to see if it would still bind to receptors in the neuromuscular junction even though it does not have its own receptor. Additionally, because the results of nicotine supplementation were pretty similar across the board, it would be interesting to see how this changes when concentrations. That is, would amplitude increase with increased nicotine, or simply last longer at the same amplitude? One final future way to study the effects of acetylcholine agonists at the neuromuscular junction would be to analyze how an agonist like nicotine affects the neuromuscular junction when an inhibitor is also added. It would be interesting to note whether the inhibitor or the agonist affect the muscle more or whether their effects cancel each other out. While the results of our study on the surface seem to be very clear, we did run into some limitations. First and foremost, the sample size in our experiment is the most prominent limitation. Because we only analyzed three frog legs, it is very difficult to determine whether values are actually statistically significently different regardless of the t_test results. If we had more data values, we could more confidently say whether the amplitudes are actually significently different. Additionally, one of our frog legs came with a split sciatic nerve. To compensate for this, we had to use the direct muscle stimulators. Because we were injecting into the muscle directly, it is possible that some nicotine got onto the stimulator which was sued for each of the three frogs. Thus, it is possible that the controlll values for frogs 2 and 3 could have been skewed. A third limitation came with the size of the frog legs. The frog legs that we used varied in size from small, slightly bigger and relatively large. Yet, we used the same amount of nicotine supplementation for each frog. This also could have altered the results. However, it seems that our experiment went well and that nicotine supplementation does in fact increase muscle amplitude
