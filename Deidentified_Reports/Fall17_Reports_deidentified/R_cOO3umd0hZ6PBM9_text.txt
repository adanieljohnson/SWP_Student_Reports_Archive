Title: Altering Environmental Light Levels for Procambarus sp. Does Not Alter the Metabolic Rate After Twenty Minutes 

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to test the difference in oxygen consumptions and specific metabolic rate in Procambarus sp. crayfish under dark and light conditions. We hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate and oxygen consumption would be greater in the light conditions compared to the dark conditions due to the idea that crayfish are generally found in dark environment and the dark experimental condition would mirror their natural environment. The crayfish were placed in room temperature water with a dissolved oxygen probe and the oxygen levels were measured every five minutes for a total of twenty minutes. The specific metabolic rate was then calculated. It was found that the crayfish in the dark experimental condition had a higher specific metabolic rate, contrary to the hypothesis. These results were found to be significantly different using a two sample t- test. This indicates the crayfish might have been light adapted to the lab environment or that the crayfish use more oxygen in an environment similar to their natural environment.  

Introduction:
In this experiment, we are testing the difference in oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate in Procambarus sp. crayfish. The specific metabolic rate is referring to the amount of energy that is expelled or exerted by the animal’s physiological processes during a specific time period [Johnson:2017]. We used the crayfish in our experiment because they were an easy to obtain organism in our lab and it is easy to measure their oxygen consumption using equipment available to us. We are testing the oxygen consumption in two conditions, light and full darkness. We hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in dark conditions would be less than the specific metabolic rate in crayfish in light conditions. We thought because we assumed that our species of crayfish lived in a somewhat dark environment, such a stream bed, and the dark experimental environment would mirror the crayfish’s natural habitat. Additionally, we thought that the dark environment would cause the crayfish to use less oxygen due to a study that said that aquatic animals that live in caves (a dark environment) have decreased oxygen consumption [Mejía:2005]. For this experiment, we measured the decreasing oxygen levels in the crayfish in dark and light conditions by placing them in room temperature water and using a dissolved oxygen probe. 

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we altered the environmental light levels of Procambarus sp., each crayfish serving as its own control. The first step in this experiment was to measure the first crayfish, then fill a mason jar with room temperature water (about 22˚C) and finally place the crayfish in the filled jar. Then a dissolved oxygen meter attached to a jar lid was screwed onto the jar. The oxygen reading was allowed to stabilize and then readings were taken every five minutes for a total of twenty minutes. Following the twenty minute time period, the total volume of water was measured. The entire set up was then repeated with the same crayfish (they serve as their own control) using new water. The jar containing the crayfish was then encased in tin foil. The tin foil served as a way to prevent light from reaching the crayfish. Oxygen readings were taken in the exact same manner as before and the volume was again measured. The entire process used for the first crayfish was then repeated for the reaming two crayfish. Following the experiment we analyzed the data using a two sample t-test and calculating the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. 

Results:
In this experiment, the specific metabolic rate was significantly different between the crayfish in light and the crayfish in darkness. The crayfish being measured in darkness used more oxygen than the crayfish is light conditions. On average, each crayfish in light conditions used 0.6367 mg/L of O2 and each crayfish in dark conditions used 0.8267 mg/L of O2. The specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in light conditions were routinely lower than the rate of crayfish in darkness, which matches up the average oxygen usage. See Figure 1 for more detailed numbers and data and Figure 2 for a condensed view of the specific metabolic rate. After analyzing the data using a two sample t-test, the crayfishes specific metabolic rate in light and darkness was found to be significantly different with a t- value of 1.295279 and a p-value of 0.264923. 

Discussion:
The oxygen consumption and therefore the specific metabolic rate of crayfish in light conditions was significantly lower than crayfish in dark conditions. This does not support our hypothesis. We predicted that crayfish would consume less oxygen in dark conditions. We predicted this because we thought that crayfish would be more used to living in dark conditions, like the bottom of a stream bed, and would consume less oxygen in a condition that was similar to their natural environment. This idea is backed up by research from a study done that says that “aquatic cave animals have shown a decrease in oxygen consumption” when they were compared with non- cave dwelling counterparts [Mejía:2005]. The same study mentions that cave dwelling animals adapt to a life with less oxygen as a survival method. We figured that the cave dwelling animals and the crayfish would be similar due to the lowered light levels and therefore, the crayfish in the dark experimental environment would also have decreased oxygen consumption. The opposite was found to be true after the experiment. There are a couple potential explanations for this occurrence. It is possible that the crayfish species that we were using was used to living in a light environment. It could also be possible that the crayfish had become light adapted in the lab. The crayfish were stored in the lab room where the lights are on a large period of time each day. To cancel out the potential lab light adaptation, the crayfish could be stored in their natural habitat light conditions or they could be dark adapted for a certain period of time (maybe twenty minutes) before the experiment is conducted. In the future, this study can be conducted with varying light levels, not just total darkness and total light. By using varying light levels, one could determine the optimal light level for the least and most about of oxygen consumed. This experiment could have possible implications for not just aquatic animals in light and dark conditions. It would be interesting to see if this experiment and this data would be applicable to other cave dwelling animals and what their oxygen consumption is compared to counterparts that live in light or partial light environments. Information about animals that have decreased oxygen use in a particular environment could be analyzed to see what adaptations that have which allow them to survive in those conditions. These animals and their adaptations could then be compared with animals that live in low oxygen environments, like goats that live on high altitude mountain tops.
