Title: Effects of Temperature Variation on Chloroplast Activity of Spinach Leaves

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of low, high, and room temperature conditions on the photosynthetic activity in spinach leaves. We did this by using DCPIP which mimics the electron accepting activity of photosynthesis by decreasing in color absorbance to indicate chloroplast activity. We predicted that low and high temperatures would decrease chloroplast activity while room temperature would maximize it. Our results instead indicated that chloroplast activity significently increased in cold and room temperatures, while hot temperatures showed a decrease in activity that was not statistically significent. 


Introduction:
In plants and other autotrophs, the defining piece of their energy production system is in the light dependent reactions of chloroplasts which are powered by the Photosystems II and I which excite electrons in an electron transport chain, generating a proton gradient to drive ATP synthesis [Johnson: 2017]. There are many environmental factors that can affect the efficiency of these Photosystems. In this experiment, we will be testing the effects of temperature change on the activity of chloroplasts. In previous experiments, we determined that isolating the pellet of spinach leaves gave us the greatest concentration of chloroplasts to use for assays. Since we are testing the effects on the efficiency of the electron transport chain of photosynthesis, we will also use the alternative electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) which mimics the actions of the electron transport chain by turning colorless when its accepts electrons in the presence of light and chloroplasts [Johnson:2017]. In previous experiments, the photosynthetic membrane in plants like spinach are damaged at low temperature between 20 C and -5 C [Liu et al.: 2016] and high temperature above 30 C [Zou et al.: 2017]. Based off this range, we will perform assays in an ice bath at 1.5 C, room temperature conditions of 25 C, and in a warm water bath set to 47 C. We hypothesized that both low and high temperatures would decrease chloroplast activity (increase absorbance) in spinach over time, while maximum photosynthetic activity (decrease absorbance) would occur under room temperature conditions. 


Materials and Method:
Begin by isolating the chloroplast from 4 spinach leaves by discarding the veins and grinding with 20 Ml grinding buffer and straining liquid through a cheese cloth. Spin in a centrifuge for 3 min at 1200 rpm at 4 C, isolate the supernatant, and spin again for 10 min at 280 rpm at 4 C. The isolate the pellet formed at the bottom and resuspend with 20 Ml grinding buffer. In 12 test tubes labelled #0-11, add the amount of each reagent shown in Table 1, mixing in the chloroplast last when you’re ready to start the assay. Blank the spectrophotometer with the blank solution in tube #0 and record the absorbance of each solution in cuvettes at “time 0”. Leave tubes #0, 1, and 8-10 in room temperature (25 C), place tubes #2-4 in ice (1.5 C), and tubes #5-7 in a warm water bath (47 C). Shine a light on all the tubes. Record absorbances again after 10, 20, and 30 min, blanking the spectrophotometer between each round. Calculate the percent changes between each interval and run a two-tailed paired T-test to test the statistical significance of the results.

Results:
Our positive controlll started at an average absorbance of 0.532 nm and decreased to 0.382 nm after 30 min giving a 28.20% change. The negative controlll started at 0.554 nm and decreased to 0.529 nm for a 4.51% change. The samples set in cold conditions started with an average absorbance of 0.536 nm and decreased to 0.321 nm after 30 minutes giving a 40.10% change. The room temperature samples started at 0.530 nm and decreased to 0.364 nm with a 31.32% change. The hot samples started at 0.519 nm and increased to 0.547 nm for a -5.27% change (Figures 2 & 3).


Discussion:
The results of our experiment did not support our hypothesis. In comparison to the negative controlll group, the mean absorbance of the cold samples decreased significently (t_stat = -3.33, d.f.= 3, P= 0.044). Similarly, the mean absorbance of the room temperature samples also decreased significently (t_stat = -3.70, d.f.= 3, P= 0.034) but not as drastically. The warm samples, however, showed an increase in absorbance, but not at a statistically significent difference to the positive controlll group (t_stat = 2.51, d.f. = 3, P= 0.086). This indicates that spinach chloroplast activity is maximized at lower temperatures. These results are especially important when related to the issue of global warming. According to NASA, global temperatures have increased at a rate of about 0.15-0.20 C every decade since 1975 [Carlowicz: 2010]. This increase can have detrimental effects on commonly consumed plants like spinach that grow better at low temperatures. This shows that it important for us to combat global warming to save crop production and keep food on our tables.
