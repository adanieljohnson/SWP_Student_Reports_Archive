Title: The Joint Effects of Diuron Herbicide and Cold Temperatures on Photosynthesis in Spinach

Abstract:
This experiment set out to find the effects of cold temperatures on the photosynthetic rates of spinach. Specifically, whether cold temperatures would further deter photosynthesis in spinach plants that were already under the treatment of herbicides. Our team hypothesized that the two factors combined, freezing temperatures with a strong herbicide, would act to jointly deter photosynthesis more so than either would do individually. Grinding spinach chloroplasts into a solution we were able to track their photosynthetic rates through the addition of DCPIP. Their rates of photosynthesis could be seen through the reduction of DCPIP as it made the solution clear. Following the collection of our data, we determined that our results were insignificant, with a p-value of .1178. We believe that these results can be attributed to a short observation time and that spinach plants are particularly effective at adapting to colder temperatures. 

Introduction:
Plants are the building block for every food chain on the planet. Without the ability to consume other organisms, plants have developed the unique process of photosynthesis, where they can create energy utilizing rays from the sun. This is done by using photons from the sun to excite a free electron, originally cleaved from water, in the plant cells chloroplast. This process triggers a pathway that ultimately creates a proton gradient that ATP Synthase uses to catalyze the reaction of ADP to ATP, a usable energy source for the cell. [Lambers: 2008] In a recent 2017 study, it was found that cold temperatures combined with herbicides had a joint, compounding negative effect on seaweed photosynthesis [Wilkinson: 2018] With this knowledge, we hypothesized that a spinach plant were exposed to a herbicide while simultaneously under the duress of colder temperatures, the two factors would have a join detrimental effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Our independent variable in this experiment was the presence of the Diuron herbicide, while the dependent variable was the measured rate of photosynthesis via the absorbance spectrum. Chloroplasts from common spinach were determined to be good subjects as spinach is easily grown and kept healthy, while also providing a sufficient number of chloroplasts for the experimental purpose. 

Materials and Methods:
This experiment requires 4 Large Spinach Leaves, Distilled water, 10mL 130mM DCPIP 12mL Reaction buffer, and 8mL Herbicide Diuron. To begin we removed the veins from four large spinach leaves. Using a mortar and pestle, we ground the spinach leaves into a solution of 10mL cold grinding buffer until the paste was thick and the leaves had been thoroughly ground in. This paste was added to another 10mL of grinding buffers before being strained through cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. The now filtered green liquid was put into a 50mL centrifuge tube and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes. We transferred the contents of this tube into another beaker, leaving the debris at the bottom that had settled out, and spun again at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes. We added grinding buffer to this solution and suspended it. 
	We prepared 8 test tubes, each with 6mL of water, 2mL of DCPIP, 2mL of the reaction buffer and 1mL of the herbicide Diuron. In addition, a blank solution was prepared using 8mL of water and 2mL of the reaction buffer. When our group was ready to begin testing, 100uL of our green, suspended solution was added to each test tube. 4 of the test tubes were placed in a bucket of ice under a light for the duration of their monitoring, while the other 4 test tubes sat under the light in room temperature. We recorded the initial absorbance of each test tube using the spectrophotometry and proceeded to record the absorbance of each test tube at every ten-minute interval, for a thirty-minute period. 

Results:
Overall, we saw a .8% change in absorbance of the chloroplast solution containing the herbicide and a 1.3% change in absorbance of the chloroplast solution that was subject to cold temperatures along with the herbicide. For the chloroplast solution that wasn’t in the cold solution, it started out with an average absorbance of .3915 which rose .3975 and .4005 in subsequent 10-minute waiting periods until finally going down to .38825 at the end of the thirty-minute period. Meanwhile, the solution in the cold temperature only rose during the first ten minutes from .402 to .403 before lowering to .398 and .396 at the twenty and thirty-minute marks. For the two solutions, the room temperature chloroplasts had an average absorbance of .3945 while the chloroplast solution in freezing temperatures averaged .4002. For this experiment we found a P value of .117 which was above the predetermined alpha value of .005

Discussion:
This study ultimately went against our hypothesis that the cold temperatures would combine with the herbicide to even further deter photosynthetic rates. Although both solutions showed very slow rates of photosynthesis, the data went against our hypothesis as photosynthesis wasn’t super inhibited.  This was proven by an insignificant P value of .1178, well above the desired value of .05 or less. The negative effects of low temperatures is well documented and even highlighted in studies as recent as Dr. Huggins documenting the negative impact on tree metabolism in freezing temperatures [Huggins: 2017] However, in another study specific to spinach, it was found that in the short-run cold temperatures had little effect on chloroplast activity [Ito: 2013] In another study more specific to spinach from 2005, a strong case was made for Spinach’s ability to acclimate. It was shown that RuBP levels and carboxylation rates in the spinach actually leveled off after time to acclimate with the temperature difference [Yamori, 2005.] With these conflicting reports it’s difficult to exactly determine why we gathered the results we did, as other studies had supported our hypothesis. More likely than not, it’s possible that these studies show that the research we based our hypothesis off were not applicable for spinach plants. However, it’s additionally possible that our time limit in which we examined the specimens wasn’t long enough, over half the time for both samples was spent raising in absorbance, which, hypothetically, shouldn’t even be possible. It’s also possible that we failed to truly chill the samples as it was difficult to completely engulf them in ice due to the orientation of the bucket. To improve this study in the future, I would want to consider increasing the time the samples are surveyed for to an hour, doubling the length in time. Additionally, instead of trying to place them in rocky ice I believe the samples would sit better in a fridge or freezer of some point that still has the light shining on them. For future study, this experiment is worth evaluating as it can tell us the effectiveness of herbicides in different temperatures. Information such as that will become increasingly more important as we enter an age of global, year-round agriculture.
