Title: The relation between visibility of the environmental water and the aggressiveness of male-male Betta fish interactions

Abstract:
For our experiment, our goal is to understand Betta splendins' intraspecific behavior. Our hypothesis is, there is a relation between the visibility of the environmental water and the aggressiveness of male-male Betta fish interactions. In order to study this topic, we had two different environments, one is the clear water the fish always lives in, the other one is the murky water environment the wild Betta fish lives in as the experimental group. We had three fish as our samples. We paired them into groups and quantify their aggressiveness in different environments by bin system, added the score of both fish as the aggressiveness score for that sample. After the experiment, we used the average scores for the two environments to run the two-sample t_test and had a p_value lower than 0.05, which rejected out null-hypothesis. From the experiment, we gained a better understanding about the relation between environment and animal’s behavior.

Introduction:
The purpose of studying animal behaviors is to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection.The study of animal behavior or ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science.[Johnson AD. Aug:2017] For the goal of gaining a better understanding of the animal behavior, we have designed an experiment for Betta splendins to learn whether there’s certain connection between the level of aggressiveness of male to male Betta fish and the visibility of their environment. Our target species is Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are common aquarium fish that originated in southeast Asia. They are indigenous to Thailand, where they are widely distributed in ponds, ditches, drains, rice paddies, and other sluggish or muddy waters. However, the fish has been domesticated for many generations. This species is very aggressive and has very stereotyped social displays. [Oliveira, R. F., McGregor, P. K., & Latruffe, C.: 1998]. As a result of the sexual selection, the betta fish would have a series of behaviors when they are excited by the presence of another male. This kind of behavior is called as the intraspecific agnostic behavior. The intraspecific behavior of bettas includes two main type of movements: broadside movements and facing movements. [Johnson AD.: 2017] The reason we chose Betta splendins as our target species is that its behaviors are measurable and obvious, why created a 3 bins system to quantify its level of aggressiveness. Our hypothesis is a two tail hypothesis; the visibility of Betta fish's environmental water would affect the aggressiveness of male-male Betta fish. The independent variable of the experiment is the visibility of the environmental water, the dependent variable of the experiment is the two fish's aggressiveness when they are in the environments. The reason we decided to study this question is that we noticed that the wild Betta fish live in muddy water. Even though all the domestic betta fish are living in the fresh water, but their origin environments in the wild were in the muddy water, so we wondered whether putting the fish back to its primitive environment would trigger more aggressive intraspecific behaviors for male fish. We predicted that the male Betta fish would have a different level of aggressiveness when they are in a different environment with different visibility.

Materials and Method:
We had three Betta fish examples for our experiment and two tank for the different environmental water, in order to avoid differences caused by the color of the fish, we decided to use three Betta male fish with the same color. The three fish are Fish 1, Fish 2 and Fish 3. We paired them into three groups, put them in clean water first, then the murky water. For the murky water, we created the environment with 4 liters of water and 40 Ml of potting soil, mixing them properly.  Because we only had four group members and it was hard for us to differentiate them in the murky water, so we decided to leave the glass that separates them physically in the tank. We used a three bins system to measure the level of aggressiveness: tail flashing—1; showing “red mane”—2; bumping against the glass—3. We separated our group into parts, two of us would in charge of judging the level of aggressiveness of the fish, two of us would be in charge of writing down the data. Because each one of our group members has a different standard for the bins, so the people who were in charge of the judging would always be the one to judge which level of aggressiveness the fish was at that moment. After each experiment, we would add the score for both fish, to collect that score as the aggressiveness of the pair of fish under this circumstance. After each experiment, we will rest the fish for at least 10 minutes. We used the average score for the two environments to run the two-sample t_test. From the t_test, we had our p_value and t-value. If the p_value is smaller than 0.05, then our null-hypothesis will be rejected.

Results:
Because we have 2 groups of data in the entire experiment, we decided to summarize the data by using the average of each group and using the two-sample t_test to analyze our data. The average score for the aggressiveness of male Betta fish in the clear water is 114±50. And the first pair of the male Betta fish- clear water experiment has a very unusual low data, which caused big standard deviation for the clear-water-data. The average score for the aggressiveness of male Betta fish in the murky water is 1±1.414213. No specific data was found in this trail. The mean of the controlll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group(t_stat=3.192517, d.f.=4,P=0.016568). With the data above, we can see that the fish in murky water has a significently lower level of aggressiveness score than the fish in the clear water.

Discussion:
Because our p_value of the data is smaller than 0.05, which means that there is a significent difference between the two groups of data, and the null-hypothesis of the experiment has been rejected. Our final conclusion for the experiment is, the visibility of their environmental water would affect the aggressiveness of male-male Betta fish. In another previously published article, they also come up with the conclusion that the environment of the Betta fish could hugely affect Betta fish's aggressiveness [Oliveira, R. F., McGregor, P. K., & Latruffe, C.: 1998]. Because as we know that the intraspecific behavior for the Betta fish is a mating competition related behavior, also, to display all kinds of movements are very energy consuming, so the Betta fish would only display the agnostic behavior when it realizes the presence of other male fish. For the experiment we had in the murky water, we noticed that the fish weren’t even facing each other when they were in the same tank, and they barely display any intraspecific behaviors or swimming around in the tank as they would when they were aware of the presence of another male Betta fish. So, we believe the difference of the Betta fish's aggressiveness was caused by the fact that the murky water clouded them from each other. But considering the fact that the wild original environment for the Betta splendins fish was the murky and muddy water, we realized that after generation of artificial selection, the Betta fish had already lost their ability to identify others in the murky water. 
As for the huge standard deviation the first experiment group has, we believe it was caused by the first pair of the experiment in the clear water. In that experiment, our total score for the fish was 37, which is significently lower than the average score of the fish in clear water (114). We believe the reason is due to the fact that the plastic board that supposes to separate them visually was not big enough to separate the two fish effective, so they could sometimes notice the existence of each other, which might cause errors for the data. 
For the further experiment, we want to design an experiment about how would the color of the water affect the aggressiveness of the fish, which could avoid the situation that fish did not see each other.
This is an experiment about animal’s behavior. All of our results are based on the data we gathered and the observation we had. The intraspecific agnostic behavior of Betta splendins are behaviors shaped by evolution and selection. Through this experiment, we had two main conclusions based on our observation and data: Firstly, the environment of the animals could impact the animal’s behavior greatly; Secondly, the domestic fish would have very different behaviors from the wild fish.
