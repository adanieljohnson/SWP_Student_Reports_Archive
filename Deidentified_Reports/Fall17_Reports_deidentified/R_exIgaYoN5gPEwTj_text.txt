Title: Sodium channel-blocker in the form of lidocaine increases the amount of voltage needed for Rana pipiens to reach tetany

Abstract:
In this experiment, we worked with the Rana pipiens’ gastrocnemius muscle. Our main objective throughout this experiment was to determine the twitch threshold for each frog from the control and experimental by using a neuromuscular control system. We used a sodium channel- blocker, in the form of 25mM lidocaine to see how the lidocaine would affect the twitch threshold of each group. We believe that lidocaine will produce an increase in the amount of voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle to contract. The test we conducted was to find the twitch threshold of each frog from both the control and experimental group. For our experimental group, we injected each frog with about 0.2mL of lidocaine in the gastrocnemius muscle. We found that the experimental group had a very high number when it came to the amount of voltage they were able to handle than the control group. This proves that the injection of lidocaine did block the sodium channels which then hindered the gastrocnemius muscle to contract. This will be further explained in the discussion. Our results support our hypothesis because we did find that lidocaine affected the twitch threshold of the frogs.


Introduction:
In this experiment, we will be using the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens. We isolated the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from each of the R. pipiens’ leg to show the basic properties of neuromuscular control [Johnson: 2017]. The R. piniens was helpful to work with because these frogs are especially good at jumping which means they have a large gastrocnemius muscle. The legs were prepared before lab which gave us ample time to complete our experiment. It was a very easy process for when it came time to separate the sciatic nerve from the muscle. We used the computer program, iWorx, which will show the twitch threshold and the stimulus frequencies that are determined by direct stimulation. We also used a sodium channel blocker, in the form of lidocaine, to see how lidocaine affects the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle. Lidocaine will block the sodium channels by binding to the sodium channels itself [Cummings: 2007]. Lidocaine will also decrease membrane excitability and can block seizures induced by glutamate [Hoang: 2006]. We used lidocaine because we wanted to know how it will affect the contract of the R. pipiens’ muscle.  The contraction will be affected by the injection of lidocaine where the independent variable is lidocaine and the dependent variable is the contraction of the muscle itself. We predict that lidocaine will increase the voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle to contract.


Materials and Methods:
We first prepared the frog’s leg by separating the inner thigh muscles to reveal the sciatic nerve. We kept the leg moist by squirting each leg with the frog Ringer’s solution without drowning the leg in the solution. Once we had the inner thigh muscles separated, we attached a string to the gastrocnemius muscle from the hook making a 90degree angle between the string that is tied around the muscle and the other parts of the frog leg that are on the tray. Secure the frog’s leg to the tray with pins so when conducting the experiment, the leg doesn’t move. Then we took the sciatic nerve that is separated from the connective tissue and laid the nerve on the end of the stimulator and place a clear sleeve over it to secure the nerve in place. From here we hooked up the iWorx machine to the frog’s sciatic nerve to determine the twitch threshold. To determine the twitch threshold, we started by recording at 0.1V then increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1V increments until you find the twitch threshold. We repeated this whole process for all three of the frog’s legs. Once we determined the twitch threshold for each frog, we prepared the lidocaine solution. We used 25mM of lidocaine and dissolved 0.6g of lidocaine into 100mL of Ringer’s solution. Then we injected the frog with about 2 mL of the lidocaine solution into the gastrocnemius muscle and waited at least 5 minutes before continuing the experiment to give the frog rest. After we waited the 5 minutes, we repeated the exercises to determine the twitch threshold. We then repeated this same exercise for all 3 of the frog’s legs. Once all the data was gathered, we use a scatter plot to plot our data for both the control and experimental group with two degrees of freedom to show the results.


Results:
The test we conducted was on finding the twitch threshold of each frog. In the control group, control 1 reached 0.5 V, control 2 reached 0.2 V and control 3 reached 0.2 V before they reached the twitch threshold. The standard deviation between the control group is 0.173. In the experimental group, experimental 1 reached 2.5 V, experimental 2 reached 3.0 V. and experimental 3 reached 3.0 V. The standard deviation between the experimental group is 0.289. From Table 1, you can tell how the control groups are all close in the amount of voltage they received in order to find the twitch threshold. This is the same way for the experimental group where the twitch threshold was close in the amount of voltage they received. There is a big difference in the amount of voltage that the control group and the experimental group received during the testing of twitch threshold. From our data, we were able to find the mean, degrees of freedom, t-value and the p-value. The mean of the control group was 0.3 and the mean of the experimental group was 2.8. The degrees of freedom were at the value of 2 and the t-value was 9.5. We concluded that are results are significant with a p-value of 0.0109.


Discussion:
We are able to find the twitch threshold for both the experimental and control group by using the iWorx program. There was a big difference with the amount of voltage needed to reach twitch threshold between the control group and the experimental group. The experimental group had a very high frequency which is to be suspected considering we injected each of the frogs with lidocaine. This gave the frogs the ability to handle a higher amount of frequency than the frogs in the control group. The standard deviation within the experimental group was fairly low at 0.0109, which shows that our results were conclusive. By conducting our experiment, our results show that our hypothesis was supported considering that there was a big difference between the control group’s twitch threshold and the experimental group’s threshold, where the experimental group’s threshold values were a lot larger. Lidocaine has also been used to treat asthma and has been shown to be a therapy treatment where steroids are being used to control their asthma. This proves that lidocaine actually works as a sodium channel blocker that can be used as an anti-asthma treatment [Hoang: 2006]. A possible source of error that deals with our experimental group could be with the amount of rest they had in between the injection of lidocaine and the twitch threshold test that was conducted. If there was not the proper amount of rest time, which was 5 minutes, the lidocaine may have not been about the block the sodium channels in the short amount of time. Also, having a larger group of frogs to test on, would have made our data more accurate and our results more conclusive.
