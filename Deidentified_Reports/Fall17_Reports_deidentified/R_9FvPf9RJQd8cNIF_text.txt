Title: Measuring the Resource Allocation Potential of Alfalfa and Rye Plants 

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an important subset of ecological and evolutionary biology that gives key insights into interspecies dynamics. Our experiment aimed to observe some of these dynamics between Medicago sativa (alfalfa) and Secale cereale (rye). We measured the root to shoot ratios of alfalfa and rye planted alone and planted together in order to observe whether increased competition for limited resources had an effect on them. We conducted a two week long experiment in which we harvested fifteen alfalfa plants per treatment group and 3 rye plants per treatment group at the end of the experimental period. We measured the length and weight of their roots and shoots and analyzed the data using single factor ANOVA significance tests. We conducted one test for the root to shoot ratios of length and another test for the root to shoot ratios of weight. The significance tests conducted indicate that it is highly unlikely that the differences between treatment groups is a result of another underlying variable. According to our results, in alfalfa and rye plants, interspecific competition often coincides with a higher root to shoot ratios for both weight and length in comparison to the control groups. 

Introduction:
 Resource allocation is how an organism, in our case rye and alfalfa plants, distributes and uses the limited resources in its environment. This pattern is typically genetically determined. Higher fitness of certain resource patterns leads to those plants having more chance of producing offspring, thus passing on those traits to the subsequent generations. However, resource allocation patterns are not completely fixed and thus can also change in response to differing environmental conditions, e.g. interspecies competition.  

Previous research indicates that biomass allocation is the driving force of the capacity of a plant to take up necessary resources for survival. (Poorter 2012) Regarding the collection of data in a resource allocation experiment Poorter concedes that the collection of data can be difficult and complicated even though the overall concept is relatively simple. This study measures the effect of several environmental factors on the root to shoot ratios on plants and what was found is that when plants are in more “stressful” conditions the root to shoot ratio tends to be higher. Depending on the treatment, the root or the shoot can be the part of the plant increasing the overall ratio. For example, during a drought a plant will typically demonstrate larger roots while in an environment with limited sunlight a plant will typically demonstrate larger shoots.  (Poorter 2012)

Also, a 2014 study indicates that larger plants commonly have the advantage in a situation where two species are competing for resources, especially in situations where more of the interspecific competition occurs above ground. This is due to the simple fact that larger species can often overshadow the smaller species when competing for sunlight. However, larger plants tend to have larger root to shoot ratios when facing intraspecific competition. (Schamp 2014) A separate study by clarifies that discussing the differences between the effects on interspecies and intraspecies competition can be difficult when the plants are grown at similar densities. (Udd 2016)
	
Our experiment observed the effect of proximity on resource allocation in rye and alfalfa plants. We had two control groups: alfalfa planted by itself in each pot and rye planted by itself in each pot. We had three pots full of plants per treatment. For our experimental group, we planted alfalfa plants and rye plants in the same pot to measure the effect of proximity on resource allocation. Some questions that come to mind are: will the root to shoot ratios increase (or decrease) when the plants are growing in close proximity opposed to isolation? Does the root to shoot ratio greatly differ between rye and alfalfa? We hypothesized that planting the rye and alfalfa plants in the same pot would increase competition for limited resources, thus increasing the root to shoot ratio in comparison to the control groups. 


Materials and Methods:
In our experiment we measured the root to shoot ratios of weight and length in alfalfa and rye plants. We are thus able to observe to which biomass the plant tends to allocate resources to in pots with others of their own species versus in a pot where it is in competition with another plant species. In order to conduct our experiment, we filled three pots for each treatment group to the top with vermiculite soil and soaked each one in water. Then we added more vermiculite along with 50 mL of Miracle Gro to encourage plant growth. We then planted our seeds, labeled our pots and put them in the greenhouse to germinate. Throughout the experimental period (2 weeks) our group members alternated watering the plants every other day. 

After the experimental period passed, we harvested the plants for analysis on 10/2/17. For the alfalfa, because they are so small, we weighed them in groups of five and for the rye we measured the weight of three individual plants. We repeated this for each replicate within the treatment group, e.g. alfalfa only, rye only, alfalfa and rye in the same pot. We then separated the roots and shoots, taking care to separate them at the same spot on each plant, and weighed the roots and shoots separately. Then we calculated the root and shoot masses and measured the maximum root and shoot lengths. In order to analyze our data we used a single factor ANOVA and a Tukey-Kramer test with a significance level of 0.05 for the root to shoot ratios of length (in millimeters) and weight (in grams). Our result from the Tukey-Kramer test was .4016. It compares the pairs of means greater than the expected standard error. 


Results:
For the root to shoot ratios of length we calculated a p-value of 2.76E-0.5, which is much lower than the significance of 0.05. For the root to shoot ratios of weight we calculated a p-value of 1.14E0.6 which is also much lower than the significance of 0.5. 

The average length root to shoot ratio for the alfalfa only plants was 1.556 and the standard deviation was 0.295. The average length root to shoot ratio for rye only plants was 0.864 with a mean +/- SD of 0.341. The average length root to shoot ratio for alfalfa plants in the experimental group was 1.659 with a mean +/-  SD of 0.423. The average length root to shoot ratio for rye plants in the experimental group was 0.945 with a mean +/- SD of 0.287. 
The average weight root to shoot ratio for the alfalfa only plants was 0.308 and the standard deviation was 0.054. The average weight root to shoot ratio for rye only plants was 1.048 and the mean +/- SD of 0.449. The average weight root to shoot ratio for alfalfa plants in the experimental group was 0.398 and a mean +/- SD of 0.128. The average weight root to shoot ratio for rye plants in the experimental group was 1.125 and a mean +/- SD of 0.362. 
The mean value was 0.4016 for the Tukey-Kramer test. Also, both the root to shoot ratios of length and weight were higher for the plants in the experimental group than for those in the two control groups. Also, the root to shoot ratios of the rye plants in both the experimental and control groups tended to be higher than their alfalfa counterparts. We came to the above conclusion by comparing the minimum significant difference values found by performing the post-hoc Tukey-Kramer tests and ANOVA. 




Discussion:
Due to the fact that both of our p-values were lower than the significance of 0.05, we can safely reject our null hypothesis that increased interspecies competition would not have an increase in the root to shoot ratio. The data collected in this experiment confirms our initial hypothesis that the root to shoot ratio for plants in close competition for resources with another species, the experimental group, than those that did not have to compete for resources with a different plant species. As stated in the introduction it can be difficult to ascertain how much of the results were due to differences in plant size or the densities of the control groups. (Udd 2016) However, Udd does conclude similarly that this competition for limited resources leads to adaptations that more efficiently allocate resources depending on what is needed more, e.g. water, light, nutrients, etc. (Udd 2016)
According to more studies, for example are in agreement with our hypothesis, that coexistence between different species does increase competition for limited resources. Each species must adapt to these circumstances, creating “niche differentiation” where plants must either allocate a majority of their resources to their roots, below ground biomass, or shoots, above ground biomass. (Schamp 2013) Our results match this because we observed that plants in the experimental group consistently had higher root to shoot ratios than in the control groups. This study also observes that size plays a role in determining competition for resources such as light. We observed in our experiment that rye had higher weight root to shoot ratios than alfalfa plants in both intraspecific competition (planted alone) and interspecific competition (planted with another species). 
Also note that we observed mold growth around the rye plants in both the control and the experimental groups. For others replicating this experiment in the future, it is also possible that there was some defect in the rye seeds that caused the mold.  The study of resource allocation in plants can give unique insights into evolutionary biology. The changes in resource allocation based on different environmental conditions across several generations could be another set of factors to research.
