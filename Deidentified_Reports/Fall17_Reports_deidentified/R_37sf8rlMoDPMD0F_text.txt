Title: Effects of Atrazine, Diquat, and Paraquat Herbicides on Light-Dependent Photosystems of Isolated Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) Chloroplasts

Abstract:
In this experiment, we used three different herbicides (atrazine, diquat, and paraquat) to test which one was the most efficient inhibitor of light-dependent photosystems of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts. We hypothesized that atrazine would be the best inhibitor because it is an electron transport inhibitor which would disrupt photosystem II which is the first step in the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis. We made replicates of chloroplasts, herbicide, reaction buffer, water, and DCPIP to induce photosynthesis and activate the system. Absorbances were recorded at 600nm. We concluded that diquat was the best inhibitor having the highest absorbance values meaning low photosynthetic activity. Since diquat works by diverting electron flow and is non-selective, it had the greatest inhibitory effect on the light-dependent photosystems. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is used by plants, some protists, and certain bacteria to create and store energy from the sun. In photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation which excited electrons to leave carrier molecules. This excitement triggers a chemical reaction that cleaves water releasing electrons to replace the ones that left the carriers and generate a proton gradient. These high energy electrons are stored as NADPH and the proton gradient which powers ATP synthesis. These electrons are used in chemical reactions to create 6-carbon glucose from 1-carbon carbon dioxides [Johnson: 2016]. 
	The first two stages of photosynthesis are called the light-dependent reactions. They create the gradient that drives ATP synthesis. In Photosystem II, energy that is absorbed from the light photos creates oxidized chlorophyll which indirectly stimulate the cleavage of water to create molecular oxygen and electrons that restore the ones lost from the chlorophyll. The free protons from the water are pumped across the thylakoid membrane. In Photosystem I, energy carried by photons are used to excited electrons of chlorophylls. The excited electrons leave the chlorophyll and produce NADPH. In Photosystem I, the electrons that leave the chlorophyll are replaced by the electrons carried by plastocyanin in Photosystem II. When protons move down their combined electrical and diffusion gradient, ATP molecules are synthesized by the complex [Johnson: 2016]. 
	Measuring ATP production is difficult; however, the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts and light is called the Hill reaction. By using 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) as the electron acceptor, the color change that results from bring oxidized (dark blue) and being reduced (clear), we can measure DCPIP reduction [Johnson: 2016]. 
	When thinking about this system, we wanted to test the effects of different types of herbicides on photosynthesis of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). We are asking this question to be able to determine the best type of herbicide to have the greatest effect on photosynthesis. We hypothesize that atrazine herbicide will have the greatest effect on photosystem II, the first part of photosynthesis. Our independent variable is the type of herbicide used (atrazine, diquat, or paraquat), our dependent variable is the absorbance recorded after time in light to photosynthesize. We wanted to use spinach leaves specifically because they have broad leaves which mean they have lots of chloroplasts making them easy to isolate and test in this experiment. 
We hypothesized that atrazine would inhibit spinach photosynthesis the most because it specifically targets Photosystem II. Herbicide affecting proteins of the electron transport chain is what is going to most inhibit photosynthesis because in both cellular respiration and photosynthesis, the continual transportation of electrons from high to low energy states, moving from one protein carrier to another, is what will generate the most energy- as such, we predict that the herbicide affecting PSII (atrazine) is going to most reduce photosynthetic activity. Atrazine binds to the plastoquinone-binding protein in PSII- electron transport process causes oxidative damage, and since the electron transport chain relies on Pq, this will inhibit photosynthesis more than the diquat/paraquat, which inhibit PSI by competing with NADP+ as an oxygen acceptor. PSII occurs before PSI, such that one could argue that if PSII is significantly affected, photosynthesis will cease early, as PSII is what generates ATP [Markwell: 2003].


Materials and Methods:
The herbicides we will be using are atrazine, a Photosystem II inhibitor [Markwell: 2003], diquat, and paraquat which are both non-selective contact herbicides [Markwell: 2003]. We will use a spectrophotometer machine to record absorbances from the herbicide replicates. 
	First, we need to isolate the spinach chloroplasts by grinding them up in a mortar and pestle with 20 mL of grinding buffer. Then strain the mixture, transfer into a beaker, and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4º C. Then, isolate supernatant and centrifuge again at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4º C. Then remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Add 20 mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it. 
	After isolating the chloroplasts, three replicates of atrazine, diquat, and paraquat as well as a positive control replicate, negative control replicate, and blank are all produced. For the herbicides, 5 mL of water, 100 microliters of chloroplasts, 2 mL of 100 mM phosphate reaction buffer, 2 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, and 1 mL of the specific herbicide into a test tube making three replicates. The blank will only have 5 mL of water and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. The positive control will consist of 5 mL water, 100 microliters of chloroplasts, and 2 mL or reaction buffer. The negative control will consist of 5 mL water, 100 microliters of chloroplasts, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 2 mL of DCPIP. However, when making the replicates, don’t add the chloroplasts until just before you are ready to begin the experiment. After adding, mix each tube and transfer to cuvettes to measure absorbance of all of the samples at 600 nm. After 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer, and record absorbances again, calculating percent change. Repeat this at the 20 and 30 minute marks. 
	In total, the reagents used were 30 mL of water, 40 mL of grinding buffer, 12 mL of 100mM phosphate reaction buffer, 8 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, 1 mL of atrazine, 1 mL of paraquat, and 1 mL of diquat. 
	In calculating statistical significance we used a two sample t-test assuming unequal variance between paraquat, diquat, and atrazine using absorbance values over time and percent change from average absorbance values at each time. 

Results:
We determined from our data that diquat was the most efficient herbicide for spinach since it has the highest average absorbance at the end of the 30-minute period signaling least photosynthetic activity. The mean for absorbance was 0.5543 for atrazine, 0.5408 for paraquat, and 0.5871 for diquat. The statistical test between atrazine and paraquat using absorbance values resulted in a p value of 0.406 which is statistically insignificant. The t-test between atrazine and diquat using absorbance values resulted in a p value of 0.0221 which is statistically significant. For the t-tests comparing atrazine and paraquat using percent change of average absorbance values, the p value is 0.016 which is statistically significant. The t-test comparing atrazine and diquat using average absorbance values resulted in a p value of 0.492 which is not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
With a statistically significant result when comparing diquat to atrazine using absorbance values, we were able to determine that the difference between the absorbance levels had to do with our manipulation of the independent variable, the herbicide type. According to the Washington State Department of Ecology, diquat is a non-selective contact herbicide that is quickly absorbed by green plant tissues which are killed on exposure to light. The mode of action for diquat is a photosynthetic electron flow diverter [Emmett: 2002]. Diquat is absorbed through the leaf cuticle and interferes with photosynthesis by inactivating cells and their functions by releasing strong oxidants [Emmett: 2002]. Since spinach has broad leaves and a high number of chloroplasts, the tissues are very green making it susceptible to diquat. Because diquat damages the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, it makes sense that when placed under a UV lamp, absorbances for the samples with diquat increased signaling a decrease in photosynthetic activity. This can be seen in figure 1 with diquat having absorbance values closest to the negative control. Figure 2 shows differences in percent change with time for the different herbicides. For this one, diquat had an insignificant p value while paraquat’s p value was significant. Since the absorbance values were significant for diquat, the reason the percent changes might be insignificant could be not because of invaluable absorbance values but rather similar percent changes between the two different herbicides, in this example, atrazine and diquat.
Atrazine is an electron transport inhibitor that mainly targets photosystem II. However, partial reactions aren’t determined by photosystem II. This could be why atrazine fell in-between paraquat and diquat. Some of the photosynthetic activity was inhibited by not the partial reactions. An example is cyclic phosphorylation which is either not inhibited or only weakly inhibited. This is why atrazine wasn’t the most effective herbicide when dealing with light-dependent photosystems [Alsop: 1974]. Our hypothesis predicting atrazine had to do with the fact that it seemed that without the initial electrons, photosynthesis wouldn’t be able to occur. However, as proven by this article, partial reactions do take place allowing for photosynthesis to occur at a mild level. 
We could improve our experiment by increasing the number of replicates used for each sample. We could also compare our results with spinach to that of another plant such as kale. We could also do the experiment for a longer period of time. According to Washington State’s Department of Ecology, it takes around an hour for diquat to reach its full potential in inhibiting photosynthesis [Emmett: 2002]. If we extended the time of this experiment, perhaps we could get a more drastic decrease in photosynthetic activity creating clearer results allowing us to form a more advanced conclusion about our study.
