Title: The Effect of Light and Darkness Increased the Specific Metabolic Rate of Crayfish 

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to measure the effects of light and darkness on the specific metabolic rate of two crayfish. The two crayfish are of the same species and only vary in size by a small number. We measured the dissolved oxygen content in a mason jar with the crayfish in them using a probe and then used that dissolved oxygen number to calculate the specific metabolic rate. The hypothesis states that the oxygen consumption will decrease with darkness because as the environment gets darker the water and temperature gets colder because as the temperature in water increases oxygen consumption decreases and therefore so does the specific metabolic rate. The data that was collected concluded an increase in specific metabolic rate from a change in light to dark. Therefore we refuted the hypothesis that was previously stated. The p_value also showed significance within the data that was concluded. 


Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to determine the effects of light on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish. Cray fish are ectotherms, “their body temperatures fluctuate with environmental temperatures and the rates of most biochemical reactions and biological processes increase approximately exponentially with temperature” as quoted from an academic article titled “A general model for effects of temperature on ectotherm ontogenetic growth and development” [Zuo, Moses, West, Hou, Brown; 2011].  This will be measured through the variation of light, from a fully covered mason jar to an uncovered mason jar. The independent variable is the variation of dark or light. The independent variable is the specific metabolic rate. The hypothesis for this experiment is that the oxygen consumption will decrease with darkness because as the environment gets darker-the water and temperature gets colder because as the temperature in water increases, oxygen consumption decreases therefore so does specific metabolic rate. 

This experiment will be accomplished through the use of a test chamber and a probe that measures the oxygen consumption. The specific metabolic rate will be calculated through the use of an equation. use the equation of specific metabolic rate to calculate the specific metabolic rate. 

Within an experiment that was previously published called “Effect of variation in Photoperiod and Light Intensity on Oxygen Consumption, Lactate Concentration and Behavior in Crayfish Procambris Clarkii and Procambris digueti” studied the effects of oxygen consumption and they concluded that oxygen consumption decreased within crayfish that increased light intensity. [Fajul-Molesa, Bosques-Tistlera, Prieto-Sagredoa, Castanon-Cervantesa, Fernandez-Rivera-Riobj; 1998] This experiment can be used to back up the hypothesis above. 



Materials and Method:
1. Begin with room temperature water that is not covered with aluminum foil. Fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with room temperature water saturated with air. Set test chamber in empty plastic dishpan.
2. Place crayfish in test chamber after you weight it. Record weight. 
3. FIll container with room temperature water.
4. Place entire tank-set up to the neck with water in a dish pan filled with room temperature water.
5. Insert dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber.
6. Turn on instrument and let the instrument stabilize.
7. Take a baseline reading of dissolved oxygen concentration. 
8. At 5, 10,15, and 20 minutes, read the oxygen concentration and record what the instrument says. 
9. Now do the same with the same crayfish but this time cover the jar with aluminum foil and then repeat steps 6-8. Record this data.
Do the same with the other crayfish. 



Results:
The p_value is 0.167904. This means that the p_value is significent because it is larger than 0.05. The controlll’s average is 0.000605667 and the standard variation is 0.000229106. The average is calculated from the average of specific metabolic rate average of the two crayfish. The experimental average is 0.001488667 and the standard deviation is 0.000503156. This shows that there is a stronger variation for the experimental group than the controlll’s.


Discussion:
From the results of the data, the specific metabolic rate from light to dark increased instead of decreased. We refute the hypothesis because the average specific metabolic rate increased as darkness increased instead of decreased based off of the data. In an experiment titled “The effect of light on oxygen consumption in two amphipod crustaceans- the hypogean Niphargus stygius and the epigean Gammarus fossarum” tested the effects of light on oxygen consumption on ectotherms, which is very similar to this experiment. The experiment concluded that “oxygen consumption in the dark was much higher in the epigean G. fossarum than in the hypogean N. stygius” [Tatjana, Anton; 2007]. This difference in oxygen consumption was due to the fact of their different habitats. But this can still be used to explain our results of why specific metabolic rate increased as darkness did.

Some limitations that this experiment encountered was the stress that was most likely induced on the crayfish from being left in light to a rapid change to darkness. This could have stressed the creature enough to actually cause the increase in specific metabolic rate. Another limitation that was experienced was the late start of stabilization of the instrument that was used to calculate the dissolved oxygen. It was not consistent in reading the dissolved oxygen number at the very moment of 5 minutes, but alternatively it took longer for that to occur. That could have given some skewed data. 

For future experiments, there should be a resting period implemented to allow a more relaxing transition between periods of light and darkness. Also maybe increasing the space that the crayfish was in could help reduce stress levels. Because this was only tested on two crayfish a few other test trials could better improve results.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Figure 1 shows an increase in average specific metabolic rate from controlll to experimental (dark). There are also error bars that show a larger variation within the experimental's data. This means that the experimental data had a larger range of numbers.
