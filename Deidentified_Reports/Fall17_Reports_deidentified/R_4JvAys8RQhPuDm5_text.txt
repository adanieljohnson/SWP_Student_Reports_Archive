Title: Observing the effect of aggression on Procambarus specific metabolic rate

Abstract:
All organisms require energy to drive metabolic processes.These can be measured through O₂ consumption, and can be affected by external stimuli like aggression. The purpose of this lab was to observe the effects of aggression on crayfish (Orconectes sp.) metabolism. It was hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate of small crayfish would increase when in the presence of a large, intimidating crayfish. Smaller crayfish were placed in a container and the concentration of dissolved O₂ was measured until 20 mins, and after this a large crayfish was placed in proximity and the concentration of dissolved O₂ was measured again. It was found that p=0.018 and t=0, meaning that the difference between the means of the control and experimental groups was significant. This result implies that the presence of the large crayfish significantly and effectively increased the specific metabolic rate of the smaller crayfish.

Introduction:
Organisms procure energy for metabolic processes in different ways. Autotrophs capture sunlight or chemical energy in glucose and similar molecules through photosynthesis or other enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Heterotrophs obtain high energy molecules through consumption of other heterotrophs or autotrophs. Both of these kinds of organisms use mitochondrial enzymes to convert high-energy molecules into low-energy ones, capturing the energy released in ATP. Metabolism is the whole process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells of an organism. Metabolic rate is the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiological processes at any time. This can be indirectly measured by O₂ consumption or CO₂ production by a specific organism. These molecules are involved in metabolic processes as CO₂ is the result of the conversion of glucose to energy, and O2 is inhaled to combine with electrons from the electron transport chain involved with the breakdown of glucose and forms water. This water joins body fluids or is excreted, and CO₂ is removed from the body through exhalation to avoid toxic consequences. The amount of energy produced by the amount of O₂ consumed or CO₂ excreted [Johnson 2017]. Metabolic rate is influenced by many factors, including size and aggression. It has been shown that crayfish are known to exhibit protective responses to threatening external stimuli, including defense posturing and increased heart rate [Bierbower: 2009]. It would therefore be interesting to see the effect of size and aggression on crayfish (Orconectes sp.) metabolism. Crayfish are model organisms because they are easy to handle, and, since they live underwater, it is easy to tell the volume of O₂ consumed by calculating dissolved O₂ concentrations. It was hypothesized that in the presence of a larger crayfish, the metabolic rate of a smaller crayfish will increase.

Materials and Methods:
Three small crayfish (Orconectes sp.) and one large one were procured and kept in 22°C water tanks.
A crayfish was weighed and placed in a testing container, which was filled with 22°C air saturated water. The container was then sealed shut.
The container was placed in a tray of water at room temperature.
The lid of the tank was used to block off the container in the corner, while leaving space around it.
A probe attached to the cap of the container measured a baseline concentration of dissolved O₂ of the water.
The dissolved O₂ concentration was determined again at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, the volume of the water in the container was measured in a graduated cylinder.
This procedure was repeated again for the other crayfish.
Now, a large crayfish was placed in the tray in the space adjacent to the crayfish but confined by the lid, and the experiment was repeated.


Results:
Each small crayfish saw an increase in specific metabolic rate after the introduction of the large crayfish. Crayfish 1’s SMR increased by 2.30*10^-12, crayfish 2 increased by 1.72*10^-6, and crayfish 3 increased by 1.07*10^6). Using a paired T-test, it was found that the mean specific metabolic rate of the control group was significantly greater than that of the treatment group. (t=0, p=0.018, degrees of freedom=2). 


Discussion:
The data supported the initial alternative hypothesis. From figure one it can be observed that the specific metabolic rate of each crayfish increased once the larger crayfish had been added to the tank. In previous studies on tadpoles, researchers found that oxygen consumption increased by 16.8% in the presence of predation risk [Steiner: 2009]. This is consistent with the findings of this experiment and suggests that the presence of threatening or aggressive stimuli will result in an increased metabolic rate. Furthermore, this explanation is likely as the p-value from the t-test was 0.018, showing a significant effect of the presence of an aggressive stimuli on metabolic rate. Further experiments could be performed to determine if factors other than size influence aggression, such as coloration or pheromones.
