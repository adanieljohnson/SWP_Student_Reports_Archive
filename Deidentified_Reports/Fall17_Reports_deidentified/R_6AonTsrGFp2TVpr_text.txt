Title: The Effect of Nicotine on the Neuromuscular Control of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Abstract: 
The main objective of this experiment was to compare the strength of gastrocnemius contractions in the the Northern Leopard Frog (Rana pipiens) with the contractions after nicotine was directly injected into the muscle. It was  hypothesized that if the gastrocnemius is injected with nicotine, then it would experience a strong contraction. Nicotine does essentially what acetylcholine does and when injected into the muscle, it contributes to the release of calcium. When calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle contracts. The gastrocnemius muscle was isolated and pin electrodes were stuck directly into the muscle and electrical pulses were sent to the leg to measure amplitudes of contractions. A myogram was used to show a latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period. The results showed that the amplitudes were higher for the experimental muscles, which had the nicotine injection, than the amplitudes of the control muscles. Our p-values were all p < .001 (6.34E-11, 1.81E-7, and  2.16E-11.) The results supported our hypotheses that the nicotine causes stronger contractions. 

Introduction:
Introduction:
In this experiment, Rana pipiens, or commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, was the organism that was studied in order to understand how the skeletal neuromuscular junction operates.  Nerve cells send electrical signals throughout the body. The structure of nerve cells allows them to carry out their functions. They have axons that transmit electrical signals away from the cell body and dendrites that have the ability to receive signals from other neurons. The branching axons attach to the synaptic terminals in the muscle, controlling its movements. When a nerve signal is sent it reaches a neuromuscular junction and releases acetylcholine which fuses to the membrane of the muscle fiber and releases calcium. An action potential is created by the postsynaptic membrane and it moves through the t-tubules. This changes the shape of the DHP receptor, which in turn changes the shape of the ryanodine receptor as well. Next, the DHP receptor and ryanodine receptor detach and the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium. The release of calcium causes the contraction in muscle fibers [Johnson: 2017]. Myosin uses the energy from ATP cleavage to move across actin filaments. The myofiber shortens when the myosin heads continuously move across the actin. Finally, re-uptake occurs and calcium re-enters the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the muscles relaxes. 
Acetylcholine is key in the contraction of muscles because it contributes to the release of calcium. Nicotine is an acetylcholine agonist and it contributes to the release of calcium as well. This means that injecting nicotine would most likely cause calcium to release, leading to the contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle. In another study, it was found that high nicotine concentrations caused contraction in Oryctolagus cuniculus, commonly known as New Zealand white rabbit, corpus cavernosal (a region of erectile tissue in the penis) strips [Nguyen: 2015]. Rana pipiens is an ideal organism to use because it has skin that is soft so it slides off easily and it is easy to find and isolate the gastrocnemius muscle. The gastrocnemius muscle was able to be cut away from the rest of the leg quite easily. We hypothesized that if the gastrocnemius is injected with nicotine, then it would experience a strong contraction.


Materials and Methods:
Material and Methods:
For this experiment, Rana pipiens was used to test the response of the gastrocnemius muscle to nicotine. iWorx was the computer program was used to measure contractions and it produced myograms which show the relationship between time and muscle tension. 
First, three frog legs should be placed on a tray. Next, the skin must be pulled off of the legs, revealing the muscles. Then, the sciatic nerve should be retrieved and pulled away from the other muscle tissue surrounding it. Parts of the leg must be pinned down to the tray so that their movements are not recorded as contractions on iWorx. The gastrocnemius should be isolated, tied, and lifted at a ninety degree angle. We used pin electrodes to determine amplitudes. Place the pins in the gastrocnemius muscle, careful not to let them touch each other or other metal.
For the control, the pulse amplitude should be set to 0 volts, set the pulses to 1 Hertz, and pulse width to 5 milliseconds. Next, increase the volts to .1 in order to find the individual threshold for each muscle. The size of the muscles in the frog leg varied drastically, and therefore our average amplitudes for the frog legs varied so we had to perform three separate t-tests. We set the iWorx for the control so amplitude was .5 (use optimal threshold for specific muscle) pulses to 5,  width to 5, frequency to 1. Next, we let the frog leg go for 5 pulses. Then, we injected the nicotine, turned iWorx off for for ten seconds, then turned it back on and let it run for five pulses again. The syringe contained 1 mg/ml nicotine with a concentration of 1 mm of tubocurarine for each injection. Be careful to hold the muscle while injecting for maximal control and safety. Finally, measure the amplitude of the control to that of the treatment. We ran a one-tailed t-test for this experiment.

Discussion:
Discussion:
Our hypothesis that nicotine causes long contractions in the muscle was supported. The three average muscle contractions that occurred after the nicotine injection had a much higher amplitude than the contractions of the control muscle. Based on an article in the US National Library of Medicine, the muscle should contract when it is exposed to nicotine because nicotine is an acetylcholine agonist [Nguyen et al: 2015]. In the experiment from the literature, nicotine injected into the corpus cavernosum of New Zealand white rabbits caused the muscles to have strong contractions due to the release of calcium caused by nicotine. Our experiment also showed muscle contraction due to nicotine injection. Nicotine caused release of calcium which allowed sodium channels to open, causing an action potential which signaled to the gastrocnemius muscle to contract. However, the experiment in the literature also states that nicotine can also cause relaxation of the corpus cavernosum [Nguyen et al: 2015]. It is noted that large amounts of nicotine are what cause the contraction. It would be interesting to further study the sciatic nerve in Rana pipiens by injecting less nicotine and recording the results. Instead of injecting 1 mg/ml nicotine, we would inject 0.5 mg/ml nicotine.
