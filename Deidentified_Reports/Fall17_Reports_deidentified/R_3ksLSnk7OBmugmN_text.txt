Title: The Lack of Significant within the Rate of Photosynthesis of _Spinacia oleracea_ Using Different-Colored LED Lights 

Abstract:
All living organisms must have a way to produce energy in order to perform life sustaining processes. Plants, some protists, and certain bacteria are able to obtain energy through a process called photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis needs light energy to proceed, and it is believed that the manipulation of the color of light being received by the plant can alter its photosynthetic rate. If this is true, altering the color of light will, in essence, change the rate of the plant’s growth as well. Using basic light theory, prior experimentation, and photosynthetic theory, this experiment compares photosynthetic rates of chloroplasts from _Spinacia oleracea_ under different colored LED lights. The photosynthetic rate was measured using DCPIP and spectrometry. It was found that the rate of photosynthesis was not significantly altered with the use of different colored lights. It was concluded that without further experimentation, it cannot be determined if different colored LED lights do in fact have an effect on photosynthesis.

Introduction:
All living organisms must have a way to produce energy in order to perform life sustaining processes. Plants, some protists, and certain bacteria are able to obtain energy through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis takes in carbon dioxide and water molecules and, through light energy, is able to create glucose, oxygen, and water molecules. During photosynthesis, a variety of steps occur that lead to the production of ATP. First, cells absorb solar radiation within their chlorophyll molecules. This process occurs in the thylakoid stacks within the chloroplast. Electrons within the thylakoid stacks are then excited, causing them to leave their electron carriers and enter an electron transport chain. The electron transport chain allows protons to cross the membrane, establishing a proton gradient. As protons undergo passive transport and try to return to an area of lower concentration, they spin ATP synthase, which produces ATP molecules. The majority of these ATP molecules are later used during glucose synthesis. [Govindjee: 2016]
	The model organism for this experiment was _Spinacia oleracea_, commonly known as spinach. Spinach is a good model organism because it is able to be grown hydroponically in controlled environments. Spinach is also a good organism because it has large leaves with a dark coloring, symbolic of a large number of chloroplasts. Spinach is also one of few plants that can undergo the centrifuge process while keeping its chloroplasts intact [Schmitz-Linneweber: 2017].
	Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) is a photo-reactive electron acceptor that is used to measure the photosynthetic rate. DCPIP begins with a blue coloring, and as it accepts more electrons, it loses its pigmentation. This is a good indicator of the photosynthetic rate because the quicker the solution loses its color, the faster the rate of photosynthesis. The change in pigmentation will be found using a spectrometer set at 600 nm, the optimal absorption of the blue color distinctive to DCPIP [Johnson: 2017]. For this experiment, the dependent variable is the change in the rate of absorbance of DCPIP.
	In past experiments, when using red, blue, yellow, and green cellophane film over a light source, it was found that blue light inhibited growth, yellow light had no effect, and red light caused the culture to look more green. Therefore, they concluded that red light was the most beneficial to growth within a plant. In fact, the results of that experiment led to the use of blue lights to prevent plant growth [Sanmartín: 2017]. In another experiment, it was found that the most impressive rate of growth occurred in plants that were exposed to a red light as well [Chen: 2014]. However, in another experiment, it was shown that a blue LED light increased photosynthetic pigments within the test plant. The peak wavelength in this experiment occurred at a wavelength of 445 nm [Miku: 2016]. Many experiments also support this claim, with one reporting photosystem II activity up to 35% [Hsieh: 2013]. For this experiment, the independent variable will be the color of light shined on the mixtures. 
	Based on past literature on similar experiments, the hypothesis of this experiment was that if Spinach is exposed to red, blue, green, and white LED lights, then there will be a significant difference in the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts exposed to the varying light treatments. The expected outcome is that the plants will experience a greater photosynthetic rate in red light, and a lower rate in green light than the control’s photosynthetic rate, with blue light somewhere in between. 


Materials and Methods:
To conduct this experiment, chloroplasts first had to be isolated from spinach leaves. This was achieved by deveining six leaves and crushing them with a mortar and pestle. The leaves were crushed with twenty mL of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose un tricine buffer, pH 8), and filtered with cheese cloth. The mixture was then sent through a centrifuge and spun at 200 x G for three minutes at 4º C. The solution was decanted, and was once again spun in a centrifuge, this time at 1000 x G for ten minutes. The pellet at the bottom was reached through decanting, and 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to suspend the chloroplasts within the pellet.
	The resulting solution was added to 12 test tubes in 100 µL increments. Also added to these tubes was two mL of 130 mM DCPIP, two mL of 100 mM phosphate reaction buffer, and six mL of water. A blank was also created to calibrate the spectrometer. The absorbance was recorded at initiation (time zero) and they were then separated into groups of three. Each group of three sat under a certain colored LED light for thirty minutes and the absorbance was calculated again. The colored LED lights that were used were white, blue, green, and red. The group under the white light will act as the control group. To test for significance, a one-way ANOVA will be used. This will compare all the values for each colored light to one another. If the p-value is less than 0.05, then the values will be deemed as significantly different.


Results:
As was expected, the chloroplasts under the white light, the control group, had the highest experimental change in absorbance. It experienced a loss of pigmentation of 0.213 AU. Therefore, it had the highest rate of photosynthesis. No other experimental group had results that equaled or surpassed those of the white light. The second best experimental group was the chloroplasts under the green light, with a loss of 0.145 AU. This is followed by the blue light group, with a loss of 0.139 AU. This is finally followed by the lowest amount of change within the red light group, with a loss of 0.069 AU. It is important to note that, despite the experimental difference that can be seen in Figure 1, there was not a significant difference. The individual p-value (0.133) is not less than 0.05. The ANOVA results can be seen in Figures 2 and 3. 

Discussion:
In conclusion, the hypothesis is unable to be accepted as there was not any significant change in the data. The results almost directly refute the hypothesis, in the fact that it was thought that the highest photosynthetic rate would belong to the red light, then the blue light, and finally the green light. Despite the belief that the red light would induce the highest rate of photosynthesis compared to the other two colors, it actually performed the worst. It was also expected that the green light would have the lowest rate of photosynthesis, but it had the highest instead. It was originally thought that the green experimental group would perform the worst because the green light emitted from the source would be reflected off the green chloroplasts, a belief that is based upon light theory. The light reflects off the chloroplast, making it unable to harness the light energy, and therefore preventing them from undergoing photosynthesis. However, upon closer examination, it was found that the green light bulb differed from the other two colored lights that were used. In fact, the green light bulb allowed two times the amount of light to pass through it, doubling its brightness compared to the other bulbs. It is likely that this increase of brightness is the cause of the skew of the data, as the chloroplasts within the bulb were introduced to two times the amount of light that the others received. 
	As was expected, the white light bulb led to the largest rate of photosynthesis. This is likely because the white light bulb emitted all wavelengths to the chloroplast, so the chloroplast was able to absorb a variety of the light energy to begin photosynthesis. It had a better rate than the colored light bulbs because the colored light bulbs only emit a certain range of wavelengths, which is not preferred for photosynthesis.
	In order to have the best results possible, the experiment would need to be repeated with different colored lights with the same about of light emitted. Otherwise, because of the difference in the light emittance, it is impossible to make a conclusive statement. To further expand on this experiment, it would be interesting to see the effect that a light source with two or three colors combined would have on photosynthesis rate, and if there is an optimal ratio of the colors for optimal photosynthetic activity. If a significant change can be found under a certain compound light, this information could then be taken and utilized in agribusiness to help increase product yields.
