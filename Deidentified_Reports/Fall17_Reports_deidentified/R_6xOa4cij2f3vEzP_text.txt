Title: The Effect of the Temperature of the Surrounding Environment on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp.

Abstract:
Changes in the environment result in increased metabolic rates because the organism will consume more oxygen and expend more energy in order to accommodate to the changing and stressful environment. Oxygen consumption can be used to determine the specific metabolic rate which is a measure of the amount of energy expended by the organism in relation to their body mass. In this study we examined the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. in cold water (10°C) and room temperature water (22°C). The results showed no statistically significant difference in the specific metabolic rate between the two water conditions (p = 0.7949), which suggests that temperature does not have an effect on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp.

Introduction:
The term metabolism refers to the biochemical process of combining nutrients with oxygen in order to release the energy necessary for bodies to function. The amount of oxygen consumed is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended by that animal. The amount of energy expended by the animal is the specific metabolic rate [Sadava: 2017]. Some endotherms go into hibernation in the winter which is a state where they decrease their metabolic rate in decreased temperatures in order to survive. By decreasing their metabolic rate, the animals are not expending as much energy and therefore conserving energy used to maintain bodily functions. A study conducted by Fritz Geiser suggests that the slowing of the metabolic rate of hibernating species is in response to the fall of bodily temperature [Geiser]. There are a variety of different factors that influence the specific metabolic rate of a given organism such as the Procambarus sp., more commonly known as a crayfish. In order to further examine the boundaries of decreased metabolic rate in response to decreased temperatures, we tested whether or not temperature has an effect on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp., comparing room temperature conditions (~22°C) to cold water conditions (~10°C). We hypothesized that Procambarus sp. will have a lower specific metabolic rate in colder conditions.

Materials and Methods:
Room Temperature Water Conditions: Three small (~2-5g) Procambarus sp. were used in this experiment. Each Procambarus sp. was weighed and then placed into a screw-top glass testing chamber filled completely with room temperature oxygenated water (~22°C). The oxygen consumption of each individual Procambarus sp. was recorded, using a dissolved oxygen probe, at baseline and in five minute intervals for 20 minutes. After this was completed the volume of the water in the container was measured using a graduated cylinder. This is the control group. Cold Water Conditions: The same three Procambarus sp. were used again but under cold oxygenated water conditions (~10°C). The same procedure was followed for the cold oxygenated water conditions as was for the room temperature oxygenated water conditions (as previously described) with the addition of the chamber being placed in an ice bath. This is the experimental group. Calculating Specific Metabolic Rate: Specific metabolic rate was calculated using the following equation: SMR=[O2(mg/L)*volume H2O (L)]/Time(min)*weight(g), where O2 is the change in oxygen consumption, volume H2O is the volume of the container, and weight is weight of the organism. Statistical Analysis: In order to test if the results are significant, a paired-two-sample t-test was applied to the specific metabolic rate.

Results:
We determined if there were significant differences between the specific metabolic rates of Procambarus sp. in room temperature oxygenated water conditions compared to cold oxygenated water conditions by calculating the specific metabolic rate of each Procambarus sp. at both room temperature water conditions and in cold water conditions. The average specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. in room temperature oxygenated water conditions was 0.00422436mgO2/g*min (SD = 0.0009) while the average specific metabolic rate in cold oxygenated water conditions was 0.003793333mgO2/g*min (SD = 0.0019) (Figure 1). The specific metabolic rate for the Procambarus sp. in room temperature water conditions was slightly higher than in the specific metabolic rate for Procambarus sp. in cold water conditions but not significantly. There were no statistically significant differences in the specific metabolic rate between the Procambarus sp. In room temperature water and Procambarus sp. in cold water (sample size= 3, df = 2, p= 0.7949).

Discussion:
After conducting this experiment, our results showed no significant difference concluding that within our tested range, temperature has no effect on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp.(p value = 0.7949). This is most likely because Procambarus sp. are ectotherms which means their internal body temperature changes with the external temperature. Due to this condition, Procambarus sp. do not have to regulate their body temperature as often as endocrines do, therefore, their metabolic rate is not significantly altered. A study published by Humberto Villarreal examined the difference in oxygen consumption of Cherax tenuimanus (a species very similar to Procambarus sp.) in cold water compared to the oxygen consumption in room temperature water. Cherax tenuimanus and Procambarus sp. are both types of crayfish however the Cherax tenuimanus are found in the deep waters of rivers with plenty of organic matter requiring good water quality while Procambarus sp. can be found in a variety of different environments and are able to withstand a range of environmental conditions including low oxygen levels and high temperatures [IUCN]. Villarreal concluded from his study that oxygen consumption by of the Cherax tenuimanus at 18°C was 60% of the rate at 22°C and 26°C. This study gave evidence supporting the hypothesis that oxygen consumption in colder water is less than it is at room temperature. Villarreal also concluded that the heartbeat rate was lowest at 18°C and highest at 22°C. He claimed that there was evident stress of the organism at 26°C [Villarreal: 1990]. Although Villarreal was able to conclude in his study that the specific metabolic rate and oxygen consumption of Cherax tenuimanus was lower in cooler temperature, this does not necessarily apply to our study. Do to the fact that Procambarus sp. are able to live in a variety of different environments and withstand a wide range of water temperatures, it is possible that the temperatures we tested do not have as much of a effect on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. in comparison to Cherax tenuimanus. Although our experiment did not result in conclusive evidence of specific metabolic rate decreasing in colder water conditions, it is possible that this would be proven true with further testing. Villarreal’s experiment may have been more conclusive do to his sample size of 60 Cherax tenuimanus [Villarreal: 1990]. In order to improve this experiment, I would increase the number of Procambarus sp. tested, therefore, increasing the sample size. Typically, the greater the sample size the more conclusive the data. One limitation to this lab may have been if the starting oxygen content was measured prior to fully stabilizing. This would account for why under some circumstances, our oxygen content of the water went up after 5 minutes. In order to further this study I would like to test an array of temperatures rather than just the two that were tested. This could lead to a study examining the extent to which the specific metabolic rate of a Procambarus sp. changes over a gradient giving insight to a possible trend.
