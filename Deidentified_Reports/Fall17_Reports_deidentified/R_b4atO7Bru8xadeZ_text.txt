Title: Chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea and an Increase in Photosynthesis in Blue, Red and White Light

Abstract:
In this lab we looked at how the different shades of light of blue, red and white affected the results of photosynthesis. Blue, white, and red light show different wavelengths and represent different types of environments for plants and photosynthesis. We extracted chloroplast from spinach, Spinacia oleracea and then looked at how DCPIP would reduce and change from a blue color to a clear color in order to see how our chloroplasts completed photosynthesis in the their experimental conditions. We hypothesized that white light will produce the highest amount of photosynthesis and lowest absorbance over time while the red light will produce the lowest amount of photosynthesis and highest absorbance over time. Our results supported this showing an overall decrease in absorption over the thirty minute period with white light showing the highest decrease in absorbance and red light showing the lowest decrease in absorbance.

Introduction:
	The way that plants primarily capture energy is through the processes of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis happens in the chloroplast an organelle of plants cells. In this lab we looked at the how chloroplasts went through the photosynthetic processes under different colors of light which have different wavelengths. The way that photosynthesis works is through different reactions and processes. There are three different steps for reactions. The first two steps are a part of the light dependant reactions and the last step is part of the light independent reactions. We chose to evaluate the light-dependant reactions by changing the important contributing factor of light. The light-dependent reactions is where electrons are excited by light and this creates the reduced form of NADPH which leads to a proton gradient that then drives ATP synthesis. The light-dependant reactions are separated into photosystem I and photosystem II. In photosystem II two electrons that are excited by light leave the chlorophyll and go to plastoquinone. Then water is split to make oxygen and electrons that then restore the previously lost electrons. The hydrogen ions then create the proton gradient that is needed to drive ATP synthesis. In photosystem I light energy excites electrons that then make NAD+ reduced to NADPH. We chose to look at the light-dependant reactions for our experiment because light plays an important role in exciting the electrons. For this lab we tested light filtered with the colors of  blue and red, and then one group that had no filter so white light on the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea, spinach leaves. We chose to look at blue light which has the wavelength of 450–495 nm and red light which has the wavelength of 620–750 nm, because they are on different ends of the electromagnetic spectrum and we hypothesized their results would show different excitations of the electrons due to their different wavelengths. We used white light as well because without a filter it would mimic the light of the sun, or the light of the chloroplasts under typical growing conditions. In studies shown with growth in red and blue light, the blue light was shown to have been a better growing environment compared to the red light, showing that the optimal photosynthetic and plant environment close to sunlight was blue light [Brown:1995]. We were able to measure the photosynthetic rates by using the hill reaction. The hill reaction is represented through water and an electron acceptor with chloroplasts and the addition of light to produce a reduced version of the acceptor and oxygen. This reaction is indicative of photosynthesis because it shows how well the redox reaction completed. The electron acceptor we used was DCPIP. If the DCPIP was reduced then it changes color from its dark blue color to a clearer color. Therefore, if the photosynthetic reaction went through then the color would change and the absorbance would decrease. Measuring the absorbance allows us to see how much our photosynthetic reactions would go through. We hypothesized that white light will produce fastest rate of photosynthesis and lowest absorbance over time while the red light will produce the lowest rate of photosynthesis and highest absorbance over time. 

Materials and Methods:
We removed the veins of four spinach leaves then rinsed and dried them. We then ground them up with a cool mortar and pestle and added 20 ml of cold grinding buffer, 400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8, to make a paste that we filtered through cheesecloth. We next wanted to access the chloroplast so we created a pellet of the spinach leaves by centrifuging the filtered material two times. We centrifuged it first at 200 times the force of gravity 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for three minutes. We then poured the supernatant, but not the pellet, out of that tube and transferred it to a clean one to then centrifuge a second time at 2800rpm for ten minutes. We next took the liquid out of that tube and collected the pellet at the bottom. Adding 20 ml of the grinding buffer to the pellet at the bottom we mixed it together and that was the sample of chloroplast we used. In thirteen tubes we prepared one blank tube to use as our control with just  8 ml of water and 2ml of reaction buffer, 100mM phosphate pH 6.5. We then created 4 groups of data. One group was a set of three tubes that contained no chloroplasts and we tested this group which one tube in each color of light, this tube contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. The tubes without the chloroplasts were to act as a part of our control to show how the absorbance of DCPIP changed over time. Our next 9 tubes all contained 100 microliters of chloroplasts,  6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer, and three of these tubes were placed in each color of light for testing. We mixed all the tubes before blanking the spectrophotometer at 600nm with our blank tube and then measured each tube’s absorbance to get an initial reading of the absorbance before our light exposure. We then put all the tubes in their corresponding light (red, blue or white) for a total of thirty minutes and stopped to measure their absorbance rates in ten minute intervals. We then used the statistical test of ANOVA to find out the significance between the different averages of the absorbance after thirty minutes. 

Results:
We saw an overall trend of decrease in absorbance and percent change of absorbance over the thirty minutes and at each interval. Our statistical results were calculated through the absorbance at the end of thirty minutes for each of the different wavelengths. Our data showed that the white light had the lowest absorbance and an average of 0.046, the blue light had the absorbance average of 0.65 and our red light had the highest average of 0.102. Our control group with no chloroplast did not show a significant decrease in our absorbance, it showed a decrease average of -1.6%. Our p-value for the experimental group was 0.126, showing that the difference between each of the absorbance averages was not significant. The Tukey-Kramer test also showed that the differences between blue and red, blue and white, and red and white were not significant. 


Discussion:
In this lab our results supported our hypothesis because we saw a decrease in the absorbances for all the groups, but the lowest absorbance for the white light with an average of 0.046. This means that the photosynthetic reaction was able to go through more fully than the other light colors because we saw our DCPIP getting reduced. The red light was the light that showed the highest absorption with an average of 0.102 so that means that it did not fully go through the photosynthetic reaction as fast or complete as the white and blue light did.  However, our statistical data did not show a significance in the data that we obtained because it was greater than 0.05. Also the Tukey-Kramer test did not show any significance from the values at the end of the thirty minutes. This represents that while our data did reflect the absorbance changes that we predicted, the changes were not statistically significant.  In another study that tested results of red and blue light they found that blue light had the highest absorption rates and that it mimicked the light of the sun giving the highest photosynthetic rates, and that red light showed the lowest [Hogewoning: 2010]. We did not have any known sources of error in our procedure. In the future, it would be interesting to try all colors of the electromagnetic spectrum in filters in order to see how the different wavelengths of all the light affect the photosynthetic rates. It would also be beneficial to leave the samples in light for a longer period of time in order to possibly see some more differences and if this could lead them to being statistically significant. This experiment showed that light plays an important role in the processes of photosynthesis and how it relates to plants going through the processes and reactions. In order for plants to go through photosynthesis, a necessary processes to harvest energy and grow, they must be in optimal light. This can be shown through a study examining the light in the forest comparing the photosynthetic rates of the plants on the top which is similar to blue light and the light at the bottom of the forest floor, which is similar to red light because not a lot of light can travel through the other plants to reach the bottom. The study results showed that the light quality affected the light response and that blue light promotes the photosynthetic activity [Bukhov: 1995]. The ideal growing and photosynthetic conditions is in bright white light, or blue light in order to go through the photosynthetic reactions.
