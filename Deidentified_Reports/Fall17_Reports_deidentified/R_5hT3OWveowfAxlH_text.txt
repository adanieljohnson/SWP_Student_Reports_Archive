Title:  Ca2+ channel activator 100mM A23187 increases the duration of muscle contraction in a Rania Pipiens leg

Abstract:
In this study, the effect of a Ca2+ channel activator on the muscle contraction mechanism of a frog leg was measured. It was hypothesized that the injecting this activator would cause the same number of contractions, but that the contractions would last for a longer period of time. The Achilles tendon was cut and the gastrocnemus was held above at a right angle to the rest of the leg, as the Achilles tendon attached to it was secured on a sensor by a string secured to a hook. Five individual stimulations were applied to the sciatic nerve in the frog leg without the experimental fluid loaded. The length of contractile periods and total time were determined using a myogram. The average time of each pulse after the activator fluid was loaded, as well as the average total time for each stimulation, were for a majority of the legs significently less than the baseline average times of each leg. The results disproved the hypothesis with a P value of 0.582635 for the length of the contractile period, and 0.852101 for the total time. 

Introduction:
An action potential is characterized by the depolarization of the neuron axon from rapid Na+ ion influx, followed by K+ ion efflux. Skeletal muscles are innervated by the axons of motor neurons, which release acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction when an action potential is fired. Ach binds with its receptor on the muscle fiber membrane and the opening of sodium channel leads to depolarization in the t-tubules of the muscle cell. Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber. The muscle contraction stops when acetylcholinesterase is released and rapidly breaks down Ach so that it does not over-stimulate post-synaptic nerves, muscles, and exocrine glands (Johnson:53).
        	The purpose of this experiment is to discover the effect of a Ca2+ channel activator (100mM A23187) on the length of the contractile period of the gastrocnemus muscle contraction in a Rania Pipiens frog. The frog is a good model organism because of its size as well as how easy it is to locate the sciatic nerve in the leg. Based on knowledge of the properties of neuromuscular controlll and a case study discussing the identification of a caffeine-induced Ca2+ influx pathway in rat primary sensory neurons, it is predicted that if a Ca2+ channel activator is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle, the length of each contraction will significently increase because more Ca2+ is available to activate the contractile mechanism of each myofibril. Caffeine, which has a similar effect as a calcium channel activator, elicits a calcium transient by causing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum and by triggering Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane . In this experiment it was found that the Ca2+ influx pathway acted through a non-selective cationic channel and that there was a change in reactions to stimuli in the presence of more open calcium channels [Daher:2009]. Therefore, using a Ca2+ channel activator (100mM A23187) should produce a normal amount of contractions of the Gastrocnemius muscle lasting longer than those in a normal leg. From the change in contractions and timing, the change in calcium ion channels will be explored.

Materials and Method:
Students removed the skin from the leg of the Rania Pipiens frog, moistened the leg with Ringer’s solution, and separated the inner thigh muscles, revealing the white sciatic nerve and various blood vessels. The nerve was gently separated, and the tissues were kept moist with Ringer’s solution (Johnson:55). Using the stimulator box, the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle were stimulated with the minimum voltage necessary to elicit a response, the threshold which was found, and a voltage for maximal contraction. The Achilles tendon was cut and the gastrocnemus was held above and at a right angle to the rest of the leg, as the Achilles tendon attached to it was secured on the myogram sensor by a string secured to a hook.
The voltage setting was set to the threshold stimulus. One single stimulation consisting of five pulses was applied to the frog leg without the Ca2+ channel activator fluid loaded. The length of time of each contraction in the myogram was recorded as well as the total stimulation time, and the averages were determined. The gastrocnemus muscle was then injected at various sites with 0.1 Ml of a Ca2+ channel activator. After about 30 seconds, one stimulation consisting of five pulses was applied to the frog leg, and the time of each contraction was recorded. The average time of the contractile period and total time were compared to that of those times before the Ca2+ channel activator fluid was injected into the leg. This process was repeated twice more on additional frog legs. A paired t test was run to determine how statistically significent the difference between the length of time of the contractile period and total time was both before and after the Ca2+ channel activator was loaded.


Results:
Figure 1. This data shows the effect of Ca2+ channel activator on the time of the contractile periods of legs 1, 2, and 3. The baseline time is shown by the blue bars, while the length after the injection is represented by the orange.

Figure 2. This data shows the effect of Ca2+ channel activator on the total time of stimulation of legs 1, 2, and 3. The baseline time is shown by the blue bars, while the length after the injection is represented by the orange.

The data shows that the experimental treatment did not have a significent effect. The average controlll contractile time was 82.8 seconds in Leg 1, 133.4 seconds in Leg 2, and 121.4 seconds in Leg 3 (Table 2 and Figure 2). After the Ca2+ channel activator was injected, the average contractile times of Leg 1, 2, and 3 were 94.2, 116.6, and 93.6 respectively (t=0.649519, p=0.582635). The average controlll total time was 344 seconds in Leg 1, 772.4 seconds in Leg 2, and 622.8 seconds in Leg 3 (Table 1 and Figure 1). After the Ca2+ channel activator was injected, the average total times of Leg 1, 2, and 3 were 587.4, 670.67, and 563.4 respectively (t=0.211487, p=0.852101). The Ca2+ channel activator overall decreased contractile period time. This shows that the treatment did have a significent effect.


Discussion:
The hypothesis that the injection of 100mM A23187, a Ca2+ channel activator, in a frog leg will maintain the number of contractions and significently increase the length of contractions was rejected in this experiment. The Ca2+ channel activator leads to an increase in Ca2+ entry, which allows Ca2+ to serve as an intracellular messenger (Katz: 1986). Calcium triggers contraction by reaction with regulatory proteins that in the absence of calcium prevent interaction of actin and myosin (Szent-Györgyi: 1975), which decreases the amount crossbridges that can form, weakening the contraction. The specific myofibril contractile elements determine the functional character of the skeletal muscles and therefore whole-body performance. This experiment was possibly limited by the injection of the fluid and by the wait time after injection. Maybe fluid should have been loaded in smaller increments in different locations throughout the muscle, especially towards the top, so that it would have spread through the entire muscle more easily. Additionally, the wait time should have been monitored more carefully to ensure that more than 45 seconds did not pass before stimulation. In further studies, the effect of different amounts of 100 mM A23187 Ca2+ channel activator should be tested. It would be interesting to determine how much would be necessary to have a significent effect on the length of contractions or to observe the amplitude of contractions rather than the timing. In conclusion, this study was not effective because a significent difference between the controlll and experimental data was not found.
