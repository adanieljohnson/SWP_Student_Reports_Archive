Title: Effects of nicotine on the amplitude of Rana pipien gastrocnemius muscle contraction

Abstract:
This experiment focused on how amplitude values of Rana pipien gastrocnemius muscle contractions would change in response to an injection of 1 ml of nicotine. It was hypothesized that injecting nicotine into the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle would increase the amplitude of contractions. This was due in large part to the fact that nicotine is an ACh agonist, the primary chemical that initiates muscle contractions. Three frog legs were connected to an iWorks machine and underwent stimulation of the sciatic nerve. After 5 pulses the legs were injected with nicotine and then stimulated again. It was found that amplitude did increase significantly after the nicotine injection. The mean of each leg’s preinjection amplitudes and post injection amplitudes were found. Leg 1 showed an averaged difference 1.0978 between both stages. This was the greatest increase. Leg 3 had the smallest difference between stages with a close value of 0.9222, and leg 2 had an average difference of 0.9874. Furthermore, conducting a paired-t-test revealed that for every leg P>0.05 (0.05 being the predetermined α), displaying clearly that mean amplitude is greater post-injection. Therefore, it can be said that nicotine can help increase amplitude of muscle contractions.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle is at the basis of all movement. It is comprised of numerous muscle fibers containing structures that cause contraction. These subunits, called sarcomeres, are activated by a process that begins with acetylcholine. A neuron, containing acetylcholine (ACh), releases the chemical onto the membrane of the muscle fiber. This initiates a release of sodium from Na channels, generating an action potential (AP). The AP activates a release of calcium, causing sarcomeres (the contracting structures of muscle fibers) to shorten. From this, the importance of acetylcholine in muscle contraction is made evident. Studies, like that of T.M. Egan and R.A. North, have observed the effects of the ACh agonist, nicotine, on muscle fiber.Nicotine, and ACh agonist as previously mentioned, acts the same as ACh. In Egan and North’s study, they tested the effects of ACh and nicotine on rat locus coeruleus neurons. They found that “nicotine depolarized locus coeruleus neurons and increased the rate of action potential discharge”[Egan,North: 1986]. In addition, they found that ACh and nicotine “caused a net inward current”[Egan,North: 1986]. 
In this experiment, the effects of nicotine on directly stimulated Rana pipien (frog) leg muscles will be observed and recorded. The independent variables are the level of voltage applied to the Rana pipien legs and the amount of nicotine injected into the legs. The dependent variables are the amplitude values recorded during stimulation of the pre-nicotine injected legs and the post-injected legs. Based on my understanding of muscle contractions as well as Egan and North’s findings that nicotine raises the rate of action potential discharge, my hypothesis is that injecting nicotine into the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle will increase the amplitude of contractions.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, place three frog legs on a specialized tray. Remove the skin from all three legs using your hands. Peel back the muscle to expose the sciatic nerve and attach a BNC connector to the nerve. Cut along the tendon of the muscle and tie a string loop to the exposed tendon on each leg. Be sure to keep the legs moist with Ringer’s solution. After placing the loop onto the hook of the iWorks system and securing the muscle to the tray, insert the wires into the muscle. Using iWorks to measure and stimulate, apply a voltage of 0.1V for 5 pulses and then, without stopping the reading, inject the leg with 1 ml of nicotine. Observe any changes and wait for the muscle to return to a resting value. Apply 5 pulses at 0.1V to the leg once again. Do this for all three Rana pipien legs. Use a paired t-test to compare the results of each leg.

Results:
There was a clear growth in amplitude values between the legs pre-injection and post-injection. In the first leg, the average signal amplitude pre-injection was 0.3152 volts whereas the average signal amplitude post injection was 1.413.
This is a difference of 1.0978. In the second leg, the average amplitude pre-injection was 0.0996 and the average amplitude post injection was 1.087, a difference of 0.9874. Finally, the third leg showed a difference of 0.9222 between the average pre-injection amplitude, 0.3562, and the average post-injection amplitude, 1.2784. Amplitude values in all trials remained in a similar range with no prominent outliers. A paired sample-t-test was conducted to compare the amplitude values in nicotine and no nicotine conditions. The mean amplitude of the leg 1 contractions after nicotine was substantially greater than the mean amplitude before (t-value=147.7, α=0.05, P=1.26, df=4).The same can be said for leg 2 (t-value=91.1, α=0.05, P=8.70, df=4) and leg 3 (t-value=357.88, α=0.05, P=3.66, df=4). The following graphs show the average pre-injection amplitudes and average post injection amplitudes for each leg. The standard deviation for each is indicated by the error bars.


Discussion:
The results of this experiment supported the original hypothesis that nicotine will increase the amplitude of Rana pipien leg muscle contractions. The data collected showed that in every leg there was an average amplitude increase greater than 0.9. Conducting a paired t-test further supported the hypothesis because for each leg P>0.05, showing that in every case the mean amplitude pre-injection was less than the mean amplitude post-injection. These results were highly expected based on the previously known functions of neurons and skeletal muscles. Because nicotine is an ACh agonist, the most important neurotransmitter in the process of skeletal muscle contraction, it was expected that its injections would heighten the effects of ACh during contractions and therefore produce a stronger output amplitude. In addition, T.M Egan and R.A. North’s findings that nicotine increases the rate of action potential discharge supports the findings in this experiments that nicotine caused the increase in amplitude of muscle contractions. A limitation of this experiment was that electric charges in the iWorks system sometimes acted on the legs prior to recording data. This instituted electric charges in the legs that affect the accuracy of data. An opportunity for further research is using an antagonist, such as a calcium channel blocker, as well as nicotine in order to compare amplitude results.
