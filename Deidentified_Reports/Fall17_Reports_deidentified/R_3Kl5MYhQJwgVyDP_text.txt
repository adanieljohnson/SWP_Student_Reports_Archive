Title: Investigation of Shelter's effects on Betta Fish Aggression

Abstract:
There was a limited amount of papers focusing on shelter's effects on betta fish's behaviors within the field. So, in this experiment, shelter's effect on betta fish's aggressive behavior is investigated. The aggressiveness was quantified as the time of the fish showing each kind of agnostic behavior and the time was recorded for later calculation. It was shown that there was a decrease in the aggressiveness of the fish when it occupied the shelter. However, other factors, such as habituation and getting tired may lead the result to be like this also.


Introduction:
The Siamese Fighting fish (Betta Splendens) have evolutionarily developed certain aggressive behaviors that allow them to compete for limited resources such as potential mates, food, and shelters. This is because behaving aggressively may change Betta Fish's future reproductive success[Ribi et al. :1999]. It is known that there are many environmental factors that alter the aggressive behaviors of the species, such as the amount of Mercury Chloride [Mansur et al. : 2012] and UV filter benzophenone-3 in the water[Chen et al. : 2016], as well as the presence of food and shelter[Capelli and Hamilton: 1984]. In this experiment, the effects of shelter on the aggressive behaviors of betta fish will be examined particularly. It is known by a similar study that the increase of shelter will largely reduce the competitive behaviors in other aquatic species because the individual that occupies the shelter tend to stay in it and avoid contact with others[Capelli and Hamilton: 1984]. Based on this experiment, it is hypothesized that the presence of shelter will also reduce the agonistic behaviors of betta fighting fish. 

Materials and Methods:
Firstly, the aquarium was filled with water and two compartments were created by a glass and an opaque barrier was put between the two chambers. Two male betta fish were then put into the chambers separately. We removed the opaque material between the two chambers and started our experiment without using the shelter at first. We picked one fish and each person in the group observed one specific agonistic behavior and the aggressiveness of the behaviors of betta fish was quantified as the time(in seconds) taken for the fish to perform each particular behavior. In the experiment, only 4 agonistic behaviors were considered: pelvic flickering, tail flashing(broadside movements), pectoral fins erecting, and red mane(facing movements)[Simpson: 1968]. We recorded the time of the fish performing each behavior within a 5-minute interval with a timer. We let both fish rest for 3 minutes and repeated the procedure for two more times. Then, we put the shelter with the previously observed fish. We waited for 2-3 minutes to let the betta fish adapted to the shelter, and we continued our experiment and repeated the same steps. We collected the data and times 3 for the results we got for tail flashing and red mane because they had the highest rank of aggressiveness among each group. Two sampled T-Test (0.05 was used as the critical value) was later performed to test if there was a significant difference between the group without the shelter and the group with the shelter.


Results:

A two Sampled T-Test analysis showed us that the control group displayed more aggressive behavior compared to the experimental group. Error bars are ± s.ds of the mean values. (t-value=4.07, d.f.=4, p-value=0.015) 


Discussion:
Our results from this experiment showed us that our prediction was supported. We hypothesized that betta fish that had no shelter would display agnostic behaviors for a longer duration compared to betta fish with the shelter. Because occupying the shelter usually means that the fish has already ensured itself to have a potentially higher fitness than others as it usually has better protection for the predators when in the shelter. So, in this condition, it is not necessary for the fish to display aggressive behaviors to the other fish, as behaving aggressively will cost the fish a lot of energy and even cause damages to the fish itself. It saves this energy for future use, such as reproduction or other intraspecific events[Fero and Moore: 2014]. However, there may still be a potential that this result is caused by habituation. Habituation is the process that the species adapts to the environmental stimulus and shows a decreasing response to this stimulus. Habituation may lead the betta fish to show a decreasing response, which means showing less aggressive behaviors in this circumstance, to the other fish[Clayton and Hinde: 1967]. Also, fish could also get tired easily throughout the experiment even when it was given time to rest between each trial, because performing both broadside and facing movements was known to be highly costly in energy[Castro: 2006]. What's more, there was relatively high standard deviation among the data obtained. They might be caused by some inconsistent experimental procedures. For example, when we were recording the duration times of the fish performing each behavior, there might be a difference between the recorded data and the actual time the fish displayed that behavior. In all, our experiment couldn't show the effects of shelter on betta fish's agnostic behaviors because it was highly possible that habituation took place when the experiment went on and thus affect the final result we got. Future studies should give more time for betta fish to rest between each trial and repeat the experiment for more times in order to reduce the effects of habituation and tiredness on the result and help us better understand the effects of shelter on altering the aggressive behaviors of betta fish, thus on the fitness of the species.
