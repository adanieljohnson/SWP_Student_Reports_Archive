Title: The effects of changes in humidity on allocation of resources in Raphanus sativus.

Abstract:
This experiment explores the effects of humidity on the resource allocation of Raphanus sativus, more widely known as radishes. Resource allocation is calculated through measuring the root-to-shoot ratio of the plants. For this lab, we investigated the root-to-shoot ratio in R. sativus plants when placed in high humidity environments versus low humidity environments. We hypothesized that R. sativus plants grown in the high humidity environment will have a lower root-to-shoot ratio than the R. sativus plants grown in the low humidity environment. To find the root-to shoot ratios, we measured the weight of the total R. sativus plant (in grams), then we measured the length of the shoots and roots (in millimeters) and the weight of the shoots and roots (in grams) in each environment. From the experiment, we found that there was no significant difference between root-to-shoot ratios of the R. sativus plants grown in the low humidity environment versus the high humidity environment. Even though no significant difference was determined, our observations revealed that resource allocation still could be occurring. The R. sativus plants grown in the low humidity environment, by observation, dedicated more biomass to their roots. 


Introduction:
Within the environment, it is important that a plant adapts and develops an effective form of allocating resources. Resource allocation refers to the process in which a species distributes it resources in order to increase its ability to reproduce and grow. [Johnson: 2017] Some plants may form different phenotypic expressions in order to best fit their environment and receive their resources more effectively. When a plant expends energy, there is considered to be a “trade-off”; therefore, it is important that a plant finds the most successful way to allocate resources. Plants will typically invest more biomass into aboveground or belowground parts, depending on where the most limiting resource is located [Rosenvald: 2014]. For example, if a plant is exposed to an environment of high humidity, then it may not require an extensive root system. Whereas, if the plant lacked the availability of water, then it may be in need of longer, more complex roots. An effective way to measure resource allocation in plants is through root-to-shoot ratios of the biomass of the plant. This differentiation in phenotype can be distinguished in Raphanus sativus, radishes, when they are set in environments of different levels of humidity. With growing climate change as a prevalent issue, it is important to understand the effects of humidity levels on plant species. Climate change can have extreme effects on plant species; therefore, it is vital that researchers understand how plants can adapt to changes in humidity levels. By investigating these changes in humidity, scientists can see how plants will alter their phenotypic expressions for the allocation of resources.  For our experiment, we placed R. sativus plants in two differing environments: low humidity and high humidity. We predicted that if a R. sativus plant is raised in a high humidity environment, then it will have a lower root-to-shoot ratio than a R. sativus plant raised in a low humidity environment. 


Materials and Methods:
For our experiment, we obtained 120 R. sativus seeds and split them up into six pots. We planted 20 R. sativus seeds in 4 rows of 5 in approximately four inches of vermiculite. Of the six pots, three were placed in an air-tight aquarium. The other three pots were placed in another air-tight aquarium, but this aquarium had the pots sitting on stilts, and the base of the aquarium was filled with about two inches of water in order to simulate the high humidity environment. The water level of the aquarium was marked, and kept constant throughout the experiment. The plants were then watered each day for a week. Once the plants were watered in the greenhouse for a week, they were taken out of the vermiculite, washed, and prepared for measurement. We then selected five random plants from each of the three pots in both humidity environments. Each plant was measured as a whole, then the roots and shoots of each plant were measured and weighed. From the measured values, we selected the maximum root and shoot lengths from both the control group and experimental group. For the weight of the roots and shoots, we averaged the measured weights. After finding the lengths and averaged weight of each of the plants, we calculated the root-to-shoot ratios for the two differing environments, as well as their standard deviation. For our experiment, a two-tailed T-test was performed to find out if the data held statistical significance.


Results:
Our data revealed that R. sativus plants grown in high humidity environments will have a smaller root-to-shoot ratio than the R. sativus plants grown in a low humidity environment. In the high humidity environment, the average root-to-shoot weight ratio was 0.2183 +/- 0.0213 (in grams). Also within the high humidity environment, the average root-to-shoot length ratio was 1.0287 +/- 0.1225 (in mm). For the plants in the low humidity environment, the average root-to-shoot weight ratio was 0.2983 +/- 0.0716 (in grams), and an average root-to-shoot length ratio of 1.3226 +/- 0.2293 (in mm). To test for statistical significance, we used a one-tailed T-test to determine the difference between the two groups (t=1.8532 & t=1.9581, df= 2). From the one-tailed T-test, we found the P-value of the root-to-shoot weight ratio to be P= 0.1735, and the P-value of the root-to-shoot length ratio to be P= 0.1218. The root-to-shoot ratios between the low humidity and high humidity environments are displayed in Figure 1.   

Discussion:
At the conclusion of our experiment and analysis of our statistical tests, we found that by observation our hypothesis was supported; but, our statistical test revealed that our data was insignificant. Although a significant difference was not determined between the two groups, resource allocation was still most likely occurring because there was an evident observable difference in the phenotypes of the R. sativus plants in the two separate environments.  Raphanus sativus plants in low humidity environments would generate a higher root biomass and length, as opposed to Raphanus sativus plants grown in high humidity environments. This analysis was determined through the comparison of the root-to-shoot ratios between the two groups of experimentation. The low humidity group had a root-to-shoot length ratio of 1.3226, and the high humidity group had a root-to-shoot length ratio of 1.287.  So, therefore, the radishes of the low humidity group would generate much more biomass towards their roots, in order to receive water, and the radishes of the high humidity group would allocate more biomass in the shoots, because water is readily available in the humid air. In nature, plants are always trying to be more efficient when it comes to energy expulsion. We found that the R. sativus plants in the high humidity would overcompensate their aboveground parts, in order to perform at their highest fitness within the environment.  Another study analyzing the effects of high air humidity on the growth and morphology of temperate forest herbs, found that woodland herbs would require high humidity environments in order to increase their reproductive success and survivorship [Lendzion: 2009]. This study ultimately revealed how temperate forest herbs will allocate biomass towards their roots when placed in drier climates. Although our results were statistically insignificant, we observed that the R. sativus plants, when placed in the low humidity environment, would allocate for more resources through their roots.   Sources of error within our experiment may include failure to fully isolate all of the humidity within the environment, and also the possibility of the radishes growing differently due to their location and access to sunlight within the greenhouse. The overall purpose of our lab was to determine how plants can alter their phenotypic expression in order to be most effective when it comes to resource allocation. From this experiment, a future study could incorporate the idea of resource allocation into understanding why some plants are more effectively grown in certain environments, versus others. Also, these results can serve help to understand the effects of humidity on the growth of plants. Overall, understanding the pattern in which plants allocate resources can allow scientists to see how plants will change phenotypes in order to increase fecundity and their overall fitness.
