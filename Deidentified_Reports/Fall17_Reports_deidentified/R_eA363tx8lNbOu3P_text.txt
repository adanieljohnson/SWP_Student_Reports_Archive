Title: Differences in metabolic rate for Procambris spp. while in varying temperatures of water

Abstract:
In this experiment, we worked with Procambris spp. and measured each of their specific metabolic rates by using different water temperatures. The amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed and the amount of carbon dioxide excreted. We used room temperature water (22C) and cooler water (10C) to see how the difference in temperature would affect the metabolic rates of Procambris spp. where we used a testing chamber and a probe to measure the dissolved oxygen. We believed that the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. would decrease if the temperature of water decreased. However, our hypothesis was not supported because Procambris spp. that was in the cooler water actually had an increase in their metabolic rate. Our experiment had 2 degrees of freedom, a t-value of 8.1362 and a p_value of 0.0148. Since our hypothesis was not supported and the specific metabolic rates were significently higher in the experimental group, we have concluded that stress from the cold water may have played a factor in the rise of the specific metabolic rates of the experimental group.


Introduction:
Metabolic rate is the process where energy and materials are transformed within an organism and then exchanged between the organism and its environment [Gillooly: 2001]. In this experiment, we measured the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. We used Procambris spp. for this experiment because they are easy to calculate oxygen consumption with which makes noticeable changes on the probe machine. The amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed and the amount of carbon dioxide excreted [Johnson: 2017]. We measured each Procambris spp. metabolic rate in two different temperatures which included room temperature (22C) and cooler water (10C). We wanted to know how lower temperatures will impact the specific metabolic rate of each Procambris spp. By reading through our textbook, we believed that the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. will decrease if the water temperature decreases as it states, the warmer the water is, the less O2 there is [Sadava: 2017]. 


Materials and Method:
We first weighed each Procambris spp. then filled up a screw top glass testing chamber with room temperature water (22C) and then placed Procambris spp. into the testing chamber. Then we placed the entire tank set-up into a dishpan filled with room temperature water. Next we inserted the oxygen probe into the top of the testing chamber which measures the dissolved oxygen concentration. We then turned on the oxygen probe machine to stabilize the readings and we took a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Every 5 minutes, another dissolved oxygen concentration reading was conducted and recorded for a total of 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes has elapsed, we recorded the dissolved oxygen concentration and remove the probe from the testing chamber. To measure the volume of water that was in the testing chamber, we poured the water through a funnel and into a graduated cylinder and record the volume. After all the data has been recorded, we repeated these method for all 3 Procambris spp. Then, for the experimental group, we filled up the screw top glass testing chamber with room temperature water and then placed the testing chamber into an incubator full of cooler water (10C). We waited two minutes for the Procambris spp. to get acclimated to the difference in water temperature. We repeated all of the same method as we did for the controlll group that was in room temperature water. Once all the data was gathered, we used a paired t test to show our results.


Results:
The test that we conducted for this experiment was on finding the amount of oxygen consumed by each Procambris spp. and then calculating the specific metabolic rate for each. In the controlll group, controlll 1 had a specific metabolic rate of 0.00087, controlll 2 was at 0.0021 and controlll 3 was at 0.0011. The standard deviation between the controlll group was 0.00065 and the mean was 0.0014. In the experimental group, experimental 1 had a specific metabolic rate of 0.0045, experimental 2 was at 0.0077 and experimental 3 was at 0.0061. The standard deviation between the experimental group was 0.0016 and the mean was 0.0061. From Figure 1, you can tell how the controlll group had a smaller metabolic rate than the experimental group did. Each Procambris spp. in our experimental group had a larger specific metabolic rate than the controlll group had. From our data we were able to find the degrees of freedom, t_statistic and the p_value. The degrees of freedom were at the value of 2, the p_value was 0.0148 and the t_statistic value was at 8.14.


Discussion:
For this experiment we were able to find the specific metabolic for both the experimental and controlll group by using a dissolved oxygen probe that was hooked up to a dissolved oxygen reader. We believed that the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris spp. would decrease as the water temperature decreased because usually as the water temperature rises, an ectotherm’s body temperature and metabolic rate rise making the water breathers need more O2 as the water gets warmer [Sadava: 2017]. However, from our findings in this experiment, we can say that our results did not support our hypothesis. We found that the experimental group actually had a higher specific metabolic rate. The sudden decrease in temperature caused the stress levels of Procambris spp. to increase. The increase in stress level in the experimental group may have caused the oxygen consumption to increase thus, causing the specific metabolic rate to increase as well. A possible source of error that came about was the fact that we may have not given each Procambris spp. a sufficient amount of time to adapt to the cooler water temperature. In another experiment in measuring oxygen consumption, the people that conducted the experiment gave each crayfish twenty to thirty minutes to let the animal adjust to the different temperature in water [Wiens: 1961]. This extra time could have been useful and could have made our data change due to the fact that Procambris spp. could have potential have time to adapt to the difference in water temperature. It could have also possibly changed our results if we gave them this extra time. Also, having a larger group of Procambris spp. would have made our results more conclusive since we would have had more specific metabolic rates to discuss. Even though there were some possible errors made during the experiment, our results were significent with our p_value being at 0.0148. As for relation to the real world, global warming is upon us and those that live in the ocean, particularly ectotherms. Environmental temperature is very important for ectotherms because their body temperature change with the temperature of their environment which causes their physiological and biochemical reactions to change from how they normally act [Sokolova: 2008]. This information correlates with our experiment where Procambris spp. in the cooler temperature water had higher metabolic rates compared to Procambris spp. in room temperature water. If the temperatures of the water start changing for the ectotherms and other animals in the water, their stress levels will become very high which will affect their normal functions. The temperature of ectotherms surroundings does impact their metabolic rates and also produces stress which would give us the reason as to why Procambris spp. metabolic rate when up when the temperature of their surroundings changed [Sokolova: 2008].
