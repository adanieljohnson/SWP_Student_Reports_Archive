Title: The Effect of an Increase in Salinity on Metabolic Rate of Procambarus Sp.

Abstract:
	When the environmental salinity increases, organisms need to spend more energy to pump excessive ions out of their body to maintain a stable internal condition, and thus, results in a higher metabolic rate. This study focuses on the effect of such an increase in salinity on the metabolic rate of Procambarus Sp., a kind of crayfish, with the null hypothesis that there will be no significant difference in the metabolic rate when the salinity increases, while a significant difference is expected. In the experiment, the crayfish are randomly assigned into the control group and the treatment group, which is treated by NaCl solution of 6.5% concentration, and the specific metabolic rate for each will be calculated with the measurement of the weights. The resultant P-value is 0.785848, which is larger than the critical value α, 0.05. Therefore, there is no sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Introduction:
	Metabolism is an important process for almost all organisms, including plants and animals. Metabolism is a process of the conversion of glucose to energy. In the series of reactions of metabolism, oxygen (O2) and sugar will be consumed while carbon dioxide (CO2) will be produced as the results as well as the production of high-energy electrons. Those electrons will be transformed through electron transport chain to give off energy to power the hydrogen pumps to actively transport hydrogen ions against the concentration gradient in the mitochondria. Then, those protons will flow through ATP synthase, driven by its concentration gradient. As a result, ADP will be converted to ATP, an important energy currency.
	Metabolic rate may vary due to a lot of reasons, mostly environmental factors like temperature, Ph, salinity, and so on. In this study, the relationship between metabolic rate and salinity will be examined by using crayfish, procambarus sp., an ectothermic animal, as it will be easier and more controllable when changing the salinity while keeping other confounding variables stay constant. 
	The conclusions on the effect of salinity change on the metabolism of certain organisms vary from species to species. Rosas et al. indicated that an increase in salinity will lead to an increase in metabolic rate of Litopenaens vannamei [2001]. However, other studies conclude that the correlation doesn’t seem to exist [Swanson: 1998]. The purpose of this study is to examine if this kind of statistical relationship exists in crayfish.
	It is hypnotized that an increase in salinity will result in an increase in metabolic rate because more energy should be spent to maintain the osmotic balance of the crayfish; in other words, those crayfish need to actively transport the excessive ions flowed into their bodies. Thus, the null hypothesis of this experiment is that a rise in salinity will not have a significant influence on the crayfish metabolic rate, while the alternative hypothesis is that a rise in salinity will significantly increase crayfish metabolic rate, which is expected.



Materials and Methods:
	The crayfish’s metabolic rate can be determined by measuring the amount of O2 consumed or the amount of CO2 produced. As mentioned before, O2 will be consumed and CO2 will be produced during the process of metabolism. Thus, the metabolic rate is proportional to the amount of O2 consumed, which will be measured in this study.
	The effect of salinity on crayfish’s metabolism is defined as the specific metabolic rate, which equals to ([∆O2×volume H2O])/(time×weight), where the change in the concentration of O2 is in mg/L, volume of water is in L, time is in minutes, and weight is in grams. The specific metabolic rate is based on a per gram scale, and this formula can be understood as the change of O2 in the water divided by the multiple of the time spends and the weight of the crayfish.
	The independent variable in this experiment is the salinity of the environment, which is quantified as the concentration of Na ions, and the dependent variable is the change of O2 concentration in water.
	In this experiment, 3 crayfish will be used to collect data; they will be labeled as #1, #2, and #3 before the experiments start. Water saturated with O2 at room temperature, which is around 22°C is prepared for all treatments use. The crayfish will be placed in a tank full of water with a salinity of 0%. The tank will be sealed and dissolved O2 probe will be put inside the tank, and the first reading will be taken after that. The time will be taken as 0 at the first reading, and readings will be taken after 20 minutes. Measure the volume of water in the tank by pouring them into a graduated cylinder every time after a treatment is done.
	After the completion of the first treatment, the crayfish will be placed into water with a salinity of 6.5% and same procedures are sued to collect the data. After the trails for the first crayfish, the rest two crayfish will have the same procedures done. Note that throughout the experiment, the water will be controlled to be at room temperature and water with a certain salinity will be prepared by dissolving NaCl into water, Record the amount of NaCl dissolved.
	A one-tailed paired t-test will be run to see if there is a significant difference between the metabolic rate of the crayfish when the salinity is 0% and when it is 6.5%, as each will serve as its own control.



Results:
	For crayfish #1 and #2, an increase in environmental salinity results in a decrease in their metabolic rate, while for crayfish #3, the result is the opposite. The resultant P-value of the t-test is 0.785848, with degree of freedom of 2, standard deviation of 0.364462207, t-value of 0.310049.

Discussion:
	The P-value, 0.785848 is much larger than the critical value α, 0.05; thus, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that an increase in salinity will not result in a significant change in crayfish metabolic rate. In other words, there is no significant difference between the metabolic rate of the control and that of the treatment.
	This result matches with the conclusion of Swanson’s study that there is not a certain correlation between the change in environmental salinity and the change in the metabolic rate of organisms [1998]. The hypothesis that the crayfish will need to spend more energy to pump those excessive ions out of the body in order to maintain their osmotic balance cannot be proved based on this experimental result, with only one crayfish shows such a trend. In this way, crayfish #3 can be considered as an outlier, but because of the small sample size, it is not possible to run an outlier test to exclude that data point. 
	From another perspective, crayfish #1 and #2 follows the trend concluded by Rosas that an increase in salinity will lead to a decrease in organism metabolic rate [2001]. The explanation by Rosas is that for Litopenaens vannamei, there is a kind of protective mechanism for that specific species so that the metabolic rate will decrease. This protective mechanism doesn’t necessarily apply to crayfish, or at least, there is currently no evidence to prove so. Thus, one possible explanation of the result of crayfish #1 and #2 is that Procambarus Sp. has a certain favorable environmental salinity, at which it doesn’t need to spend extra energy to regulate osmotic balance by pumping ions out of the body. In this case, their favorable salinity may be at somewhere between 0% and 6.5 %.
	However, due to the small number treatments done in the experiments, the results of either crayfish #1 and #2 or crayfish #3 can be caused by chance. In other words, crayfish #3 can be an extreme value that ruins the statistics, while the result of crayfish #1 and #2 can be caused by coincidence. One of the ways to answer this question is to increase the sample size; 3 is too small for a persuasive result. Therefore, for future studies, other than assuring a larger sample size, different salinity should be tested in addition to 0% and 6.5%. In this way, the theory of favorable environmental salinity can be tested. Also, different species of organisms from both fresh water and salt water can be examined so that the theory of pumping excessive ions out can be tested.
