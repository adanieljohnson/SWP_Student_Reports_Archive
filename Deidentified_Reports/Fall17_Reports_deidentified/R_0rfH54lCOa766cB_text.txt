Title: The effect of salinity concentration on metabolic rates of freshwater crayfish: Application of salt water results in a decrease of the metabolic rate in freshwater crayfish

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment is to determine the effects of salinity on the metabolic rates of freshwater crayfish. Metabolic rate measures how fast or slow the chemical processes of balancing energy, capturing, conversion, and transferring within in an organism occurs, so our goal was to see if adding salt to the crayfish’s environment would change that rate. We hypothesized that adding salt to the water would increase the metabolic rates of the crayfish. We added 100 ml of salt water to the test chamber with room temperature oxygenated water, placed the crayfish into the test chamber and measured the oxygen concentration in increments of 5 minutes up to 20 minutes. After running both control and experimental tests on three different crayfish, our results showed that the metabolic rates of the crayfish decreased in salt water when compared to freshwater. The statistical test run on this experiment deemed our results insignificant, however, because the p-value was so close to .05, it allowed us to conclude that our experiment and results were not completely inaccurate. 


Introduction:
Metabolism is the process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells or an organism. Therefore, metabolic rate is the rate at which metabolism occurs in a living organism. [Johnson 2016]  In addition to this, we also have to understand what cellular respiration and gas exchange are, as we will be monitoring the oxygen levels of the crayfish in salt water as well as freshwater. Because the crayfish are aquatic animals, they breathe through gills in the water. When water passes through the gills, the dissolved oxygen diffuses into the bloodstream of the crayfish. The carbon dioxide is then released from the bloodstream to the external water, leaving the crayfish’s body. The gas exchange occurs between the water, blood, and gills of the crayfish. [Johnson 2016] Oxygen sensors inside the body force the crayfish to ventilate faster if oxygen levels drop, which then causes more carbon dioxide to be released. In our specific experiment, where we will be testing how salinity levels affect the metabolic rates of freshwater crayfish, we will also account for other variables such as time, weight of crayfish, water volume, temperature of water, and change in dissolved oxygen. In another experiment we looked at, other variables such as water temperature were tested along with salinity levels. This showed that higher temperatures of water actually reduced growth and well being of the red claw crayfish. This demonstrated how different variables have different effects on the crayfish. [Meade 2002] For our experiment, we hypothesize that adding salt to the water will increase the metabolic rates of the crayfish, because the higher the salinity of the water, the harder the gills on the crayfish should have to work, leading to an increase in metabolic rate.


Materials and Methods:
The methods of this experiment started with the process of filling the glass testing chamber with oxygenated water at a temperature of 22 degrees celsius. When running the control test, nothing else was added to the water, but when running the experimental test, we added 100 ml of salt water into the glass testing chamber in addition to the 22 degree celsius oxygenated water. After filling the testing chamber with the water, we placed it into an empty plastic dishpan so that water wouldn’t leak on the table. We then took the crayfish out of its individual tank and weighed it, recording the weight in a table. The crayfish was then placed into the test chamber, the oxygen probe was inserted, and the top was placed on the test chamber tightly to close it. We then turned on the machine attached to the oxygen probe to get the baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration in the testing chamber. After recording that number, we then read the oxygen after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes and recorded the results. After the 20 minutes were done, we untwisted the top of the testing chamber, removed the oxygen probe, and poured the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder to see and record the total volume of water left in the chamber. We ran the control test first, and then repeated the test again on the same crayfish, adding 100 ml of salt water to the test chamber. We repeated this process 6 times, one control test and one experimental test for each of the three crayfish. After gathering all of our data, we recorded it on a google document and ran a paired T-test to determine whether or not our data was significant. 


Results:
For this experiment, the statistical test used was  a Paired T-Test. The test was run on the difference in the crayfish’s metabolism between salt and fresh water. Our P-value was .068428, our t-value was 3.623743, and our degrees of freedom was 2. We also calculated the salinity rates in the water for each crayfish, with the percentages ranging between .72 and .73 percent salinity. Figure 1 shows the average metabolic rates of crayfish in both fresh and salt water.


Discussion:
Overall, the data did not support our hypothesis. The metabolic rates demonstrate to be lower rather than higher in the salt water at room temperature. After running a statistical paired T-test, we determined that our results were insignificant, as our P-value was above alpha=.05.  Because our p-value was .068, our results are not completely unreliable, as it was very close to the significance level of .05. After doing some research, we determined that in salty water, there are more ions floating around. The crayfish actually conserves its energy rather than expends it by trying to maintain ions in its vacinity in fresh water like it is used to, which may have something to do with why we got the results we did. If we were to run the experiment again, we would use various salinity levels in order to see whether higher levels have a greater or different effect on the metabolic rates. In a study done by scientific researchers in Australia, the experiment demonstrated that high salinity levels in the ecosystem are becoming a potential problem for various organisms, as they are not used to the level of salt in their environment, and the scientists are unsure as to whether or not the organisms will be able to adapt. [Nielsen 2003] In addition to the varying levels of salinity, we would also work with a larger sample size of crayfish if we did the experiment again in order to get a more accurate representation of data for the population. In another study we looked at, salinity levels were coupled with other factors such as weight gain and growth efficiency/survival in addition to metabolic rates. Both weight gain and survival rates were lower in salt water climates than fresh water climates, which is an interesting idea that helps to connect our study to the surrounding environments of crayfish as well as other freshwater organisms[Rouse 1992]. This experiment helps us to understand how even small changes in an organism’s environment can have a big impact on its level of success and survival. External environments are constantly changing, so understanding how those changes affect the organisms living in them is very important for the successful future of our earth.
