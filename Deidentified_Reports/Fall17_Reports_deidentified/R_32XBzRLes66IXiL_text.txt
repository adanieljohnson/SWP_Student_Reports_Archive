Title: The Pharysum polycephalum’s lack of movement toward glucose with the activator, dibutyryl-cAMP

Abstract:
 Cells are an essential component to life to all living organisms. Cells need to communicate with their internal and external environment, they do this with cell signaling.   This study looked at the chemotaxis signaling pathway of Physarum polycephalum. The goal of this study was to see how the Physarum polycephalum would react with a signaling activator,dibutyryl cAMP, and an inhibitor, curcumin, of signaling. It was hypothesized that the activator, dibutyryl cAMP, will cause the Physarum polycephalum to move towards the glucose since glucose is a food source for Physarum polycephalum. This experiment was ran by using 2% water agar plates soaked in 4Ml of curcumin or dibutyl cAMP for 10 mins. Then 1cmx1cm block of Physarum polycephalum was placed in each agar plate with a 1cmx1cm block of glucose.  The slime mold was allowed to incubate in the plate for 24 hrs. After 24 hrs, the movement of the slime mold was measured with a ruler and recorded. After the experiment was conducted, it was concluded that the hypothesis was not supported. There was no significance between each treatment group and the controlll group.  Cell signaling is complex and more studies need to be done in order to make a definite conclusion on if cAMP is an activator of Physarum polycephalum. 


Introduction:
Cells have signal transduction pathways that allow cells to respond to their internal and external environment. The model organism of this study was slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. Physarum polycephalum contains many nuclei within a single plasma membrane. When stresses like light or heat are present along with lack of food, it responds by starting its reproductive cycle[Johnson:2016]. Physarum also has several other common behaviors like cytoplasmic streaming,phototaxis,chemotaxis, gravitaxis, and structural reorganization[Johnson:2016]. This study will look at the chemotaxis response of Physarum polycephalum toward glucose in a 2% water agar plate soaked in an activator and an inhibitor of cell signaling pathways. Chemotaxis is a process in which cells sense extracellular signals and move towards the signal [Van Haastert:2004]. For an activator dibutyryl-cAMP was chosen because Physarum polycephalum requires calcium for cell movement as calcium binds to the actin and myosin in order to move the Physarum polycephalum[ Maruta: 1983].  Also, cAMP can regulate calcium channels within a cell and is a second messenger in cell signaling like calcium.  Inhibitors affect the endoplasmic flow within the slime mold[Avsievich:2016].   The endoplasmic reticulum is the site where proteins are synthesized and transported. When the endoplasmic reticulum flow is inhibited it will stop the synthesis and transport of proteins which will cause the slime mold from being unable to move towards the glucose. Curcumin has been shown to induce cell death signals and apoptosis in tumor cells which makes it a viable option as an inhibitor of Physarum polycephalum [Chen:2014]. It is hypothesized that the dibutryl-CAMP will act as an activator and make the Physarum polycephalum move towards the glucose.


Materials and Method:
3- 2% water agar plates were soaked in 4 Ml of dibutryl-cAMP for 10 mins. 3- 2% agar plates were then soaked in 4 Ml of curcumin for 10 mins. After the 10 mins of soaking, 2 -1cmx1cm squares were cut into opposite sides of all 9- 2% water agar plates.  The left box in each plate had a 1cmx1cm box of Physarum slime mold placed in it. The right box in each plate had a 1cmx1cm box of glucose placed in the box.  All of the plates were wrapped in aluminum foil and labeled and placed in a 25 Celsius incubator for 24 hrs. The growth of Physarum polycephalum was measured with a ruler for each of the plates. Two t-Tests  were ran to determine if the data was significent.


Results:
The Physarum in the 2% water agar plates soaked in dibutryl-cAMP, grew towards the glucose but the Physarum on the controlll plates also grew towards the glucose. Meanwhile, the Physarum on the curcumin soaked plates grew away from the glucose or had no growth at all.  The data was not significent. The p value for the t_test ran between the dibutryl-cAMP and the controlll was 0.6852. The p value between the controlll and curcumin was  0.1685. Both p values are higher than the alpha value of 0.05.


Discussion:
The initial hypothesis that dibutryl-cAMP plays a role in chemotaxis in cell signaling was not supported. Even though this particular data collected did not support the initial hypothesis, one could still say that cAMP still helps activates chemotaxis because there have been numerous of papers saying that cAMP activates cell signaling. In a different slime mold,  Dictyoselium discoide, it has been shown that dibutryl-cAMP was an activator that caused the slime mold to be chemotactic toward metabolites[Smith: 1978]. For the next study, different slime molds should be used in order to see if different slime molds use cAMP as an activator . This study might have not worked because cell signaling is complex since cell systems has to respond to a lot of information from the intracellular and extracellular space of the cell; it receives information from the cell’s receptors on the outside of the cell and has to make changes in the gene expression and cellular activities like motility, proliferation, and death [Hlavacek:2009]. Since this study measured the movement of the Physarum polycephalum, the cells might have had to use the activator for another cell signaling event.  With a complex concept like cell signaling it is hard for one experiment to give insight into the cell signaling of chemotaxis in slime molds.
