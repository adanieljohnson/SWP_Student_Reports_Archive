Title: 2% Sevin and its Effect on Tetany

Abstract:
To discover the effect of a acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on tetany 2% sevin was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of the rana pipiens. Our hypothesis was that the addition of the inhibitor would lower the Hz needed to reach tetany. Our hypothesis proved to be correct as the results showed a consistent lowering in the Hz tetany was reached before and after 2% sevin was added to the gastrocnemius muscle. Comparing the results of the leg before the chemical was added and it endured the exposure to the raising Hz level to after the chemical was added, the data shows a decrease in the Hz tetany was activated. 


Introduction:
In our experiment, we injected 2 % Sevin, our chosen chemical for injection, into the Rana Pipiens; or more commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog. Sevin is carbaryl, which used practically, is applied as a pesticide (NIPC, . It functions by blocking acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter released from a neuron’s presynaptic membrane that binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic cleft. The binding of Ach depolarizes the myofibril and in response, an action potential is fired. Acetylcholinesterase is released to break down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. This ceases muscular contraction. We will be using the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve located in the leg of the northern leopard frog. We will inject the 2% sevin, which will inhibit the actions of AChE, causing the constant contraction of the muscle until it reaches tetany. Our hypothesis is that the addition of the 2% sevin will lower the voltage that tetany will occur at.  Our variables are the following: The voltage tetany occurs at, whether sevin is used or not, and the amount of time the nerve is stimulated for.


Materials and Methods:
To conduct our experiment we obtained three northern leopard frog legs. In addition to the organism used, we obtained .6 mL of 2% sevin, a needle to inject the gastrocnemius muscle with, a rubber platform to set the from upon, a hooked device used to support the gastrocnemius muscle, a force transducer, and thread, to tie the muscle to the transducer. Each freshly obtained leg was skinned by sliding the skin at the top of the leg, where is was cleaved from the body, past its feet. Next, the sciatic nerve was isolated without it coming in contact with any metal materials. We separatde where the cleft is, between the dorsal and ventral side. Here the sciatic nerve lays and was then removed. In the next step, we detached the gastrocnemius muscle at the achilles tendon. This was done by placing the tip of the scissors in the gap next to the gastrocnemius muscle and cutting towards the toes. The muscle was detached but cutting on the achilles tendon, leaving some of it attached to the gastrocnemius muscle. The remaining portion of the achilles tendon attached to the gastrocnemius muscle was tied to the hook by the thread and tightened until the muscle formed a 90 degree angle with the remaining portion of the leg. The remaining portion of the leg was pinned to the rubber platform. Two pins to the top and bottom of the leg. Once it was securely pinned to the platform, we placed the sciatic nerve along the clasp of the force transducer. Once the force transducer was on and attached to one of our laptops we proceeded with the experiment. We initially began by using 4 Hz, then 8 Hz, 12 Hz, and finally 15 Hz. We recorded the visual results and the results on the computer for each Hz setting. Next, we proceeded by injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with .2mL of 2% sevin and ran each Hz. setting again. We repeated this with each leg until all three had experienced the same level of Hz with and without the 2% sevin. 


Results:
As it was shown in the graph, as the 2% sevin was injected into the leg, tetany was reached at a lower hertz value. It is also seen that the larger the size of the frog leg, the higher hertz it required to reach tetany. 
Central Tendency:
Mean of Hz before Sevin injections: 15 Hz.
Mean of Hz after Sevin Injections: 12.3 Hz.
Standard deviation: 2.7 Hz.


Discussion:
The results supported our hypothesis, showing that tetany could be reached at a lower hertz value if acetylcholinesterase  was inhibited, producing constant contraction. Inhibiting this molecule allowed acetylcholine to remain binded to the post-synaptic membrane. Due to it remaining there, there was a constant depolarization. The action potential persisted, producing the muscle contractions we saw. The constant muscle contractions, with no reprieve, led to tetany at a faster rate.  There have been no other research experiments documented using 2% sevin on a nervous system to compare our results with, only the destructive results of its pesticide attributes. To improve the accuracy of our results, obtaining legs similar in size would prove to be beneficial. This is known because there was obvious deviation between the Hz tetany was reached and the size of the northern leopard frog leg. If we intended to solely find the variance in the Hz level tetany is reached, the absence of other variables would prove to be helpful. In addition to this, we could improve our results by increasing the Hz level through smaller increments. By increasing anywhere between 3-4 Hz we could easily miss the correct level tetany occurred at. This could provide an incorrect variance in our results.

Figure Legends: 
In the two graphs above you will see the comparison of data between the level of Hz required to reach tetany before and after the 2 % Sevin was injected into frog legs. As you will see, the data varies because the post injection didn't require as high of a Hz. level to reach tetany.
