Title: Root to Shoot Ratio Increases in Raphanus sativus in the Presence of Salinity

Abstract:
Salinity is a possible factor that plants have to adapt to, to allocate their resources. Salinity can have the ability to limit plant growth and plant productivity. We predict to see that salinity will have an effect on resource allocation within the common radishes (Raphanus sativus) causing the root to shoot ratio to increase for both the weight and the length. By using six pots of common radishes, we can see how our controlll, watered with just tap water grows compared to our experimental common radishes which were watered with 0.35% salt water over the course of two weeks. Our hypothesis was partially supported. Our data supported our hypothesis of the R:S length ratio, but the data does not support our hypothesis on the R:S weight ratio. Based on the R:S results we can see that the common radishes allocated their resources when influenced by salinity by increasing the length of their roots and by retaining water.

Introduction:
The pattern in which plants distribute and use their limited resources is called resource allocation. The allocation pattern is determined genetically but species can adapt to a variety of conditions. Plants obtain resources by their leaves, stems and roots. The leaves of the plants are the photosynthetic organ of the plant and when there is an increased allocation of resources to leaves the plant has a high growth rate. Stems capture light and competition by lifting their leaves above other plants. Roots are the primary absorptive organ in plants and also anchor the plant to the soil. Shoots are the leaves and the stems measured together. To determine the ability of a plant to require resources in a given environment we use the root to shoot ratio where the biomass of the root is divided by the biomass of the shoot [Johnson: 2016]. Plants are trying to optimize the way in which it responds to the environment to maximize its reproductive potential and ensure the survival of the next generation [Bennett et al.: 2012].
Salinity is a possible factor that plants have to adapt to, to allocate their resources. Salinity can have the ability to limit plant growth and plant productivity. Salinity can possibly cause the death of plants. Some plants develop ways to exclude salt from their cells or tolerate it while still allocating the necessary resources [Parida and Das: 2005]. Allocating resources becomes a challenge to the plants however, because all the major processes, such as photosynthesis, protein synthesis, energy metabolism and lipid metabolism are affected because of salt [Parida and Das: 2005]. One of the first responses to salinity in the plants environment is the reduction in the rate of leaf surface expansion [Parida and Das: 2005]. Plants accumulate or exclude uptake of ions by their roots and compartmentalize the ions to cope with salinity [Parida and Das: 2005]. Plants also synthesize solutes, change the photosynthetic pathway within the plant and alter membrane structures to cope with the presence of salinity in the environment [Parida and Das: 2005]. The common radish was the species chosen for our experiment because they respond to stimuli well. We predict to see that salinity will have an effect on resource allocation within the common radishes (Raphanus sativus) causing the root to shoot ratio to increase for both the weight and the length because of higher salinity in the soil as compared to another group of common radishes where there will be no added salinity to the soil. 

Materials and Method:
Six pots of common radishes were used in the experiment. They are cheap, common, and easy to grow. Each pot had twenty seeds per container planted in them on 9/19/17. All plants were fertilized with Miracle Grow, 38g/10L. Three of the pots were watered every day until the soil was saturated for two weeks with tap water. This was the controlll. The three other pots were also watered every day until saturated for two weeks with water that had a 0.35% salt concentration. This was our experimental.  All groups were placed in a greenhouse and had the same amount of natural sunlight for two weeks. The pots were taken apart, soaked and the plants were separated and measured on 10/2/17. Five plants were measured from each pot in the experiment.  There was a two sample 1 tail t_test with Alpha, or the significance level of 0.05 used to compare and contrast the means of root to shoot length and weight ratios from our controlll group of common radish and from our experimental group [Johnson: 2016]. Our dependent variable will be the measure of the root to shoot ratio.

Results:
The means for R:S weight ratio of the controlll is  0.33907 +/- 0.096212279 (Figure 1). The mean R:S weight ratio for the experimental is 0.16749 +/- 0.025012735 (Figure 1).  
The mean R:S length ratio for the controlll is 1.2864 +/- 0.07254571 (Figure 2). The mean of the R:S length ratio for the experimental is 1.55713 +/- 0.239495669 (Figure 2). 
For the R:S weight ratio there were 4 degrees of freedom. Our P-value and t-value are different. The t-value was 2.989477 and the P-value was 0.040359. The test is significently different. 
For the R:S length ratio there were 4 degrees of freedom. The t-value and P-value are different. The t-value was 1.873859. The P-value was 0.134231. The P-value is larger than the Alpha, so the R:S length statistical test is not significent. 
The controlll weight R:S ratio is about double the experimental weight ratio (Figure 1). The R:S length ratios are close in numbers for both sets of radishes (Figure 2). The results are close together and makes the statistical test not significent. All the tests for both the experimental and the controlll group were consistent throughout the results. There was no big outlier.  The experimental group radishes looked more withered and dehydrated than the tap water controlll.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was partially supported. Our hypothesis supports the R:S length ratio, however it does not support the R:S weight ratio. The R:S length ratio of our experimental group was larger than our tap water controlll group which supported our hypothesis. The R:S length ratio was larger for the radishes watered with 0.35% concentrate of salt water than the controlll because it allowed for the roots to grow longer and allocate its resources while the salinity was dehydrating the plants. The common radishes were trying to optimize the way in which they respond to the environment, by forcing their roots to grow longer in a chance to obtain water and nutrients while under the pressures of salinity. The R:S length ratio increased because the plants sent their roots out long to collect resources. A previous study found that the common radishes increased their root lengths to maximize their reproductive potential and ensure the survival of the next generation [Bennett et al.: 2012]. 
The R:S weight ratio is not what we expected. We expected both the R:S weight ratio to increase like the R:S length ratio did. The R:S weight ratio did not increase because the experimental common radishes retained more water, thus the reason why the ratio is 0.16749 and smaller than the controlll (Figure 1). The experimental radishes retained water because of the salinity [Poss et al.: 2006]. Salinity reduces growth, thus the R:S weight ratio did not increase like the R:S length ratio did when the common radishes were in the presence of salt water [Hasegawa et al.: 2000]. Salt dehydrates the plants and if they do not retain water then they cannot survive. The common radishes retained water, and made the R:S weight ratio smaller because the weight of the roots decreased and the weight of the shoots increased (Figure 1). In another study, it was found that when there is a lack in soil moisture there is an increase in the R:S ratio [Davidson: 1969]. We expected to see an increase in the R:S weight ratio because of the increase of salinity, like Davidson’s study, but we did not.  A source of error could have been in our measurements because any extra water or soil could have affected the mass of the roots and the shoots. 
As seen in many scientific journals, salinity clearly affects plant growth and plant productivity.  We can further evaluate how the salinity affected plants by doing more similar salinity tests. We can also further evaluate salinity in plants be taking our experiment and by using a bigger sample group. We can add more experimental groups and increase the salinity in each group and see how the plants will respond [Sheldon et al.: 2017]. 
It is very clear that salinity had the ability to limit plant growth and plant productivity within the common radishes [Parida and Das: 2005]. Based on the R:S results we can see that the common radishes allocated their resources when influenced by salinity by increasing the length of their roots and by retaining water. Plants will do everything they can to obtain their resources necessary for survival. Resources are very limited and are not only necessary for their survival but for the survival of their future offspring [Bennett et al.: 2012].
