Title: Varying Colored Lights' Lack of Effect on Photosynthesis

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a process utilized by every plant cell to synthesize energy for their many processes. Light supplies the energy needed for photosynthesis to be completed. Therefore, the light supplied to the enriched chloroplast solution was altered in wavelength to test the varying colors’, red, green, and blue wavelengths, ability against white light to affect photosynthesis. The absorbance was measured by the electron acceptor DCPIP’s change in color from dark blue to colorless and is negatively correlated to photosynthetic activity. The findings were not significent which suggests varying wavelengths have no effect on chloroplasts amount of photosynthesis. The experiment would need to be repeated to further the study of different colored light’s effect on photosynthesis. If varied light colors were found to increase photosynthesis rates this could aid in forming more efficient plant growth formulas and method. 

Introduction:
Cells require energy for virtually every process they conduct. Since plants are autotrophs, their cells must produce their own energy from outside sources such as light, water, and CO2. The process of producing their own source of energy, glucose, is known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis begins with light dependent reactions in chloroplasts’ thylakoid membranes where an electron transport chain reduces highly oxidized compounds through a series of electron acceptors as ATP is generated. ATP production is hard to directly measure; however, it can be measured through the rate of electron acceptance in certain compounds such as DCPIP. DCPIP is a dark blue compound in its oxidized form and colorless in its reduced form; therefore, a decrease in absorbance can be measured and negatively correlated to an increase in electron acceptance and therefore an increase in photosynthesis (Johnson 2016). 
	As photosynthesis’ rate increases then the production rate of glucose will increase as well giving the cell more fuel to power its processes. Many variables have been tested to increase the rate of photosynthesis such as varying wavelengths of light exposed to chloroplasts. A previous study that compared photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts in red and blue light showed the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts in red light was significently higher than that of chloroplasts in blue light (Buschmann 1978). For this lab, a third wavelength was added (green) and all three colors of light were compared to white light’s rate of electron acceptance in chloroplasts of Spinacia oleraca (spinach plants). Green light was added due to varying outcomes of plant growth under the influence of green light in past studies. Some suggest it helps plant growth while others suggests it harms plant growth (Snowden 2015). It is hypothesized that white light will have the largest decrease in absorbance, and therefore the fastest rate of photosynthesis, due to plants’ natural tendency to grow in white light. It is also hypothesized that out of the three other colors green light will have the lowest photosynthesis rate due to plants natural green color which suggests they reflect green light instead of absorbing it. 


Materials and Method:
A mortar and pestle, medium beaker, and 3 50 Ml centrifuge tubes were cooled in an ice bucket along with grinding buffer, 130 mM DCPIP and reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). The central veins were removed from 4 spinach leaves and disposed of. The leaves were then rinsed and blotted dry and added to the cold mortar and pestle. 10 Ml of grinding buffer, to lyse the individual plant cells, was added and the leaves were grinded into a thick paste. 10 more Ml of grinding buffer was added to the paste and the mixture was strained through 4 layers of cheese cloth into the chilled beaker. The liquid was then poured from the beaker into the first centrifuge tube and spun for 3 min at 200 x G, 4 °C. The supernatant was poured into another centrifuge tube was spun in centrifuge at 1000 X G for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant of this tube was poured into a third centrifuge tube. 20 Ml of grinding buffer was then added to the pellet left in the second tube and stirred gently. 13 test tubes were then labeled and 3 replicates of the following were prepared. 6 Ml of water and 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP was added to each tube, except for the blank which received 8 Ml of water and no DCPIP. 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) was added to all tubes. The spectrophotometer was turned on and set to absorbance of 600 nm. 13 spectrophotometer cuvettes were obtained, and 0.1 Ml of enriched chloroplasts were added to the tubes which were mixed immediately. The solutions in the test tubes were then transferred to the cuvettes. The cuvette with the blank solution was used to blank the spectrophotometer, and then the other absorbances were measured immediately for time = 0. Cuvettes 1-3 were placed under the white light bulb, cuvettes 4-6 were placed under the red light bulb, cuvettes 7-9 were placed under the green light bulb, and cuvettes 10-12 were placed under the blue light bulb. After 10 minutes their absorbances were all measured again for time = 10. The cuvettes were then placed under their previous lights and the procedure was repeated twice for time intervals of 20 and 30 minutes. The absorbances of each solution were then recorded along with their averages and their % change of absorbance. A one-way ANOVA test was then ran on the results to further analyze them. 

Results:
Figure 1 depicts the trends of the average absorbances of each sample at each time increment. Each color caused a decrease in absorbance over the 30 minutes. Table 1 shows the average percent change in absorbance of each sample after 30 min with red light having the largest percent change. The percent change is also an indicator of how much photosynthetic activity occurred in each sample. Finally, Table 2 shows a summary of the ANOVA statistical test. The results can be deemed insignificent due to a p value of greater than 0.05. 

Discussion:
This lab was conducted to help show whether there was an effect of various wavelengths of light on photosynthetic activity. While each light color decreased absorbances over the 30-minute timespan, as shown in Figure 1, the absorbances of the white light samples, red light samples, green light samples, and blue light samples after 30 minutes had no significent difference. Since the p value was greater 0.05, the original hypothesis that predicted a difference in photosynthetic activity in varying light wavelengths was rejected. Previous studies suggest that varying light bulb colors affect the rate of photosynthesis greatly so some errors may have been made in the experiment that affected the results. For example, there was one outlier in the white light samples that had a much larger absorbance than the other two after 30 minutes. This difference in absorbance may be due to the tube randoMly receiving less chloroplasts than other tubes when the enriched chloroplast solution was prepared. If the average percent change in absorbance is recalculated without this outlier it is 88% instead of 46%. This change suggests that white light would have had the most change in absorbance and therefore the highest rate of photosynthesis. This result is consistent with a study that compared cool white light to red and blue lights’ effects on photosynthetic activity. The findings suggest that cool white fluorescent light caused higher photosynthetic rates than red or blue LED lights (Yorio 2001). 
The results generated in this experiment suggest that red light had the highest percent change in absorbance which suggests samples in red light had the highest photosynthetic rate. This finding is consistent with other studies that show red light is close to the maximum absorbance for chlorophyll and phytochromes, components of chloroplasts that aid in photosynthesis, when compared to blue and green light (Kang 2013). 
Previous studies also show that green light causes very low photosynthetic activity due to its low ability to be absorbed by chlorophylls (Folta 2007). The results in this experiment show that green light samples have a higher percent change in absorbance than blue light samples. It was then discovered after the experiment was completed that the green light bulb had twice the emission strength of the red and blue light bulbs. This would skew the results towards the samples in green light having a higher photosynthetic rate than blue light. 
In conclusion, this experiment suggests that white light, red light, green light, and blue light have no significent effect on photosynthetic activity. Since this finding contrasts many previous studies conducted, it should be repeated to further analysis of varying wavelengths of light on photosynthesis. The experiment would need to be repeated with even amounts of chloroplasts in each tube to ensure equivalent DCPIP activity. Equal strength light bulbs should also be used to ensure consistent light intensity and accurate results. By determining the light wavelength that is most productive of photosynthesis, plant growth in general could be made more efficient.
