Title: Effects of acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (Sevin) on the amplitude and relaxation period of the Rana pipiens’ action potential using electrical stimuli, producing insignificant results

Abstract:
This experiment will explore the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on the amplitude and relaxation period of the action potential of the Rana pipiens' gastrocnemius muscle.  The study explores the role of acetylcholine to propagate action potentials in the neuromuscular junction by opening ligand gated sodium ion channels. It is hypothesized that the amplitude will increase in voltage and the relaxation period will be prolonged after administering the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Sevin.  By running two paired T-tests, the results of both dependent variables were concluded as insignificant, denying the researcher of making any conclusions.  

Introduction:
The myofibril, a long cylindrical structure, is the most basic unit of a muscle cell.  When bundled together, multiple myofibrils create a muscle cell, containing multiple nuclei.  Bundles of muscle cells create the muscle itself, bound by connective tissue [Binder:1976].  Neurons that control muscles bind at the myofibers, a place known as the neuromuscular junction.  The neuron will extend all the way back to the spinal cord, specifically the grey matter, to relay information [Johnson:2016].

The neuromuscular junction uses the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to communicate between neurons and muscle cells.  When an action potential depolarizes the axon terminal of the neuron, voltage gated calcium ion channels are opened, allowing calcium ion into the cell.  This influx causes acetylcholine, already bound in presynaptic membrane vesicles, to re-bind with the presynaptic membrane and are released to the synapse.  In this way, the vesicles are recycled in the neuron. [Heuser:1973]  The acetylcholine neurotransmitters then bind to corresponding receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, initiating the opening of sodium ion channels, depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane and further continuing the action potential into the muscle.  

Also in the neuromuscular junction is an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase.  Its job is to break acetylcholine off from its receptor, break it into two parts, and return it to the presynaptic membrane to be taken up and reused.  When this process occurs, an action potential is fired.  The action potential has three parts; the latent, contractile, and relaxation period.  The latent period is the time between the stimulus and the reaction of the cell.  The contractile period occurs when the muscle contracts.  The relaxation period is the repolarization process when the muscle cell relaxes and comes down to resting potential voltage, -60mV.  

Using the Rana pipiens as a model organism was beneficial because it is a manageable size to see results yet is not too large for laboratory purposes.  Additionally, the the neuromuscular junction of this organism is similar to that of a human.  This experiment will introduce an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, the independent variable, Sevin, to test the effects on the amplitude and relaxation period of the action potential.  Without an active acetylcholinesterase, the acetylcholine will stay attached to the postsynaptic membrane, allowing sodium ion channels to remain open, prolonging the total time of the action potential.  It is hypothesized that the Sevin will cause an increase in amplitude of the action potential, as well as increase the length of the relaxation period, the dependent variables. 


Materials and Methods:
 1. 3 frog legs were collected.  The legs were skinned, the the sciatic nerve was exposed, the gastrocnemius was severed and tied so that it hung perpendicularly above the rest of the leg, using string and a pair of scissors.
2. Frog Ringer’s solution was periodically dripped onto the leg to keep the muscle moist.  
3. The computer program LabScribe was used on the computer to record electrical activity.
4. Using a sleeve electrode, the sciatic nerve was attached to the recording device that measures electrical activity, displaying the data on LabScribe. 
5. Determine a threshold for the frog leg.  This will be repeated on each new leg.
6. Use the voltage determined from the threshold to administer 5 single electrical impulses to the leg, waiting approximately 3 minutes between trials.  
7. Record the amplitude and relaxation period of each trial.
8. Administer 0.1mL of 2% concentration of Sevin to the frog leg using a needle.  Administer half the dose in the top of the gastrocnemius and the other half in the bottom half of the muscle.  
9. Wait 3 minutes to allow the chemical to take effect. 
10. Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the newly injected leg.  
11. Once the control and experimental trials for one leg have been completed, repeat steps 4-10 on the two remaining legs.  
12. A paired T-test was conducted for the amplitude and relaxation period dependent variables.  For each test, the data from each leg before the administration of Sevin was compared to the data after the administration. 


Results:
Generally, the amplitude of the action potentials post injection of Sevin were smaller in magnitude than the control group’s (t-value=2.117343, df=2, P=0.168431).  This is shown graphically in Figure 1 by each orange bar being lower than the corresponding blue bar.  The blue bars represent the average of the control trials for each of the three legs.  The orange bars represent the average amplitude of the three Sevin treated legs.  The magnitude of each frog leg’s action potential was between 0.034 and 0.352 millivolts.  

There was no recorded trend among trials testing the relaxation period when the paired T-test was run (t-value=0.245509, df=2, P=0.828957).  The relaxation period of the frog leg’s gastrocnemius ranged from 125 milliseconds to 213.4 milliseconds.  

It should be noted that the threshold not only changed from leg to leg, but also in between trials.  Leg 1 created an action potential at a threshold of 0.1mV, while leg 2 and 3 reached threshold at 0.2mV.  While testing the amplitude with a Sevin injection, the frog leg became unresponsive after trial 3.  Trial 4 was continued when a new threshold of 0.3 was established.  


Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis that the amplitude and relaxation period will increase in magnitude and time, respectively.  The P-values for each variable were 0.17 and 0.83, for amplitude and relaxation period.  In science, a P-value below 0.05 is generally accepted as a 95% accuracy rating, and therefore, statistically significant.  However, the values obtained were 0.17 and 0.83.  This means that a 83% chance of being correct, while the P-value correlating with the relaxation period accounted for a 17% chance of the data being correct.  

Human error greatly contributed to error in this experiment.  Measuring the relaxation period is subjective.  There is often not a clear line to when the end occurs, creating room for much human error to occur. 

Acetylcholinesterase is concentrated at the neuromuscular junctions of frog muscles [Anglister:1994].  A reaction did take place when Sevin was administered to the specimen.  Because the results were insignificant, determined by the P-value, no conclusions can be made.  Very little research has been done to explore the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on action potentials.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are now being studied as possible medical breakthroughs. 

Drugs such as E2020 are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that are used to treat Alzheimer’s.  By removing the number of acetylcholinesterases in the synapse, more acetylcholine is able to bind with their receptors, delivering more messages, something that is inhibited in Alzheimer’s [Kawakami:1996].  It is known that with decreased activity of acetylcholine, the less active the memory and muscular function are [Fambrough:1973].  The role of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is only beginning to be explored.  

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are promising subjects to study.  Studying the frequency at which action potentials are fired before and after the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is a worthy future study.  As Fambrough discovered, the activity of acetylcholine is much more active when acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are functioning at high levels.  The smallest portions of the body make the largest differences in physiology, which is why acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are being studied so heavily by researchers.
