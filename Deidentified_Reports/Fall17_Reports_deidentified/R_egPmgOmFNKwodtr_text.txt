Title: Music and Aggression in Betta splendens: an Analysis

Abstract:
We sought to understand the effect that music has on the agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens, particularly the effect of tempo on aggressiveness. We proposed that high-tempo music would increase agonistic behaviors in the Bettas. In order to test our hypothesis, we played two songs for two pairs of male Betta fish: “Humble,” a fast hip-hop song at 152 bpm, and “Adagio for Strings,” a slow orchestral piece ranging from 66-76 bpm. Our hypothesis was not supported by our data, which was above significance level. However, our data was inconclusive due to a lack of replicates and the effect of an outlier. We also tested the Betta fish in two different social conditions, which likely affected their agonistic behavior. Future experiments should focus on only one social condition to improve consistency and to increase the number of replicates under observation.  

Introduction:
Animal behavior is an expression of a complex interplay of factors, shaped by evolution and selective pressures that cause animals to act the way that they do. Ethology is the study of these behaviors; it seeks to better understand these behaviors and the forces behind them, focusing on the genetics, physiology, and learned actions of animals [Johnson: 2016]. 
Ethology distinguishes between two categories of interaction in animal behavior: interspecific, or between individuals of different species, and intraspecific, or between individuals of the same species. A further subcategory is that of “agonistic,” or aggressive, behaviors. These threat behaviors are those associated with competition and fighting, especially over food resources [Raveling: 1970]. A successful display can reward the aggressor with more food, territory, and mating opportunities, increasing its reproductive fitness. An individual’s tendency towards agonistic behaviors can also be influenced by external factors. A study of golden hamsters found that individuals that had been subjected to social stress in adolescence were more likely to initiate aggressive behavior than those that had not been subjected to that stress [Wommack: 2003]. Another study showed that Betta fish individuals that had lost one fight were more likely to lose another or to submit to the dominance of their competitors [Francis: 1983]. 
The Betta fish, or Betta splendens, is well-known for its agonistic behaviors. When two male Betta fish interact, they exhibit aggressive displays meant to intimidate the other. These displays consist of two general categories of movement, broadside and facing. Both of these two categories can be broken down into three primary displays of increasing aggressiveness: the broadside displays of pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing; and the facing displays of erecting its pectoral fins, spreading its gill covers, and showing a red “mane” of its branchiostegal membranes [Johnson: 2016]. If the two males are not physically separated, then their agonistic displays could even escalate to an attack. 
In our experiment, we sought to observe the impact that playing music in the background of interaction between two male Betta fish would have; specifically, how faster, more “aggressive” music might affect aggressive interactions between the Betta fish. We hypothesized that if fast music were played during the Bettas’ interactions, it would lead to an increase in the aggressiveness of the Bettas.

Materials and Methods:
To test the effect of music on the aggressiveness of Bettas’ interactions, we studied the interactions of two Betta male pairs in a single tank, initially separated by an opaque plastic barrier and a layer of transparent glass. We then studied two social conditions, one Betta pair in each. The first social condition, with one pair of fish, was with the opaque barrier removed but the glass in place, allowing the two Bettas to see each other but remaining physically separated. The second condition, with a second pair of fish, was with both barriers removed, so that the two Bettas were visible to each other and no longer physically separated. For each social condition, we had two musical treatments, one “high” and one “low.” The “high” treatment was the song “Humble” by Kendrick Lamar, a hip-hop song with a tempo of 152 beats per minute (bpm). Our “low” treatment was the work “Adagio for Strings” by Samuel Barber, an orchestral piece with a tempo varying from 66-76 bpm.  The music was played at the same volume over a Bluetooth speaker. Our control for both social conditions was no music playing. Each trial ran for three minutes or until an attack and contact were made, whichever came first. 
	As each trial was run, two observers closely watched the subjects and recorded each occurrence of agonistic behavior and its type. In order to give the observed Bettas time to calm after agonistic interactions, in between each trial we gave them three-minute breaks of time in which we lowered the opaque barrier so that they were both physically removed and invisible to each other. So that we could avoid habituation in the Betta fish, which would tend to reduce agonistic behavior, we switched out both of our test subjects after completing our three trials under the first social condition. 
	In order to quantify the aggressiveness of the Bettas, we assigned a numerical value to each display on a scale from 1-3, with higher scores going to more aggressive behaviors in both categories [Johnson: 2016]. Pelvic fin flickering and erect pectoral fins both received scores of 1; tail beating and gill-cover spreading received scores of 2; and tail flashing and displaying the red “mane” received scores of 3. Once these values were assigned, we totaled the score for each social condition and musical treatment and then divided that score by the time that the trail ran; this allowed us to create an “aggression per minute” score that solved the issue of trials abbreviated by physical contact. The data was analyzed with an ANOVA statistical test, and the mean aggression scores and standard deviation for each treatment were calculated.

Results:
The test performed on the data was a one-way ANOVA. This test yielded a P-value of .303 with 2 degrees of freedom, showing that the data was not significant. The means and standard deviation of the control and low music treatment were very similar, with means of 6 and 6.51 and standard deviations of 2.36 and 1.67, respectively. The high treatment had a much higher mean of 17.11, but that dataset includes a great outlier of 24.89 due to one very abbreviated trial, resulting in a large standard deviation of 11.00. 

Discussion:
We found that our hypothesis was not supported by our data. We predicted that playing high-tempo music in the background of intraspecific Betta interactions would increase the Bettas’ aggressiveness in those interactions. A one-way ANOVA showed that the data was not statistically significant. This was despite the mean aggression score for the high treatment being almost three times as high as the mean aggression scores for the control and the low treatment; this may stem from our low number of replicates, only one per social condition. Ideally, we would have had at least three replicates so that the data might be more conclusive. As it stands, the data is not decisive, as there are too few replicates to establish a decisive correlation between background music and agonistic behaviors in the Betta fish.
	Another issue to consider when looking at the data is the possibility of bias on the part of the observers. Because we anecdotally felt that the high music treatment was an aggressive song and predicted that it would cause more aggressive behavior in the Bettas, we may have experienced confirmation bias while performing our experiment, being more willing to identify and record aggressive behaviors during the high treatment trials and more willing to overlook aggressive behaviors during the control and low treatment trials. This would skew our aggression scores, artificially raising and lowering scores to meet our preconceived expectations of the Bettas’ behaviors. We attempted to reduce any bias or oversights by assigning two observers during each trial, whose averaged recordings formed the basis for our calculated mean aggression scores. An ideal design to further minimize any confirmation bias would be to have the observers unaware of the treatment to which the Bettas were subject, performing the trials in a randomized order and blocking the hearing of the observers so that they would be unable to discern which trial was occurring. 
	It seems intuitive to humans that music can affect an emotional response, and thus, influence behavior; however, this is an anthropocentric assumption that must be handled carefully. A number of ethologists have studied the importance of sound signaling in various organisms, from birds to primates. The ethologists Smith and Harper found that sounds could convey information about the sounding organism or the environment, playing a role in social activities such as resource competition or mating [Smith: 1995]. Because the ability to send these signals comes at the cost of producing the sounding organs in the first place, it implies the elicitation of a response in the receiving organisms, forming the foundation of the argument for an evolutionary basis for a response to music [Bryant: 2013]. To test whether this evolutionary feature might extend to other animals, a research team composed music based on their hypothesized emotional features of vocalizations of the tamarin, a small monkey, and played it to a study group of tamarins. They found that the tamarin-based music evoked a behavioral response in the monkeys, but that human-based music had no such effect [Snowdon: 2013]. While fish are quite distinct behaviorally from primates, a number of fish are known to vocalize [Fay: 2008]. Although the effect of music on fish has not been extensively studied, it thus seems possible that music may affect fish behavior. However, our study showed no clear link, and even if it had, it would need further corroboration from future experiments.
	Future experiments should be much more thorough in their running of trials. Because we attempted to examine two social conditions, we only had one replicate for each social condition; ideally, we would have had at least three. In order to get those three replicates, we should have focused on one social condition. Only testing one social condition would also increase the consistency of data; the one massive outlier in our data was due to an aggressive action that was not even possible in our trials of the other social condition. In order to test fish behavior and its response to music more generally, it would also become necessary to test a broad variety of fish species rather than simply Betta splendens. Our experiment also only focused on one aspect of music, its tempo. Other experiments may focus on the effect of various noise levels on the behavior of Betta fish.
