Title:  Raphanus sativus biomass allocation due to differing humidity 

Abstract:
	This study investigates the effects of humidity on radish, Raphanus sativus, biomass growth. The energy allocation was measured through the use of root to shoot weight and length ratios. It was determined that those growing in a lower humidity environment would have on average a higher root to shoot ratio than those in the more humid one for both weight and length. This could be due to the fact that plants need to grow more expansive root networks to get the water they need. 


Introduction:
Abiotic factors in the environment, such as humidity in the air, may lead to a limitation of resources (if the air is less humid, then water may be less readily accessible to a plant). In response to this, a plant may have a tradeoff, whether to allocate its energy to one part or another. Resource allocation in response to humidity may be seen through a root to shoot ratio of biomass (Johnson et al. 2017). If exposed to a more water plentiful environment, then a plant may not need to grow as much root biomass to absorb water out in the ground.  This phenotypic plasticity may be seen in radishes, Raphanus sativus, when placed in different humidity’s. Radishes, small sprouts when young, have measurable weights and lengths for both their roots and their shoots.  If a radish is exposed to a higher humidity environment, then it will have a lower root to shoot ratio than those placed in a lower humidity environment, which will in turn have a higher one. 


Materials and Methods:
We used 120 radish seeds for this study. They were divided into six 5x5 pots, 20 seeds in each, placed about an inch apart with three inches of vermiculite. Three were put into each of the two air tight aquariums and watered daily. One of the two aquariums had two inches of water in the base with the three pots on stilts; this was to simulate a high humidity environment. The water at the base was marked with tape and kept the same over the course of the study. After a week of watering, the newly grown sprouts were taken out of the greenhouse and removed from the soil. Keeping the high humidity plants separated from the low humidity ones, we randomly pulled five from each pot set. These were measured (mm) and weighed (g), using a ruler and scale, as wholes, then their roots and shoots were measured and weighed separately. We only took the maximum length from each set of five to find the average of the three pots root-shoot lengths. After finding the averages for lengths and weight of both roots and shoots, we determined the two root to shoot ratios for weight and length and their standard deviation. There is a five percent chance that the null hypothesis for this study is true, which we disregarded as shown through the significance level, alpha. A two tailed T-test was performed on the data collected to determine their statistical significance and how they vary in each direction. 


Results:
In this study, we found that radishes grown with higher humidity have a smaller root to shoot ratio for both weight and length than those of a lower humidity. The average root to shoot weight of radishes grown with high humidity was 0.2183, an average root weight of 0.1153 g and shoot weight of 0.532 g, with a standard deviation of 0.0213. The maximum root length was 165.8333 mm and maximum shoot length 161.6667 mm, making a root to shoot ratio of 1.0287 deviating 0.1225 in either direction. The plants exposed to lower humidity had an average root weight of 0.146 g and shoot weight of 0.496 g. This made a root to shoot ratio of 0.2983, with a standard deviation of 0.0716. Their root to shoot length ratio was 1.3226, made up of a max root length of 183.6667 mm and shoot length of 140.0000 mm. This had a standard deviation of 0.2293. The difference between the data found from the high humidity group and the low humidity group can be shown through a T-value equaling 9.403392. The degree of freedom for this is 10. This data can be found in Table one, with the ratios and standard deviations also in figure one. The probability that this data proves a null hypothesis is represented by a P value equaling 2.79E -6. 


Discussion:
After gathering the data from the two humidity groups and comparing them using a T-test and bar graph we found that our hypothesis was confirmed. The Radish plant, Raphanus sativus, of lower humidity would grow more shoot mass and length compared to root mass and length than the one of higher humidity, which would have less.  This can be seen when comparing the root to shoot weight and length ratios: high humidity having a weight ratio of 0.2183 and length 1.0287 while low is 0.2983 and 1.3226. These differences may seem minute individually, they are the averages of many plants making their differences more noteworthy. A plant tends to try and optimize its energy allocation in response to environmental cues. This, in turn, will maximize its fitness and ability to live long enough to get its genes to future generations (Bennett et al. 2012). The plant would invest more energy into certain areas depending on where resources are more or less accessible (Rosenvald et al. 2014). Thus, if the air is more humid, then more water will precipitate on the plants and soil surrounding it, being absorbed into the ground for the plants to use. Likewise, the radishes grown in the less humid environment need to grow a more expansive root network to get the smaller amount of available water in ground. This is displayed through a T-value of 9.4033.
These results and reasoning coincide with other humidity-plant allocation studies. One study, on the effects of humidity on silver birch and hybrid aspen biomass allocation and accumulation found that increased humidity significantly impeded the growth of the aspen plant, resulting in smaller shoot size and above ground biomass. This was thought to be because with higher humidity, there is a decrease in water fluxes through a forest canopy, which may cause a diminished nutrient supply to foliage and photosynthetic capacity (Rosenvald et al. 2014).
There may have been errors in the study, which could have affected the results. The plants may have not been watered equally, causing one aquarium to grow better than the other. They may not have been exposed to exactly the same amount of light, as well. While notable, we attempted to make these errors less influential by putting them directly beside each other in the greenhouse, so that they are exposed to roughly the same amount of light, and watering them for the same amount of time each. Of course, there may be some human error in time spent watering, but that was counteracted by giving them the same number of counted seconds each.  
This data may be helpful in the future when attempting to grow plants in environments with different humidity’s than they are used to. If a plant is grown in an area with lower humidity than the environment that it evolved to fit, then it may grow less biomass above ground than below. If put in a more humid environment, such as a greenhouse, it may grow more above ground mass, due to water in the soil being more easily accessible and decreased water flux affecting the nutrients in the air.
