Title: The Effect of A23187 on Tetany in the Northern Leopard Frog’s Neuromuscular System

Abstract:
Muscle contractions occur when action potentials are fired in a cell and reach the inside of the muscle cell. Without calcium, this process would not be able to occur throughout the neuromuscular system in an organism. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of A23187 on tetanus in the gastrocnemus muscle in frogs. The chemical we are using “A23187” directly improves the transportation of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane of a cell. It was hypothesized that the presence of A23187 would reduce the time it takes for a muscle to reach tetany. This prediction is based on what is known about calcium’s importance in muscle contractions and action potentials. To test the hypothesis 3 frog legs from the Rania pipiens were used and at first, they were tested as a controlll. After controlll testing, they were injected with 2Ml’s of A23187. The hypothesis was rejected after testing due to a high P-value. After testing was concluded it was observed that A23187 did not have a significent effect on frequency and tetany in muscles.

Introduction:
In this lab, the effects of tetany on a frog’s neuromuscular system was observed.  The frog we are testing is the Northern Leopard Frog, or the Rania pipiens.  The frog leg gives a model that can be tested and observed with the naked eye. We are using this particular frog leg because of the similarities it shares with a human leg muscle. In the experiment, the independent variable is the amount of hertz used to test tetanus. The dependent variable, on the other hand, is the achievement of tetany. We were observing twitches in the frog leg which is equivalent to an Action Potential being fired. An action potential is generated from the neurons and then sent down the neuromuscular pathway so that it can travel down t-tubules and cause a muscle twitch or movement. Our calcium channel activator carries more calcium across the membrane and also induces stronger calcium signals, therefore, releasing more calcium which in turn allows more neurotransmitter to be released. [Sigova,: 2000] The effects that electrical pulses have on muscles were observed through this testing procedure. Muscles can reach a point called tetany which is described as “a state of maximal sustained contraction.” (Johnson,2017) In this lab, we are testing to see at what frequency tetany occurs in the muscle and then comparing those results to when we add calcium channel activator (A23187) to the muscle. Our rational for our hypothesis was based on calcium’s role in generating action potentials and passing them through the synapses. (Bolton, 1979) Calcium is the key to muscle contractions and depolarization on the cellular level. With an increase in calcium’s presence, it makes more neurotransmitter release and ultimately is the cause of a muscle contraction. It was hypothesized that when adding the calcium channel activator, the muscle would achieve tetany at a lower frequency than compared to without A23187. We suspect it will achieve tetany at a lower frequency because calcium is responsible for neurotransmitter release which tells the next neuron to prepare to fire an action potential. 

Materials and Method:
In the beginning of the experiment we received three Northern Leopard frog legs and we had to begin by preparing them for testing. To prepare the frog leg we begin by peeling back the skin and keeping it moist with frog ringer solution. We then cut the Achilles tendon and hung the gastrocnemus muscle from the stand on force transducer. (Figure 2) After hanging the frog, we took pins and pinned down the rest of the frog leg so that when electricity hits it the leg does not move around. While the muscle is suspended with a small amount of tension on it, we inserted the electrical probes so that the frequency can be directly inserted into the muscle. (Figure 3) We then recorded shocks at different frequencies in Hz. We used 4-20 Hz in increments of 1 until tetany was observed. We then injected 0.2Ml’s of A23187 into the muscle and then started the initial procedure over again beginning with 4Hz and the same parameters until we reach tetany with the A23187. This was repeated with all three frog legs with the controlll being done first and then using the same parameters injecting A23187 and comparing the results. With our results, we used the paired T-test, which is most useful for us because we are comparing two groups of non-independent variables.  

Results:
The three experimental frog legs showed a decrease in the amount of Hertz needed in the experimental groups using the calcium activator (post-injection of 0.2Ml) [figure 1]. In the pre-injection testing of frog legs or controlll, legs one and two only needed 14 hertz to reach tetany. After the injection of frog leg one, it showed a small decrease in hertz needing only 12 to achieve tetany. Frog leg two also had a decreased amount of hertz needed to achieve tetany with number two achieving it at ten Hertz post-injection. Frog leg three pre-injection reached tetany at a slightly higher number of hertz than legs one and two with fifteen hertz. Post-injection for frog leg three needed only 9 hertz to achieve tetany. The paired T-test showed a P-value of 0.07418, with 2 degrees of freedom, and a T-value of 3.464.

Discussion:
In our experiment, we did not have statistically significent results between the controlll and the calcium channel activator treatment. Our P-value of 0.07418 and the overlap in the error bars confirmed that we had results that were not statistically significent. Having results that were not statistically significent rejects our alternative hypothesis and supports the null. The three controlll legs we tested had about the same amount of hertz needed in order to achieve tetany. Post-injection we can see a noticeable decrease in amount of hertz needed to have tetanus. With the calcium at normal levels, we see it took about fourteen hertz to cause tetany. When we add calcium activator and allow more into the cell we see it drops four hertz down to ten Hertz. In the future, we need to have more testing on more legs to further confirm or disprove our hypothesis again. Based on the amount of testing we have done in this experiment we can see a trend that when you add Calcium channel activator A23187, there will be less frequency required to reach tetany, but it is not statistically significent enough to say it was completely due to the A23187. I believe this experiment needs further testing to be able to close the case and say for sure that A23187 does or does not have effect on frequency required for tetany.
