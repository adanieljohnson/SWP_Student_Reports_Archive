Title: As Light Intensity Increases the Root-to-Shoot Ratio Increases in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Through the removal and decrease of the sunlight on the Vigna radiata plant, this study shows how such plants adapt to the lesser resources available. The Vigna radiata plants that have less access to light will have smaller root-to-shoot ratios than those that have full access to light as a result of resource allocation and adaptation. With three light intensities and three replicates per intensity, the experiment provided enough data to run statistical tests. These statistical tests supported the hypothesis. Based on previous studies, Vigna radiata plants have been subject to changing their appearance as a result of exposer to other chemicals in the environment. Therefore, it was not surprising when the plants in this experiment had adapted to their conditions in different ways.

Introduction:
In order for any plant to grow and complete natural processes like cellular respiration and photosynthesis, it requires certain conditions like: access to sunlight, water, and nutrients. Without these conditions, the plant will be impacted in one or multiple ways. In this study, the plant Vigna radiata, more commonly known as mung beans, was tested. Mung beans are a very widely grown and consumed crop throughout the United States, Asia, Africa, South America, and Australia [Oplinger: 1997], so they are capable of growing in many different environments. Since mung beans grow in a short amount of time [HanumanthaRao: 2016], it was good to use them for this experiment so that the impacts of light intensity could be analyzed in the time period provided. Since we know that abiotic factors such as: sunlight, water, and soil, are required for the plant to be successful in its processes, in manipulating one of those variables the plant will likely have to adapt in one way or another. Inadequate amounts of light—in the wintertime, for example—is known to reduce the growth of many plants [Porter: 1937]. Since lack of light can reduce plant growth, other aspects of the plant such as root-to-shoot ratio and mass would also be affected. in The optimal light intensity for mung beans is 100% light intensity, which is the controlll group for this experiment, so all of the replicates in this group were under full light inside of the greenhouse. The independent variables that were tested included light intensities at different levels: 0% intensity, meaning that the mung bean plants were put inside a dark cabinet, and 50% intensity, meaning that the mung bean plants were partially covered underneath a screen in the greenhouse. The main dependent variable that we tested was the impact of the different light intensities on the root-to-shoot ratio of the mung bean plants. If the mung beans have less access to sunlight, then the root-to-shoot ratio will be smaller, and vice versa.

Materials and Method:
After deciding to have three different light intensities (0%, 50%, 100%), the amount of replicates (number of pots) per light intensity was three or nine total pots, and the number of seeds per pot was 15 or 45 seeds total. The next step was planting the seeds. The seeds had been soaking in water prior to planting; after filling the pots with vermiculite (soil), water it, add 50 Ml of miracle grow, then add more water, then add the seeds, then put the 100% and 50% pots in the greenhouse, with the 50% pots going underneath the screen that blocks half of the light, and 0% in the cabinet. It is essential to water the plants everyday with water from the same source and in the same method—through a watering can—and that the soil is thoroughly watered, especially as the plants germinate and grow, requiring more water. After two weeks all of the plants should be carefully removed from the soil and kept within their replicate groups for measuring. The hypothesis was tested by growing the mung bean plants for two weeks and then extracting each individual plant from the pots and measuring, weighing, and counting the leaves. After the lengths and masses of the whole plant, the root, and the shoot, and the number of leaves on each plant was recorded, some of the means were compared using an ANOVA test and the 0% and 100% data were used in t–tests. In the ANOVA test the means of the root-to-shoot ratios and the masses of the 0% and 100% replicates were tested and showed a p value in support of the hypothesis. In the ANOVA test the means of the whole plant length and mass, root length and mass, shoot length and mass, and the number of leaves were all tested for the 0% and 100% replicates to find out whether the p_value was or was not in support of the hypothesis. A t_test was then used to also compare the means of these values and then to show these values in the figures.

Results:
Prior to removal from the soil, some of the effects that the availability, or lack thereof, of light had on the mung bean plants. As seen in Figure 1, the 0% light intensity plants have fewer plants protruding above the soil, are white in color, have smaller and fewer leaves, and are all pointing facing a direction in which the plant detected light, which is the direction that the cabinet would open at. The 50% plants shown in Figure 1 have more, larger, and greener leaves in comparison to the 0% plants, but are nowhere near as large and green as the 100% plants. When removing the plants from the soil for the measurements, the 100% plants had many more roots and the roots were very entangled because of this, whereas in the 50% and 0% plants, the roots were easier to track to the shoot that they are a part of. The data recorded for the plants in the 50% light intensity do not have each of the replicates separated, it was not included in the ANOVA and t_tests because the data could not be used in any meaningful way. The t_tests are shown in chart 1, chart 2, and chart 3. As shown by Chart 1, the 100% light intensity plants had greater total and root lengths, but the 0% plants had greater shoot lengths. The p_value from the ANOVA test for comparing the whole plant length was 0.045 and the p_value for the root length was 0.002754, both of which are significent, but the p_value for the shoot length was 0.266, which means it is not significent. Chart 2 shows that the weight of total plant, the root, and the shoot is greater in all instances in the mung beans that were in the 0% light intensity conditions. The p_value from the ANOVA test for comparing the whole plant masses was 0.000076, the p_value for comparing the root masses was 0.021, and the p_value for comparing the shoot masses was 0.000011, all of which are significent. Chart 3 shows that the plant in the 100% light intensity had more than triple the amount of leaves in the 0% light intensity; the p_value that was found in comparing the number of leaves in each of the replicates was 0.000107, which is significent. Overall, the plants in the 100% light intensity were longer and had more leaves but weighed less than the smaller and lighter plants in the 0% light intensity.

Discussion:
The significance of all, except for one, of the p_values means that the evidence is strong in supporting the hypothesis. Meaning that the results support the original hypothesis because the root-to-shoot ratio is smaller for the lights that were in the 0% light intensity. From limiting the mung beans access to light, the plants could not fulfill their biological processes as thoroughly and in turn their root to shoot ratio was effected. This shows the importance of plants having access to the abiotic factors of sunlight, water, and nutrients. All organisms, where that is a plant or an animal, will need to adapt to their environment in one way or another, which this experiment showed; the direction of the shoots of the plants in the 0% light intensity was an adaptation to the environment because the plants sensed the resources available beyond the darkness of the cabinet, so their current resources were allocated for their shoots to turn towards that direction. Plants have the ability to adjust their root-to-shoot ratios when in environments that inhibit them from access to other nutrients like nitrogen, not just in cases of sunlight [Agren: 2003]. Error in this experiment occurred while taking measurements of the plants in the 50% light intensity. The replicate groups were not kept separate, resulting in having one big group rather than having three replicate groups, which is why the data for those plants was excluded from the statistical tests. Other future experiments could test how the root-to-shoot ratios are effected with different amounts of water or different amounts of access to other nutrients that plants need. The next logical step for this study would be to repeat it with several more replicate groups, a few additional light intensities, or adding in another species of plant to see how it reacts in the conditions. If I were to do this experiment again, I would also ensure that all of the lab members know to keep track of which plants belong in which replicate group to avoid future errors and to allow for additional statistical tests to be done. In many environments plants, especially small ones such as mung bean plants, do not always have a completely open landscape in which to grow, which is why it is important to research and test how the plants are impacted by either having an abundance of sun light, or none at all. After studying how mung beans were effected by light intensity it would be interesting to test how the root-to-shoot ratio of other similarly sized plants are impacted by light intensity. Allocation of resources and adaptations to environments are very common among all plants, and can be seen through limiting what resources are available to them.
