Title: Agricultural Waste Effects on Oxygen Consumption and Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp. 

Abstract:
We worked with Procambarus sp. to demonstrate properties of metabolic reactions. We viewed the effects agricultural waste has on specific metabolic rate. Metabolic rate is the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiological processes at any given time. Pollution and its effects on ecosystems and global health is a rising concern. This results in organisms exhibiting physiological changes in response to the pollution. Our alternative hypothesis was that the metabolic rate of crayfish would increase with agricultural waste pollution in their environment. Three crayfish were used in this experiment and each served as their own control. We added 100 ml of agricultural waste to 900 ml of water and then added this mixture to the testing chambers and measured oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption is an indicator of energy production and can be used to calculate specific metabolic rate. There was an overall decrease in the specific metabolic rate when adding agricultural waste to the testing chambers. However, our P value was 0.22 which was not below our alpha level of 0.05. The results were not significant, and we failed to reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis was not supported (P=0.22; t=1.76; df=2).

Introduction:
Metabolic rate is the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiological processes at any given time. Metabolic reactions begin when an organism coverts glucose to energy which then goes through a series of reactions until it is converted into carbon dioxide. These reactions release high-energy electrons which are then captured by NAD+ and FAD, which begin the electron transport system. The release of energy from the electrons converts low-energy ADP into high energy ATP in considerable amounts until electrons are not removed from the mitochondria. Removing electrons from the mitochondria requires the electrons to be converted into the oxygen that is delivered to the cells by the respiratory organs. This adding of electrons converts oxygen to water which is then returned to the bodily fluids or excreted [Johnson: 2016]. Oxygen consumption is an indirect indicator of energy production. Pollution and its effects on ecosystems and global health is a rising concern. Environmental pollutants wreak havoc on aquatic environments and cause many organisms to exhibit behavioral and physiological responses including changes in oxygen consumption [Martins: 2007]. We measured oxygen consumption of Procambarus sp. to estimate its metabolic rate with the presence of agricultural waste. Procambarus sp. is a good model organism for this lab because these crayfish are sensitive and intolerant to water pollution and can be used as monitors of water-quality conditions [Helfrich: 2005]. A 2001 study by Rowe found that crayfish found at contaminated sites had elevated metabolic rates compared to crayfish found at non-contaminated sites [Rowe: 2001]. The presence of the agricultural waste could increase the energy needs of the crayfish from increased activity. Our alternative hypothesis was that the metabolic rate of crayfish would increase with agricultural waste pollution in their environment. The independent variable was agricultural waste pollution and the dependent variable was oxygen consumption. 

Materials and Methods:
Methods:

We weighed 3 large crayfish and placed them into closed mason jars and filled the jars with water. These jars were then placed in a dishpan with room temperature water and oxygen probes were inserted. Once the oxygen levels stabilized, a base line reading for each crayfish was taken. Oxygen levels were also measured in five-minute increments for twenty minutes. The volume of water was then determined by pouring the water in the jar into a graduated cylinder. This was then repeated for the 3 experimental crayfish but with adding agricultural waste pollution into the water-filled jar. The agricultural waste was made with 100 ml waste and 900 ml water. The crayfish served as their own controls. The oxygen rate of consumption was calculated for all 3 controls and treatments. To evaluate the data, we used a two-tailed t-test to determine significance. An alpha level of α=0.05 was used.


Results:
The control group (n=3) specific metabolic rate was an average of 0.0161±0.00039 mg O2*g-1*min-1. The experimental group (n=3) specific metabolic rate was an average of 0.0116±0.00021 mg O2*g-1*min-1. The specific metabolic rate decreased for all three experimental crayfish. (P=0.22; t=1.76; df=2)

Discussion:
The results were not significant, and we failed to reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis was not supported (P=0.22; t=1.76; df=2). There was an overall decrease in the specific metabolic rate when adding agricultural waste to the testing jars as seen in Figure 1. This could have been because the agricultural waste damaged bodily functions. The reduction in oxygen consumption, and therefore metabolic rate, could have been due to damage to the respiratory tract and muscles. Decreased oxygen consumption would then serve to function as a survival strategy. Our results were different from past research. This may be because of our short exposure duration. Chronic exposure to low levels of agricultural waste can negatively impact organism functioning [Rowe: 2001]. However, our results were aligned with a 2007 study by Martins, which found that with 15 minute exposure to different aquatic pollutions, all but one organism decreased its oxygen consumption when compared to the control group [Martins: 2007]. This study used Daphnia magna as their organism of study which is more primitive than the crayfish, but the study found that several pollutants had a significant decrease on oxygen consumption for short term exposure [Martins: 2007]. A limitation to our experiment was that we had to share crayfish that had other treatments prior to our testing without waiting for an appropriate washout period, or time between treatment periods. Therefore, we are unable to ensure that carryover effects were not a factor. This could have been a reason our p value was high. Our next step would be to expand our research to different exposure times to see which exposure times result in a significant change and whether this impacts the increase or decrease of metabolic rate.
