Title: Effect of Salinity on Oxygen Consumption in Procambarus sp.

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effect of increased Salinity added to the environment of Orconectes sp., the gray crayfish, was studied in order to compare oxygen consumption before and after addition of a 0.65% NaCl solution as a way to determine metabolic rate. Using an arated water bath, mason jar, and dissolved oxygen probe, oxygen consumption was measured over a period of twenty minutes for three crayfish before and after addition of NaCl to the environment by taking periodic readings every five minutes of the oxygen concentration of the environment. Each crayfish served as its own control. We hypothesized that the addition of NaCl to the environment would result in an increased metabolic rate, however, this was proven incorrect as in each crayfish, the specific metabolic rate was lower following addition of NaCl to the environment than in the control. The mean specific metabolic rate for the control group was higher than that after addition of salinity to the environment, but not significantly so (t-stat = 2.067, df = 2, P-value = 0.174). While this indicates that salinity does play a role in crayfish metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, further study is required.  

Introduction:
Organisms require energy in order to carry out functions for survival. Autotrophs capture sunlight or chemical energy in glucose via photosynthesis while heterotrophs obtain high-energy molecules and raw materials by consuming autotrophs or other heterotrophs. Both use mitochondrial enzymes to convert high-energy molecules into low-energy ones and capture the energy released during conversion as ATP. Metabolism refers to the entire process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells or an organism. Metabolic rate refers to the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiologic processes at any given time. When an organism converts glucose to energy, the carbon and oxygen atoms that are present in the glucose molecules are converted into carbon dioxide gas. These reactions release high energy electrons that are captured by NAD+ and FAD, molecules that transfer the electrons to the electron transport system. As the electrons move between the transport molecules of the chain, they give up energy, which is used to convert ADP into ATP. Electrons at the end of the train are removed from the mitochondria by transferring them to molecular oxygen, which is delivered to the cells by respiratory organs. Adding electrons converts oxygen to water, which joins body fluids or is excreted as necessary. Therefore, oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are good indirect indicators of energy production and use by an organism. In an experiment performed on narrow-clawed crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus), the effect of salinity acclimation on survival and moulting was studied with results indicating a salinity of 10% to be the best for moulting and survival and increased salinities up to 30% causing higher mortality rates [Hesni and Shabanipour: 2009]. Salinity is an important environmental factor that plays a role in maintenance of homeostasis and oxygen consumption in organisms. If an organism is subject to an environment of increased salinity, it will not have to work as hard to maintain a water balance with the environment as a result of there being more Na and Cl ions in the environment around them, causing a decrease in metabolic rate. With more salt in the environment, the organism would be taking in salt rather than having to expel it from their body to maintain balance with the environment, which requires less energy and reduces their metabolic rate. In this experiment, our group will work with a gray crayfish in order to determine the effect of addition of a fixed concentration of NaCl solution (0.65%) to the environment on specific metabolic rate. This organism was selected due to the fact that while commonly found in fresh water, crayfish can also survive in environments with various salinity levels. We will use an arated water bath, a mason jar, and a dissolved temperature probe in order to record oxygen consumption in the control and salinated environments over the course of twenty minutes. We hypothesize that if NaCl is added to the environment, the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish will increase.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, three crayfish were used, with each organism serving as its own control group. Prior to this experiment, a dishpan filled with room temperature (22 degree Celsius) water was prepared. We weighed each crayfish then placed it in the screw-top glass testing chamber that had been filled with room temperature water. The test chamber was then placed in the dishpan. The oxygen probe was screwed onto the top of the chamber and an initial oxygen concentration reading was taken. At 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, the oxygen concentration was read again. After 20 minutes the probe was removed and the volume of water the crayfish was in during the experiment was determined by pouring the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder. For the salinity measurements, the same crayfish was used. The chamber was refilled with room temperature water mixed with a 0.65% NaCl concentration and placed in the filled dishpan. Once again, a baseline reading was taken as well as readings at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes and the volume of the water the crayfish was in during the experiment was determined at the end of 20 minutes. The process was repeated for each crayfish. A paired t-test was used to evaluate the data with a one-tailed alternative hypothesis in which H_A:x_(experimental group)< x_(control group). 


Results:
For all 3 crayfish, specific metabolic rate following addition of salinity to the environment was lower than specific metabolic rate under control conditions. The average specific metabolic rate for control conditions was 1.135 and the average specific metabolic rate for experimental conditions was 0.435 mgO_2*g^(-1)*min^(-1). The results of the paired t-test indicated a t-stat value of 2.067 with df = 2 and a P-value of 0.174. Each crayfish served as its own control. Specific metabolic rate refers to the amount of oxygen consumed by each animal per minute and is found by multiplying the change in O2 concentration by the total volume of water in the experimental chamber and dividing this by time, multiplied by the weight of the animal. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported as we believed that addition of NaCl to the environment would cause an increase in specific metabolic rate rather than the observed decrease. We can reject the null hypothesis on the basis that addition of NaCl to the environment did cause a difference in specific metabolic rate, resulting in lower specific metabolic rate following addition of NaCl to the environment. Although the mean specific metabolic rate following addition of NaCl to the environment was lower than that of the control group, it was not significantly lower (t-stat = 2.067, df = 2, P = 0.174). We most likely got these results because aquatic organisms such as the crayfish must maintain a water balance with their environments, and therefore, if there is an increased concentration of Na and Cl in the external environment, the crayfish will be taking in these ions to maintain equilibrium rather than actively expelling these ions, which means they will be doing less work since this process requires less energy, and their metabolic rate will decrease. A different study found that increasing salinity of the environment of a crayfish beyond 10% resulted in increasing mortality and increased moulting [Hesni and Shabanipour: 2009]. This further demonstrates the role of salinity in homeostatic balance and every day functioning of the crayfish not only in oxygen consumption and metabolic rate, but in processes such as moulting as well. Limitations to our experiment included the number of crayfish we were able to test as well as organism stress, a factor that could not be easily controlled as some organisms may have been more susceptible to the stress of being handled and moved than others. Additionally, our test was not statistically significant. If we were to perform another experiment, it would be interesting to test crayfish of different species such as the blue crayfish or the signal crayfish to see if results varied across species. Additionally, it could also be interesting to test across different crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimp.
