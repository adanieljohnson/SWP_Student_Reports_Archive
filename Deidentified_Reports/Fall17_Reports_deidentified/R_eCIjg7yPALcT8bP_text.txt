Title: Utilizing Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts to determine the optimal light intensity for maximal Percent Change in absorbance of Light.

Abstract:
In photosynthetic organisms, chloroplasts extract energy from light photons in a form of energized electrons that are utilized in electron transport mechanisms of ATP synthesis. In this experiment, the model organism, Spinacia oleracea, was utilized to determine the effects of light intensity on percent change in absorbance, measuring the photosynthetic activity within the electron transport chain involving photosystems 1 and 2. Lights portrayed role in initiation of photosynthetic activity, led to the hypothesis: if Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts are placed in different light intensities, there will be an observed optimal light intensity for photosynthetic activity. The control group contained chloroplasts placed under natural light, and the experimental groups contained chloroplasts under varying light intensities, due to manipulation of lumen intensity of the light bulb. Absorbance measurements were collected and percent change at ten minutes was calculated using baseline values. Results demonstrated that as light intensity increased, percent absorbance increased relative to natural light.  From these observations, the hypothesis is rejected, and light intensity did not demonstrate an optimum, but a linear increase relative to increasing light intensity. This conclusion demons

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is central to the metabolic activity of plants, as it converts solar radiation into energy used in cellular processes and metabolism, thus making it a vital mechanism. To begin the photosynthesis pathway, light radiation hits photosystems one and two, exciting electrons, creating a proton gradient that allows ATP synthase pump to phosphorylate ADP into ATP [Cooper: 2000]. The by-products of this stage travel to the light independent cycle and Calvin Cycle to reduce carbons into glucose and additional ATP [Cooper: 2000]. More specifically within the light dependent reaction, light photons enter the photocenters of PS 1 and PS2 which each contain antenna pigment molecules, that absorb the light photon energy [Cooper: 2000]. As light hits PS2, energy causes electrons to be excited, binding to plastiquinone, to stimulate cleavage of water, releasing hydrogens [Fromme, et.al: 2005]. This creates the proton gradient needed for ATP synthase to phosphorylate ATP [Fromme, et.al: 2005]. As a result, PS1 utilizes absorbed light energy to reduce electrons from NAD+ to NADPH, which are then replaced by electrons from the PS2 plastiquinone electron carrier [Fromme, et.al: 2005]. After absorption, energy is transferred to chlorophyll reaction center where the excited electrons travel down the electron transport chain, creating a photochemically generated electrochemical gradient thus creating usable ATP energy [Cooper: 2000].  
Due to photosynthesis’s dependence on light to excite electrons into the rest of the pathway, light is a key determinant in the rate and efficiency of photosynthesis.  In an experiment conducted on Lolium plants, scientists found that average rates of photosynthesis increased with increasing light intensity, and then leveled out at 2500 ft-candles at a constant rate despite increasing light intensity [Wilson: 1969]. In a similar study conducted on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), easterni red oak (Qtercus borealis miaxima), white oak (Qutercuts alba L.) and dogwood (Corwutsflorida,L.),varied light intensity demonstrated that photosynthesis in loblolly pine constantly increased relative light intensity [Kramer:1944]. However, in the remaining species photosynthetic rate increased to its maximum at on third of the maximum light intensity before leveling off to a constant rate [Kramer:1944]. Each of these experiments consistently demonstrate that light intensity is not only a key determinant in photosynthesis, but a higher light intensity will result in a higher photosynthetic output until a certain level of light intensity is reached. The cellular component of the relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis is an important aspect of understanding how an increased rate of photosynthesis is produced. In an article describing the cellular mechanisms of photosynthesis in plants, the experimenters drew observations that under low light intensity conditions, plants rely on the energy distribution between PS 1 and PS2, that form the electron transport chain, thus depending on how well antenna pigments can capture energy and deliver to the reaction center [Ruban: 2009]. As light intensity increases, reaction centers encounter more photon energy that can be reduced and allow for increased energy production as NAD+ can be reduced to NADPH [Ruban: 2009].  Thus, light intensity affects how reduced the electron transport chain becomes, affecting the rate of photosynthesis [Ruban: 2009]. 
Like Lolium plants and the hardwoods described, Spinacia oleracea utilize similar processes during photosynthesis, so it is expected that their rate of photosynthesis will also follow parallel patterns in response to light intensity variations. Furthermore, Spinacia oleracea represent strong model organisms due to their easy reproduction, storage, and their large plethora of chloroplasts contained within each leaf in comparison to other organisms. Due to these reasons, this experiment utilized Spinacia oleracea to gain further understanding about the mechanism of photosynthesis in response to light within photosystems 1 and 2. As previous studies have shown, light intensity and photosynthetic rate will each increase relative to each other, to an extent, however, it must be addressed if there is an optimal range of light intensity which photosynthesis outputs are maximal.  
Through collected observations in the trends of photosynthesis in comparison to light intensity, it is shown that light intensity levels play a direct role at the start of the photosynthesis pathway within photosystem 1 and 2 complexes [Ke:1967]. By studying PS1 and PS, the electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts can be measured via 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), demonstrating how light affects the rate of photosynthesis [Ke:1967]. As the ETC pathway responds to light, DCPIP picks up excited electrons becoming reduced, changing color from blue to clear, which demonstrates a change in absorbance, or rate of photosynthesis [Ke:1967]. This understanding allows photosynthetic ability to be directly measured in response to light intensity via absorbance measurements over a period of time. As a result of this understanding, the independent variable utilized in this experiment was represented as light intensity which directly affected the dependent variable of the percent change in absorbance (nm) over time.  Using these observations and variables, it was hypothesized that if Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts are placed in different light intensities, there will be an optimal light intensity for photosynthesis activity, in between extreme brightness and complete darkness.



Materials and Methods:
To begin, four leaves of, Spinacia oleracea, spinach were collected from a local market and stored in a lab refrigerator. The leaves were deveined and ground in a chilled mortar and pestle where grinding buffer 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0 was added during grinding and then before drainage into cheesecloth covered beaker. The collected spinach slurry centrifuged two times, once at three minutes at 1200 rpm, and a second for ten minutes at 2800 rpm to collect maximum amounts of chloroplasts.  Then, the chloroplasts were separated into 16 tubes, in which there were three replicate tubes per experimental and control group. The tubes placed in natural light served as the control group while the remaining four groups ranging from bright to dark served as experimental groups due to their alteration of light intensities from natural light. 
The Hill reaction was assembled and all reactions included: 100mM 6.0 pH reaction buffer, water, 130mM DCPIP, 100 ul of chloroplasts, expect herbicide was not used.  After assembly, the five groups were placed under varied lumen intensities. The light intensity was altered via lumens, which is a measurement of light intensity of luminous flux, that is equal to the amount of light given off through a solid angle by a single radiating source [Kalloniatis: 2005]. Lamps each contained bulbs of different lumen intensities: 1630, 890, 600 lumens. Complete darkness was obtained by placing the plants in a closed drawer and the control group was placed on the table near a window for natural light.  Finally, absorbance’s of each tube was collected at time zero to ten minutes using a spectrometer at 600 nm.  The percent change in absorbance was calculated via the formula: % change = [(absorbance time at zero – Absorbance at time N) / Absorbance at time Zero] * 100%, and averaged per period of each group.  
Finally, data collected was statistically analyzed via a two tailed t test to determine if the means between two groups are significantly different.  This test allowed comparison the experimental and control groups to determine if there were significant differences.  All data was collected as Means +/- STD, a p value of less than 0.05 represents significant data.  



Results:
The increase in light intensities used on Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts greatly increased the percent change in absorbance of light over time in comparison to the natural light while as the light intensity decreased, percent of light absorbed also decreased. Chloroplasts exposed to complete darkness demonstrated a significant decrease in percent change in absorbance as compared to the control group (t(4)= 2.776, p= 7.79 E-7). In parallel to the trends of chloroplasts in darkness, chloroplasts exposed to a light intensity of 600 lumens demonstrated a significant increase in change in absorbance in comparison to natural light (t(4)= , p= 0.0022). Unlike the other groups, the chloroplasts exposed to 890 lumens portrayed an insignificant increase in percent light absorbed in comparison to the control group: (t(4)=, p= 0.057), Finally, the chloroplast group exposed to1630 lumens showed a significant increase in light absorbance change in comparison to the control group as it demonstrated the most percent change out of any group: (t(4)=3.9909, p= 0.016).


Discussion:
Within this experiment, data collection provided clarification as to how light intensity directly affects percent light absorbed, or photosynthetic rate. Plants exposed to higher intensities of light demonstrated higher percent absorbance rates when compared to the control group of natural light. Plants exposed to lower light intensities demonstrated lower percent absorbance rates when compared to natural light.  However, an optimal range of light intensity was not observed, as percent absorbed linearly increased with light intensity. Due to this, there was no observable threshold as the chloroplast became saturated with light and reactions within each photosystem continued to increase in rate. Even though the data held significant differences between experimental and control groups, the biological hypothesis of: if Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts are placed in different light intensities, there will be an optimal light intensity range for photosynthesis activity, will be rejected. However, due to the observed linear increasing trends in data, it is shown that light energy alters the photosynthetic pathway due to its role within photosystem redox reactions in the electron transport membrane.
The increase in photosynthetic activity relative to light intensity within Spinacia oleracea is also seen within other similar organisms. In an experiment conducted on Lauderia borealis, photyoplanker, not only demonstrated the importance of light in photosynthetic processes, but how their light intensity affects a light saturation curve [Marra:1978].  The results of this experiment demonstrated similar tends to our experiment in that as light intensity increased, so did photosynthetic outputs [Marra:1978]. The experiment found that due to light saturation, photosynthetic rates are flexible, and plants can more accurately respond to an environment through alterations of the light dependent cycles [Marra:1978]. In a similar experiment, the molecular mechanisms of this response to light fluctuations demonstrated that captured light energy is distributed to PS 1 and PS 2 to create the electron transport chain to create NADP [Ruban:2009]. As a result, a saturation of light availability was demonstrated to create a higher amount of available light energy within PS 1 and PS2, thus increasing the rate of photosynthesis as more reagents become available to complete the pathway [Ruban:2009].
The experiment provided significant data and trends similar to those of other experimental results, however, the experiment did not find an exact range of light intensities in which photosynthesis is optimal. In a study conducted, it found that photosystems one and two operate under photon intensities of 700 nm for PS1 and 677 nm for PSII [Caffarri: 2014]. The study not only examined the mechanism how photons are absorbed in the photosystems, but also why different intensities of light are absorbed within these photosystems [Caffarri: 2014]. The article described how this is due to the fact that photosystems I and II contain different chlorophyll centers, which absorb different types of light. [Caffarri: 2014]. In addition, due to the fact that this experiment was not able to determine a threshold for maximal photosynthesis, it demonstrated that photosynthetic was linear to light intensity. In an experiment done on the process of water splitting within PSII, data demonstrated that harsh light intensity can actually decrease photosynthetic outputs at a certain level [Barber: 1992]. The experiment observed that due to photo damage within photosystem two, the electron transport chain will be inhibited because the over saturation of light will result in a highly reduced system, in which Quinone cannot bind to its active site to initiate the ETC [Barber: 1992]. 
In addition, despite the significance of data observed within this study, there are possible sources of error that could have altered outcomes of how light intensity affects photosynthetic rates. The control group for natural light was not actually natural due to the light contamination from fluorescent light. Thus, it was difficult to accurately predict the relative amount of photons present in natural light, altering the comparable values between experimental and control. In the future, experiments should be more consistent with light intensity, in that there should be a more measureable source of light to ensure increased accuracy. The experiment was performed with light contamination, and different times of day will thus alter results concluded within this experiment. From this, a more reliable and constant source of light should be defined for natural light.  Furthermore, another source of error could have occurred due to the light manipulation. Due to the fact that a broader range of light was not used, and the fact that natural light was not in between the experimental group intensity ranges, could have be a reason that the biological hypothesis was rejected. If a larger range of light intensity was used, and natural light was not confounded, then it could be determined if there is a threshold for maximal photosynthetic activity, or if photosynthesis will linearly increase in response to light, never decreasing. In other studies, photosynthetic activity was shown to level off at a certain light intensity, and stay constant no matter the increase in light [Kramer:1944]. Thus, by increasing this light range from natural light, this experiment can better determine if the results are similar to past experiments or if new conclusions should be formed about lights correlation to photosynthesis. 
Through a collection of the observations both within this experiment on Spinacia oleracea and other studies, new questions of further study can be proposed to better understand light pathway within the photosystems.  One possible study could include ideas of more photon energy is continuously favorable, and never decreases. For example, why does the curve for as light intensity increase photosynthetic activity also increases, but then levels off at a specific point no matter the increase in light.  This question would allow scientists to better understand the machinery involved within photosystems to collect light energy, and why too much light energy has not been shown to create negative effects. One other possible future study could include testing how plants utilize machinery in response to maximize output of photosynthesis, that is, are plants able to manipulate the types of machinery made and synthesized within cells to maximize different light intensities. These future questions can help clarify exactly how light manipulates photosynthesis and how different light intensities affect this pathway.  
Overall, the experiment demonstrated the effects of light intensity not only on photosynthetic output, but also on the electron transport systems in conjunction with photosystems one and two.  The observations allow future experimentation on this mechanism of the photosystems within the electron transport chain as a result of light manipulation and how excited electrons affect this pathway.  Further photosystem study will demonstrate the role light plays in photosynthesis, and the flexibility of plant machinery to respond to changes within their environment.
