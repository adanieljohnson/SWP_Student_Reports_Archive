Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Chloride on the Gastrocnemius Muscle`s Susceptibility to Tetany

Abstract:
In our experiment we studied the Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens, and the effect that the calcium blocker lanthanum chloride had on its gastrocnemus muscle’s time until tetany. We hypothesized that the lanthanum chloride will cause a decrease in the amount of time it took for the muscle to achieve tetany. To test our hypothesis we subjected three frog legs to a constant amplitude of 0.2 V but changed the frequency in intervals of 2, 4, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100, stopping when tetany was achieved. We tested controlll first then treatment second repeating the procedure. Our results were that for every leg the treatment achieved tetany at a lower frequency then the controlll and the controlll took twice as long to reach tetany. We saw that there was a significent difference between the treatment and controlll group as our p_value was 0.003442, t_stat=17, and d.f.=9. From these results, we can say our hypothesis stood as the lanthanum chloride (treatment) group had a decreased time reaching tetany relative to when they were the controlll group.

Introduction:
We are studying the time it takes for the gastrocnemus muscle of a Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens, to reach tetany and how adding the Calcium blocker lanthanum chloride affects this time. The Northern Leopard Frog is an example of Krogh`s Principle as it is an ideal organism to use for this type of experiment where we are monitoring the leg muscles as the gastrocnemus muscles are very prominent in frogs, which leap in order to move [Layne: 1993]. In addition, it is a very convenient size in that it isn’t so big that it cannot be manipulated/moved with our hands and at the same time it isn’t so small that we need a microscope to observe it. We experiment with lanthanum chloride as it alters the permeability of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal and the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Friedman: 1998]. Calcium ions are vital to action potentials and muscle contractions. Once depolarization occurs and the action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal the calcium ion voltage gated channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum is opened allowing the calcium ions to be released into the presynaptic terminal. [Vieira: 2015] The calcium ions allow the vesicle carrying the neurotransmitter (ACh in this case) to bind to the presynaptic membrane and the neurotransmitter to, through exocytosis diffuse across the synaptic cleft to the muscle where it will bind to the receptors on the muscle causing another action potential to travel into the muscle and down the t-tubule to the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Vieira: 2015]. There the calcium ions will be released into the sarcoplasm and bind to troponin to initiate a contraction [Vieira: 2015]. The addition of lanthanum chloride would hinder the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the presynaptic terminal and sarcoplasm therefore would alter the rate at which the neurotransmitters can be transported to the effector muscle [Vieira: 2015]. Based on this, we predict that the calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride, will lower the time it takes for the Gastrocnemius Muscle to reach tetany.

Materials and Method:
We will be using a paired t_test to analyze our results. First, we will remove the skin from the frog in a dissecting pan using dissecting needle, dissecting probe, and forceps, revealing the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle. We will then connect the gastrocnemus muscle to the force transducer, and connect the pin electrode to set up our experiment. We will then have three Rania pipiens frog legs that will each be tested as a controlll first and then as a treatment (0.2 Ml of Lanthanum Chloride) adding frog Ringer`s solution periodically to maintain organisms. We will perform the experiment three of the effect of the stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude. For the controlll test we started at a frequency of 2 Hz and then kept going up to the frequencies of 4, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100, stopping on whichever frequency caused tetany, which is marked by the series of very close peaks on the LabScribe program. The amplitude will be kept at 0.2 V for the controlll and treatment tests. In between the two tests we will allow the muscle to rest for a couple minutes (about 5) so it will be fresh for the lanthanum chloride experiment. To prepare the 1 mM lanthanum chloride solution we dissolved 12 mg into 100 Ml Ringer`s solution. After the muscle has rested we injected, using a syringe, the lanthanum chloride directly into the gastrocnemus muscle and waited two minutes to let it propagate throughout the muscle. We then repeated the same steps as the controlll and stopped stimulation after tetany was achieved. Repeat these steps for the other two frog legs. We will then determine which group, treatment or controlllled, experienced tetany first based on the graph of the LabScribe program and the frequency at which each occurred.

Results:
The general trends we saw that, as shown in figure 1 the plots were much higher for the controlll frog legs every frog and the numerical values of the controlll group were larger than their treatment counterparts for every frog. For the most part each trial/frog was the same in terms of the frequency tetany was achieved except for one treatment frog leg which was off by 1 Hz relative to the other two treatment legs. The mean frequency that tetany was achieved of the frogs without lanthanum chloride was significently greater than its mean after the injection of lanthanum chloride (t_stat=17., d.f.=9, P=0.003442).

Discussion:
From our results in figure 1 we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported as the time it took the frog legs before the injection of lanthanum chloride to achieve tetany was over double the time it took the treatment frog legs which had the lanthanum chloride injected in their gastrocnemus muscle and also our stats showed significance. In our hypothesis we said the lanthanum chloride would decrease the time it would take for tetany to be achieved which it did. The biological reason for this is that because of lanthanum chloride blocking the calcium channels not as many sarcomeres, in comparison to the controlll, will be engaged in the contraction [Caterall: 2011]. This is because there will not be as many calcium ions released because of the inhibition of the ryanodine and DHPR receptors which controlll the release of the calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum unto the sarcolemma and onto the myofibrils [Caterall: 2011]. Here they would bind to the troponin and allow for myosin binding to actin and initiate the contraction but again because there are not as many calcium ions in the treatment legs it would be to a much lesser extent [Caterall: 2011]. Therefore, it would reach tetany a lot faster because of the decreased force of contraction [Caterall: 2011]. In addition, the blockage of calcium channels would inhibit the speed at which the action potential is propagated to the neuromuscular junction and therefore the actual muscle (in this case the gastrocnemus) would not be able to withstand a high frequency of contractions without tetany since it cannot keep up as well and will be forced to succumb to tetany [Caterall: 2011]. This occurs because the calcium voltage gated channels in the presynaptic terminal are blocked and therefore there will not be as many calcium ions to bind to the vesicles containing the neurotransmitter (ACh) that will illicit an action potential which will lead to the contraction [Caterall: 2011]. This study we conducted is relatively reminiscent of another study where they used lanthanum chloride and tested how its inhibition on calcium channels affected the gravitropic response of Snapdragon Spikes [Friedman: 1998]. In this experiment they proposed that because the gravitropic ability of the Snapdragon was inhibited by the lanthanum chloride that the gravitropic response of the snapdragon`s shoots could be controlllled through a Ca2+ dependent cascade involving the “modulation of cytosolic calcium ions,” [Friedman: 1998]. This relates to our study as they were testing how the inhibition of calcium channels affects the gravitropic response while we studied its effect on the susceptibility of muscles to reach tetany. Furthermore, to our knowledge there was no evidence of error and therefore no sources of error. There is no other explanation for our results as the logic (detailed above) matched the results. The only thing that could have had some impact on the numbers but would have not altered the overall result of the experiment is that maybe the frog legs did not rest enough in between the controlll and treatment experiments leading to a faster tetany for the treatment. To compensate for this, we should do an experiment with six frog legs where we make three legs controlll, three legs treatment or we should do the experiment and give more than ample time for the legs to recover from the controlll experiment just to ensure validity.

Figure 1. Frequency at Which Tetany Was Achieved vs. Presence of Lanthanum Chloride 
Representation of the results, comparing the frog legs` time (in terms of frequency) until they reached tetany. Standard deviation error bars were placed over the plots for each frog leg to compare the variance between the averages of the frog legs. Standard Deviation for the controlll group was 0 and for the treatment group it was 0.577. The blue plots represent the frog legs before the injection of lanthanum chloride and the orange represent the frog leg after lanthanum chloride. Our sample size was three Rania pipiens legs. The mean frequency at which tetany was achieved before lanthanum chloride was injected was 10 Hz., after lanthanum chloride it was 4.33 Hz.
