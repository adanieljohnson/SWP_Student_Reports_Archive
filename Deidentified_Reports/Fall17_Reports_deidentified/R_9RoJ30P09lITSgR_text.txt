Title: Effect of Calcium Channel Blockers on Voltage Threshold for Muscle Contraction in Rana Pipens

Abstract:
We studied the effect of calcium channel blockers on the voltage threshold required to stimulate a contraction in a rana pipens leg. We suggested that injecting the gastrocnemius muscle of the leg with lanthanum chloride would increase the voltage threshold of the muscle contraction. Lanthanum chloride is a calcium channel blocker. The release of calcium ion is what triggers the contractile mechanism of the muscle. Therefore, a lack of calcium release would inhibit the muscle contraction. To test this hypothesis, we electrically stimulated the sciatic nerve and recorded the voltage threshold of the rana pipens leg. We recorded the voltage threshold before and after injecting the leg with lanthanum chloride in order to have a control for each leg. Our results did not support our hypothesis or provide significant data in order to draw conclusions. This could be because lanthanum chloride my not target the specific calcium channels responsible for muscle contraction or because calcium channels are not completely responsible for muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
Action potentials in motor neurons stimulate the release of calcium ion from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscles. Calcium ion entering through voltage-gated plasma membrane channels is what stimulates nerves to release neurotransmitters [Protti: 1996]. The release of calcium activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber and the reuptake of calcium allows the muscle fiber to relax once again. Calcium ion binds to troponin, which moves the position of tropomyosin uncovering myosin binding sites on the actin within the muscle. This allows myosin to form cross-bridges with myosin, contracting the muscle. Therefore, the use of a calcium channel blocker should impair muscle contraction by not allowing these cross bridges to form between actin and myosin. Therefore, a higher voltage of electric stimulation would probably be necessary to trigger a contraction. One study found that some calcium channel blockers blocked action potentials and inhibited synaptic transmission [Protti:1996]. Lanthanum chloride is a calcium channel blocker that will be used in this experiment. Rana pipens is a good model organism to measure muscle contraction because the sciatic nerve is very visible and the muscle contractions can be easily observed. The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether or not a calcium channel blocker will inhibit muscle contraction in the leg of rana pipens. We hypothesize that the addition of calcium channel blockers should affect the voltage threshold to contract the gastrocnemic muscle of the rana pipens leg. 

Materials and Methods:
We were provided with three rana pipens legs. For each leg we first removed the skin. As we were preparing each leg for the experiment, we were sure to keep it moist with Ringer’s solution. Next, we freed and exposed the sciatic nerve from the muscles in the thigh. Then the gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the bone at the Achilles tendon. The gastrocnemius was tied to the force transducer and the rest of the leg was pinned down. The electrode stimulator was placed around the sciatic nerve. For the first myogram, the leg was not injected with anything. We started with a stimulus of 0.1 V and increased by 0.1 V until we got a response. Once we got a response and recorded the voltage threshold, we then injected the gastrocnemius muscle with 0.2 mL of lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker. After injecting, we waited 8 minutes before we repeated the same process of stimulating the nerve with 0.1 V of electricity and increasing by 0.1 V until getting a response. The data was read the same way and compare to the previous control measurement. This process was repeated for the other two legs. A two-tailed t-test was used to analyze the data. 

Results:
Our results were different for each leg. In the first leg measure, the voltage threshold increased from 0.3 V to 0.5 V, supporting our hypothesis. The second set of measurements showed a decrease in voltage threshold from 0.5 V to 0.2 V. The third showed no change with the voltage threshold remaining at 0.2V. The first set of measurements had a p-value of 0.141. The second set of measurements had a p-value of 0.212. The third set of measurements had a p value of 0. The average p value was 0.84, meaning there was no significant difference in our data. Figure 1 shows that there was no significant difference in voltage thresholds and the standard deviation is quite large. 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis that the voltage threshold for a muscle contraction would increase after the injection of calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride. A study done in 1989 found that both calcium channel agonists and antagonists caused paralysis. This suggests that calcium channels may not be the mechanism completely responsible for muscle activation [Fill and Best: 1989]. Our results may be inconclusive because of the specific calcium channel blocker used. Calcium receptors may be sensitive to different types of blockers. It may be possible that the calcium channel blocker we used doesn’t target the specific calcium channels that are responsible for muscle contraction. We could have also waited for a longer time before taking the second measurement so that the lanthanum chloride would have more time to take effect. For future studies, a larger sample size for the experiment would be beneficial.
