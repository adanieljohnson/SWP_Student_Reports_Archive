Title: The effect of temperature on the photosynthesis  of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Living organisms need energy to sustain life. Plants capture and store energy by photosynthesis. Energy is then is released by glycolysis and respiration.  The goal of this lab was to see how photosynthesis rates change with temperature change. It was thought that photosynthesis would work the best at 20 degrees Celsius since it mimics the growing season temperature of Spinach oleracea, spinach, the best.  This was done by running an assay to track the Hill reaction using DCPIP. The color changes from deep blue to colorless as photosynthesis rates increase. This reaction was done by placing tubes in 0 degrees,20 degrees, and 40 degrees Celsius.  The absorbances were checked every 10 mins for 30 mins. The data was recorded. An ANOVA test was ran and it was determined that 0 degrees Celsius was significantly different than the other groups and had the best rate of photosynthesis. 

Introduction:
Cellular processes require energy. This energy comes in the form of energy stored in chemical bonds, energy stored as an oxidation-reduction(redox) potential. An electrical or chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer. Plants capture and store energy via photosynthesis.  Stored energy is subsequently released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm and respiration that occurs in the mitochondria.   During photosynthesis light dependent reactions generate most of the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. The Hill reaction( 2 H2O + 2A →2AH2O2 A= electron acceptor) measures ATP production. 
DCPIP is an electron acceptor. DCPIP can be used in an assay to determine if environmental conditions, chemical,and other factors affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. If reduction occurs in the assays the reactions turns from deep blue to colorless. 
Photosynthesis occurs at an optimum temperature[Mackey:2013]. Photosynthesis occurs by electron transport.  Temperature has been shown to affect the electron transport chain of Deschampsia caespitosa [Yamori:2005].   The change of absorbance will be greater in the chloroplasts in room temperature(20 degrees Celsius) due to spinach growing season being in the spring and this temperature most mimics springtime temperatures. 


Materials and Methods:
Cool a mortar and pestle, medium size beaker and 3 mL centrifuge tubes. Then, remove the central veins from 4 medium sized spinach leaves. Add 10 mLs of pH 8 400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer(cold) to the spinach leaves and grind up the leaves. Add 10 mLs more of grinding buffer and strain the leaves. Transfer the stained liquid to a cool centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 200xG for three mins at four degrees celsius. Pour the supernatant into another cold centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the supernatant at 1000xG for 10 minutes at four degrees Celsius. Pour the supernatant into another centrifuge tube and set aside. Resuspend the pellet with 20mLs of grinding buffer to the pellet.  Use the resuspended pellet as the chloroplasts to do the study.  For the study, we need a blank to zero the spectrophotometer with 8 mLs of water and 100 mM Phosphate pH 6.5 buffer at 600nM absorbance. In order to test temperature on photosynthesis rates, we will  test 3 reactions at 0 degrees celsius, 3 reactions at 20 degrees celsius, and 3 reactions at 40 degrees celsius. All of the reaction tubes had 6mLs of water, 2mLs of 130mM DCPIP, and 2 mLs of 100 mM Phosphate pH 6.5 buffer. To start the reaction 100 microliters of chloroplasts were added to the test tubes  and the absorbances were checked with the spectrophotometer at 600nM. The test tubes were put in the appropriate temperature water bath.  The absorbances of the test tubes were checked every 10 mins for 30 mins and recorded. An ANOVA test was ran to check the significance of the data. 

Results:
Based off the ANOVA test, the test tubes at 0 degrees Celsius was the most significant with the p Value of 0.00782.  The test tubes at 0 degrees Celsius had a much larger percent of change than the test tubes at 20 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius. According to ANOVA the difference between he test tubes at 20 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius were not significant. 

Discussion:
As the temperature decreased the rate of photosynthesis decreased. Our hypothesis was not supported. Figure 1 shows how big of a difference the rate of change was between 0 degrees Celsius and the other temperatures.  The test tubes at 0 degrees Celsius had the largest change in absorbance. According to a study done by Hew, he saw decreasing rates of photosynthesis when the temperature rises from 20 degrees to 40 degrees Celsius [Hew,1969].  It is weird that the ideal temperature for photosynthesis was at 0 degrees Celsius. This could be to the ice bath being right next to the window and the other tubes were put in a water bath that was by no windows. According to Sharkey, supply of light is a limiting factor of photosynthesis[Sharkey,1985]. Next time, we need to make sure all of the tubes are under the same amount of light.
