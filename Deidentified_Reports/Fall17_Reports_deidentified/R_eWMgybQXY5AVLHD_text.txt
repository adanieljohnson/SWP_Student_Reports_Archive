Title: The Effect of Temperature on the Specific Metabolic Rate in Procambarus sp.

Abstract:
This study serves to investigate whether change in temperature has an effect on the specific metabolic rate in Procambarus sp. We hypothesized that a decrease in water temperature would cause the specific metabolic rate to also decrease. We used three similar sized Procambarus sp. and placed them each in test chambers filled with first 22C water and then 10C water to compare the two different temperature environments. By measuring the amount of dissolved oxygen concentration, we were then able to calculate the specific metabolic rate. Our data was applied to a two-tailed T test which showed that our results were not significantly different due to the p-value of 0.969. We concluded that we could not confirm our hypothesis because our results showed that these temperatures did not have an overall effect on the specific metabolic rates. 

Introduction:
During aerobic respiration, glucose is broken down into CO2 and releases many high energy electrons that are captured in the FAD and NAD proteins. These proteins transport the high energy electrons to the electron transport system that uses the energy from these electrons to convert ADP into ATP [Bio 114 Lab Manual, 2017]. In order to remove the electrons off the transport system, oxygen is required. This is important because the amount of oxygen consumed is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended, which is the specific metabolic rate. [Barnhart]. We want to know whether or not temperature will have an effect on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. A study involving the examination of metabolic rate in an endothermic used Mus musculus as its model organism. They found that a mouse at 25C or at 35C consumed more oxygen and produced more carbon dioxide than one between 30 and 31.5C. This range where the mouse expends the least amount of energy is the thermo-neutral zone. [Zelickr, 2013]. Contrasting to this study, our experiment focuses on ectotherms who cannot maintain constant body temperature by behavioral means, so we assume that the metabolic rate would decrease as the temperature decreases. We are using Procambarus sp. as our model organism because as ectotherms, it is easy to alter their body temperature and affect metabolism. [Bio 114 Lab Manual, 2017]. One source explains how crayfish as a whole are ideal model organisms because of their ubiquity and are readily obtainable. [Larson, 2016]. Overall, we hypothesize that if the environment is cooler than room temperature at 10C, the specific metabolic rate will be less than it is in the room temperature environment of 22C.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment utilizes three similar sized Procambarus sp. To begin, each individual crayfish is weighed and the screw-top glass testing chamber is filled with 22C oxygenated water. The model organism is placed in the test chamber and the top is screwed on tightly to make sure no oxygen is getting in. The chamber is placed in a dishpan filled with the same 22C oxygenated water. The dissolved oxygen probe is inserted and the instrument is turned on to begin recording the dissolved oxygen concentration. A baseline reading is recorded originally and then again, every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. The water from the test chamber is poured into a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of water which is then applied to the equation of specific metabolic rate which is SMR = (∆O2 (mg/L) x volume H2O(L)) / (Time (min) x weight (g)) This process is repeated on the same Procambarus sp. and then carried out on the other two organisms. The three organisms will each produce a specific metabolic rate for the 10C water and the 22C, which is then compared with a two-tailed T test. 

Results:
Due to the application of a two-tailed T test, our results are not significantly different due to the p-value of 0.745. The average specific metabolic rate in the room temperature condition of 22oC was 0.0042 with a standard deviation of 0.00087. The average metabolic rate for the 10oC conditions was 0.0038 with a standard deviation of 0.0019.

Discussion:
Due to the p-value of 0.969, there is no significant difference between our control group versus the experimental group and we conclude that the temperature at 10C and 25C has no effect on specific metabolic rate. Our hypothesis that the lower temperature would have lower specific metabolic rate cannot be supported even though our slightly different averages produced numbers that were true to this. Some possible sources of error in our experiment include the fact that we were not exactly monitoring and maintaining the temperatures of the water. The testing chamber also may not have been closed tightly, allowing oxygen to get in. In a future experiment, we would want to improve by increasing to a larger sample size, testing over a longer amount of time, and fixing these errors of water temperature and oxygen. Similarly to our study, but not using aquatic organisms, they tested the relationship between environmental temperature and metabolic rate in Gryllus assimilis. This experiment produced results that proved the metabolic rate of the crickets was much lower at 10C than it was at room temperature. [Baker, 2015]. Because of the biological process of thermal regulation in ectotherms, our results should have been similar to this study, but clearly there were sources of error. An idea for another study would be to compare the metabolic rates of aquatic animals compared to land animals.
