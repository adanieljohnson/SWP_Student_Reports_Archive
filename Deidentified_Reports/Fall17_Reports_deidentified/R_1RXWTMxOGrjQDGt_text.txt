Title: Optimization of root:shoot length ratio in Vigna radiate grown under different light intensities

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to study the relationship between root:shoot length ratio and light intensity in the growing environment. It was assumed that higher light intensity results in higher root:shoot length ratio. The study was performed on two groups of randoMly selected Vigna radiate (mung bean) seeds. One treatment group germinated and grew completely in darkness for 14 days. The other group germinated and grew under 100% natural light for the same duration of time. The two groups were provided with the same amount of nutrient every day. The root:shoot length ratio of the light group (1.012  0.168)  is statistically significently larger than that of the dark group (0.429  0.063) (P < 0.5). In conclusion, increased light availability promotes more growth in root length relative to shoot length in mung bean seedlings.

Introduction:
There is always competition for natural resources such as sunlight among and within plant species. Sometimes, environmental changes are deliberately planned in agriculture to maximize yield. As an illustration, a greenhouse maintains the optimum temperature for plant growth even in winter. Nevertheless, many environment variabilities are not controlllled by human beings. Northern European countries are known for the short sunshine hours throughout the year, to raise an example. Thus, light intensity should be taken into consideration when planning objectives for farming in those countries. 
In this paper, we explore the effect of light intensity on resource allocation in plants. Most terrestrial plants require light for photosynthesis in order to supply nutrients for their own growth. It is commonly assumed that plants optimize their resource use for better adaptation to the environment they are in [Bloom: 1985]. If the rate of respiration exceeds rate of photosynthesis in complete darkness, the plant ought to respond to the environment through physiological and morphological adjustments. Phenotypic plasticity is believed to be induced changes in phenotype that plants adopt to adjust to the environment [Loomis: 1953; Grime: 1986]. The influence of light intensity on resource allocation was evaluated by measuring the length of roots and shoots of the seedlings. 
Mung bean (Vigna radiata) was selected for the present study, because it is commonly used in other studies for their ability to germinate and grow in complete darkness. In comparison to mung bean grown under 100% natural sunlight, we expect dark-grown mung bean to allocate more resources to its shoot growth, because shoot is the place for photosynthesis to occur. On the contrary, it should not be necessary for mung bean exposed to natural sunlight to devote much resource to shoot growth. Therefore, we assume that the root:shoot length ratio is higher in the light treatment group than in the dark treatment group. 


Materials and Method:
The work was conducted at Wake Forest University, located in the city of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Analyses were carried out in the Biology laboratory. 
For the experiment, 90 mung bean seeds were evenly planted in 6 pots with equal amount of vermiculite. We manually irrigated the plants with water every day until each pot was dripping. 
To provide different light intensities, 3 pots of mung bean seedlings were kept inside the laboratory cabinet since the day they were planted so that they grow under 0% of light. The other half of the seedlings grew in the laboratory green house, where they were exposed to 100% of natural sunlight. The duration of light each day was completely dependent on the weather of that day. 
The analysis was carried out 14 days after sowing. Every seedling from each pot was moved out of vermiculite carefully with water. A few of the seedlings were abnormally shorter than others due to broken stem. The measurement excluded any seedlings that were broken. 
The whole plant length (WL) of individual seedling was first measured, then shoot length (SL) was measured. The root lengths (RL) were calculated from the two previous measurements as RL = WL - SL. Root: shoot ratio (R:S) was calculated as R:S = RL/SL. Data were analyzed by one-tailed two sample t_test (α=0.05). Values reported are means of three replicates.


Results:
Figure 1 shows the effect of different light intensity treatments on the root:shoot length ratio of mung bean. The average root:shoot length ratio of 0% light treatment group (n=3, x=0.429, s.d.=0.063) was statistically significently smaller than the average root:shoot length ratio of 100% light treatment group (n=3, x=1.012, s.d.=0.168) (t_test=5.63, d.f.=4, p=0.0024 < 0.05).

Discussion:
The present study supports our hypothesis; it has demonstrated that an increase in light intensity results in a significent increase (136%) in root:shoot length ratio of mung bean seedlings. Conceptually, one understands that pursuit for light is the priority for a dark-grown plant. Shoot and leaves are the parts of a plant which absorb sunlight. As a result, dark-grown plants allocate more resources to shoot growth. This result has a significent meaning to both agriculture and forestry. It suggests one can promote the desired growth in root or shoot by altering the environmental light intensity. 
Our result was consistent with previous studies that suggest there is a steady increase in root:shoot mass ratio as the light availability increases [Cronin: 2003; Wilson: 1988]. However, numerous studies have focused on the biomass growth in plants, while our study focused on the length growth. 
The increase in root biomass relative to shoot biomass under higher light intensity is attributed to carbon/nitrogen allocation in plants [eWegener: 2015; Bittar: 2013]. The C/N allocation may also help explain the overall growth of root relative to shoot. Nevertheless, length and mass are two different characteristics. It would be wrong to acknowledge that increase in one is associated with increase in another. There is still a lack of explanation for the growth in length of root relative to shoot under higher light availability. Stem elongation is promoted by the plant hormone auxin. We suggest future studies analyze the change in hormone level in plants at different light intensities. In addition, we propose future studies should add more treatment groups of intermediate light intensities. The present study was performed on two extreme light intensities (0% and 100%). A more detailed study would provide better evidence for the relationship between root:shoot length ratio and light intensity.
