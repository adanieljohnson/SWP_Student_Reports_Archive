Title: The effect of salinity on metabolic rate within Procambris sp.

Abstract:
Environmental systems, especially aquatic systems, are characterized by a wide range abiotic factors, including salinity and temperature, etc. Especially, salinity, as one of the most important factors, acts on physiological processes like metabolism due to more energy expansion required for osmoregulation. The main objective of the study was to determine the capability of salinity to alter the metabolic rate which can be indicated by oxygen consumption. It was hypothesized that salinity would increase the specific metabolic rate within crayfish. I examined how specific metabolic rates changed in response to 0.73% NaCl water . Comparing the controlll and experimental groups, there was a large percentage increase in specific metabolic rate but it failed to reach significance (P>0.05).  Hence, the increase in water salinity did not significently lower the metabolic rate. This result opposed the hypothesis probably because of the small sample of subjects, and the effect of salinity on metabolism remains to be explored.

Introduction:
The physiology of crustacean is usually changeable to intrinsic factors like body size and extrinsic factors such as salinity, pH, and temperature. One of the most important physiological processes from autotrophs to heterotrophs is metabolism which involves using a group of mitochondrial enzymes to convert high-energy molecules to low-energy ones, and capturing the energy released to convert ADP to ATP [Johnson: 2017]. ATP is considered as the energy currency of life which is mainly stored in cytoplasm and used in all energy-requiring mechanisms.  In many recent studies, salinity has been proven to be a vital abiotic factor influencing on population distribution of estuarian systems [Allan: 2006]. A reasonable conjecture from this phenomenon is that salinity has an effect on amount of energy expansion. The interaction with saline environment increases amount of osmoregulation required to return body salt to the normal level. This ATP-powered mechanism might drive higher ATP production by more rapid metabolic rate.   To explore the relationship between salinity and metabolic rate, three crayfish were selected because they are typical freshwater ectotherms with high sensitivity to water salinity and appropriate size. Each crayfish acted as its own controlll and experimental groups. Metabolic rate can be indicated by carbon dioxide production or oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption was preferred as it could be easily measured with an oxygen meter. In this investigation, it was hypothesized that increase in salinity would increase the metabolic rate. 

Materials and Method:
A crayfish was weighed and gently put into a glass testing chamber with a screw-top. The glass was filled with oxygen-saturated water until the top of water overflew slightly, and was then carefully placed in a dishpan with half-filled room-temperature water. A dissolved oxygen meter was inserted into the bottle top. Some water overflew during the insertion and it was made sure that there was no air space left in the chamber. After the reading on the instruction stabilized, the initial oxygen concentration was taken and recorded in a raw data table; at the same time, the stop watch was started. Subsequently, readings of oxygen concentration after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes were recorded in the table. The probe was removed, and water was poured out carefully into a graduated cylinder without dropping the crayfish. After that, the crayfish was gently taken out of the chamber. 100 Ml of 6.5% NaCl was measured with a cylinder and poured into the chamber. Next, after filling rest of the chamber with oxygen-saturated water, it was put back into the dishpan and the crayfish was placed inside again. The same setting-up and measuring procedure with the dissolved oxygen probe and the instrument was repeated. The readings of oxygen concentrations at the interval of 5 minutes were recorded into the table. And volume of salt water was measured with the cylinder and written down in the table. The other two crayfish were tested with the same method.  The specific metabolic rates for each crayfish in freshwater and salt water was calculated with the equation: Specific metabolic rate= [△O2(mg/L)*volume H2O(L)]/[Time(min)*weight(g)]. Instead of subtracting the specific metabolic rates in freshwater from those in salt water, percentage difference was calculated due to the variation in crayfish body size and presented in Table 1. The average specific metabolic rates in the two salinity conditions were calculated and displayed in a bar graph in Figure 2. Paired t_test was used to compare the controlll and experimental groups, and the level of significance was set to p<0.05.

Results:
According to table 1, two crayfish have higher specific metabolic rate, especially the metabolic rate of crayfish 3, which increase by 68.1%. But crayfish 1 revealed a decrease by 2.9% in specific metabolic rate after addition of salt water.   Overall, the average percentage change between the specific metabolic rate in freshwater and salt water is positive (see Table 1), indicating the general increase in respiratory rate by 30.6%. Also Figure 2 showed that the average specific metabolic rate increased from 0.00121 to 0.0016.  Comparing the experimental group to the controlll group, the pair t_test revealed that p=0.119>0.05 (t_stat = 1.66, d.f. = 2).

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that a significent increase in metabolic rate in response to the addition of saline water would be shown. But data opposed this hypothesis and revealed that the increase in salinity had no effect on rate of metabolism, as the values of specific metabolic rate were not significently higher with higher water salinity compared to the controlll group (P>0.05).  

The absence of significent difference in metabolic rate also suggested that the crayfish might be well adapted with external environments with variations in salinity. However, the practical significance of this result is still questionable, as there was a relatively large average percentage increase in metabolic rate (30.6%) after the increment in salinity. This was probably due to the limited sample size of subjects and relatively low salinity, so improvements could be made by investigating on a larger number of crayfish and preparing water with much higher salinity. 

In an animal completely adapting to freshwater existence, increase in salinity in living environment triggered accumulation of salts within crayfish. This is because the external salt concentration is considerably higher than salt concentration within crayfish and salt ions diffuse passively down the concentration gradient through membrane [Allan: 2006]. Also, the interaction with the saline environment does not only involve osmoregulatory cost. The gills, where ventilation takes place, is the main site of ion water leakage [Claireaux: 1999]. Therefore, the energy for compensation for osmotic and ionic loss would also enhance metabolic expenditure and rate[Claireaux: 1999].  

The effect of salinity is comparable in other organisms and reflected by dependent variables like oxygen consumption and survival. In a study on relationship between oxygen consumption and salinity by Allan, significent difference in oxygen consumption was observed over salinity range 5%-45% at 15℃ (p<0.05) [Allan: 2006].  Also, significent differences in routine metabolic rates and swimming velocities of milkfish were observed between salinities (15%, 35%, 55%) in an investigation by Swanson [Swanson: 1998].  The major limitation of this research was the small sample size and therefore low reliability of the results, so further investigation would be based on a much larger sample size (at least 10 crayfishes). Apart from this modification, the categorical variable (freshwater and salt water) will be replaced with a quantitative variable (water salinity), allowing finding the correlation between salinity and the resultant specific metabolic rate. 

Even though there are strong evidences suggesting the significent effect of salinity on the metabolism of aquatic organisms, there are still large amounts of species unaffected by this factor. The exposure to aquatic systems characterized by a wide range of salinity makes them tolerant and well adapted to survive in hypersaline environment. These groups of animals reflect the evolutionary traits on osmoregulatory, ionic regulatory and metabolic performance [McNamara: 1983].  However, human-induced salinity change in aquatic systems, especially the release of industrial wastewater into streams, still threatens the aquatic lives.
