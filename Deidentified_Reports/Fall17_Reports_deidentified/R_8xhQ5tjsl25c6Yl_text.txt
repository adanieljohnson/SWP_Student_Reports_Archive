Title: Intraspecific Interactions in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Oxygen plays a crucial role in the energy supply of Betta splendens. This energy is used for essential, life-sustaining functions as well as for competitive advantages. We are interested in the affect of varying levels of oxygen on the aggressive behavior of Betta splendens. In order to do this we will calculate overall aggressiveness score for male Betta fish in normal oxygen conditions and elevated oxygen conditions. We found that the Betta fish in higher oxygen conditions generally had lower aggressiveness scores than those in high oxygen conditions. 

Introduction:
Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration in animal cells. Without this necessary reactant animal cells would be unable to produce the energy to properly function. Therefore, in environments with low oxygen concentration, organisms will experience an energy deficit and must first allocate energy to function needed to sustain life and then to other unnecessary functions. Under the principles of natural selection an organism’s main goal is to pass on its offspring to the next generation. Intraspecific competition, competition between members of the same species, often poses a threat for other males looking for female mates as is the case with Betta splendens. Therefore, many animals, such as Betta fish, will attempt to harm or even kill potential competing males. Betta fish do this primarily by pulling off the fins of competing males, which lowers the other male’s chance of mating as these colorful fins are often what attracts a female to a male (George:1964). There is a sequence of behaviors that precede these violent actions, each increasingly more aggressive. This aggressive behavior, however, has a cost to the Betta splendens who exhibit it as it depletes a large amount of Betta’s available energy which. Due to the large energy expenditure necessary to exhibit these violent actions, Betta Splendens risk not having enough energy to complete functions vital to sustaining life such as respiration. We predict that in normal oxygen concentrated conditions, Betta splendens will exhibit less of these aggressive behaviors towards other males than when in high oxygen concentration because the higher availability of oxygen, and thus energy, will allow the Betta’s to have enough energy to carry out aggressive behavior in addition to life-sustaining functions.

Materials and Methods:
First, we set up two fish tanks, one with normal oxygen levels and one with a bubbling device that added oxygen to the water. We then randomly assigned three male Bettas to the normal oxygen tank and three male Bettas to the increased oxygen tank. We put each Betta into their assigned tank, each divided by glass and visual dividers. We created a scoring system (shown below) based on the aggressiveness of the behavior. We removed the visual dividers in the normal oxygen tank and recorded the aggression score for each Betta male. We then computed a two two-sample, one-tail t-test in order to test the significance of the relationship between oxygen levels and aggression levels exhibited by Betta splendens. We then repeated the same steps in the tank with oxygenated water.

Results:
Overall, we observed that the aggression score in the treatment group/oxygenated of Betta splendens tank tended to be lower than that of the Betta splendens in the control group/normal oxygen tank. We could tell this because the mean of the Betta splendens in the treatment group was 43, 10.5 points higher than the mean of the control group/normal oxygen, 32.5. This indicates that on average, male Betta fish in the control group tended to exhibit more aggressive behavior than those in the oxygenated water. After computing a two-sampled, one-tailed t-test I found that the t-statistic is 0.6355, the p-value is 0.2697. Our p-value, .6355, is larger than the alpha value, 0.05. This indicates that our results were not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our data as we saw a higher aggressiveness score in the Betta splendens in the tank with normal oxygen levels as opposed to those in the tank with increased levels of oxygen. Our data, though it did have a relatively large standard deviation and exceeded our p-value, showed a slight different in the average score of aggressiveness, 10.5 points. We expected to see a higher amount of aggression because more oxygen results in more available ATP energy for an animal to utilize. It is natural instinct for Betta fish to respond to the image of another male Betta, however a variety of factors can inhibit aggressive nature as is likely what happened in our experiment. For example, in an experiment performed on Betta splendens, male Bettas showed a significant reduction in aggressive behavior when in the presence of a female Betta splenden (Douterlant:2001).  The reason for the difference in our hypothesized results and actual results is likely the presence of the bubbles in from the oxygenator distracting the Betta fish. In the future, we could use a different method to oxygenate the water that does not involve a physical distraction. In another study in which Betta splendens in normal water conditions were compared to those in deoxygenated conditions, the male Betta fish in deoxygenated conditions acted less aggressive towards each other and even coordinated their air gulping to conserve oxygen (Simpson:1968). This potential cooperation between what would normally be expected to be a highly aggressive interaction between the two fish suggests that the depleted levels of oxygen inhibited their ability to act out aggressively.
