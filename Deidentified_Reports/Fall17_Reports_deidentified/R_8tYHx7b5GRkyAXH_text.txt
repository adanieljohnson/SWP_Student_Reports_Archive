Title: The Effect of Tetraethyl Ammonium Chloride on the Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The muscle contraction of the gastrocnemius in the Rana pipiens was studied after treatment of tetraethyl ammonium chloride, a potassium channel blocker.  It was hypothesized that the inhibition of potassium channels of the muscle fiber would cause greater contractions in the muscle due to a greater depolarization.  The muscle was stimulated without potassium channel blocker first then stimulated again after it had been injected with 0.2 mL of the potassium channel blocker (tetraethyl ammonium chloride).  The hypothesis was not supported by the data in this lab which used a paired two sample t-test.  We ran a paired t-test and the results showed significant difference between our two groups (p-value < 0.05), but it was concluded that even though there was significant evidence to support the difference in muscle contraction amplitude after treatment with tetraethyl ammonium chloride the trend of the data does not support our hypothesis.  There was still some interesting data that could lead to potential other experiments that will answer what role the potassium ion channels have in the contraction of muscle fibers.

Introduction:
Muscles fibers, as known as muscles cells, are what allows us to move.  This is caused by the contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers.  Muscle contractions occur because of depolarization in muscle fibers causing action potentials.  A motor neuron’s axon terminal creates a synapse with a muscle fiber and this synapse is called the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).  At the NMJ, calcium ions (Ca2+) enter the axon terminal binding to the acetylcholine (ACh) vesicle allowing it to dock to the axon terminal membrane and release ACh.  Once ACh is released, it binds to the ACh receptors in the membrane of the muscle fiber which can then open up to let sodium ions (Na+) into the cell.  This causes depolarization in the muscle fiber and creates the action potential needed to contract the muscle [Wu: 2010]. The muscle fibers also contain K+ channels that is constantly letting K+ ions leave the cell [Davies: 1991]. Since tetraethyl ammonium chloride is a K+ channel blocker, K+ ions would not be able to leave the cell as the Na+ ions enter.
The focus of this lab is to determine the effects of tetraethyl ammonium chloride, a potassium (K+) channel blocker, on a muscles ability to contract.  In order to study this, the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle of the Rana pipiens, or commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, was treated.  The R. pipiens’s leg has a very simple anatomy where the upper part of the leg, where the thigh muscles are, is where the sciatic nerve lies and below the knee of the leg and behind the tibia is the gastrocnemius [Johnson: 2017].  The hypothesis is that we would have greater depolarization and stronger action potentials, which would in turn lead to a stronger muscle contraction.


Materials and Methods:
There were three R. pipiens legs used for three different trials.  These legs were skinned to expose the muscles of the leg and the gastrocnemius were detached at the tendon near the ankle bone.  Then the gastrocnemius was strung up by the tendon previously attached to the ankle with string and the suspender provided so that the leg was lying flat on the dissection plate and the gastrocnemius was suspended with some tension in it.  The muscle was directly stimulated with the probes supplied with the LabScribe program.  The probes were inserted into the gastrocnemius so that the black probe was entering the base of the muscle and the red probe was entering the top (Refer to Figure 1 below).  For the controls, each muscle was stimulated without treatment first to determine the voltage needed to reach the threshold that creates action potential.  The voltages used were 0V, 0.1V, 0.2V, 0.3V, 0.4V, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, 3V, 4V, and 5V.  Then the same leg was used for treatment as well.  The gastrocnemius muscle was injected with 0.2 mL of 100 mM tetraethyl ammonium chloride and then stimulated again with the same voltages.  The thresholds were determined for each and if possible the max output.  This process was then done again on the other two R. pipiens legs.  Once the data is collected, a paired two-sample t-test was used to determine results and support for hypothesis.

Results:
The graph (Figure 2) shows that with the addition of tetraethyl ammonium chloride the amplitude of the muscle contraction would generally go down.  There were some exceptions to this trend of course, but overall the general trend did not deviate.  It also seems that the actual voltage needed to reach threshold for each muscle decreased after the injection into the gastrocnemius muscle.  However, it seems that treatment 3 is the exception to this trend with it requiring more voltage to reach threshold.  Figure 3 shows that the average muscle contraction amplitude was much higher for pre-injection stimulation than for post injection stimulation. The paired two sample t-test showed that there was significant difference between the muscle contractions of the control and treatment R. pipiens gastrocnemius muscle.  The degrees of freedom were 32, the t-value was 5.033617, and the p-value was 1.80x10-5.

Discussion:
The data collected does not support our hypothesis even though after the completion of the paired t-test showed significance.  This conclusion came about because of the trend we see in Figure 2; the decrease in amplitude after the injection of tetraethyl ammonium chloride suggest that the strength of contraction is weakening instead of increasing.  Therefore, it cannot be said that by inhibiting the K+ channels in muscle fibers from opening causes stronger muscle contractions due to greater depolarization. A similar experiment was run with potassium ion channels and how they cause hyperpolarization in cells [Siegel: 1992].  Hyperpolarization is when the difference of the negative charge of the inside of a cell and the positive charge outside the cell becomes greater.  In the experiment from 1992, Siegel mentions that the hyperpolarization caused vasodilation in smooth muscle when the Ca2+ channels are also closed.  Maybe instead of thinking of potassium ions in the cell contributing to the strength of action potential, like hypothesized, it would be more helpful to think of them contributing to the rate of action potential created.  This would be interesting to looking into further in future experiments with tetraethyl ammonium chloride and the effects it has on muscle contractions. There were many difficulties that occurred during the experiment that cause slight deviations from the original plan for the experiment.  Before we decided to stimulate the muscle directly, the original thought was to stimulate the sciatic nerve.  However, due to technical reasons the nerve would not stimulate so the experiment had to change to direct muscle stimulation.  Also, when stimulating the muscle there were some problems with the actual graph showing the muscle amplitude.  Instead of showing a (what would be considered) normal myogram, once the muscle was stimulated the contraction phase of the myogram never came back to the relaxed state.  Overall, based off the results of this lab, more testing will be needed to determine how the potassium channels have an effect on muscle contraction.  In order to improve or at least add a new element to this experiment if it were to be conducted again stimulating the sciatic nerve may give different data leading to a new interpretation on the role of potassium channels in muscle contraction.
