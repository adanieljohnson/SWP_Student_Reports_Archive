Title: Analyzing the Effect of a Predatory Threat on the Metabolic Rate of Crayfish

Abstract:
Abstract:
	The purpose of this experiment was to explore the effect of a predatory threat on metabolic rate, characterized by oxygen consumption. This was tested by measuring the oxygen consumption of three crayfish with and without the presence of a larger, more aggressive crayfish. A paired t-test was used to measure the results which produced a p value of .014, which makes the results statistically insignificant. However, this is most likely due to the small sample size used as a clear trend showed that oxygen consumption increased in the presence of the large crayfish in all three trials. This is not a surprising result as it’s well documented that a “fight or flight” reaction increases respiratory and circulatory function.


Introduction:
Introduction:
The purpose of this lab was to test the effect of an external stimulus on the metabolic rate of an organism. For this experiment, crayfish were used as the model organism. Crayfish are a good subject for testing as they are easy to handle, and their metabolic rate can be easily measured as they’re aquatic organisms. The external stimulus chosen for this experiment was an external threat from a larger crayfish. Crayfish are highly aggressive by nature and are often documented killing and eating smaller organisms of their own species. Placing a large crayfish in the view of a smaller subject should illicit a “flight or fight” response which should in turn affect metabolic rate. The “fight or flight” response is a reaction fundamental in all animals in response to an immediate threat. The response is characterized by the fast-acting release of epinephrine and other hormones and the increase of heart and lung function which allows for a near immediate response to the perceived stressor. This response should be seen and measured in the small crayfish test subject. In order to measure whether aggression has an effect on crayfish metabolism, crayfish oxygen intake, the dependent variable of this experiment, will be measured with and without the presence of a threat, the independent variable. Oxygen gas consumption is used as the primary measure of metabolic function as it is directly correlated to the amount of energy expended by an organism. O2 is an essential molecule in the major metabolic reactions. Essentially, oxygen “pulls” electrons down the electron transport chain with its charge, converting ADP to ATP and subsequently remove the electrons from the mitochondria. The removal of electrons from the mitochondria forms water. Water and CO2 are then removed from the organism as waste products. Based on this information it can be hypothesized that exposing a smaller crayfish to a larger more aggressive crayfish will increase the smaller crayfish’s metabolic rate due to the aggressive nature of the species in addition to the relationship between metabolic rate and the inherent “fight or flight” response. This hypothesis is supported by a 2009 study in which researchers studied the oxygen consumption of tadpoles when in the presence of a predator. It was found that over a short-term period there was a significant increase in oxygen consumption “consistent with the ‘fight-or-flight’ response observed in many organisms” [Steiner: 2009]. This is almost an identical experiment, so it sets a strong precedent for the outcome of the experiment when performed with crayfish rather than tadpoles.


Materials and Methods:
Methods:
	To perform this experiment, a small crayfish was weighed and placed in a mason jar filled with slightly oxygenated water. After an initial reading, for twenty minutes, the oxygen content of the surrounding water was recorded in five minute increments using a dissolved oxygen probe. After twenty minutes, to determine specific metabolic rate of the crayfish, the volume of water was measured using a graduated cylinder. 
Specific metabolic rate:   ΔO2 (mg/L) * Volume H20(L)
Time(min) * Weight(mg)
The water was then replaced, and the same steps were taken, with the addition of a large crayfish in a tray of water surrounding the jar. A wall was placed in the tray in order to confine the larger organism next to the jar, guaranteeing some level of contact between the two crayfish. This paired test was repeated two more times with two new small crayfish subjects. The large crayfish was the same for every test. 



Results:
Results: 
	The statistical test used to analyze the data collected (Specific metabolic rate) was a one tail paired t-test of the three trials. The statistical null hypothesis for this experiment was Ho = μt – μc = 0. The sample size used was n = 3. This resulted in a p value of .014. 



Discussion:
Discussion:
	The results of this experiment supported the alternative biological hypothesis but not the statistical hypothesis. All subjects displayed an increased metabolic rate, as seen in figure 1. However, a p value of .014 is below the significance threshold of .05, meaning that any difference in specific metabolic rates are due to chance. Each trial showed a consistent trend of increased metabolic rate characterized by an increase in dissolved O2. Although these findings were not statistically significant, the trend produced supports the notion that an external threat leads to an increased respiratory rate. In addition, there was clear difference in behavior between the control and treatment groups. When the subject was in a jar by itself, it was sedentary. However, when the large crayfish was introduced to the environment, the small crayfish moved seemingly to avoid the threat. This supports the notion that the “fight or flight” reaction was initiated in the subject, which would support the biological trend that metabolism increased.
	One explanation for the insignificance of the data is the small sample size used. To run a highly accurate parametric test, a sample size greater than thirty is generally required. With a similar trend replicated over a larger sample, it’s likely that the data would have been considered significant. 
	Although the connection between metabolic function and predation is impractical when applied to useful scenarios. Understanding factors which influence the metabolic rate of marine organisms can be applied to select industries, such as farming. Raising aquatic animals in confinement has risen in prevalence over conventional fishing techniques as it allows for efficient mass production. Although predatory threats are not necessarily prevalent in aquatic farming, being aware of how certain conditions (temperature and acidity for example) affect an organism’s metabolic rate is essential in measuring how much supplemental oxygen should be administered to its external environment. For example, a study on crayfish and freshwater crabs showed that the oxygenation of water greatly influences metabolic rate [DeJours: 1977].  If inadequate supplemental oxygen is added to an environment detrimental to crayfish metabolism, the organisms would be at risk of hypoxia.
