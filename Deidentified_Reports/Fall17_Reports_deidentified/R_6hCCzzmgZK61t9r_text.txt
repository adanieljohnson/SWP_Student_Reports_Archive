Title: The effect of lidocaine on muscle twitch threshold in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker that can affect the muscle contraction of Rana pipiens. The gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve can be easily dissected to study the neuromuscular system. In addition, Rana pipiens do not yield to rigor mortis immediately following death, so the stimulation of a muscle contraction can still occur. The main objective of this study was to learn more about the neuromuscular system and explore how lidocaine affects muscle twitch threshold through direct stimulation to the sciatic nerve. We predict that if a frog leg is injected with lidocaine, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold will be higher compared to a frog leg that is not injected with lidocaine. First, muscle twitch threshold was determined, and then the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg was injected with roughly 0.2 mL of lidocaine. Five minutes later, muscle twitch threshold was determined with the presence of lidocaine. Results showed that the mean voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold was not statistically, significantly greater after the injection of lidocaine, as the p-value was 0.183503. While lidocaine did not have a significant effect on muscle twitch threshold, it does significantly weaken the strength of contraction.

Introduction:
The following experiment examined the neuromuscular system of Rana pipiens. Known as the Northern Leopard Frog, this organism ranges from 5 to 11 centimeters and can be found across the United States (Dodd: 2013). Rana pipiens is an example of Krogh’s principle for studying the neuromuscular system because of the relationship between its gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve. Unlike other organisms, the frog’s muscle does not yield to rigor mortis immediately following death. This is important for studying the neuromuscular system of Rana pipiens because it allows the muscle to contract after death if a stimulus is applied (Sadava: 2016). The gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens is a skeletal muscle responsible for voluntary movement of the frog’s leg to be able to jump (Sadava: 2016). The muscle is made up of hundreds to thousands of multinucleate muscle fibers (Johnson: 2017). Within each muscle fiber, there are bundles of myofibrils containing highly ordered groupings of thin actin and thick myosin filaments (Sadava: 2016). The sciatic nerve in Rana pipiens is a motor neuron that innervates the gastrocnemius muscle (Johnson: 2017). The sciatic nerve stimulates muscle contraction in a process called excitation-contraction coupling (Johnson: 2017). 

To begin, an action potential travels down the motor neuron where it eventually arrives at the neuromuscular junction (Sadava: 2016). The depolarization of the neuron stimulates the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve membrane (Sadava: 2016). Then, ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft where it binds to receptors on the membrane of the muscle fiber (Sadava: 2016). The opening of sodium channels produces an action potential in the muscle fiber, and the spreading of the action potential down the T-tubule system results in the conformational change in the DHP and ryanodine receptor (Sadava: 2016). This releases Ca²⁺ into the sarcoplasm where it binds to troponin, exposing the myosin-actin binding sites (Sadava: 2016). The binding leads to a chain of reactions that stimulates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber (Sadava: 2016). If Ca²⁺ is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle will relax (Sadava: 2016). 

A myogram is a graphic representation that monitors the different stages of a single muscle contraction, also known as a twitch (Johnson: 2017). There are three phases of the muscle twitch that display on the myogram: a latent period, the contraction phase, and the relaxation phase (Johnson: 2017). The latent period is the time between stimulation and the start of the muscle contraction (Johnson: 2017). Following, the contraction phase is the actual contraction of the muscle (Johnson: 2017). The relaxation phase begins when the muscle contraction has peaked, signifying the muscle is returning to its relaxed state (Johnson: 2017). 

Muscle contractions are affected by many physical and chemical factors. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals in your body (Lin: 2016). It is most commonly used to reduce pain or discomfort caused by skin irritations (Lin: 2016). More specifically, in frog legs it acts as a sodium channel blocker. This experiment explores how lidocaine affects muscle twitch threshold through direct stimulation to the sciatic nerve. The presence of lidocaine is the independent variable while the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold is the dependent variable. We hypothesize that if a frog leg is injected with lidocaine, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold will be higher compared to a frog leg that is not injected with lidocaine. 

Materials and Methods:
Obtain three, fresh Rana pipiens frog legs and place in a dissecting pan. Using gloves, isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and expose the sciatic nerve. Occasionally moisten the frog leg with frog Ringer’s solution to prevent it from drying out. Tie a piece of string to the gastrocnemius muscle so it can suspend from the force transducer. Attach the proper probes to the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle. Use LabScribe to process myogram data and generate muscle stimulation through the sciatic nerve. Set the following stimulus parameters: pulse amplitude to 0.000 V, number of pulses to 1, frequency to 1, and pulse width to 5 ms. Determine the muscle twitch threshold through nerve stimulation by increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1 V increments. Create a solution of 25mM lidocaine by dissolving 0.6 g of lidocaine in 100mL of Ringer’s solution. With a syringe, inject roughly 0.2 mL of lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle. Wait 5 minutes and repeat the exact steps previously mentioned to determine twitch threshold voltage. Repeat the experiment with the other Rana pipiens frog legs. The results were analyzed with a two-sample t-test. The statistical test will be paired. All error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean.


Results:
In Frog Leg 1 and Frog Leg 3, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold was higher after the injection of lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle. For Frog Leg 2, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold was the same. On average the muscle twitch threshold was higher after the injection of lidocaine (Figure 1). The mean muscle twitch threshold was 0.26666667 with lidocaine present versus 0.2 without the presence of lidocaine. However, there was not a statistically significant difference. The paired, two-sample t-test showed a corresponding P-value of 0.183503, a resulting t-statistic of 2.0, and the degrees of freedom was 2.0. For Frog Leg 1, Frog Leg 2, and Frog Leg 3, the voltage out at muscle twitch threshold was higher before the injection of lidocaine into the muscle (Figure 2). The paired, two-sample t-test showed a corresponding P-value of 0.045182, a resulting t-statistic of 4.543581, and the degrees of freedom was 2.0. The mean voltage out at muscle twitch threshold was 0.277 without lidocaine versus 0.084333333 with the presence of lidocaine.


Discussion:
To restate the hypothesis, if a frog leg is injected with lidocaine, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold will be higher compared to a frog leg that is not injected with lidocaine. Based on the results of the paired, two-sample t-test, the findings do not support the hypothesis. While two out of the three frog legs showed an increase in muscle twitch threshold after the injection of lidocaine, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.183503). In Frog Leg 2 the twitch threshold was the same, but the voltage out was 0.005. The muscle twitch was so weak that it was not visible to the naked eye, but it appeared on the myogram. Even when the stimulus amplitude was altered above twitch threshold, the voltage out was miniscule as well. Since lidocaine serves as a sodium channel blocker, it is possible that it is harder for action potentials to arise. When acetylcholine binds to receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber, Na+ would not be able to diffuse into the motor end plate (Sadava: 2016). Therefore, the muscle fiber would have difficulty depolarizing enough to result in an action potential. However, even with the presence of lidocaine, an action potential could arise if not all Na+ channels are blocked by lidocaine. Due to the mechanism that an action potential is an all-or-none event, if the motor end plate is slightly depolarized, positive feedback with voltage gated Na+ channels ensures that an action potential always reaches its maximum value (Sadava: 2016). In a similar experiment, the effect of lidocaine was tested on electrically induced contractions in isolated tracheal smooth muscle of adult rats (Kao: 2010). Results showed that the addition of lidocaine did not cause a negligible response to the rest tension (Kao: 2010). 

It is possible that the lidocaine leaked out of the gastrocnemius muscle after the injection. We observed this in Frog Leg 1, and the voltage out at muscle twitch threshold was significantly higher than in Frog Leg 2 and Frog Leg 3. If all Na+ channels in the gastrocnemius muscle were blocked, then the muscle would not have contracted or it would require a higher stimulus amplitude to generate a twitch. Another source of error could be the time that we waited to measure twitch threshold after the injection of lidocaine. We waited 5 minutes, but it could be possible that the lidocaine did not fully kick in until later. Lastly, the fact that we had three different frog legs of different size led to variation in our results. While they did not have major differences in size, some produced a voltage out that was stronger than others.

It was interesting to note that lidocaine did have a significant effect on the voltage out, which corresponds to the strength of the contractions. At twitch threshold, the voltage out was significantly lower after the injection of lidocaine. This shows that lidocaine weakens the muscle contractions. Even as stimulus amplitude was increased in 0.1 increments all the way to 0.5 V, the voltage out stayed relatively constant. This led to the conclusion that since lidocaine is a local anesthetic it weakens the strength of muscle contraction. 

Going forward, the experiment could have been performed with more frog legs, giving us a wider variety of results. This could have allowed for the statistical test to show statistically significant results. In addition, we could have determined twitch threshold at different stimulus amplitude increments. Instead of 0.1 increments, we could have done 0.05 increments to give us even more varied results. Furthermore, the effects of lidocaine could have been studied on muscle tetany and muscle fatigue. Since the strength of the muscle contraction was weaker with the presence of lidocaine, it would be interesting to explore if the muscle would reach fatigue more rapidly.
