Title: Resulting Root-Shoot Ratio of Field Peas as Affected by Water Salinity

Abstract:
This is a study of Pisum sativun (The Field Pea) in which we expose the roots of the peas to water with a fairly high NaCl concentration (~35%). The objective was to figure out what a plant’s response would be to an increase in salinity-based toxification. This is be measured in a root-shoot-ratio which shows the relationship between growth in the roots and growth in the shoot of the pea. We predicted that in the presence of a more toxic environment a field pea would dedicate more resources to the growth of its roots so as to dig deeper into the ground for hydration. As a result the overall Root:Shoot would be higher. One set of field peas was be grown in a container of salt water, and the controlll was be grown in regular water. We continued to water and monitor them for 3 weeks before extracting them and realizing that the Root:Shoot for length was virtually the same. We concluded that because of the toxicity of the environment they were grown in, the peas were only stunted by the salt water, and did not change their ratio of length. Their weight however was significently affected by the salt water, and this resulted in a lower average Root:Shoot in the experimental.


Introduction:
As a plant grows in the wild it sacrifices resources it has collected for the ability to complete certain processes and grow. For instance a tree must choose between dedicating its limited resources to leafing or the widening of its trunk. The same basic principle applies to all plants. In the study my team conducted we took the average field pea (Pisum sativun) and observed how it would choose to partition its resources under different water salinities. Similarly, The University of Gent in Belgium has performed studies tracing and concentrating on the ability of certain plants to obtain a “salt tolerance” based on selective breeding, showing that on average plants do not have a resistance to  (Moons A., Bauw G., Prinsen E., Montagu M. V., & Straeten, D. V. D. 1995). The Department of Botany in Queensland they performed a study in which similar results were being collected as well. The difference being that they were testing specifically for the ability of plants to reject Na+ after over-absorption has occurred (Maser P. 2002). Finally a study performed on tomato plants tested the effect of mycorrhizal fungi on salt-stress resistance. This led to interesting finds on the use of fungi against over salinization in arid areas (Al-Karaki, G. N. 2000). All of these studies lead us to believe that either Na+ or NaCl are detrimental to plant growth. The reduction in available resources as a result of NaCl occupying space in the soil can dry out or destroy plant life if the percent salinity become too high. For our study we used only an amount of salt that would affect, but not destroy, the field peas. Assuming that the field peas reach towards the resources they desire most, the scientific literature combined with our past knowledge allowed us to hypothesize that the field peas hydrated with a 35% NaCl solution would grow in a higher length based root-to-shoot ratio than those watered with normal distilled water.


Materials and Method:
Obviously, we needed a good quantity of field peas. In order to keep the data consistent we required a solution of NaCl and water which would be mixed to a 35% - 65% ratio in that order. We would also need Miracle Gro, small plastic pots, and implements for measuring and weighing the roots and shoots of the field peas. To start we prepped the peas by soaking them in water for about 20 minutes. We then planted both the controlll and experimental peas in a combination of vermiculite and miracle gro. The peas were separated into 6 plastic containers (3 controlll and 3 experimental) at 9 peas per container. We then labelled them and returned everyday for 3 weeks to water them in their particular solution. At the end of 3 weeks we took them out of the greenhouse and sliced them at the root-shoot-junction, measuring the weight and length of both the roots and shoots to determine partition of growth and root-shoot-ratios.

Results:
After observing the growth and making the proper measurements on our field peas we found that salinity in the water supply of the field peas led only to reduce overall growth. This means that our hypothesis was incorrect. Though shoot growth was reduced in the end it was irrelevant to our hypothesis due to the almost equal loss in root growth. The Root:Shoot for length were within .04 of one another. It should also be noted that the imbalance in mean weight Root:Shoot speaks to the fact that the experimental field peas were of significently smaller size and lesser health than the controlll peas.


Discussion:
By reading Al-karaki’s work on salinity in crops  we could be pretty certain that the increasing salinity would be detrimental to the growth of the  plants, but with the results we have it becomes obvious that we may have misinterpreted the effect of salinity on plants, making our hypothesis incorrect.  (Al-Karaki, G. N. 2000). At first we speculated that the shoot of the plant would shrink for a redirection of resources to the roots. That did not end up being the case. Instead we saw a direct and proportional shrinkage of the entire field pea, the mean length root-shoot ratio remaining the same all the while. This makes clear that the true problem with increased salinity is not a loss of belowground resources as a result of blockage by salinity, but instead that increased salinity sets back all growth for both the roots and shoots. I am curious what would have happened if we had left the field peas for a few more weeks. Perhaps then an increase in root growth would have been seen. Those dealing with the salted solution were stunted in every sense. A future study would have us extending the period of experimentation so as to see if the upper ceiling of growth was damaged in any way by the exposure to excessive salinity. We could then ask if in certain drought-prone areas it would be worth investing in a reservoir of salt water that would otherwise be considered worthless. If it simply makes crops grow slower, but the end result is the same, then that could have implications across the world, turning otherwise waterless areas into more plentiful farMland. The water crisis could be mitigated a small bit by the diversion of distilled water to something more valuable.
