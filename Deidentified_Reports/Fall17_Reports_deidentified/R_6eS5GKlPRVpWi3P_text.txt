Title: The Effect of a Sevin Solution Injected into the Gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens on the Stimulus Frequency at Which Tetany Occurs

Abstract:
In this lab, 2% Sevin solution, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, was injected into the gastrocnemius to measure the effects on the frequency at which tetany occurs in Rana pipiens, or the Northern Leopard Frog. The experiment was conducted by measuring tetany of a frog leg before the solution was injected, and after 0.2mL of the Sevin solution was injected into the gastrocnemius. The data was measured using the software LabScribe. The original hypothesis was that the addition of the Sevin solution would lower the frequency in hertz at which tetany occurs. To measure the significance of the results, a paired t-test was used. The calculated P-value was 0.015, indicating that the results were significant and the hypothesis was accepted. The frog legs reached tetany at a lower frequency after the injection of Sevin into the muscle.

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab was to measure the effect of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Sevin, on the frequency at which tetany occurs in the gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens. Rana pipiens, or the Northern Leopard Frog, is a fairly large frog species that grows to three to five inches at maturity. It is mainly found in North America. This species is commonly used in labs because of its accessibility and for its ability for the sartorius muscle to survive for hours in vitro, or outside its normal biological context [Lannoo: 2005]. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used by all neuromuscular systems in vertebrates. Acetylcholine is released when an action potential arrives at the axon terminal. This causes calcium channels to open, allowing calcium to enter the cell. Calcium causes the vesicles containing acetylcholine to bind to the presynaptic membrane, emptying acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Some acetylcholine will then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. IF enough receptors are activated, the depolarization will spread to the ends of the motor end plate and to the surrounding muscle cell membranes. When the action potential reaches a muscle cell’s system of membranes, it causes the muscle to contract. In this experiment, the motor neuron is the sciatic nerve, and the muscle cell is the gastrocnemius. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that functions to break down acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction after an action potential has been fired. [Sadava, et al: 2016]. The solution of Sevin is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which prevents the breaking down of the acetylcholine after an action potential has been fired. This would leave acetylcholine sitting in the neuromuscular junction. With acetylcholine already in the neuromuscular junction before the firing of an action potential, questions arose on what effect this would have on the firing of the action potential, specifically how this would affect the frequency needed to reach tetany. Tetany is reached through temporal summation, or when the axons are repeatedly stimulated. This will eventually lead the muscle to generate the maximum possible force, tetany. Our hypothesis was that when the solution of Sevin was injected into the gastrocnemius of the frog leg, the frequency in hertz needed to induce tetany would be lower. In this experiment, the independent variable is whether or not the gastrocnemius has been injected with the Sevin solution, and the dependent variable is the frequency at which tetany occurs.

Materials and Methods:
Before the start of the lab, download LabScribe, a computer software program that will provide graphical representation and allow control of variables in the experiment. This software can be downloaded at iWorx.com. Once the application is downloaded, load the group settings from a flash drive given by the teacher.
Obtain three frog legs of recently euthanized frogs. Each of these legs will serve as both a control and experimental group. Before touching the frog, make sure to put on gloves. Place each leg in a dissecting pan and using a pair of forceps, grasp the skin starting at the top of the leg and gently pull down towards the foot. Moisten the leg with Frog Ringers solution periodically throughout the experiment to prevent the exposed leg from drying out. Separate the inner thigh muscles starting at the top of the frog leg to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is long and white. Once the sciatic nerve is identified, gently separate it from the connective tissue it is attached to. Separate the sciatic nerve using only fingers because metal can damage the nerve. The next step is to detach the gastrocnemius muscle at the Achilles tendon. The gastrocnemius muscle is located on the back of the leg, underneath the thigh muscle. To detach the gastrocnemius muscle, have one person pick of the leg, and pull the gastrocnemius away from the tibialis anterior using a little bit of pressure. Have another member put scissor tips in gap and move the scissors back and forth to sever the connective tissue between the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. Then, take the scissors and make a cut at the end of the gastrocnemius closer to the toes. Try to cut as close to the toes as possible in order to cut off some of the Achilles tendon along with the gastrocnemius. This will be beneficial for the next step, when string has to be tied at the end of the detached gastrocnemius. Cut a piece of about 20cm of string, and use the string to tie a knot at the edge of the gastrocnemius. Double knot the string to ensure the string will not give. After this step, the extra Achilles tendon can be cut off. Using the string attached to the gastrocnemius, suspend the gastrocnemius using a force transducer. Hang the other end of the string on the hook on the force transducer, and then raise or lower the transducer to have the rest of the frog leg resting on the dissecting pan. Before making fine adjustments to the force transducer to get the desired ninety degree angle, pin down the leg using four pins. Place the first two at diagonals going across the tibia and tibialis anterior. Use the next two pins at diagonals going across the femur. Make sure these two pins do not come in contact with the sciatic nerve. Now the force transducer can be adjusted to that the gastrocnemius is at a ninety degree angle with the dissecting plate. To make fine adjustments, use the precision tensioner, the silver knob at the top, to place a tiny bit of tension on the muscle to maintain the ninety degree angle. The next step is to attach the sleeve probes. Pull off the rubber cover on the probe to expose a cylinder with two wires on it. These two wires give off the bipolar stimulation. Gently pick up the sciatic nerve and place it into the probe, making sure the nerve touches both wires. Have another person grab the rubber sleeve and place it back over the sensor, cuffing the nerve. 
After the specimen is prepared, plug in the probes to a laptop and open LabScribe. Upon opening, LabScribe should display a message that it has found hardware. Select the Frog Lab under Animal Muscle tab on group settings. Then, click on the Stimulator Preferences button located on the top of the program to set preferences. For this lab, the pulse amplitude was set at 2.0, the number of pulses at 0, the pulse width at 5, and the frequency, our variable, starting at 4 Hz. 
Once everything is prepared, data can start being collected. Using the sleeve electrodes in the sciatic nerve, click Record to stimulate the nerve. Stimulate the nerve for five seconds before ending the stimulation. Record observations in both the graph and appearance of the leg twitches, especially looking for signs of tetany. After this has been recorded, change the frequency to 8 Hz and click apply on the left hand side to save changes. Leave all other parameters the same. Once again, click to record to stimulate the muscle and record for five seconds. Keep repeating this procedure for 10 Hz, 12 Hz, 15 Hz, and 18 Hz. This first set of data is the control data for Frog Leg #1. Once this data has been collected, pour 2% solution of Sevin into a tiny bowl. Using a syringe, inject 0.2 mL of the solution into the gastrocnemius of the frog. After injecting the solution, take care to place the syringe into a proper syringe disposal box. Let the frog leg sit for one minute before stimulating again. After one minute has passed, reset frequency back to 4 Hz and repeat the experiment using the same frequencies. Record data for each frequency. After collecting data for all the frequencies, detach the frog leg from the probes and force transducer. Repeat the entire experiment for the other two frog legs.
After all data has been collected, properly dispose of the frog legs, and wash all supplies used in this experiment in the sink. To interpret the data, a paired two-sample T-test is used.


Results:
Based on the data collected, each of the frog legs reached tetany at a lower frequency when the Sevin solution was injected into the muscle than when not exposed to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In the first frog leg, the leg naturally reached tetany at 12 Hz, and then reached tetany at 10 Hz when the solution was injected into the gastrocnemius. Similarly, the second frog leg reached tetany at 15 Hz without Sevin, and 12 Hz with Sevin. The last leg also showed a similar trend with 18 Hz and 15 Hz respectively. To measure the significance of this experiment, a paired t-test was used. The t-statistic was 8.0, the degrees of freedom was 2, and the P-value was 0.015. This led to the conclusion that the results are significant.

Discussion:
Based on the results of the paired t-test and the outcome of the experiment, the hypothesis was accepted, and the data collected was significant. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor did have the expected effect of inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction. The pre-existing acetylcholine enabled the gastrocnemius to contract more rapidly and reach tetany sooner than the leg would without the esterase inhibitor. The differences in the original frequencies that tetany was obtained at can be contributed to the different sizes of the frog legs. Some of the legs were larger than others, and those legs needed a higher frequency to reach the original tetany. Although the pulse amplitude would usually be set around one in this experiment, the pulse amplitude was set at two because the first frog leg used needed a higher pulse amplitude to enable the graph to show contraction. This should not have had any effect on the data collected though, because the pulse amplitude was kept consistent throughout the experiment. While the results were significant, the experiment was done with a small number of test subjects. To expand the study in the future, a larger experiment could be done with the frog legs. If the data is once again significant, possible future studies could be done on other vertebrates to see if the same results are shown. This results of this study correlate with an experiment that recently concluded in September of 2017. In this experiment, pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was used to increase muscle contraction in the respiratory muscle function in mice. The purpose of this study was to look at the effects of problems with neuromuscular junctions in relation to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Similar to the experiment above, the inhibitor, pyridostigmine, was hypothesized to increase muscle contraction. The conclusion of this experiment was insignificant in terms of effect on the mice [Amancio: 2017]. Part of the problem with this experiment was that the solution injected into the mice was toxic in certain concentrations.
