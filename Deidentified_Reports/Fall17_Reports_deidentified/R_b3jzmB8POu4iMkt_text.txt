Title: Negative Effects on Photosynthesis in Brassica oleraca var. sabellica leaves Due to Cold, Hot, and Room Temperature Conditions

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to determine how temperature affects photosynthesis in kale (Brassica oleraca var. sabellica) leaves. A Chloroplast suspension made from kale leaves was mixed into solutions containing DCPIP and a buffer. Solutions were placed in three different temperature conditions—cold, room temperature, and hot—and the absorbance of each was measured every ten minutes for a period of 30 minutes. It was hypothesized that the highest rates of photosynthesis would occur in room temperature samples, followed by cold temperature samples, and lastly hot temperature samples. Results, while not statistically significent (meaning they were due to random chance), proved the hypothesis correct. It is likely that the results seen in the experiment were due to the denaturing of RUBISCO, the enzyme responsible for the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. In hot temperatures, this enzyme denatures, and at low temperatures, the frost-resistant properties of kale prevent complete denaturing of RUBISCO enzymes. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the metabolic process carried out by plants, in which light energy is used to excite electrons and drive a series of reduction reactions to ultimately produce glucose. This process is split into light-dependent and light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, photons are used to generate NADPH and a proton gradient that drives the production of ATP. The light-independent reactions contain RUBISCO (enzyme), which uses ATP and NADPH to combine 5 carbon molecules to 1 CO2 molecule to produce a 6-carbon glucose molecule [Johnson: 2017]. This process is easily disrupted by factors such as temperature, which can denature RUBISCO, and thus halt or decrease the production of ATP. In a previous experiment, Weis found that Rubisco is especially sensitive to elevated temperatures [Feller et. al: 2017]. The purpose of this lab was to determine how both cold and hot temperature conditions affect photosynthetic activity in kale (Brassica oleraca var. sabellica) leaves, which are known to be temperature resistant, especially to frost conditions [Frost tolerance of vegetables]. Centrifuged samples of kale chloroplasts were placed in an ice bath (approx. -1 C), room temperature (~23 C), and a heat bath (approx. 30 C) for three, 10-minute intervals. A baseline sample and controlll group were also utilized. The independent variable of this experiment is temperature, and the dependent variable is rate of photosynthesis, or more specifically absorbance (nm) which is indirectly proportional to photosynthesis. All samples contained DCPIP, which is reduced when photosynthesis occurs. As a result of the reduction of DCPIP, the sample’s color will change from blue (color of oxidized DCPIP) to clear (color of reduced DCPIP), and thus, absorbance, measured using the spectrophotometer, will be lower in samples where activity is present and higher in samples where activity is absent [Johnson: 2017]. If kale chloroplasts are exposed to high temperatures, photosynthetic rate will be lower than that of samples placed in room temperature and -1 C conditions. Room temperature samples will present the highest rates of photosynthesis.  

Materials and Method:
Preparing the chloroplast sample: The central veins were removed from four kale leaves and discarded. The remaining parts were rinsed and dried. The experimenters combined the leaves and 10 Ml of grinding buffer in a mortar and pestle, and grinded the leaves into a thick paste. Then, 10 more Ml of grinding buffer were added, and the grinding process was repeated. The liquid was strained, using a cheesecloth, into a centrifuge tube and spun at 200G and 1200 rpm for three minutes. The liquid was transferred into a second centrifuge tube, with the pellet remaining at the bottom of the original tube. The second tube was centrifuged at 1,000 G and 2800 rpm for ten minutes and then the supernatant was discarded. Then, 20 Ml of the grinding buffer were added to the pellet, and the solution was stirred.     
 
Preparing the temperature samples: The experimenters labelled 13 test tubes and prepared the mixes in Table 1. The ice bath and heat bath were prepared, with a thermometer placed in each. The temperature of each bath was recorded. Thirteen spectrophotometer cuvettes were numbered. Then, 100 μl of the chloroplast sample were added to test tubes #1-10. Each sample was mixed after adding the chloroplasts and transferred to the cuvettes. The experimenters blanked the spectrophotometer using the blank sample, and measured each sample at time zero (baseline condition). The samples were placed in their according conditions (making sure they were exposed to direct light from either a lamp or windowsill). Every ten minutes, for a period of thirty minutes, the process of blanking the spectrophotometer and measuring the absorbance of all samples was repeated. Finally, the percent change in absorbance at 10, 20, and 30 minutes was calculated. 


Results:
Data was recorded using a spectrophotometer and measured at 600 nm. Figure 1 shows average absorbance of chloroplast samples in cold, room temperature, and hot conditions at 10, 20, and 30 minutes. All conditions show a decrease in absorbance over time, however, room temperature samples had a decrease by the largest factor, with average absorbance decreasing by 0.07 nm. Absorbance is indirectly proportional to photosynthesis, because of the DCPIP that is added to all samples; it is important to note that photosynthesis occurred in each temperature condition, regardless of whether it occurred at very low rates (as seen in 30 C conditions). Figure 2 shows the percent decrease in absorbance across the 30-minute span of the experiment for each temperature condition. In this figure, the change in photosynthetic rate across the timespan and the differences between the three temperature conditions are more noticeable. However, the results were not statistically significent (p=0.235), meaning they were due to random chance. Thus, changing temperature conditions did not significently affect photosynthetic rates in kale leaves.   


Discussion:
Figures 1 and 2 show that photosynthetic activity increased the most in samples tested in room temperature conditions, followed by samples in cold conditions, and lastly, those in hot conditions. The enzymatic activity (specifically that of the enzyme RUBISCO) that drives the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, and its dependence on temperature conditions, explain the results shown in figures 1 and 2. Solutions in 30C conditions showed the smallest decrease in absorbance and the smallest percent change in absorbance during the 30 minute testing period. These results indicate the denaturing of RUBISCO in ~30 C temperature conditions. While experiments conducted by Feller et. al were done on wheat and cotton, results similarly showed that, “Increasing the leaf temperature above 22.5°C for wheat or 30°C for cotton during the last 5 min of the irradiation period caused progressive inhibition of Rubisco activation” [Feller et. al: 1998]. This finding is further supported by Diaz-Espejo, who suggests that studies show differences in RUBISCO activity across different species to be negligible [Diaz-Espejo, A: 2013]. From these results, we can conclude that RUBISCO, regardless of which plant it is in, is denatured at ~30 C. Because RUBISCO can regain function when the plant is exposed to temperatures within its normal range, Yuepeng, Song, et al suggest that the denaturing of RUBISCO is potentially a protective strategy against heat stress [Yuepeng, Song, et al: 2014]. Photosynthetic rates in cold conditions (approx. -1 C) were second highest, likely due to the frost resistance of kale leaves [Botanical interests], and subsequently the denaturing of fewer RUBISCO enzymes compared to samples in hot conditions. With denaturing of only some enzymes, chloroplasts still had photosynthetic activity, although it was limited, which explains why absorbance was lower than that of room temperature samples, but higher than that of ~30 C samples. However, large errors could have been due to the consistency of the chloroplast suspension, which was too thick and the means of distributing the suspension into the test tubes too unprecise to ensure that each sample had the same concentration of chloroplasts. In further trials of this experiment, samples should be tested in their temperature conditions for a period of time longer than 30 minutes and chloroplasts should be more accurately distributed into each test tube. Additionally, Feller et. al found that RUBISCO had enzymatic activity at 50 C, which indicates that its denaturing is reversible. Thus, testing more variations of “hot” and “cold” conditions would provide more insight into the temperature conditions in which kale functions best.
