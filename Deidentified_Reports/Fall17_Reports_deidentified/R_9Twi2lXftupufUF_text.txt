Title: The effects of caffeine on the amplitude of the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle

Abstract:
In this experiment, we looked at the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle of two Rania pipiens legs. Rania Pipiens, commonly known as frogs in the Anura order, are considered to be the most diverse of the three amphibian orders. Frogs can be found throughout the world, in nearly every region. They are exceptional jumpers with long, powerful legs (Heying 2003). We observed their legs and how caffeine affects muscle contraction. In order to do this, we had to attach the sciatic nerve of the leg to the BNC connector which was linked to a stimulator and computer software (LabScribe). We stimulated the nerve with increasing frequencies in order to observe the amplitude differences. The amplitude is the speed/force of contraction of the leg. Next, we determined the effects of injecting each gastrocnemus muscles with 0.1Ml of caffeine, utilizing amplitude testing with the same intervals as the controlll.  We hypothesized that the caffeine will increase the amplitude of the muscle contraction because previous experiments explore the ergogenic effect of caffeine during exercise (Jenky 1995). We received a very small standard deviation of amplitude for both legs and a P-Value of 0.0422. We concluded from our data and statistical testing, that caffeine increases the amplitude and strength of

Introduction:
The Rania pipiens is the ideal organism for visualizing muscle contraction because its large gastrocnemus is easy to manipulate. Its muscles are similar to that that of a mammalian muscles (Department 2002). Frogs also have large extensor muscles that they use during jumping. The gastrocnemus muscle, found in the leg, is composed of many muscle fibers. All of these fibers have their own unique threshold (Johnson 21). Threshold is the voltage of a stimulus eliciting a physical response. Not all muscle fibers are stimulated at the same voltage. When voltage is higher than the threshold, more and more fibers are stimulated. Eventually, the fibers will reach a constant stimulation at a certain threshold (Johnson 20). Muscle contraction is an important part of this experiment. Muscle cells are excitable and conduct action potentials. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released and binds to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane when an action potential arrives at a neuromuscular junction. Ion channels open in response to the acetylcholine making the cell depolarized. The voltage-gated sodium channels in the muscle fiber are stimulated and opened by this depolarization; sodium rushes in (Johnson 19). The T tubules are also stimulated, causing the conformation of the DHP receptor and the ryanodine receptor to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When the calcium diffuses into the sarcoplasm, the muscle contracts due to the troponin. 
We will be using software to determine the amplitude, difference in voltage, between frogs with and without caffeine.  Caffeine is a natural stimulant often found in beans and leaves. For hundreds of years, people have created drinks using caffeine in order to feel more “awake” and “alert.” Caffeine can be consumed in energy drinks, coffee, tea, etc. It is a legal, unregulated, psychoactive substance that is becoming more and more popular around the world. Because of this, we believe that caffeine not only affects neurotransmitters and the brain, but it also affects skeletal muscles in the body. Biologically, caffeine causes an dose-dependent increase in release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Olorunshola and Achie 2011). The calcium then binds to troponin which, in turn, allow myosin to bind to actin. This process allows the filaments to slide past each other and the sarcomere is shortened. A shortened sarcomere contracts the muscle. 
We hypothesize that the isolated Frog Sciatic Nerve – Gastrocnemius Muscle will show that the muscle amplitudes are increased when exposed to caffeine. We will attempt to display how our hypothesis was consistent with what actually happened during our experiment by comparing amplitude before and after the injection of caffeine in the gastrocnemus. 


Materials and Method:
The Rania pipiens was degloved. We moistened the leg with frog Ringer’s solution periodically to keep it from drying out. The sciatic nerve was then exposed. We tied a string tightly to the top of the leg, close to the Achilles tendon. Then we looped the string onto the hovering hook so that the gastrocnemus muscle is stretched vertically. Then, we laid the nerve on the electrodes. We put the BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes attached to the BNC-banana adapter on the stimulator output of the IWX/214. We found the threshold. The frequency (F(Hz)) was set at 2 Hz, the number of pulses to zero, the pulse amplitude to the threshold, and the pulse width at 5ms. We recorded until we saw the effect of stimulating at a certain frequency. We recorded 5s for stimulus frequencies of 2, 4, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 Hz. We injected the same leg with 0.1Ml of caffeine and waited 5-10 minutes. Then we repeated the same process as above now that the leg had caffeine. To statistically test the data, we ran a two-sample T-Test so we could compare the means of both legs.

Results:
A T-Test resulted in a P-value of 0.0422. As one can see, the general trends in both legs are that of increasing amplitude with the caffeine treatment. The treated legs have an amplitude nearly double of the untreated. The amplitude average of both legs display this. Physically, we observed that the treated legs felt very hard and swollen.


Discussion:
Between the raw data, averaged data, statistical test and physicality of the frog legs with caffeine, we can say with confidence that caffeine increased the amplitude and strength of the contraction of skeletal muscles in the frog leg. For every interval in both Rania pipiens legs, the treated legs had higher amplitudes. The caffeine did have an effect on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens. Our hypothesis was supported in this experiment. Caffeine is widely consumed because it can act as a stimulant. In this study, we found that a large dose of caffeine increases the force of contraction. This partially explains why people claims they feel “the jitters” after drinking caffeine; their muscles are contracting with higher amplitudes. After running statistical tests, we found a P-value of 0.0422 which means the difference is significent and the null hypothesis is not accepted. For our experiment, we only used two legs because the third leg’s sciatic nerve was damaged. In the future, it would be best to use more legs because the data collection would be greater.
