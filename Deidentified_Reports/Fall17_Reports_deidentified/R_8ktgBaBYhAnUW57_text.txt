Title: Varying Light Intensity Effect on Plant Resource Allocation in Pisum Sativum Arvense

Abstract:
The effect of light on plant resource allocation of essential nutrients was studied in pisum sativun arvense. Pisum sativun arvense, known commonly as field pea plants, were grown for two weeks in different environments; direct sunlight and shade. The root to shoot ratios (R:S) of weight and length were obtained to demonstrate that high intensity light environments cause field pea plants to allocate more resources to root growth while low intensity light environments cause field pea plants to allocate more resources to shoot growth.


Introduction:
While not often visibly noticeable, the influence that plants have on their ecological environment is quite large. Within their environments, plant interact with biotic and abiotic factors while remaining in place. A large portion of plant interactions with the environment are driven by the need for plants to take in natural resources for their growth. However, plants are restricted by both natural resource limitation of essential nutrients and their ability to only extract a certain amount of resources at one time. Therefore, plants have the ability to allocate their resources to certain parts of their structure depending on specific needs. Plant resource allocation is not a fixed process and can cause phenotypic variability; meaning that the plant's’ phenotype can adapt and change to various circumstances. Plant resource allocation can be observed through a comparison between roots and shoots due to a plant's ability to extend both above and below ground. Essential resources are taken in by both roots and shoots as roots anchor the plant to the ground and absorb water, nitrogen, and other elements and minerals while shoots carry out the process of photosynthesis to take in carbon compounds. By studying plant resource allocation patterns, the efficient level of essential resources required for optimal growth can be provided for plants. Pisum sativun arvense, or field pea plants, are used as the experimental test subjects in this study due to their resources being almost completely allocated towards either their roots or shoots as they are not yet flowering and producing their fruit. This lab will compare the root and shoot masses and lengths between field pea plants grown under different light intensive conditions in order to determine how light affects plant resource allocation. These root and shoot measurements will be expressed as ratios to demonstrate comparison.  We hypothesize that the root to shoot ratio will be greater in pisum sativun arvense grown in the high light intensity environment due to their need to extend their roots deeper into the soil to find resources for growth as they have no need to allocate resources to shoot growth because light is abundant while the Root to Shoot ratio will be smaller with pisum sativun arvense grown in the shade environment, or low light intensity environment, as they need to allocate resources to grow longer shoots to search for light.


Materials and Method:
In order to have organisms for this experiment, field pea plants were grown over the course of a two week time interval. In each pot, ten field pea plants were planted into vermiculite. A total of six pots were used as three were labeled to be placed in direct sunlight while the other three were labeled to be placed in shade. Once the plants were placed in their designated environment, they were all watered once every day for two weeks. A total of three plants were then harvested from each pot. The vermiculite was broken up to separate the roots and the plants were then washed in a container and were pat gently until dried. Each group of three plants were then weighed together before the roots and shoots of each plant were cut apart. Then, the groups of three shoots were weighed together and the weights of the roots were calculated by subtracting the shoot mass from total mass.  Additionally, the maximum shoot and root length was measured for each group. After all data had been recorded, the standard deviation was calculated and a two sample one tailed t_test was run. 


Results:
The mean R:S ratio regarding weight for field pea plants grown in high light intensity is 0.61± 0.108 g while the mean R:S ratio regarding weight for field pea plants grown in low light intensity is 0.46± 0.404 g. The R:S weight ratio is smaller in plants grown in a low intensity light environment, suggesting that more of the plants weight is located in the shoots while less weight comes from the roots. Whereas the plant grown in the high intensity light environment has a higher R:S ratio suggesting that more of the weight of the plant is from the root rather than the shoot. The R:S length ratio mean is 1.28 mm for plants grown in high intensity light while the R:S length ratio mean is 1.46 mm for plants grown in low intensity light. This suggests the roots were longer in plants grown in low intensity light compared to high intensity light. Our results from running a two sample one tailed t_test  are not significent as results for weight (0.6213, 1, .2954) and for length ( -0.8647, 1, 0.7674) do not show a p value as less than 0.05. 


Discussion:
Our results support our hypothesis that plants in high intensity light environments allocate more essential resources to their roots than their shoots while plants in low intensity light environments allocate more essential resources to their shoots rather than their roots. The field peas grown in direct sunlight allocated more resources to roots as their roots were heavier, shown by the greater R:S weight ratio in Table 1. This suggests that plants grown in direct sunlight do not allocate as many resources to shoot growth as light is easily accessible. However, our results regarding the R:S length ratio contradict our hypothesis and evidence from the R:S weight ratio in Table 1. This could be due to an error in measurement as it was noted that an outlier in the raw data does exist, or perhaps the fact that the maximum length of roots and shoots were recorded and compared rather than an average length of roots and shoots. Therefore, the mean R:S length ratio may not be an accurate representation of the data. These results correlate to an experiment done where plant resource allocation was observed regarding plant burial. Biomass was found to be shifting from root to shoot plant components at an increasing rate as plants were buried deeper into the ground [Brown: 1997]. Furthermore, a study was done that suggests the time of planting for seedlings affects the shifting of biomass. [Hegazy:2005]. The relative growth rate for plants also affects where biomass is located in plants and as age increases, it has been shown to correlate to a shift; specific to different species [Hegazy:2005]. Resource allocation has also been studied in regards to reproductive organs in plants at different altitudes, showing that resources are allocated more to roots when altitude is increasing however allocation to reproductive parts of plants did not change [Johnston:2004]. These studies suggest that plant resource allocation correlates to phenotypic plasticity but many variables contribute to a plant's pattern of resource allocation that were not considered in this study. In the future, it would be beneficial to consider how various factors such as temperature, nutrients in the soil, absence of certain resources, and physical location of growth affect plant resource allocation in field pea plants.
