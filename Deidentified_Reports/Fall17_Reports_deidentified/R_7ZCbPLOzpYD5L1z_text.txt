Title: The Effect of Temperature on Specific Metabolic Rate of Crayfish. 

Abstract:
Metabolism is critical for all living organisms. The goal of this lab is to see how specific metabolic rate changes in relation to a temperature change. This study will be done on crayfish since they are ectotherms and rely on water temperature to keep their bodies warm. The crayfish were weighed and put in 7 and 18 degree Celsius water. The crayfish's oxygen was measured at 0,5,and 10 mins in the chamber. This was repeated with 3 crayfish. It was shown that the temperature had no significant change on the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. 

Introduction:
Metabolism is a chemical process that occurs in living organisms in order to make energy to maintain life. The Metabolism formula is O2+ glucose+ ADP ⇔CO2+ H20 +ATP. ATP is used by the organism for energy. Since O2 is used directly in metabolism is is a good indicator for calculating metabolic rate.
		In this experiment, we will be studying the metabolic rate of crayfish. Crayfish are ectotherms, animals that do not make their own body heat.  Also, temperature has an affect on how much oxygen the ectotherm can take up(Powell,2006). This experiment will look at the effect of temperature on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish.  The warmer the water, the higher the specific metabolic rate will be. According to Zou et. al, it is well known that the higher the temperature is, the metabolic rate goes up exponentially ( Zou, 2012). 

Materials and Methods:
First, each one of the three crayfish used were weighed. To test the specific metabolic rate for the colder temperature water, we made an ice bath. The temperature of the ice bath ended up being 7 degrees Celsius. We then put one of the weighed Crayfish in a Mason Jar with Oxygenated water from the fridge and an oxygen probe. We then took the Oxygen concentration at 0,5,and 10 mins. Next, the volume of water was measure in order to calculate specific metabolic rate.  This was repeated for the two other crayfish.  Room temperature water was then used as the warmer water. The above procedures were then followed to determine the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in warmer water.  The specific metabolic rates were calculated using the specific metabolic rate formula . Then a paired T-test is used to see if the data is significant. 


Results:
The results showed that there was barely a difference in the crayfish’s specific metabolic rate. The crayfish in 7 degree celsius water had a slightly higher metabolic rate than the 18 degree celsius water. 

Discussion:
The data was not significant to prove that crayfish’s  specific metabolic metabolic rate depends on specific temperature of the water.  This also means it does not support the hypothesis that the water temperature changes the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. The T test showed that the P value was 0.947 which is much greater than 0.05. One of the reasons why this experiment might of not worked, was there was not enough difference in the temperature to see a significant change of specific metabolic rate. To overcome this next time, we should probably put the crayfish in 0 degree Celsius Water and then in 40 degree Celsius water to see if the specific metabolic rate changes.
