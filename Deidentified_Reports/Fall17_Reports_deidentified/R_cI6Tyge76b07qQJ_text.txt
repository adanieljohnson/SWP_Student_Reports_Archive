Title: Calcium Antagonist, LaCl3, Decreased Response Amplitude of Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
This experiment investigated the effect of calcium antagonist, Lanthanum Chloride (LaCl3), on the response amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle after stimulation of the sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens. The significance of this project resides in its ability to support the findings found for the use of calcium antagonists as beneficial agents for surgical assistance and patient treatment. To conduct this experiment, frog legs were dissected and electrodes were attached to the sciatic nerve to stimulate the gastrocnemius muscle. The LaCl3 solution was injected into the muscle, followed by a 10-minute muscle stimulation. It was hypothesized that the introduction of LaCl3 would cause the gastrocnemius muscle’s response amplitude to decrease in comparison with the control group. The muscle response amplitude significantly decreased after the injection of LaCl3, across all three trials, with trial 1 yielding a p value of 0.0040, and trial 2 and 3 with p values of 0.0049 and 0.0000123, respectively.

Introduction:
Nerve impulses and neurons compose the basis of mobility within all animals. The generation of action potential is what initiates skeletal movement, and thus, induces mobility. ATP, scientifically known as adenosine triphosphate, is broken down to generate an action potential that will cause muscle contraction [Baker: 2010]. In addition to ATP, calcium ions are essential to produce movement. Calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and then bind to troponin, which induces a series of conformational changes that generate muscle contraction. The muscle contraction is then stopped by the re-uptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is responsible for initiating contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles. Calcium antagonists inhibit this release of Calcium ions, and may also be responsible for decreasing the availability of calcium ions within the cell, thus decreasing the chance for muscle contraction to occur [Middleton: 1983]. The utilization of calcium antagonists is beneficial for a wide variety of medical purposes, beginning with the use of calcium antagonists to successfully treat patients with hypertension [Grossman: 2004]. It has also been observed to successfully treat those who suffer from exercise-induced asthma [Middleton:1983]. As the release of calcium ions generates muscle contraction, the inhibition of calcium ion ingress will either weaken or prevent the muscle contraction from occurring. As mentioned in the examples above, it is beneficial that these contractions do not occur in order to treat certain disorders. Calcium antagonists are also important to study when trying to introduce muscle relaxers to the human body. A prime example of a calcium antagonist is Lidocaine, which serves to numb the muscle, and as a result, inhibit the stimulation of muscle contraction. Testing the efficiency and speed of calcium antagonists would be beneficial to further advance the application of calcium antagonists within treatments commonly used throughout the medical world. Additionally, calcium antagonists are used to dilate systemic arteries and arterioles. This is beneficial for biologists who conduct experiments that require close analysis of arteries within animals. By being able to dilate the arteries, biologists will be able to more precisely analyze the effects of their experiment on the arteries of experimental subjects.
In this experiment, the calcium antagonist’s effect on the response of the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens is closely examined. The Rana pipiens is a specific species of frog that belongs to the genus Rana. These frogs are generally utilized for experimentation revolving around musculoskeletal physiology, as these frogs have powerful hind legs for jumping long distances. The natural anatomy of these frogs makes them a model organism to use for the analyzation of the gastrocnemius muscle, which are more prominent in the Rana pipiens. The gastrocnemius muscle receives signals from the sciatic nerve, and is responsible for initiating movement of the lower leg. In a study utilizing D600, a calcium antagonist, it was found that the introduction of the D600 to a rabbit ear artery did not alter the current of depolarization when the muscle was at rest; however, the calcium antagonist either blocked or increased the rate of relaxation of the muscle after activation [Hering: 1989]. The cells utilized in this experiment were smooth muscle cells taken from an artery within the rabbit ear. Both smooth and skeletal muscle contractions are triggered by the release of calcium ions. As the gastrocnemius muscle is a skeletal muscle, it can be inferred that the effect D600 had on smooth muscle cells will be indicative of the effect that Lanthanum Chloride, also a calcium antagonist, will have on the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens. Based on this research, we hypothesized that the introduction of the calcium antagonist, LaCl3, would yield a decrease in the gastrocnemius muscle’s response amplitude, in comparison with the control group. 


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, we began by dissecting the frog leg, carefully peeling the skin off the entire leg to reveal the underlying muscle. From here, the scissors were used to cut the extraneous connective tissue away from the gastrocnemius muscle, in order to fully isolate the muscle for our purpose. We then used a dissecting probe to separate the inner thigh muscles, find the white sciatic nerve, and separate it from the surrounding connective tissue. We made sure to keep the muscle moist by periodically wetting the muscle with frog Ringer’s solution. We then cut off the end of the sciatic nerve where the junction between the top of the foot and the end of leg lay. After doing so, the end of gastrocnemius muscle was tied with a string, the tension was adjusted, and then the two pin electrodes were placed just inside the muscle. The BNC connector for the sleeve electrodes was then connected to the stimulator output. Using the Labscribe toolbar, the pulse amplitude was set to 0.00 V, the frequency was set to 1 Hz, and the number of pulses was set to 5. This step was done in order to ensure that there were no external influences affecting our measurements, and to ensure that the probe was working properly. The amplitude was then set to 1 V, with the frequency and number of pulses remaining the same. After recording values for the control, we then injected the frog leg with 0.2 mL of LaCl3. Following injection, we set a timer for 10 minutes before sending an impulse to the sciatic nerve. This was done to ensure that the LaCl3 had enough time to fully diffuse within the muscle. Once the 10-minute wait period was over, we sent a stimulus to the sciatic nerve, again following the same data measurement of 1 V, 1 Hz, and 5 pulses. This experiment was then conducted 2 more times, each time with a different frog leg. The data was then recorded and analyzed using a one-tailed, two sampled t-test to determine the statistical difference of the data. 

Results:
The general trend observed with each trial was that the response amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle decreased after injection of the LaCl3, as compared to the muscle response amplitudes recorded for the control groups. Trial 1 yielded average results of 0.6446 V and 0.510 V, and standard deviations of 0.0505 and 0, for the control and experimental groups respectively. The p value was calculated to be 0.0040, the Tstat was 5.966, and the degree of freedom was 4. Trial 2 yielded average values of 0.8274 V for the control group and 0.5646 V for the experimental group. The standard deviations were 0.0486 and 0.0661 for the control and experimental groups respectively. The p value was calculated to be 0.0049 and the Tstat value was 5.6445. Degrees of freedom was 4. Trial 3 yielded averages of 0.5430 V for the control group and 0.2030 V for the experimental group. The standard deviations were 0.0151 and 0.0207 for the control and experimental groups respectively. The p value was calculated to be 1.23×E^(-5), the Tstat value yielded 26.373, and the degrees of freedom was 8. All three trials yielded statistically significant results after data analysis. One general trend observed, was that there was a decrease in the amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle’s response after stimulation of the sciatic nerve when calcium antagonists were introduced. This trend was also observed in the lab, as the gastrocnemius muscle’s reaction to stimulation after injection of LaCl3 was visibly smaller than the contraction that ensued after stimulation without added calcium antagonists. Also, each ensuing trial yielded smaller average values of muscle contraction, before injection of LaCl3, than the trial before it. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that there would be significant decrease in the amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle’s response to sciatic nerve stimulation after the application of LaCl3 was supported by the statistical data gathered, thus rejecting our null hypothesis that there would be no difference in the gastrocnemius muscle response amplitude. These results were observed due to the properties of calcium antagonists working to inhibit the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as observed within the previously mentioned experiment where D600 was introduced to an artery within the rabbit ear. Thus, we could draw the conclusion that the decreased muscle response amplitude portrays the inhibition of these calcium ions, as fewer Ca2+ ions were able to flow down the ion channels and exit the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A complete lack of muscle response was not observed, signifying that the calcium antagonists did not fully inhibit the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 
Regarding human error, the measurement of LaCl3 to the 0.2 mL line using the syringe could have been slightly off as the reading was based upon a human eye. As well, the injection site could have been slightly different each time, possibly causing a difference in the rate of absorption or distribution of the calcium antagonist solution. Additionally, the frog ringer solution and LaCl3 solution possibly could have mixed when on the tray, causing some LaCl3 solution to be absorbed in the other frog legs before the experiment was conducted on them. This could explain the subsequent lower average values of the muscle response amplitudes of the control groups before injection of LaCl3. 
To further this experiment, it would be beneficial to test other application methods of introducing the LaCl3, other than injections, such as spritzing the muscle with the solution and massaging the solution into the muscle. The experiment could be further tested by utilizing an increased concentration of LaCl3, and observing the amount of time needed for diffusion as a result of a higher concentration, and examining whether there is an increased inhibition of Ca2+ ions.
This experiment revealed that calcium antagonists reduce muscle contraction, thus enabling the muscle to attain longer periods of relaxation without the generation of a contraction. This concept is important to study because it can help advance the field of medical technology and biological experimentation. Generating more knowledge on this subject matter can help with the production of more effective, efficient medicine that can help relax a patient’s muscles in order to maximize patient benefits, such as anesthesia, patients suffering from dystonia, asthma sufferers, and a multitude of others, as well as advance the knowledge gained through the field of biological experimentation.
