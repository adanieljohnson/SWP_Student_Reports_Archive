Title: Root to Shoot Ratio is not Affected by Reduced Surface Area in Raphanus Raphanistrum

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to test how herbivory affects plants growth, in terms of root to shoot ratio. My hypothesis was that increased herbivory would reduce plant growth, or root to shoot ratio. We calculated the root to shoot ratio of radish plants both with and without holes punched in its leaves to replicate herbivory in a natural setting of R. raphanistrum. We found that there was little difference between the growth of the R. raphanistrum that was affected by the reduced leaf surface area caused by herbivory and R. raphanistrum that was not affected by herbivory. We concluded that this could have occurred because the holes that we punched in the leaves of the experimental group may have been too small. 

Introduction:
Every species has its own optimal conditions in which fitness is at its highest. Each species also only has access to a limited amount of resources, so the organism must allocate its resources effectively in order to survive. In order to measure the allocation of resources, the root to shoot ratio can be utilized. By using this ratio, we can measure how the disruption of leaf surface area will plant growth. This will show how resource allocation may change based on the disruption. Herbivory, or organisms consuming plants, occurs in natural biological settings often. The plant that was studied is Raphanus raphanistrum, a wild radish species native to the southeast United States, south Australia, and throughout the Mediterranean region [Maldini et al.: 2017]. In Europe, Australia, and Canada, R. raphanistrum causes major crop losses as it is an agricultural weed [Singh: 2016]. This makes Raphanus raphanistrum a good plant to study on because it has quick germination and rapid growth, but this rapid growth is also the reason that R. raphanistrum is successful in causing crop losses [Yilmaz et al.:2016]. If holes are punched in the R. raphanistrum, disrupting the leaf’s surface area and mimicking herbivory, then the R. raphanistrum that had their surface area disrupted will have a lower root to shoot ratio than the R. raphanistrum that was not disrupted. 

Materials and Methods:
The independent variable was whether or not the plant’s leaves had hole punches and the dependent variable was the plant’s growth. We used six drainable pots with soil and inserted 10 R. raphanistrum seeds in each pot (about 1 inch into the soil). We added 38g per 10L of Miracle grow as a fertilizer and placed all pots in a greenhouse for optimal growth conditions. We checked on the radishes daily to ensure that the soil was adequately moistened. Once the plant’s leaves were large enough, we punched three millimeter holes in all of the leaves of the three experimental pots’ plants. We left the other three pots to grow normally in the greenhouse along with the experimental pots. We continued watering the plants on a daily basis, if necessary. After a total of two weeks of growing in the greenhouse, we removed the plants and calculated the root to shoot ratio of each of the pots. We used five measurements for each replicate. 

Results:
R. raphanistrum was not affected by the herbivory in this experiment. The R. raphanistrum that had leaves with disrupted surface area had a negligibly higher root to shoot ratio for mass and length than the R. raphanistrum that had leaves without a disrupted surface area. The difference was very minute that it led us to conclude that the experimental group and the control group had almost identical growth despite the herbivory. For the root to shoot ratio for length, there were 4 degrees of freedom, the t-value was 2.025 and the p-value was 0.113 [Figure 2]. For the root to shoot ratio for mass, there were 4 degrees of freedom, the t-value was 0.201, and the p-value was 0.850 [Figure 1]. Because both p-values were greater than 0.05, my results were not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
In our experiment, the root to shoot ratios for weight and height were both very close, leading us to conclude that herbivory had little to no effect on the success or resource allocation of R. raphanistrum. My hypothesis was not supported in that I believed that herbivory would result in a smaller root to shoot ratio for both length and weight in the R. raphanistrum in the experimental group. One reason that we could have had this result is that the holes that we punched in the leaves of the experimental group may not have been large enough to affect the plant’s growth, as the holes that we punched were only 3 millimeters in diameter. In terms of a biological phenomenon, we did not have a large enough amount of herbivory acting upon the R. raphanistrum to affect plant growth. In a study on plants’ tolerance of herbivory, it found that the plant’s tolerance to plant herbivory could affect regrowth and reproduction, showing that it is potentially possible to support my hypothesis with this experiment [Agrawal et. al: 1999]. In contrast to that evidence, a study on alternative plant survival strategies on defending itself against herbivores found that differing intensities in defoliation did not have an effect on survival or growth. This study showed that there is a trade-off between defense and regrowth [Meijden et. al: 1988]. Because different types of plants may utilize different strategies to handle herbivory, in future experiments, we should test multiple plant species. Another possible reason for our result was that we could have made an error in calculating our root to shoot ratios. We could have tugged at the roots of some of the plants as we removed the plants from their pots, causing the roots to be smaller length and weight. A similar study on root to shoot ratio in terrestrial biomes omitted 62% of its root to shoot ratio calculations because the root sampling methods were unreliable [Mokany et. al: 2005]. But the most likely explanation for our results was not punching holes large enough to mimic the effect of herbivory in natural settings. The next step for this study would be to repeat the experiment but punch larger holes in the leaves in order replicate increased plant herbivory more accurately.
