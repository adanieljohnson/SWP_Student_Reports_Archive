Title:  The inconsequential effects of salinity on photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca and Rosmarinus officianalis

Abstract:
This experiment tests the effect of salinity on photosynthesis of rosemary and spinach plants. The experimenters measured the effect on photosynthesis by measuring the change in the absorbance of the plants’ chloroplasts. The experimenters’ hypothesis was that if salt is introduced to spinach chloroplasts, then photosynthesis will occur at a slower rate, compared to the controlll group; and if salt is introduced to the rosemary chloroplasts, there will not be an observed difference between the experimental and controlll group. ANOVA tests were used to determine that the results in this experiment were largely insignificent and it was concluded that salt did not have a significent effect on photosynthesis rates. The experimenters’ hypothesis was not supported.

Introduction:
The experimenters came into this experiment understanding that photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts and that salt directly affects chloroplasts ability to undergo photosynthesis. It was also known that rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) could withstand moderate doses of salinity [Tounetki: 2011], and that chlorophyll concentration and water use of spinach (Spinacia oleraca) were reduced significently by high salinity [Kaya et al.: 2005].  This experiment is important because salinity is a major environmental factor limiting plant growth and productivity [Allakherdiev et al., 2000]. The osmotic school of thought claims that most of the adverse effects of salinity are related to the decreased osmotic potential (i.e. increased osmotic pressure) of saline root media, whereas the specific-ion school of thought thinks that the effects are caused mostly by the specific effects of individual ions [Bernstein: 1975]. The questions considered coming into this experiment were how salinity affects photosynthesis in various plants. The experimenters expected the more salt resistant plant (rosemary) to undergo photosynthesis at the same level as it would without exposure to salt and that the spinach plant’s photosynthetic processes would be negatively affected by salt, shown by a change in absorbance. In order to answer this question, the experimenters introduce DCPIP into the photosynthetic system to serve as an alternate electron carrier, since the experimenters cannot directly observe the electron transport chain. The hypothesis for this experiment is that if salt is introduced to spinach chloroplasts, then photosynthesis will occur at a slower rate, compared to the controlll group; and if salt is introduced to the rosemary chloroplasts, there will not be an observed difference between the experimental and controlll group.


Materials and Method:
First, two mortar and pestles, two 150-250 Ml beakers and three 50 Ml centrifuge tubes were placed in ice. The central veins were removed from four spinach leaves. They were washed and placed in one mortar and pestle. Next, the stems were removed from thirty rosemary leaves, and the leaves were washed and placed in a different mortar and pestle. Then, 10 Ml of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer (pH 8) was added to each and the leaves were grinded to a thick paste. 10Ml more of buffer was added to the mixtures and ground. Each mixture was strained through 3 layers of cheesecloth into its respective beaker. Then transfer each solution into a chilled, labeled 50 Ml centrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 200xG (1200 rpm) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. Next, the supernatant from the A tubes was poured into centrifuge tubes and spun at 1000xG (2800 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. These supernatants were poured into centrifuge tubes, without disturbing the pellet. 20 Ml of buffer were added to the pellets and they were suspended by stirring gently. 200 uL of the resuspended pellet was transferred into a microtubule to use the hemacytometer to check for chloroplasts in each pellet solution. Label 15 test tubes and fill them to the appropriate values in the chart. They were transferred to cuvettes and initial absorbances were measured. All tubes were placed in natural light and absorbances were measured every 10 minutes for 30 minutes.


Results:
For spinach, the initial controlll and the initial experimental absorbances were not significent. According to the ANOVA test, the spinach results throughout the entire time frame (initial, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes) never became significent. Although the derived data percent change does show some significance. For rosemary, on the other hand the controlll and experimental absorbances were initially significent, but after 30 minutes, the controlll and experimental absorbances for rosemary were insignificent, according to the ANOVA test: The derived data shows that the percent change in the experimental rosemary group was higher after 10 minutes and 30 minutes, but the controlll group was higher after 20 minutes. The derived data percent change after 20 minutes was 2% or less for both groups and was less than 1% after 30 minutes for both groups. These results were insignificent.

Discussion:
Our results, according to the ANOVA tests, did not support our hypothesis, which was that if salt is introduced to spinach chloroplasts, then photosynthesis will occur at a slower rate, compared to the controlll group; and if salt is introduced to the rosemary chloroplasts, there will not be an observed difference between the experimental and controlll group. However, the derived data shows a promising trend that suggests that further experimentation would be needed to possibly support our hypothesis. There were a few sources of error in our experiment, the primary source being a flawed experimental design. If we could to re-design the experiment, we should have tested the same plant with varying salt concentrations, instead of different plants at the same salt concentration. I think we underestimated that different species can handle the same salt concentration in entirely different manners, making it hard to ascertain significent results. If we could conduct this same experiment again, we would benefit from more trials and more materials available to us, including having a better light source, multiple pipettes, and immediate access to a centrifuge whenever needed. Although these would not have helped our flawed experimental design, they could have given us more promising results. The next logical step for this study would be to test varying salt concentrations on each of the plants, in order to see how each plants is individually affected by different levels of salinity. Our experiment can be compared to [Kaya et al.: 2001]. This experiment also tests the effects of salinity on spinach. However, they did not test how it affects photosynthesis, therefore they did not test the absorbance of the chlorophyll. Instead this experiment tested the physiological and nutritional development of spinach when not only exposed to salt but also supplementary phosphorus and potassium.
