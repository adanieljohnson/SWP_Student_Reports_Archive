Title: Effects of darkness on the metabolic pathway of Procambris

Abstract:
Oxygen is utilized in the metabolic pathway in the making of ATP, and the amount of ATP needed by the organism changes in response to environmental factors. Therefore, in darkness, when most organisms are inactive, a lower metabolic rate should be observed. It was hypothesized that Procambris would respond to darkness by lowering its metabolic rate. Method included the use of a dissolved oxygen probe to measure the oxygen consumption of 3 crayfish both with and without aluminum foil covering the chamber, with each crayfish serving as its own controlll. The hypothesis was not supported, as statistical significance was not reached in the data, with a p_value of 0.851. It was concluded that these results were likely flawed, as similar experiments found that the metabolic rate of ectotherms decreased in response to darkness. The experimental design must be altered in the future to account for limitations of the current design.


Introduction:
In the metabolic pathway, which takes place in the mitochondria, high-energy molecules (glucose) are converted to lower-energy ones; the energy released is ATP. Oxygen is vital to the pathway, because it takes electrons off the end of the transport chain, allowing ATP production to continue. In the process of doing this, oxygen is converted into water. Therefore, the amount of oxygen consumed by an organism is directly proportional to the amount of energy produced and is an indirect indicator of metabolic rate. Metabolic rate can be influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature [Sadava: 2016]. Another environmental factor believed to have an impact on metabolism is the amount of light present. In Spermestes cucullatus, a small species of bird, a nocturnal metabolic rate 50% less than that in daytime was observed [Lovegrove: 2003]. In addition, Microcebus murinus, a small primate, was exposed to simulated days and nights of varying lengths; it was found that the primates exposed to the shortest day length gained body mass and experienced a decrease in oxygen consumption [Perret: 1998]. These findings can be most likely be attributed to the tendency of animals to lower their activity in the dark, as is commonly seen at night. Procambris will be used as the model organism for the experiment, as the organism is an ectotherm, and its metabolic rate changes drastically in response to environmental conditions. Additionally, it is small enough that it can be held in a test chamber, yet large enough that its oxygen intake will register on the dissolved oxygen instrument. Although Spermestes cucullatus and Microcebus murinus are endothermic and Procambris is ectothermic, it is expected that the effect of darkness on their metabolic rate will be the same, although very few experiments have been conducted on how light impacts metabolic rate, especially with regard to ectothermic organisms. It is hypothesized that the crayfish will consume a smaller quantity of oxygen when exposed to darkness.


Materials and Method:
Three crayfish were used for this experiment, with each crayfish serving as its own controlll. A crayfish was weighed before being placed in the test chamber. The chamber was then filled with room-temperature oxygenated water. When the oxygen probe was inserted into the chamber and the chamber top was screwed on, some water overflowed, ensuring that the probe was completely submerged in water. The chamber was placed in a dishpan containing room-temperature water. Once the dissolved oxygen instrument was turned on, it was allowed to stabilize for approximately a minute before the preliminary reading of dissolved oxygen was taken. Additional readings were taken at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes before the probe was removed. The crayfish was then removed before the volume of water in the test chamber was measured using a graduated cylinder. These steps were repeated for the same crayfish, except aluminum foil was placed over the entire chamber and left in place for all 20 minutes of the dissolved oxygen readings. Specific metabolic rate was calculated using the following formula:  Specific metabolic rate = [∆O2  (mg/L)  * volume H2O (L)] / [Time (min)  *  weight (g)] This process was repeated until the specific metabolic rates of all 3 crayfish had been found under both controlll and dark conditions. Specific metabolic rate data was analyzed using a one-tailed paired t_test.


Results:
The average specific metabolic rate for the controlll was 0.000438 mg O2 *g-1 *min-1 (SD: 0.000365), whereas the average specific metabolic rate in darkness was 0.000470 mg O2 *g-1 *min-1 (SD: 0.000363), and the p_value was 0.851. The specific metabolic rate was not significently different in darkness from the baseline.


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that crayfish would consume a smaller amount of dissolved oxygen in darkness and a larger amount of dissolved oxygen in light. The original hypothesis has not been supported, and statistical significance was not reached. This data is intriguing because in another experiment, in which the resting metabolic rate was measured for a species of lizard, another ectotherm, the metabolic rate was higher in summer than in spring or fall, supposedly due to more hours of light [Angilletta: 2001]. The hours of darkness are related to metabolic rate in that physical activity decreases during darkness, resulting in a smaller need for ATP production and a subsequent drop in metabolic rate. Similarly, in an experiment in which fish were subjected to four different photoperiod cycles, or different amounts of time for light and darkness, it was observed that the greatest metabolic activity occurred during light periods and the lowest metabolic activity occurred during dark periods [Biswas: 2002]. Thus, scientific literature seems to be in agreement that, for both terrestrial and aquatic ectotherms, metabolic rate is lowered in darkness.  However, to reach these conclusions, data was collected for the lizards over 12 hours, and data was collected for the fish over 48 hours. Therefore, time limitations of the crayfish experiment could have altered the results that were attained; dissolved oxygen was only recorded for 20 minutes in this experiment, so the length of time might not have been long enough for the crayfish to habituate and adjust their metabolic rates. Moreover, there was no way to controlll for the physical activity of the crayfish, so they might have been exerting more energy during the experimental trial than they were in the controlll trial, inflating the specific metabolic rate. Another possibility could have been that the dissolved oxygen probe was faulty, as the oxygen reading exceeded the initial reading several times throughout the experiment. Also, the test chamber might not have been completely sealed, which would have allowed oxygen to enter or exit the chamber.   In a future study, the oxygen consumption of an organism living in a region with fewer hours of light could be compared to the oxygen consumption of the same organism in a region with more light. Data about how available light affects its metabolism could shed new light on that organism’s behaviors, such as its feeding and mating patterns, and how these might be restricted based on environmental factors.
