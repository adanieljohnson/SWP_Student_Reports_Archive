Title: The Effects of Salinity on Photosynthesis in Chloroplast of Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to see if salinity has any effects on the absorbance rate of chloroplasts in Spinacia oleraca. Our hypothesis was that the chloroplasts in the saline environment will have a lower absorbance rate and therefore a lower photosynthetic ability than the chloroplasts not affected by salinity. This was done by extracting the chloroplasts from Spinacia oleraca using a centrifuge. We then prepared our controlll and experimental groups (normal and saline). Then we measured the absorbance using a spectrophotometer and percent change was calculated for each group and ran statistical analysis for our data. Our results were not statistically significent and therefore our hypothesis could not be supported. There was not a large enough difference in the absorbance rates between the chloroplasts for our data to be significent. This experiment was important because our world faces an issue of a growing population with a food supply that cannot grow equally in demand. Therefore, we can use this experiment and experiments like this to help increase photosynthetic abilities in plants so they will be able to grow faster and help increase our food supply. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a biological process done by all plants in which light energy is captured to make glucose. Glucose is the basic form of sugar that plants use for food and energy to fuel other systems and processes throughout the plant. The site where photosynthesis occurs is in the chloroplast of plant cells. By measuring the absorbance rate of the chloroplast and the percent change we can tell if those chloroplasts that were tested are undergoing photosynthesis or not. More specifically, we can use the Hill Reaction to test this. This is because the Hill Reaction is the general process of electron transfer in the company of working chloroplasts with light and DCPIP as an electron receptor that absorbs maximum light at 600nm. DCPIP reduction can be related to a decrease in absorbance at 600nm, meaning it can indicate any effects on photosynthesis. Photosynthesis and the making of glucose is important in plant cells because it provides the plant with the necessary starting material needed for the process of glycolysis, to make energy, ATP [Johnson:2017]. Without photosynthesis, the plant would not have any glucose to use in glycolysis, which is the process in which glucose is broken down into pyruvate which is then used in more cellular processes, and would therefore not have any energy to run any other processes in the plant. 
	There are many factors that can influence the rate of photosynthesis, these include the amount of light present, the amount of chloroplast in the plant, the amount of water, and the salinity of the environment. The amount of light that is present controllls the rate of photosynthesis because light is used to splice water molecules and help start the process of photosynthesis, the more light/the higher the intensity of the light, the more water can be spliced in the same amount of time. The number of chloroplasts is important because the more chloroplasts available then the more area you have to perform photosynthesis. The amount of water is a regulator because water gets spliced to start the process, so the more water, more can be spliced and the reaction can proceed faster. The salinity of the environment is significent because if the is more salt in the environment there will be less water and therefore less water to be spliced, thus lowering photosynthesis [Parida:2005].
	In this lab, we will be testing how the salinity of the environment effects the photosynthetic properties of Spinacia oleraca, or common spinach. Common spinach was chosen for this experiment because it is cheap, easy to test, and applicable to the real world in agricultural senses because it is a very common part of people’s diets. The purpose of this experiment is to see the effects that salinity has on the absorbance of chloroplasts and therefor photosynthetic properties. This is important because this can be applied to the agricultural world and if a saline environment is more favorable for photosynthesis than a saline environment will be created to grow plants more efficiently. Our hypothesis for this lab is that when introduced into a saline environment the absorbance rate and therefore photosynthetic ability of the chloroplasts will be lowered/ inhibited. 


Materials and Method:
Four leaves of Spinacia oleraca were taken and the large central vein of each was taken out. Then the de-veined leaves were placed in a cold mortar and 10 Ml of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0, was added. The leaves were grinded into a thick paste to which an additional 10 Ml of the grinding buffer were added. We poured the liquid into a 50Ml centrifuge tube We then spun the sample at 200 x G at 4 degrees Celsius for 3 minutes, and had the centrifuge properly balanced. Then, we poured the liquid from this centrifuge tube into another centrifuge tube, making sure that the debris is not transferred. We then placed 200 μl of the solution into a microtubule and stored it on ice. Then we placed the centrifuge tube in the centrifuge, properly balanced, and spun it at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes and 4 degrees Celsius.  Next, we poured the liquid from the second tube into a third tube, once again making sure not to disturb the pellet. We then added 20Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet in the tube to suspend it. The pellet was mixed around in the sample and then 200 μl from that tube was transferred into a third microtubule. 200 μl of the liquid was removed and placed into a microtubule. Next 10 test tubes were taken and labeled blank and 1-9. 100 μl of the sample was placed into the “blank” test tube as well as test tubes 6,7,8,9. Then 8Ml of water was placed into the “blank” test tube, and 6 Ml of water was added to the remaining tubes. 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP was then added into every test tube except for the “blank” one. 2Ml of 100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5 was then added into every single test tube. Finally, 1Ml of 10% NaCl was added into test tubes 7,8,9 and all the test tubes were carefully mixed. Liquid from each test tube was transferred into a cuvette. Immediately the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbance for each of the cuvettes at 600nm was recorded at time zero. Each cuvette was then placed under a lamp to keep light intensity constant. After, the spectrophotometer was again blanked and the absorbance for each cuvette was recorded. This was repeated until we had data for times zero, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. The percent change for each of the absorbance recorded after time zero was calculated. Also, we used a 2 sample, 1-tailed t_test to interpret our results. We had a null hypothesis stating that if we introduced the chloroplast into a saline environment, then there would be no effect on the photosynthesis in the chloroplasts. Our alternate hypothesis was that if we introduced the chloroplasts into a saline environment, then there would be a negative effect on photosynthesis in the chloroplasts.


Results:
Our results show that after sitting for 30 minutes the chloroplasts that were exposed to a saline environment showed a lower percent change in absorbance than those in a non-saline environment. This can be seen in Figure 1 where the percent change for the saline chloroplasts was around 85 and for the normal chloroplasts it was around 90. The chloroplasts in a saline environment had a higher absorbance rate than the chloroplasts in a non-saline environment, however the difference was very small. The average percent change in absorbance rate for each group was as follows, for no chloroplasts .17%, for normal chloroplasts 64.14%, and for chloroplasts in a saline environment 62.30%. After running our statistical analysis test, 2 sample 1-tailed t_test, we can conclude that our results are not significent because a large p_value was calculated, 0.4364. We also calculated a t-value of 0.0836, further strengthening our claim that our data was not significent, due to it being such a small value. 


Discussion:
The goal of this experiment was to test if there was an effect on photosynthetic activity when introduced to a saline environment. After performing our experiment, we concluded that our hypothesis cannot be supported. Not only were the absorbances for the chloroplasts in a saline environment higher and the percent change lower, the results were not significent because we had a very large p_value. Since our data was not significent we cannot make any conclusions about the effects of saline environments on photosynthetic ability in Spinacia oleraca. However, the gathered results are very interesting. This is because we expected salt to lower photosynthetic ability and absorbance, yet our absorbance was higher in our saline chloroplast than our normal chloroplast. As a result, further experimentation should be done to yield significent data, that way we will be able to tell whether salinity really effects photosynthesis in chloroplasts with more certainty. Other similar experiments have been done where the results that were collected were opposite of ours, salt inhibited photosynthesis [Chow: 1990]. In that experiment, spinach was also used as the organism, however, they tested at a high and low concentration of salt, and got results showing that salinity inhibits photosynthesis [Chow: 1990]. Future experimentation that we would like to perform would be to see if there is a difference between plants going under a stronger and longer exposure to salt causing a salt stress and normal plants in their photosynthetic abilities [Delfine: 1999]. This experiment was similar to ours except it exposed the plants to a saline environment before testing the chloroplasts for photosynthesis. This caused the plants to be undergoing/recovering from salt stress, thus inhibiting the rate of photosynthesis [Delfine: 1999]. Or how introducing the chloroplasts of different species of plants, such as C3 plants, effects its photosynthetic ability, not Spinacia oleraca [Flexas J:2004]. In that experiment, they tested the difference in photosynthesis in different plant types because C3 plants have different photosynthetic properties than C4 plants, causing for different effects of salinity [Flexas J:2004]. This experiment was important because if this experiment is run again in a larger scale and significent results are achieved, then agricultural advancements can be made from this. For example, if significent results were collected that stated that chloroplasts in saline environments had higher absorbance rates, then it would make sense to grow those plants in a saline environment so photosynthesis would occur more often at a faster rate and the plant could grow faster. This could help become a potential fix to the global issue of a growing population that is exceeding our food supply.
