Title: BIO214 L Paper 1 - Effect of Temperature on Spinach and Strawberry Chloroplast Activity

Abstract:
In the electron transport chain (ETC), an important process in photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed and passes through a complex series of reactions, resulting in the production of ATP. In this experiment, we observed the effects of temperature on the ETC, designating three experimental groups: cold, room temperature, and hot. We hypothesized that higher temperatures would result in an increase in chloroplast activity.
    Spinacia oleracea (spinach) and Fragaria ananassa (strawberry) were chosen for this experiment because of their wide availability and agricultural relevance. The leaves were ground into a solution with grinding buffer and centrifuged multiple times. In order to quantify the change in chloroplast activity, we added DCPIP, an electron acceptor that changes from its normal blue color to clear when reduced. We recorded the absorbance of each chloroplast solution three times over a span of thirty minutes. We then calculated percent change and analyzed for variance using an ANOVA.
    While the ANOVA did not confirm significant variance between the three groups, the data for both spinach and strawberry showed the largest percent change in absorbance in the hot groups and the lowest in the cold groups.

Introduction:
An important process in photosynthesis, the electron transport chain (ETC) takes place in the thylakoid membrane of a chloroplast, an organelle which specializes in harvesting energy from sunlight. During the ETC, light energy is absorbed, in turn exciting electrons. These electrons are then transferred to electron accepting molecules, such as NADP+, and then transferred across the membrane with a proton. When the proton returns to the inside of the membrane through ATP synthase, ATP is formed [Johnson: 2017].
The activity of the ETC can be affected by many factors. In an experiment investigating the effects of temperature on photosynthetic activity, researchers concluded that the optimal temperature for photosynthesis in various segrasses was 25-35° C [Bulthuis: 1987]. Hoping to build upon this knowledge, we decided to test the effects of temperature on two different plants: Spinacia oleracea (commonly referred to as spinach) and Fragaria ananassa (also known as strawberry). 
Spinach tissue growth rates have been shown to vary based on temperature, with higher temperatures favoring increased growth [Boese: 1990]. Given that it is both widely available and agriculturally important, we chose spinach as a test organism, aiming to determine whether or not the observed difference in growth rate correlates with varying photosynthetic activity in the ETC. We decided to also test strawberry so that the results of the two plants could be compared and help determine whether or not our findings are consistent across both organisms.
We hypothesized that higher temperatures would increase chloroplast activity in both plants as the higher temperatures would cause an input of thermal energy into the ETC, exciting electrons and initiating photosynthesis. Similarly, we also hypothesized that photosynthesis would decrease in plants exposed to colder temperatures since less energy is available in the system.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we observed the effects of cold, room temperature, and hot conditions on chloroplast activity of spinach and strawberry leaves. To do this, we measured the chloroplast activity of spinach and strawberry solutions placed in cold, room temperature, and hot areas every 10 minutes (for a total of 30 minutes). In order to quantify chloroplast activity, we used electron acceptor DCPIP. When reduced, DCPIP changes from its normal blue color to clear, allowing us to quantify the activity of the ETC by measuring absorbance using a spectrophotometer.
    To begin, the Wake Forest Biology Department obtained spinach and strawberry leaves. While the number of leaves did not influence the results, 4 spinach and 7 strawberry leaves were chosen in order to provide adequate material for the experiment. Each leaf was deveined. Next, the spinach and strawberry leaves were placed in separate chilled mortar and pestles. They were then ground with 10 mL of pH 8 grinding buffer until no visible chunks remained. Using cheesecloth, the solutions were then strained into their respective chilled beakers labeled “Spinach” and “Strawberry.”
    The solutions from the beakers were then poured into their respective chilled centrifuge tubes. Both tubes were centrifuged at a rate of 1200 RPM (20 x G) for 3 minutes at 4° C. Upon completion, the liquid in the spinach tubes was poured into a new tube, leaving the solid at the bottom of the first tube. Likewise, the liquid contents of the strawberry tube were poured into a second tube. The two tubes were then centrifuged at a rate of 1200 RPM (20 x G) for 3 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant of each tube was poured into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube. The pellets at the bottom of the tubes were then re-suspended in 20 mL of pH 8 reaction buffer, creating our chloroplast solution.
    Next, 20 test tubes were obtained. One was designated the blank, and another became the positive control. Nine of the remaining tubes were labeled A1 through A9 for spinach solutions, while the the other nine were labeled B1 through B9 for strawberry solutions. Each group (A and B) was divided into three experimental groups: cold, room temperature, and hot. Excluding the blank (which was filled with only water), each test tube received 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP, 2 mL of pH 8 reaction buffer, and 100 uL chloroplast solution. The test tubes were then promptly mixed by gentle shaking.
    Using a micropipette, a small amount of each solution was transferred to a cuvette. Each cuvette was wiped down with a Kimwipe. The spectrophotometer was set to 600 nm and blanked using a cuvette filled with water. Next, each solution was placed in a cuvette and initial absorbance was recorded. Immediately after withdrawing solution, the six test tubes designated for the cold treatment were placed in an ice bath at 1° C. The six tubes assigned to the hot group were placed in a hot water bath set at 35° C. The remaining test tubes remained exposed to room temperature conditions (22° C).
    After 10 minutes, the process of recording absorbance was repeated for each solution. After withdrawing a small amount of solution, each test tube was promptly placed back in its designated conditions. The process was again repeated at the 20 and 30 minute mark for each test tube.
    Percent change was calculated for each group at the 10, 20, and 30 minute marks. An ANOVA was then used to analyze for variance in percent changes of the hot, room temperature, and cold groups for each plant.

Results:
The data for both spinach and strawberry showed a larger percent change in absorbance in the hot groups as compared to the room temperature and cold groups. Likewise, the data for both plants showed a smaller percent change in absorbance in the cold groups as compared to the room temperature and hot groups.
A 25.5 percent difference was observed when comparing the hot and cold trials testing spinach. However, the difference between the three groups was not found to be significant (F(1.057,8)=0.433).
A 15.4 percent difference was found when comparing the hot and cold groups of the strawberry tests. The difference between the three groups was not found to be significant (F(0.556,8)=0.799).

Discussion:
Our statistical tests did not confirm a significant variance between the three experimental groups. However, looking at Figure 1 and Figure 2, it is clear that our data supports our hypothesis since the warmer temperatures display a greater percent change in absorbance. This conclusion is supported by previous research. According to a study on heat sensitivity of photosynthetic electron transport, the optimal temperature for photosynthesis lies between 33.8° C and 43° C, varying based due to the sugar concentration of the leaf [Hüve 2006]. Our experimental group subjected to 35° C conditions, which falls within this range, was shown to produce the most chloroplast activity.
    While we are confident in our results, there are improvements that can be made to this experiment. When recording the absorbance for the cold group using the spectrophotometer, the wall of the cuvettes gradually fogged up due to the cold contents of the cuvette. We attempted to minimize any errors in absorbance by immediately reading the absorbance after placing the cuvette in the spectrophotometer instead of letting the number fluctuate and then settle. However, it is unlikely that all error was eliminated. The hot solutions in the cuvettes presented a similar issue by causing condensation on the walls, and measures were again taken to minimize error.
    Many steps could be taken to further research regarding the effect of temperature on chloroplast activity. For example, studying the effect of temperature on cyanobacteria rather than plants may lead to different results. In a study on photosynthetic archaebacteria Spirulina platensis, researchers determined that overall electron transport activity declined at temperatures higher than 35 °C [Venkataramanaiah: 2003]. A future experiment based off this study could be used to investigate and compare the effects of temperature on the archaebacterial and plant electron transport chains. Given that some specific varieties of archaebacteria are thermophilic, better understanding the thermotolerant electron transport chains of these organisms could help researchers increase thermotolerance of agricultural crops, optimizing growth over a wider range of temperatures.
