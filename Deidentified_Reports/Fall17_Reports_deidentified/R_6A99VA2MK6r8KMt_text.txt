Title: Betta splendins increase aggressive in behavior on the duration of that behavior when encounter larger body size opponents. 

Abstract:
Siamese fighting fish would show aggressive behavior toward territorial intruders. In order to determine whether body size would affect the level of aggressiveness of the behavior, we conduct an experiment to see if fish would show more aggressive behavior toward larger body size fish. The results show the mean of the small body size is statistically significently less than that of the mean of the large body size. Take that together, the hypothesis is supported by the data and Betta fish tend to show more aggressive behavior as longer lasting time toward larger body size fish.


Introduction:
Betta splendins, also called Siamese fighting fish, would present aggressive behavior toward territorial intruders. Two male betta fishes that are next to each other will attack each other and they will start to kill each other until one of them is dead. Normally, people would assume that smaller body size fish would show less aggressive behavior due to smaller possibility to win in the competition between the small fish and the large fish. We hypothesize that betta fish will actually show higher level of aggressiveness in behavior toward larger fish than smaller fish. We hypothesize this based on that female prefer smaller male fish when they have the chance to choose between two fishes. [Jaroensutasinee: 2001] Betta fish might tend to show higher level of aggressiveness in behavior toward larger body size fish for they having a higher reproductive chance compared to larger body size fish, better chance to pass their genes. At our last experiment, we conclude that male Betta fish would show aggressive behavior more towards other male fish than female fish. Female fish, on the other hand, would not engage in aggressive behavior like male Betta fish do. Male fish were more aggressive when they encounter other male fish than female fish and gill flaring seems to be the first behavior when they encounter other female fish during different stage. [Forsatkar: 2017] This suggests the same as the previous experiment that we did that male fish would engage in gill flaring, protruding the branchiostegal membranes, when they encounter with other male fish. The results suggest that Siamese fighting fish use gill flaring as an acute response in order to defend their territory. Forsatkar also points out that it might be replaced by fin spreading to minimize the energy that they spend on the behavior. [Forsatkar: 2017] This suggest a better way to quantify the behavior between male Betta fish – the lasting time of aggressive behavior since they see each other and marked for both the gill flaring and fin spreading as the starting point when we look at the difference of aggressive level of behavior between body size. This time, we interest in how body size would affect the level of aggressive in behavior and with the above quantifying behavior method. The null hypothesis would be that the mean of aggressive behavior toward small body size fish is not statistically significently different than the aggressive behavior toward large body size fish. The alternative hypothesis would be the mean of aggressive behavior toward small body size fish is less than the mean of aggressive behavior toward large body size fish.


Materials and Method:
We wanted to see if there are tendency that betta fish would display aggressive behavior more often on a larger body size fish than a relatively smaller body size. We would use three kinds of fish in our experiment - small body size, medium body size, and large body size. Each larger body size is 15% larger than the smaller one. In order to rule out the factor of color, we use only blue Betta fish for this experiment. We take 6 medium size fishes (subject 1-6), one small fish, and one large fish. We focus on the medium size fish to see if there is a tendency to show aggressive behavior toward smaller size fish. Then, we conduct the experiment with each medium fish engage with both the small fish and the large fish physically separate with each other. We observe the lasting time of the aggressive behavior (often start with protruding the branchiostegal membranes) since two fish saw each other as a measurement of quantify behavior. We will run each trail in a transparent glass water tank with a glass in between two subjects for 5 minutes and have a rest of 5 minutes after each fish has a trail to prevent habituation. After collecting the data, we would use a paired t_test to process the data. 


Results:
Subject 1 and subject 3 show almost no interest in engaging aggressive behavior toward either smaller or larger body size fish. Therefore, we rule out their data when we do the statistic test. The p_values of paired t_test of the lasting time of the aggressive behavior toward relatively small size fish and relatively large size is approximately 0.098325 when we don’t take subject 1 and 3 out of consideration. When we take them out of the account, the p_values of the paired t_test is approximately 0.047508. With significance level being 0.05 and p_values being 0.047508, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean of lasting time of aggressive behavior toward the small body size fish is statistically significently less than that of the mean of lasting time of aggressive behavior toward the large body size fish. 


Discussion:
In short, our data supports the alternative hypothesis. The outcome of the experiment is surprising because it seems on the opposite of the common sense. As Jaroensutasinee proposes, male fishes that show high aggressiveness to larger body size fishes are favored by female fishes and so they could have better chances to reproduce. In Jaroensutasinee’s study, their results show that larger betta fishes are more dominant in the competition between two male fishes and fighting duration is almost the same. No differences were showed between small and big betta fish on the level of the aggressiveness. [Jaroensutasinee: 2001] Comparing to our study, this show significently different results. The reason might be that our study was not as comprehensive as theirs. Measuring only one quantified behavior would seem limited at this point. Moreover, other factors could also attribute to this outcome. Forsatkar, the same person gave us the measurement of our study, suggests that temperature may be one of those factors. Bettas that are under increased temperatures seem to be more active than those in the area of lower temperature. This suggests that betta fishes might be more aggressive when they are under higher temperature. The trait could also be altered by the temperature and change the behavior along the aggressiveness of that behavior. [Forsatkar: 2017] Different area in the tank might cause different temperature and that might cause the fish to be more or less aggressive than they normally do. What’s more, in our experiment, we rule out the factor of color. However, there are still differences between parts of the fishes. We don’t know what part of fish will other fish notice first when they choose to engage in aggressive behavior with the other fish. For further study, we could take down color into different body parts for consideration of the level of the aggressiveness in behavior.
