Title: The Effect of Nicotine on Contraction Amplitude(V)

Abstract:
The objective of this lab is to study the effect of nicotine, an acetylcholine agonist, on the contraction amplitude in the thigh muscle of a frog. Electrodes will be connected to the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens. Three frogs will be used for this study and their contraction amplitude will be recorded before and after the injection of 1 Ml of nicotinic solution. Our hypothesis is that nicotine will cause a faster rate of action potentials in the T-tubules, leading to an increase in contraction amplitude. After a series of paired t_tests were done, the hypothesis was supported with three p_values all below the significance level of 0.001, meaning nicotine did increase contraction amplitude after injection. An increase in reception of acetylcholine and its agonist allows for more frequent depolarization of the T-tubles in muscle fibers. More Ca2+ ion are released as a result, leading to stronger muscle contractions. Future studies could study the long-term effects of nicotine on acetylcholine receptors. 

Introduction:
When a motor neuron becomes depolarized above the threshold, an “all or nothing” event happens. Action potentials run through the axon of a neuron to the presynaptic membrane, where synaptic transmission begins. The depolarization of the terminal opens voltage gated Ca2+ channels, causing an influx of Ca2+ ions. The flow of these ions move vesicles full of acetylcholine towards the presynaptic membrane. Once the vesicles fuse with the membrane, the neurotransmitter flows into the synaptic cleft, where they attach to receptors on a muscle fiber. This is called the neuromuscular junction. The acetylcholine does not directly contract muscles though. The receptors activated by it then depolarize T-tubules in the muscle, which activate receptors that allow Ca2+ ions to flow out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These ions are what cause muscle contraction. 
	Acetylcholine is the body’s natural neurotransmitter for muscle movement, but a molecule that is the same shape of acetylcholine could be used to mimic its function and attach to an acetylcholine receptor. These similar molecules are called agonists, and nicotine can serve as one. It could also have the potential to be stronger effect than acetylcholine. As T.M. Egan says in his research paper, nicotine increases the rate of action potentials, but has the same effect as acetylcholine [Egan: 1986]. From Egan’s study, it can be concluded that both acetylcholine and nicotine stimulate muscle contraction through a similar process. They both bind to receptors on muscle fibers that eventually cause release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which contracts muscles. 
	To see the effect of nicotine, we will inject the agonist into the leg of a Rania pipiens and measure contraction amplitude of the contractions. This species of frog is favorable to our experiment because we can locate and stimulate it through the sciatic nerve to see its effect on the gastrocnemus thigh muscle. The twitches are easily observable and there is a simple method to measuring the contraction amplitude using electrodes. The null hypothesis for this experiment is that nicotine’s effect on contraction amplitude will not differ from that of acetylcholine. We do not think this is the case because a combination of the acetylcholine pumping through the leg and the nicotine we inject will mean increased reception, allowing for more frequent depolarization of the cell. Our hypothesis is that nicotine will increase the muscle contraction amplitude after the injection of nicotine into the leg of a Rania pipiens, despite T.M. Egan saying there would be no difference. 


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, first carefully peel the skin off of a frog leg using scissors. It will serve as both the controlll before injection and treatment group after injection. The leg must be kept moist with Ringer’s solution throughout the experiment. The next step is to cut a piece of string and tie it around the frog leg, to hang it from the stand. It will be used to apply just enough tension, so it hangs, but also rests on the dissection container. Once the frog leg is hanging at the right amount of tension, locate the sciatic nerve above the gastrocnemus muscle, and hook it up to the sleeve electrode connected to the connector box, which should be off. Make sure the leg is in place by pinning it to the dissection container before doing anything else. Hook up another electrode to the gastrocnemus muscle. Then, turn on the connector box, and set up the settings on the computer program as follows, “1 amp, 5 pulses, 5 W, and 1 Hz.” Keep this consistent throughout the experiment. Start recording, and stop it after 5 pulses. Calculate the contraction amplitudes for each of the five myograms that appear. This data will be categorized as “pre-injection.” For “post-injection,” start off by recording five normal myograms. After these five myograms, the program will keep recording in the background. This is when you will inject 1 Ml of nicotinic solution. Let the program keep recording until the contraction amplitude levels off. 
Once it levels off, start recording five more myograms and calculate the amplitude for all five of them. To calculate the true contraction amplitude for post injection, you must add the peak amplitude from when nicotine was injected to the amplitude from the myograms. This will consist of going back in the graph before the graph leveled off and find the highest amplitude for when the nicotine was injected. This will be known as B1. You will add this to the amplitudes of the five myograms post injection to get the true contraction amplitude. Repeat this process for the next two frog legs. Once all data has been recorded, a paired t_test will be used to find out if the data was able to reject the null hypothesis. The significance level for the p_value will be 0.001. 


Results:
Figure 1. This figure shows the difference between the contraction amplitude before and after the injection of 1 Ml of nicotinic solution in each of the three legs (n=3)  from the Rania pipiens. The p_values were 1.26E-8, 8.70E-8, and 1.87 for frog 1, 2, and 3 respectively. All these p_values are p < 0.001. The error bar values for pre-injection were 0.3152 V± 0.01015, 0.0996 V± 0.02466, 0.3572 V± 0.0117 for frog 1, 2, and 3 correspondingly. Meanwhile, the error bar values for post-injection were 1.413 V± 0.0202, 1.087 V± 0.0033, and 1.278 V± 0.0080. 

Figure 1 shows a major difference in contraction amplitude before and after the injection of nicotine. The error bars suggest that the data is not spread apart within each bar, making the date more reliable. A paired t_test was done for each frog leg, and the degrees of freedom were four for each test. The p_values came out to be 1.26E-8, 8.70E-8, and 1.87E-10, which were well below the significance level of 0.001. This suggest that the data provided significent evidence to reject the null hypothesis. 

Discussion:
As the different paired t_tests show, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is supported. Nicotine does cause a greater contraction amplitude in the gastrocnemus muscle over acetylcholine alone. The nicotine has this effect on the muscle because it overflows the synaptic cleft of the neuromuscular junction with acetylcholine agonists, which causes more frequent depolarization of the T-tubules in the muscle fibers. This allows for more Ca2+ ions to be released for muscle contraction.  Before injection, only acetylcholine was being released, which did not overflow the synaptic cleft. After the injection of nicotine, there was an increase in the contraction amplitude because both acetylcholine and nicotine were attaching to receptors. This supports what T.M. Egan said from his study about nicotine causing an increased rate of action potentials [Egan: 1986]. 
	The results of this study further prove how nicotine serves as an acetylcholine agonist, and can have stronger effects than the natural neurotransmitter alone. The short-term effect of nicotine was increased amplitude of muscle contractions, but a further study could be done to see what the long-term effects are. The increased reception of acetylcholine and its agonists could potentially desensitize the receptors. Nicotine would be needed to achieve normal levels of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. This is like how cocaine causes the down regulation of dopamine receptors, which consists of a decrease in the number of dopamine receptors. This leads to less reception of the neurotransmitter. As a result, cocaine starts to become essential for normal levels of dopamine. This leads to an addiction, which could potentially be why nicotine is addictive in cigarette smokers. Future tests can be done on subjects with bad smoking habits to test the desensitization of acetylcholine receptors, which could potentially help find a better cure for addiction.
