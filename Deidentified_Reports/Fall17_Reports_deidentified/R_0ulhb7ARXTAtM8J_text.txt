Title: Field Pea Resource Allocation with Changing Water Levels

Abstract:
This experiment studied resource allocation in Pisum sativum (field peas). This study chose to use field peas because of its relatively low need for soil nutrients and wide range of temperature and soil needs to grow [Oelke: 2017]. To study how the same species allocates energy, we created two separate groups of field peas and designated a control and experimental group to test the impact of a limited resource on plant growth. The control group was given 100 ml of water every other day while the experimental was given 500 ml every other day. We hypothesized that plants given more water, the experimental group, will have smaller root to shoot ratios for mass and length than the ratios for the control. To do this, we calculated the mean R:S for the mass and the length for both groups. Our data supported our hypothesis by showing smaller ratios for the experimental group than in the control group. 

Introduction:
Since resources on Earth are finite, plants must be able to adapt to their environments and the available recourses around them. Resource allocation is how different species distributes and uses energy from limited resources [Johnson: 2017]. The stem and leaves of plants, the shoot, are responsible for photosynthesis while the roots of plants are responsible for nutrient uptake in the soil. Sunlight, water, and soil nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium act as limiting factors for plants. In plants, resource allocation is shown through the length and mass distributions of both roots and shoots. In this experiment, we will examine the root to shoot ratio of two different groups of plants of the same species to see how the amount of water impacts the growth patterns of the plant. We will be examining how field pea (Pisum sativum) growth patterns change when given more water. We hypothesize that plants given more water will have shorter root to shoot ratios than plants given excess water. 

Materials and Methods:
This study examines the growth patterns of field peas. First, we planted six separate containers of field peas, each with a few dozen seeds in vermiculite. We then separated them into two groups of three containers: the control and the experimental. They were then placed in the same slightly warm room with equal amounts of sun exposure. The groups were watered every other day. The control was watered 100 mL every other day while the experimental was watered 500 mL. To measure the field pea root to shoot ratio, we took six plants from each group (two from each individual container). We then cut the roots from the shoots at the point where the color from the shoot faded to white. After this, we took the mass of the individual roots and shoots and calculated root to shoot ratios. We did the same for the length of shoots and roots.

Results:
The mean R:S for mass of the control group was 0.81 with a standard deviation of 0.38. The mean R:S for length of the control was 1.35 with a standard deviation of 0.32. The mean R:S for mass of the experimental group was 0.22 with a standard deviation of 0.08. The mean R:S for length of the experimental group was 0.59 with a standard deviation of 0.09. The mean R:S for both mass and length was larger in the control group. The standard deviation for both R:S for mass and length was also larger in the control group. We performed a one-tailed t-test. Our P-value for the R:S for mass was 0.0012. Our P-value for the R:S for length was 0.0016. For both mass and length our data was significant because both P-values were less than 0.05. We can reject the null hypothesis that there was no difference in R:S for mass and length between our control and experimental groups. 

Discussion:
We originally hypothesized that the experimental group would have smaller R:S for both mass and length. Our data supported our hypothesis. Field peas are known as drought-tolerant crops [Mao: 2012]. This is because of their ability to adapt to water limitations through energy allocation This is because the experimental group was given more water, so the plants did not need to allocate energy to growing longer roots. Growing longer roots allows plants to go deeper into the ground to access more water. However, since our experimental group was given plenty of water, its roots did not need to grow to compensate for the lack of available water and so could allocate energy to the shoots to compete for more sun. On the other hand, the control group had larger R:S because the plants had to compete for water by growing longer roots. This demonstrates the effect of resource allocation in plants since only one resource (water) was manipulated.
