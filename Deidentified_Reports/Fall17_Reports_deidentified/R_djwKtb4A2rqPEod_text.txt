Title: Different colors of monochromatic light have no effect on the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca leaves

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to find whether red, green, or blue light in any way affected the rate of photosynthesis differently than white light in Spinacia oleraca. It was predicted that, if light color affects the rate of photosynthesis, a difference is expected to be observed between the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts treated with different colors of light. Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to capture energy from light in order to synthesize usable energy. It produces high energy electrons that travel through transport chains to synthesize ATP. To test activity, DCPIP, a blue electron acceptor, was added to solutions containing chloroplasts before treatment. If photosynthesis occurred, the DCPIP lost color, lowering the absorbance of the sample. Absorbances were compared to establish the effect of colored light on photosynthetic activity. Tukey-Kramer tests revealed that photosynthetic activity varied minimally, and a one-way ANOVA test indicated that no significent difference (p=0.212) existed among all groups given any form of light. Significant differences only existed between the group given no light and the colored light groups. It was concluded that light color has no effect on photosynthetic activity in vitro since chloroplasts were isolated in solution.

Introduction:
In this experiment, different colors of visible light were used on spinach (Spinacia oleraca) leaf chloroplasts in order to determine whether or not specific colors of light affect the rate of photosynthesis. Spinacia oleraca was a perfect candidate for this experiment because it is easily obtainable since it is readily accessible to the public. It was also very cheap and easy to grind up so that the isolated chloroplasts could mix into solution. Plants, some protists and some bacteria capture and store energy from the sun in covalent bonds, oxidation-reduction potential, and an electrochemical gradient across a lipid bilayer using the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which these organisms capture energy from sunlight to synthesize usable energy from carbon dioxide and water. ATP, the energy unit of the cell for plants and animals, does not directly come from photosynthesis. Plants and animals must carry out glycolysis and the citric acid or Kreb’s cycle in the mitochondria. These processes break down glucose into CO2 which releases high energy electrons that create a proton gradient and power ATP synthesis by moving these electrons through mitochondrial transport chains and transferring the electrons back to molecular oxygen to produce water again. Photosynthesis is divided in two photosystems that collaborate to produce the overall process. Photosystem I consists of excited high energy electrons leaving the chlorophyll and traveling through a multi-subunit complex to NADP+ to produce NADPH. In this step, NADP+ is reduced. This photoreduction of an electron acceptor by hydrogen in water is called the Hill Reaction. The completion of the reaction was measured in order to determine the rate of photosynthetic reduction which can be translated to photosynthetic activity because the reduction of an electron acceptor always occurs in photosynthesis once a high energy electron has traveled through the mitochondrial electron transport chain.  To simulate this step in our experiment, DCPIP will be used as an electron acceptor. When it is reduced, it changes from blue to colorless. This color change indicates that photosynthesis has occurred. The absorbance of samples was measured and decreased absorbances indicated the presence of photosynthetic activity to whatever degree indicated by the scope of the change in absorbance. A group with no chloroplasts in white light was used as a negative controlll to account for variation in absorbance over time for the solution itself. A group containing chloroplasts in white light was used as a positive controlll because white light was hypothesized to have the most photosynthetic activity since white light is a combination of all colors of light. This study examined the effects of blue, green and red light on photosynthetic activity when compared to no light and white light conditions. A previous study indicated that plants were greater in height, but had decreased capabilities to biosynthesize chlorophyll when given 100:0 Blue:Red LED photon flux ratios which is the ratio of light of each color [Hernández: 2015]. Another study indicated that a combination of red and blue light, with blue light containing a higher fraction of the ratio, facilitated more efficient lettuce growth and photosynthesis [Wang J: 2016]. Based on these studies, we expected there to be a difference among different colors of light for photosynthetic activity and we expect white light to have the most activity. The recorded absorbance was a representative value for photosynthetic activity and it was measured at 10-minute time intervals for each of the chloroplast groups treated with different colors of light. If light color affects the rate of photosynthesis, a difference is expected to exist in photosynthetic rate over time among the different colors of light that the chloroplasts are treated with.

Materials and Method:
In order to perform this experiment, chloroplasts needed to be removed and separated from the spinach leaves. A chilled mortar and pestle was used to grind up spinach leaves that had their central vein removed. A grinding buffer of 400 mM sucrose in a Tricine buffer at a pH of 8.0 was used while grinding. For four spinach leaves, 10 Ml of grinding buffer was used to initially grind the spinach leaves and 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added for additional grinding before the solution was strained through three layers of cheesecloth to remove large and unnecessary solids. The beakers, mortar and pestle, and centrifuge tubes needed to be chilled in crushed ice to slow enzyme action in solution and prevent damaging the chloroplasts before experimentation began. Differential centrifugation was used in order to separate the chloroplasts from leaf debris. After the solution was strained through the cheesecloth, it was poured into a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube that was placed in a centrifuge spinning at 200G for three minutes at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was poured into another chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube and placed in a centrifuge at 1000G for ten minutes at 4°C. The supernatant from the second centrifugation was then poured into a new tube while the remaining pellet was stirred with 20 Ml of grinding buffer to resuspend the pellet and it was stored on ice. The resuspended pellet solution contains enriched chloroplasts and was used for the remainder of the experiment. Nineteen test tubes were used to make mixtures for all the treatments, the blank, and the controllls so that triplets could be made for all groups except the blank. The blank solution contained 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5 as a reaction buffer to ensure that reducing electrons are isolated to the reduction of DCPIP rather than taking part in a phosphorylation process. The remainder of the test tubes contained 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. All solutions were placed in cuvettes and 100µl of enriched chloroplasts was added to each. The spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nm for each measurement, and initial measurements of all tubes were taken before treatment. The cuvettes were then placed in their respective treatment groups and were measured in 3 ten-minute intervals where measurements were taken at the end of each interval. Colored light treatments were given by placing the respective triplets under a white, red, green or blue colored bulb in a lamp that was able to be placed very close to the solutions. A one-way ANOVA test was performed between absorbances for each group after 30 minutes to determine if a significent difference existed between any of the groups. Tukey-Kramer tests were performed between pairs of treatment groups to determine which pairs presented a significent difference from one another.

Results:
Some level of photosynthetic activity occurred among all groups containing chloroplasts with the smallest change in activity present in the group given no light. According to Figure 1, the most photosynthetic activity occurred in the chloroplasts treated with red light, followed by white light, green light, blue light and finally no light. The group that did not contain chloroplasts experienced no change in absorbance over the 30-minute interval. An ANOVA test performed among the groups treated with light indicated that there was no significent difference of absorbances (α=0.05, p=0.212) among the different light color treatments tested. Further Tukey-Kramer tests indicated that no group treated with light was significently different from any other specific group treated with light.

Discussion:
According to the results, the hypothesis that a significent difference in photosynthetic activity exists between the different colors of light is rejected because no significent difference was observed between the treatment groups of different colored lights. The only significent differences found between the groups were those of no chloroplasts and no light with the all groups that were treated with some form of light. The groups with no chloroplasts and no light had no change in absorbance because photosynthetic activity could not occur with an absence of chloroplasts or in the absence of light. The group given no light must have been exposed to light between measurements because a small change in absorbance was observed. Similar to the results of this study, a previous study on cherry tomatoes indicated that there was no difference among leaf size under different monochromatic lighting conditions. However, it was also found that in cucumber plants under 100B:0R light, greater leaf size was observed [Hernández R: 2015]. Though this study indicated no difference in photosynthetic activity between different colors of light, other studies such as this indicate that the color of light does have an effect on some plants, but some of the effect is the result of physical features of the plants. A different study indicated that near-UV or half the green radiation present in white light increased the fresh and dry weight of marigold plants [Klein R: 1965]. These results present an interesting difference from the results of the present study because increased weight indicates that a larger amount of energy was gained throughout the plants lifetime since energy is required for plants to grow. If under a different light, plants can gain more mass, perhaps some forms of light actually do increase photosynthetic activity. Further studies should be conducted to see what exactly causes this growth because the aforementioned study indicated that near-UV or half green radiations do not appear to affect chlorophyll synthesis, mitochondrial oxidations or respiration [Klein R: 1965]. If photosynthetic mechanisms are not at play in plant growth under colored light, then other factors of plant growth and development must be explored. Another study on lettuce plant leaves found that Red and Blue light combinations are important in driving photosynthesis. More specifically, it was found that photosynthetic performance of the lettuce plant could be efficiently improved by increasing the blue fraction of light [Wang J: 2016]. In the present study, a very important determinant of photosynthetic activity was ignored. Stomatal opening in leaves controllls the movement of gases in and out of the leaf which can have an effect on photosynthesis [Kana T: 1976]. Since photosynthetic activity in the present study only took into account the reduction of DCPIP in electron transport chains, we were unable to analyze the effects of structural factors of the plant on photosynthesis. According to the study on stomata and light color, stomatal opening rates varied with changes in light color [Kana T: 1976]. These opening rates affect the rate of photosynthesis which means that the present study’s results might have been different if an actual living plant was used to eliminate confounding variables such as this example of gas exchange through the stomata. Another related study found, using P700 redox kinetics for measurement, that the amount of light absorbed by chlorophyll in the deeper tissue of capsicum leaves is higher in red light than in blue light because blue light was preferentially depleted by the uppermost chloroplasts and that photoinhibition was still more severe in blue light than in red light in deeper tissue [Oguchi R: 2011]. The results of this study are important because the present study was done with no consideration of tissue depth related photoinhibition. With a consideration of the present study’s results along with the results of studies mentioned above, more studies should be conducted on different varieties of plants in realistic, lifelike scenarios because the results of this study differed from the studies mentioned primarily in relation to the structures and mechanisms present in living plants rather than the functioning of chloroplasts of a detached leaf. A source of error in this study might be that light color was not isolated for each treatment group well enough to establish whether or not a color played the only effect on the photosynthetic activity of a particular group since some white light shined on treatment groups of colored light when measurements were taken. If this study were repeated, it should be repeated without allowing the non-white light treatment groups to be exposed to any white light. In future studies, light color should be tested only with live plants because too many other variables that respond to light color have an effect photosynthetic activity. Another source of error was the bulb used to produce green light. After the study, it was determined that the green light actually produced double the emission spectra of the other colored lights which caused it to produce more photosynthetic activity than expected since green light was believed to reflect off of the chloroplasts which would cause little photosynthetic activity. It is also possible that, because the bulbs were halogen bulbs with a colored film, light emitted from them was not pure monochromatic light. This means that little variation in photosynthetic activity would be expected anyways.
