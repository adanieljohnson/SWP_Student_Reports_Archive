Title: The Effect of Colored Light on the Photosynthetic Activity of Spinach Leaves

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to discover how different colored LED lights affect photosynthetic activity in chloroplasts of spinach leaves. The rate of photosynthesis, which is the process of plants capturing light energy and converting it into ATP, was measured by DCPIP, a compound which progresses from a blue hue to clear hue as it interacts with electrons. There were four conditions for this experiment; the positive controlll where the chloroplasts were exposed to white light, the negative controlll where chloroplasts were exposed to no light, a condition where chloroplasts were exposed to green light, and a condition where the chloroplasts were exposed to red light. Based on the amount of light energy that these different colors provided, it was hypothesized that the green light will result in an amount of photosynthetic activity similar to white light, but red light will result in a lesser amount of photosynthetic activity than white light. The absorbances of the mixtures were measured after 10, 20, and 30 minutes and percent change was calculated. A two tailed t_test with equal variance was run and showed that the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts in spinach leaves was affected by different colored LED lights. 


Introduction:
This experiment tested the biological principal of photosynthesis in chloroplasts of spinach leaves. Modern cities are surrounded by artificial light and light pollution, which has been a serious hazard to plants and animals. There are large populations of natural plants living under different colored man-made light, causing the plant’s growth and photosynthetic activity to be affected. Photosynthesis is a reaction where plants capture light energy from the sun, through their chloroplasts, and convert it into fuel and food. This process happens through two light-dependent reactions that create a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis [Johnson: 2017]. As the protons are later pushed down their gradient, new molecules of ATP, the main source of energy for the plants, are synthesized. During this process, NADP+ gains an electron. However, it is hard to measure and quantify the reduction of NADP+. In order to measure the amount of activity, a blue-colored compound called DCPIP can be used as a synthetic electron acceptor, taking the place of NADP+. As the DCPIP interacts with electrons from the chloroplasts, it loses its blue hue and becomes clearer, lowering the absorbance of the mixture. The absorbance of this mixture can be measured using a Spec20 machine at 600 nm. The lower the absorbance of this mixture, the greater the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts. Spinach leaves were the model organism for this experiment because their chloroplasts can be easily extracted. Also, previous studies, such as in a study done by Jung et al, have found that spinach leaves show a noticeable reaction to different colored light [Jung et al: 2001]. This experiment will test the effects that green and red light have on the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts in spinach leaves. Red light was chosen because it has shown in previous experiments to not offer enough light energy for a normal rate of photosynthesis to occur in plants. Green light was chosen because it was found that green light can better penetrate the canopy of a rainforest and help conduct photosynthesis at a rate almost identical to white light [Muneer et al: 2004]. The independent variable in the experiment was the color of the light that the chloroplasts were exposed to. The dependent variable was the absorbance of the DCPIP, which directly relates to the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts. The positive controlll of this experiment was the chloroplasts placed under white light and the negative controlll was the chloroplasts placed in a dark drawer with no exposure to light. It was hypothesized that if the chloroplasts are placed under different colored man-made light, then the green light will cause an amount of photosynthetic activity similar to white light, but red light will result in a lesser amount of photosynthetic activity than white light.


Materials and Method:
Three spinach leaves were obtained and their central veins were removed. The leaves were rinsed and dried thoroughly. The leaves were then placed into a mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of grinding buffer and ground. Once the leaves formed a thick paste, another 10 Ml of the grinding buffer was added, and the leaves were further ground until there were no chunks left. The mixture was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled 50 Ml beaker. The mixture was transferred into a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube and spun at 200 x G for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was then poured out of the tube into a second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube and spun at 1000 x G for ten minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was poured into a third centrifuge tube without disturbing the pellet. 20 Ml of the grinding buffer was added to the centrifuge tube with the pellet and stirred to suspend the pellet. Thirteen test tubes were dried and labeled Blank and then 1-12. The Blank Test tube was prepared with 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. The rest of the twelve test tubes were made with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. 100 microliters of the chloroplast solution from the centrifuge tube with the pellet were then added to each of the test tubes above. The solutions were then transferred into the corresponding cuvettes, labeled Blank and 1-12. The absorbance of each cuvette was immediately taken using a Spec20 at 600 nm and recorded as absorbance at Time Zero. The labeled cuvettes were placed under the appropriate light source. After ten minutes the absorbance’s were taken again and recorded under Time 10. After ten more minutes the absorbance’s were taken again and recorded under Time 20. After a last ten minutes the absorbance’s were taken for a final time and recorded under Time 30. The percent change and p values comparing percent change using a paired t_test were then calculated. 


Results:
The spinach chloroplast that were placed under the white light had an average change in absorbance of 0.00186, after 30 minutes, and an average percent change of -15.59% ±2.29. The spinach chloroplasts that were placed under the green light had an average change in absorbance of 0.0153, and an average percent change of -15.37% ±5.01. The spinach chloroplast that were placed under the red light had an average change in absorbance of 0.0133, after 30 minutes, and an average percent change of -15.16% ±5.62. The average absorbances for each time are shown in in Table 1 and Figure 1. The changes in absorbance over the entire 30 minutes are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. The percent change in absorbance for each light condition is shown in Table 3 and Figure 3. The p_values for percent change are shown in Table 4. The p value for percent change in green light compared to white light was 0.945. The p value for percent change in red light compared to white light was 0.9068.


Discussion:
The overall collected data in this experiment supported the hypothesis that chloroplasts exposed to green light would cause an amount of photosynthetic activity similar to white light, but did not support the hypothesis that chloroplasts exposed to red light will result in a lesser amount of photosynthetic activity than white light. This can be shown because the p values were greater than 0.05 and therefore not statistically significent. There was one outlier, in the cuvettes that were exposed to green light, that was eliminated from our data and further calculations. The p_value for the chloroplasts exposed to the green light was 0.945, which is greater than 0.05 and therefore, not statistically significent. However, this was expected because it was hypothesized that chloroplasts exposed to green light should have a very similar amount of photosynthetic activity as those exposed to white light. If the data points were identical, the p value of this t_test would be 1. Therefore, this high p value supports the hypothesis presented, but by varying slightly, also shows that green light does have a slight effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Furthermore, the red light was expected to have a lower percent change in absorbance than the white light, but the percent changes for these two light conditions were very similar. Additionally, the p value for the red light compared to white light was 0.9068, which is greater than 0.05 and not statistically significent. 
 There were a few limitations and errors to this study. One error that could have affected the overall results was the way that the chloroplasts were mixed in the test tubes. Although steps were taken to avoid different mixings, there was no way to ensure that each tube was mixed exactly the same. This could have led to more chloroplast being transferred into certain cuvettes, providing additional resources for photosynthesis to occur. Another limitation of this study was that some of the light energy from the lamp could have been more focused on some cuvettes than others within different experimental conditions. Although we tried to make sure that all of the cuvettes were getting the same amount of light, by distancing the lamp from the cuvettes the same amount in the different experimental conditions, there was no way to measure the light intensity on each cuvette and ensure it was exactly the same. This could have slightly altered the rates of photosynthesis, but with data this close together, that slight alteration could change the overall results. Finding a way to measure light intensity to make sure it is constant throughout the experiment would be an improvement for this particular study. A logical next step for further study would be to combine different colored light sources, such as blue and red LED lights, on the spinach chloroplasts and see if any color combinations of light would still allow the chloroplasts to function at a normal level and not affect the photosynthetic activity. Conversely, it could also be tested to see what color combinations of light would inhibit the photosynthetic activity so greatly, that the plants would die. Studies have been done that found a combination of blue and red light could cause a normal rate of photosynthesis and growth [Darko et al: 2014]. However, there have not been many studies that explore the effects of different colored light that could be completely detrimental to the growth and photosynthesis of plants. This is a problem in the real world because man-made light on store signs and streetlights are affecting the rates of photosynthesis in plants, causing them to not grow according to their potential. It would be beneficial to explore the combination of light that could allow plants to not grow at all. Overall, the experiment done did suggest that different colored light sources has an effect on photosynthetic activity of spinach chloroplasts.
