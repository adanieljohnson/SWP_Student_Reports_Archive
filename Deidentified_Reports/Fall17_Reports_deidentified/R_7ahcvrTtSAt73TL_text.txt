Title: Investigation on Shelter’s effects on Betta Fish Aggression

Abstract:
There was a limited amount of papers focusing on shelter’s effects on betta fish’s behaviors within the filed of Ethology. So, in this experiment, shelter’s effect on betta fish’s aggressive behavior is investigated. The aggressiveness was quantified as the time of the fish showing each kind of agnostic behavior and the time was recorded for later calculation. It was shown that there was a decrease of the aggressiveness of the fish when it occupied the shelter. However, other factors, such as habituation and getting tired may lead the result to be like this also. 


Introduction:
Ethology is the scientific study of animals’ behaviors as examined in relation to evolution and natural selection(“Definition of ETHOLOGY,” n.d.). The reason that ethology is of huge interest is that it can help us understand how specific behaviors are linked to the fitness of a species, which can help us better understand nature and also help us better conserve a species. In this experiment, the aggressive behaviors of Betta splendens, commonly known as Betta Fighting Fish, are of particular interest. It is known that there are many environmental factors that alter the aggressive behaviors of the species, such as the level of Mercury Chloride present in their water, UV filter benzonphenone-3, the presence of food and shelter (Capelli & Hamilton, n.d.) (Mansur, Cavalcante, dos Santos, & Gouveia, 2012) (“UV-filter benzophenone-3 inhibits agonistic behavior in male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) - ProQuest Central - ProQuest,” n.d.). In this experiment, the effects of shelter on the aggressive behaviors of betta fish will be examined particularly. It is known by similar study that the increase of shelter will largely reduce the competitive behaviors in some other species, because individual that occupies the shelter tend to stay in it and avoid contact with others.(Capelli & Hamilton, n.d.) Based on this experiment, it is hypothesized that the presence of shelter will also reduce the agonistic behaviors of betta fighting fish. And the aggressive behaviors of the betta fish will be quantified as the time(in seconds) taken for the fish to perform each particular behavior. In this experiment, only 4 agonistic behaviors will be considered: pelvic flickering, tail flashing(broadside movements), pectoral fins erecting, and red mane(facing movements) (Johnson, 2016).


Materials and Methods:
To test the hypothesis that the presence of shelter will reduce the aggressiveness of betta fish, we used the following equipment: an aquarium, a piece of glass and a visual separation tool, two male betta fish and a shelter. Firstly, the aquarium was filled with water and two compartments were created by a glass and the visual separation thing was put between the two chambers. Two male betta fish were put into the chambers separately. We removed the opaque material between the two chambers and started our experiment without using the shelter at first. We picked on e fish and each person in the group observed one specific agonistic behavior and recorded the time of the fish performing that behavior with the timer within a 5-minute interval. We let both fish rest for 3 minutes and repeated the procedure for two more times. Then, we put the shelter with previously observed fish. We waited for 2-3 minutes to let the betta fish adapted to the shelter, and we continued our experiment and repeated the same steps. We collected the data and times 3 for the results we got for tail flashing and red mane because they had the highest rank of aggressiveness among each group. Two sampled T-Test was later performed to test if there was significant difference between the group without the shelter and the group with the shelter.


Results:
Figure 1. Total time of aggressive behaviors for both control and experimental groups. In general, control group has more time showing aggressiveness than experimental group has. And in control group, average time of broadside movement is 366.3±98.3s; average time of facing movement is 550±67.2s. In experimental group, average time of broadside movements is 155.7±70.6s; average time of facing movement is 440.0±88.1s.


For broadside movements, according to the results of the two-sampled T-Test, there was significant difference between aggressiveness of the betta fish in the experimental (M=550, SD=67.2) and the control (M=366.3, SD=98.3) conditions; t(4)=3.01, p=0.0394. 

And for facing movement, there was no significant difference between R:S(Length) results in the experimental (M= 440.0, SD=88.1) and the control (M=155.7, SD=70.6) groups; t(4)=1.72, p=0.160


Discussion:
The results showed that, in general, betta fish that had no shelter with it had more time showing agnostic behaviors than it with the shelter. And particularly, the time that it performed broadside movement when there was no shelter was significantly larger than the time it performed broadside movements with the shelter present. 
The reason that we obtain this result could be that the betta fish tends to ignore the other fish when it has occupied the shelter already. Because, occupying the shelter usually means that it has already ensured itself to have a potentially higher fitness than others. So it is not necessary to show aggressiveness to the other species, which will cost it lots of energy. It saves this energy for future use, such as reproduction or other intraspecific events. (Fero & Moore, 2014) 
However, there may still be a potential that this result is caused by habituation. Habituation is the process that the species adapts to the environmental stimulus and shows a decreasing response to this stimulus. In this circumstance, habituation may lead the betta fish to show a decreasing response, showing less aggressive behaviors, to the other. Also, fish could also get tired throughout the experiment even if it was given time to rest between each trial, because performing both broadside and facing movements was known to be highly costly(Johnson, 2016). 
And there was high standard deviation among the data obtained, which might be caused by the inconsistency of the experimental procedures. 
In all, this experiment can contribute to the lack of interest in investigating shelter’s effects on agreesive behviros of betta fish.
