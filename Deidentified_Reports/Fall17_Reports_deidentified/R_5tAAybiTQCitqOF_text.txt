Title: The effect of aggression on metabolism in procambarus sp.

Abstract:
We studied the effect of aggression on the metabolic rate of procambarus sp. We hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate of a procambarus sp. would increase in the presence of a larger procambarus sp. We thought that the smaller creature would be distressed and therefore, its specific metabolic rate would increase. We measured oxygen consumption to estimate metabolic rate. To test our hypothesis, we measured the oxygen consumption of a procambarus sp. both exposed and not exposed to a larger crayfish. We calculated the specific metabolic rate for every set of data we collected. Our results did show a minor increase in the specific metabolic rate of the procambarus sp. after being exposed to a larger crayfish, which supported our hypothesis. However, our data was not statistically significant. It is possible that a bigger change might have been seen if we did not use the same large crayfish for each experimental measurement. 

Introduction:
When an organism converts glucose into energy, carbon and oxygen are converted to carbon dioxide. These reactions lead to a release of electrons that move through a transport chain, releasing energy used to convert ADP to ATP. The amount of energy used by breaking down glucose is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen used or the amount of CO2 excreted [BioCore: 2017]. We will use oxygen consumption to estimate metabolic activity. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between exposure to aggression/stress and the rate of metabolism in procambarus sp. In an experiment done with Oreochromis mossambicus, metabolic rates spiked late during an aggressive conflict, suggesting a correlation between aggression and increased metabolic rate [Castro: 2006]. Another study found that routine metabolic rates were higher than standard metabolic rates in cichlid fish when engaging in territorial behavior [Grantner: 1998]. We hypothesize that the specific metabolic rate of procambarus sp. Will increase after being exposed to another, larger procambarus sp. because of this stress. 



Materials and Methods:
We received 3 small procambarus sp. and weighed them, recording their starting weight. After weighing the procambarus sp., we placed it into the test chamber and filled it with water before screwing on the top. We then placed the tank setup into a dishpan filled with room temperature water. We then inserted the dissolved oxygen probe into the chamber and turned it on. After letting the readings stabilize, we took a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. We read the dissolved oxygen level again after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. We then removed the probe and recorded the volume of water in the testing chamber. Then we calculated the specific metabolic rate using this equation:                                        Specific Metabolic Rate=  (change in oxygen * volume of water)/(time*weight) 
We repeated this process with a large procambarus sp. in the dishpan with the testing chamber containing the small procambarus sp. We then repeated both processes for the other two procambarus sp. We used a paired t-test to analyze our results. 


Results:
Our first crayfish had a specific metabolic rate of 0.00086 originally and a specific metabolic rate of 0.00134 after the larger procambarus sp. was present. Our second crayfish had a specific metabolic rate 0.000985 when it was by itself and a specific metabolic rate of 0.002 when the larger crayfish was present. Our third crayfish had a specific metabolic rate of 0.0015 originally and a specific metabolic rate of 0.0017 when the larger crayfish was present. This data can be seen in figure 1. The average difference between the specific metabolic rates before and after the large crayfish was present was 0.00538. Our t-value form our paired t-test was 2.61 with a p-value of 0.12, meaning that our data did not show a significant difference.

Discussion:
Each procambarus sp. had a higher metabolic rate when the other larger procambarus sp. was present. This finding supports our hypothesis that the aggression or stress brought on by the presence of the larger animal would lead to an increased metabolic rate. In crayfish, dominance order is directly related to size [Bovbjerg: 1956]. This explains why the smaller crayfish would be stressed in the presence of the larger crayfish. This stress could be what lead to the increase in metabolic rate. Something to consider when looking at our results is that the large crayfish we used could have behaved differently during each measurement. I think our study could have benefitted from a larger sample size and maybe changing the large crayfish each time so that it won’t get used to the experimental conditions.
