Title: Aggression Levels of Betta splendins Based on Fish Color

Abstract:
In our experiment, we observed and tested the facing movement aggressive behaviors of male betta fish of different colors. We did this by timing how long the betta fish displayed their red mane. Our hypothesis was that there would be an increase in aggressive behaviors for bettas of different colors. Our ANOVA results showed that there was no significent difference in aggression levels of Betta splendins based on color. There was no increase in duration of time spent displaying a red mane for red vs. blue betta fish. Our hypothesis that there would be an increase in aggressive behaviors for bettas of different colors was not supported by our data. This could have been due to their environment being altered after being moved to different tanks, they could have gotten tired, or they may have gone into habituation.


Introduction:
In this experiment, we tried to understand the typical pattern of behavior and how/why the allocation pattern changes in Betta splendins fish in response to certain conditions and stimuli. We tried to understand and explain these behaviors based on their evolutionary basis. Betta fish exhibit aggressive behaviors when in contact with other betta fish. Intraspecific behaviors are very important to determining the level of aggression. These intraspecific behaviors include broadside movements, facing movements, and agnostic behaviors to display their aggression. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing, all listed in level of aggression. Facing movements include erection of the pectoral fins, spreading the opercula, and displaying their “red mane”, all listed in level of aggression (Johnson, AD). In our experiment, we observed and tested the aggressive behaviors of male betta fish of different colors. We did this by timing how long the betta fish displayed their red mane. We chose to focus on the red mane because it is the most aggressive form of facing movements. We hypothesized that there would be an increase in aggressive behaviors for bettas of different colors. 


Materials and Method:
We had three trials of blue to blue male betta fish controlll, three trials of red to red male betta fish controlll, and three trials of blue to red betta fish experimental. We placed two blue fish and two red fish in separate tanks separated by a glass barrier and opaque barrier. For each trial, we removed the opaque barrier to observe the betta fish. We observed the duration of the betta fish display of their red mane by timing on our cell phones. Each of the trials lasted five minutes with five minutes of rest time. We then tested the significance of their behaviors with a two-way ANOVA test. 


Results:
The ANOVA showed that there was no significent difference (P=0.356) in aggression levels of Betta splendins for the controlll groups or the red vs. blue experimental groups. There was no increase in duration of time spent displaying a red mane for red vs. blue betta fish. In fact, the graph shows red vs blue betta fish to be significently smaller than red vs. red and blue vs. blue (Figure 1). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that there would be an increase in aggressive behaviors for bettas of different colors was not supported by our data. Perhaps this was due to their environment being altered after being placed in more than one tank. They could have gotten tired after being moved around. Or, they may not have adjusted to their new environment, thus not responding to each other. In addition, it is possible that we did not get supportive results because we did not give them enough time to rest between the experiment trials. Another possibility is that the fishes may have gone into habituation which would decrease the duration of a red mane display. 

In an experiment done by Clotfelter, Ardia, and McGraw, Red fish, blue fish: trade-offs between pigmentation and immunity in Betta splendins, red males were found to be more sexually attractive to females than blue males. This is interesting, because there is an increased color response for sexual selection, but, based on our results, there is not an increased color response for aggression. An experiment could be done on the aggression levels of females to red males and females to blue males to see if the aggression levels were changing.
