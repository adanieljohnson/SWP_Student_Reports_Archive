Title: Effect of ACh injection on Threshold of Gastrocnemius muscle of Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
The current scientific knowledge about muscle stimulation, the role of neurotransmitters and the significance of muscle contractions for an organism with high mobility, has led to the motivation of this study on what would occur, in terms of threshold, if acetylcholine was added to the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania Pipien (frog) leg. We hypothesize that the threshold will decrease with ACh because it will increase the cell’s ability to fire an action potential. A system was created using a force transducer and each leg as its own controlll. 0.1Ml of ACh was added to each muscle, with syringe injection, directly into the gastrocnemus muscle and the threshold was determined using direct muscle stimulation. A paired T-Test reported that the threshold measurements of pulse stimulation amplitude from before and after the injection of ACh were not significently different. ACh therefore does not particularly determine the amount of stimulation a muscle needs to fire (threshold), but rather it determines the intensity of the muscle’s response once it has been stimulated enough to contract. Ultimately, ACh is critical component of the neuromuscular system and different levels of ACh in the muscles have an effect on the muscle’s response to stimulation and thus on its ability to contract.

Introduction:
Neuromuscular controlll is important to the process by which organisms sense and respond to their internal and external environments. The neuromuscular system is comprised of skeletal muscles which are innervated by motor neurons. Axons of these neurons can extend to several fibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. Neurotransmitters diffuse from axon terminals to signal the firing in another cell. The point at which a muscle stimulation results in a contraction is called the threshold. The amplitude of the contraction can be measured in volts (V). Before a muscle contracts due to weak stimulation the amplitude of the muscle will be 0V. An important neurotransmitter in motor neurons is acetylcholine (ACh). Since ACh signals the depolarization of a muscle cell, differing levels of ACh will have an effect on the contraction of the muscle [Brown: 1936]. Rania pipiens (Leopard Frog) is an organism with high mobility, and one which relies heavily on muscle contractions to survive. Frogs have to contract legs muscles to hop, thus contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle are critical to the movement of a frog. They have often been used and studied as a model organism for muscle performance and activity, particularly in the leg muscles such as the gastrocnemus [Miller: 1993]. Given the knowledge about muscle stimulation, the role of neurotransmitters and the significance of muscle contractions for an organism, we were motivated to test, in terms of threshold, if acetylcholine was added to the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg. The independent variable introduced into the system would be ACh and the results would produce the dependent variable of threshold measurements. We hypothesize that the threshold will decrease with the addition of acetylcholine because it will increase the cell’s ability to fire an action potential. 

Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis, a system was created using each of the individual frog legs as its own controlll. In order to prepare the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg for stimulation, the skin was pulled down towards the foot, allowing the muscle to be separated from the leg with only the end closest to the knee left connected to the leg. The muscle was attached to the force transducer by a string, the pin electrodes were inserted directly into the gastrocnemus muscle, and then the leg was moistened with ringer’s solution. The muscle was directly stimulated with incrementing voltage (Table 1) in order to determine the threshold. Afterwards, 0.1Ml of acetylcholine was added, with syringe injection, directly into the gastrocnemus muscle and the threshold was determined again using the same amplitudes. Three trials were conducted using this method with a new frog leg each time. 
To complete a statistical analysis using each leg as its own controlll, we used a paired T-Test. This tested our null hypothesis that the threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle in a frog leg will not change after the injection of acetylcholine. We set our significance level at 0.5.


Results:
Based on the data there were apparent trends in the threshold value of the muscles. The thresholds appear to stay constant between 0.1 V of pulse stimulation and 0.3 V of pulse stimulation despite the injection of acetylcholine. However, looking at the response to stimulation muscle amplitude at each threshold point, a trend is evident, displaying a decrease in muscle amplitude(V) after the injection. (Table 2)
The paired T-Test reported that the threshold measurements of pulse stimulation amplitude from before and after the injection of acetylcholine were not significently different (t_stat = 0.5, d.f. = 2, P = 0.666667). However, the same conclusion was not found for the measurements of response muscle amplitude at threshold. The results for the change in muscle amplitude after injection were found to be significent (t_stat = 1.077649, d.f. = 2, P = 0.393902). (Figure 2).


Discussion:
The results show that the hypothesis was unsupported, the injection of acetylcholine into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg did not have a significent decrease of the threshold (Figure 1) and the statistical analysis reveals that the null hypothesis was supported that the threshold will not change after the injection of ACh. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is released from axon terminals of motor neurons to bind with receptors in muscle fibers, which opens Sodium-Potassium ion channels, allowing the cell to depolarize. When the cell depolarizes to the point of producing an action potential in order to contract, it has reached its threshold. The threshold remains relatively constant because the muscle will always need a certain amount of voltage stimulation to contract. The amount of ACh in a muscle is important because it’s what enables the cell to depolarize, resulting in the contraction. ACh therefore does not particularly determine the amount of stimulation a muscle needs to fire (threshold), but rather it determines the intensity of the muscle’s response once it has been stimulated enough to contract. Thus the hypothesis stating that the threshold would decrease with ACh is not supported, however ACh did decrease the intensity of the response of the muscle in this experiment. This can be seen in the amplitude measurements of the muscle in response to being stimulated to threshold (Figure 2). Addition of ACh lowers the intensity of the muscle’s response under stimulation, exemplified in the gastrocnemus muscle [Brown: 1936]. A potential error in this experiment could be the precision of the threshold measurements. Our results could appear to stay constant around 0.1 V - 0.3 V, but if we measured a few more decimal places to determine more exact thresholds the experiment may have yielded trends in the threshold data. Another explanation is that the rate and concentration of ACh applied, affected the amount of response in the data. Even a large dose of ACh applied to the gastrocnemus muscle will have significently less effect on the muscle’s reaction when applied at slower speeds up, showing data differences between speeds less than a second apart [Brown: 1936]. The next logical step, to possibly further elucidate the effect of ACh injection on muscle threshold, would be to repeat the experiment with more precision in threshold measurements and a faster rate of injection with stimulation. However, the results of this experiment lead to an opportunity to examine the relationship of ACh effect on muscular amplitude during a muscle contraction. A new experiment should test the hypothesis that the addition of ACh lowers the muscle amplitude in a muscle contraction. This should be examined exploring a range of ACh concentrations for injection and the gastrocnemus muscle of different organisms. Ultimately, ACh is critical component of the neuromuscular system and different levels of ACh in the muscles have an effect on the muscle’s response to stimulation and thus on its ability to contract. This is particularly significent in organisms with high mobility, considering this experiment’s examination of contractions on the gastrocnemus muscle. As in the case of Rania pipiens, this muscle is located in the leg therefore is not only utilized but is imperative for basic movement of the organism.
