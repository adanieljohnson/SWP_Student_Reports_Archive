Title: Curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP insignificantly affect growth of Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
All living things respond to external stimuli; responses are mediated by signaling pathways. A signaling pathway shared by many organisms is the G-protein coupled receptor pathway, which mediates physiological changes of an organism in response to the environment. Physarum polycephalum (slime mold) uses protein kinase A through a G-protein coupled receptor pathway to regulate growth, often in response to external stimuli. Substances like dibutryl-cAMP activate PKA, while others, like curcumin, inhibit it. We hypothesize that slime mold will grow more on dibutryl-cAMP media, when compared to growth on curcumin or a control. Physarum exhibits positive chemotaxis towards glucose, which can control for direction. Results show no significance in growth between curcumin and control (p-value = 0.14), control - dibutryl-cAMP (p = 0.56), and curcumin - dibutryl-cAMP (p = 0.28). Growth averages (curcumin: 3.33 mm, control: 25.3, dibutryl-cAMP: 16) show that curcumin may inhibit Physarum growth. Dibutryl-cAMP did not seem to promote growth as hypothesized. More testing on growth behaviors of slime mold should be done, controlling more for direction of growth with stronger chemoattractants/repellants. With better results, we can understand how chemical pollution affect mold in ecosystems. 

Introduction:
Slime mold, or Physarum polycephalum, is a multi-nuclear eukaryotic organism. A single mass of slime mold is referred to as a plasmodium, and can be used in experiments like this one as they are easy to grow, handle and feed. In addition, they use signaling pathways that can be easily manipulated, and are very similar to those of humans and other organisms, making slime mold ideal for experimentation.

Tubules in Physarum cell cytoskeletons aid in movement and growth (Takamatsu: 2008), and can be controlled by the G-protein coupled-receptor pathway to help a Physarum cell respond physiologically to external stimuli. Protein kinase A (PKA) is involved in this G-protein coupled-receptor pathway. The GPCR is activated by a ligand, often a growth factor, which binds extracellularly. Upon binding of the growth factor, the heterotrimeric G-protein located inside the cell, bound to the GPCR, is activated, and the trimers dissociate from one another. The trimers each activate a molecule, which leads to a signaling cascade inside the cell. PKA, once activated in the signaling cascade, phosphorylates molecules so they can carry out cellular responses and regulate growth (Sakurai: 1998). These growth responses to PKA include, but are not limited to, actin filament synthesis and increased myosin activity, which are both known to be directly involved in cell movement (“Cytoskeleton”). 

In this experiment, we will be testing which chemicals inhibit, and which ones promote, growth of Physarum. It is accepted that dibutryl-cAMP activates PKA (Chen: 1998), and that curcumin inhibits PKA. Thus, we hypothesize that plasmodia cultured on dishes treated with curcumin will grow less than those on dishes with dibutryl-cAMP and water-agar. In addition, we hypothesize that the mold on dibutryl-cAMP will grow the most out of the samples. Additionally, slime mold tends to grow towards glucose, as glucose can be used as a food source for the organism. Therefore, when Physarum is placed in a medium that contains a section of glucose, the Physarum will grow solely towards the glucose. This unidirectional growth provoked by the glucose will help with measuring and analyzing growth, since we will only have to measure in one direction as opposed to multiple directions. 


Materials and Methods:
Materials

A total of 9 petri dishes (each containing water-agar solution) were used, out of which 3 were controls. 12-15 mL of curcumin and 12-15 mL of dibutryl-cAMP (total) were used. One dish of slime mold culture and one dish of glucose medium were also used. A bottle of ethyl alcohol and a flame were necessary for sterilizing tools after each use.

Methods:

4-5 mL of curcumin were pipetted onto 3 water-agar dishes, and the same was done with dibutryl-cAMP for another 3 dishes. The media soaked for 10 minutes and the excess was drained. Two 1 cm x 1 cm squares (one on each side of the dish) were cut from each medium and removed. In one of the wells, a similarly-sized glucose square was placed, in the other, slime mold. Dishes were taped closed, wrapped completely in foil, and placed in a dark incubator at moderate temperature for 24 hours. The growth of slime mold was then measured for each dish, using the longest strand from each dish for statistical testing.

A two-tailed two-sampled t-test was used to compare each test group individually with the control and with each other.  

Results:
Average growth of the longest strands for the control, curcumin, and dibutryl-cAMP groups were approximately 25.3 mm, 3.33 mm and 16 mm respectively. Standard errors for these averages were approximately 11.35 (control), 3.33 (curcumin) and 9.54 (dibutryl-cAMP) (Figure 1). P-value and t-value for the t-test between control and curcumin were approximately 0.14 and 1.86 respectively. Between control and dibutryl-cAMP, these values were 0.56 and 0.63. For curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP these values were 0.28 and 1.25. 

General trends show that the control experienced the most growth on average. The dibutryl-cAMP group also showed a lot of growth, but not as much as the control group. The mold growing on the curcumin plates had the least amount of growth by a large margin.

Discussion:
Based on our results, there was no significant difference in average growth between any of the sample groups (when comparing the longest strands). Also, while the dibutryl-cAMP dishes did see more growth on average than the curcumin dishes, the control group still had the most overall average growth, suggesting that dibutryl-cAMP did not experience growth in the way we had expected (i.e. more growth than the control). These results do not support our hypothesis that dibutryl-cAMP would promote growth. However, while not significant, there was less growth in the curcumin plates, which partially supports our hypothesis that curcumin would inhibit growth. In addition, our curcumin cultures had the most consistency with growth, as shown by the standard error, further suggesting that curcumin could consistently inhibit Physarum growth. Perhaps we needed to soak the plates in more curcumin to get better results with this particular sample group.
As for the growth on the dibutryl-cAMP media when compared to the control, perhaps the dibutryl-cAMP mold was slower to grow because it was taking up dibutryl-cAMP as it was crawling, which could slow it down. Meanwhile, the mold in the control group was simply focused on crawling to the nearest food source, and had nothing to absorb from the surrounding medium. The mold in dibutryl-cAMP did experience more directional growth towards glucose. So while it did not grow as quickly as the control, perhaps the dibutryl-cAMP helped Physarum’s chemotaxis abilities. Since PKA is involved in actin filament synthesis, which is heavily involved in contractions for directional cell movement, the activation of the PKA from the dibutryl-cAMP may have made the growth of Physarum more directional. 
More studies should be done on this topic, controlling more for direction of growth in order to further normalize the data. Both a Physarum chemoattractant (glucose) and chemorepellant (such as tryptophan) (de Lacy Costello: 2013) should be used. A chemoattractant stronger than glucose could also be used, as studies have suggested that even if Physarum senses a mediocre food source (such as glucose), it may continue looking for better food sources and not grow directly towards the first food source it finds, if that source is not ideal (Beekman: 2015). For this reason, it may also be plausible to set up multiple food sources in a single medium, allowing Physarum more choices and eliminating random crawling. This set-up could also be useful in determining if these substances affect chemotaxis behaviors, if the food sources were of varying chemoattractive strength. By controlling more for direction, we can see if substances like curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP really inhibit / promote slime mold growth, or if they affect chemotaxis behaviors. Also, allowing the Physarum cultures to grow over a longer period of time (more than 24 hours) could create better results, as it would allow more time for the substances to take their effects. 
Experiments such as this one are important for understanding how one can prevent or encourage the growth of slime mold when necessary, which can be beneficial to failing ecosystems. In addition, it can be useful in understanding how chemical pollutants may affect the growth of Physarum, which is helpful in comprehending how we are damaging our planet, and how we can fix it.
