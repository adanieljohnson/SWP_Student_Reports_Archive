Title: Food and betta fish aggression 

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment was to determine if the presence of the valuable resource of food would influence the level of aggression between two male betta fish. A common idea is that behaviors such as aggressive behaviors to some extent have an evolutionary basis. Because of this, aggression may have evolved as a mechanism for increasing the chances of acquiring more food or more mating opportunities. For this experiment, two male betta fish were placed in two conditions; one with food and one without food. In these two conditions, six major aggressive movements were observed, recorded, and later quantified using an aggression score. It was hypothesized that in the condition where food was placed in the tank with the fish, aggression level would be higher when compared to the condition where no food was present. The null hypothesis was that the presence or absence of food in the tank would have no effect on aggressive behaviors in betta fish. The results of the experiment supported the null hypothesis and demonstrated that the difference in mean aggression scores in the condition with food (0.48 ± 0.41) and without food (0.93 ± 0.94) was not statistically significant. 

Introduction:
 Behavior, in a biological sense, can be defined as how an organism interacts with its environment and other organisms within it. To some extent, behavior is innate, has a genetic basis and can be explained through evolutionary concepts [Mayr: 1974] [Skinner: 1984]. In addition, behavioral research often times attempts to predict and explain patterns and forms of behavior in order to better understand it in the context of larger biological processes. For this experiment, intraspecific behaviors, or those which occur between members of the same species, will be examined. The focus will remain specifically on intraspecific aggression in relation to betta splendens or betta fish. Aggressive behaviors are characterized as being hostile and often times violent toward another organism. Many different animals exhibit aggressive behaviors towards members of their own and different species and a study by Wilson states that aggression in animals may have evolved as a mechanism of increasing access to resources such as mates and food (Wilson:2014). Furthermore, competition for resources, according to a study by Georgiev et al, is the “main selective pressure for the evolution of violent aggression” (Georgiev et al: 2013). In accordance with this, aggression in betta fish occurs specifically when there is a territorial threat by another male in an area were resources are present. For this experiment, aggressive behaviors in these conditions will be analyzed to determine if the presence of the valuable resource of food will influence the level of aggression between two male betta fish. It is hypothesized that in the condition where food is placed in the tank with the fish, aggression level will be higher when compared to the condition where no food will be present. This is because the presence of food would increase intraspecific competition in which the males will need to compete over the food source. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to study if the presence of food influences aggressive behaviors, six male betta fish were separated into three groups of two. Within each of these groups, two conditions were observed. In the first condition, the two male betta fish were placed in the same tank and then observed for five minutes without the presence of food and in the second condition this procedure was followed with the presence of food.  However, within some experimental trials, the two betta fish had to be separated before five minutes in order to reduce or avoid physical harm. An independent measures design type was used in which each trial involved a new set of fish and this limited the effect fatigue and habituation would have on the data. To quantify aggressive behaviors an aggression score was developed. The aggressive behaviors observed included broadside and facing movements which were further separated into six aggressive positions. For broadside movements, a betta fish may exhibit pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movement positions include the erection of the pectoral fins, the spreading of gill covers, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes. These are stated in increasing order of aggressiveness with tail flashing and the protruding of the branchiostegal membranes being the most aggressive. For the aggression score a numerical value of 1-3 was assigned to the six aggressive displays mentioned previously with 1 being the least aggressive and 3 being the most aggressive. Next, the display of each behavior was timed in seconds and then divided by the total amount of time the two betta fish were allowed to interact. These two numerical values were then multiplied together to give each fish an aggression score. After results were collected a paired t-test was conducted on the data. The paired t-test was selected because it allowed for the comparison of the data from one fish with and without food to the other groups of fish.

Results:
The results of the experiment did not support the hypothesis that in the condition where food was placed in the tank with the fish, aggression level would be higher when compared to the condition where no food was present. As shown in table 1 and figure 1, the average aggression score in the condition with food was 0.48 ± 0.41 while the average aggression score in the condition without food was 0.93 ± 0.94. The high standard deviation in both of these conditions demonstrates that the data was very widely spread around the mean and a paired t-test determined that the difference between the two conditions was statistically insignificant (t-stat=1.34, df=4, P=0.25). Because of this, the hypothesis was rejected and the null hypothesis retained. 

Discussion:
   The results of the experiment did not support what was hypothesized in that aggression scores were not higher in the condition where food was present in the tank. In fact, the results demonstrated that the difference in average aggression scores in the condition with food (0.48 ± 0.41) and without food (0.93 ±  0.94) was not statistically significant. The high standard deviation in both of these conditions demonstrates that the data is more widely spread around the mean and hence likely less reliable. However, it does support the null hypothesis in which the presence or absence of food does not influence aggression in betta fish. This may hint to the fact that betta fish aggression was not evolved as a result of competition over food but rather a result of competition over mates.  A study by Doutrelant supports this premise and found that intraspecific aggressive behaviors in betta fish increased when a female was also present in the tank (Doutrelant: 2001). While other organisms such as crabs have been shown to become more aggressive towards other species and members of their own species when exposed to food, these results are not necessarily generalizable to betta fish (Tran: 2014). Because of this, further research about food and intraspecific betta fish relations would have to be studied to determine more reliably if there is no correlation between aggressive behaviors and the presence or absence of food. When conducting further research several different experimental flaws should be noted. Human error is especially relevant in relation to behavioral observations. It is likely that the amount of time a behavior was observed to be exhibited was at best a vague approximation and hence variability such as that shown by the large standard deviation for the mean values would be expected. To fix this, more than one individual should observe the same fish and after this is finished results should be compared to increase objectivity. Another experimental flaw was that only six betta fish were used. This is a very small sample size; therefore, it would be unlikely that any meaningful or significant trends could be identified or generalized to the larger betta fish population. A larger sample size should hence be collected during follow up research. Despite these flaws, the results of this study are likely valuable when describing what does not motivate betta fish aggression. Aggression is a complex behavior that can occur as a result of many different biological or environmental influences. While male on male betta fish aggression may have a large number of evolutionary explanations, the results of this study do not support the premise that competition over food is one of them. Studying animal behaviors in relation to evolution can help determine how certain behaviors become prevalent within a population or a species. In addition, understanding that certain behaviors occur as a response to specific stimuli can allow for more in-depth analysis on the trade-off between survival and reproduction.
