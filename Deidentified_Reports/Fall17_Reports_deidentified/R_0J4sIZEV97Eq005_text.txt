Title: Calcium Antagonist, LaCl₃, Decreased Response Amplitude of Sciatic Nerve of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
This experiment investigated the effect of calcium antagonist, Lanthanum Chloride, LaCl₃, on the response amplitude of the sciatic nerve of Rania pipiens. The significance of this project resides in its ability to support the findings found for the use of calcium antagonists as beneficial agents for surgical assistance and patient treatment. To conduct this experiment, frog legs were dissected and electrodes were attached to the sciatic nerve to stimulate the gastrocnemus muscle. The LaCl₃ solution was injected into the muscle, followed by a 10-minute muscle stimulation. According to a previous study conducted on smooth cells from the artery of a rabbit ear, the introduction of the calcium antagonist, D600, blocked calcium ions from leaving open calcium channels, preventing depolarization of the cells, and thus, preventing an action potential from being generated. The results of the study concluded that the introduction of the calcium antagonist decreased the gastrocnemus muscle’s response to signals generated within the cell. It was hypothesized that the introduction of LaCl₃ would cause the sciatic nerve response amplitude to decrease in comparison with the controlll group. Nerve response amplitude significently decreased after the injection of LaCl₃, across all three trials. 

Introduction:
Nerve impulses and neurons compose the basis of mobility within all animals. The generation of action potential is what initiates skeletal movement, and thus, induces mobility. ATP, scientifically known as adenosine triphosphate, is broken down to generate an action potential that will cause muscle contraction [Baker: 2010]. In addition to ATP, calcium ions are essential to produce movement. Calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and then bind to troponin, which induces a series of conformational changes that generate muscle contraction. The muscle contraction is then stopped by the re-uptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is responsible for initiating contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles. Calcium antagonists inhibit this release of Calcium ions, and may also be responsible for decreasing the availability of calcium ions within the cell, thus decreasing the chance for muscle contraction to occur [Middleton: 1983]. The utilization of calcium antagonists is beneficial for a wide variety of medical purposes, beginning with the use of calcium antagonists to successfully treat patients with hypertension [Grossman: 2004]. It has also been observed to successfully treat those who suffer from exercise-induced asthma [Middleton: 1983]. As the release of calcium ions generates muscle contraction, the inhibition of calcium ion ingress will either weaken or prevent the muscle contraction from occurring. As mentioned in the examples above, it is beneficial that these contractions do not occur in order to treat certain disorders. Calcium antagonists are also important to study when trying to introduce muscle relaxers to the human body. A prime example of a calcium antagonist is Lidocaine, which serves the numb the muscle, and as a result, inhibit the stimulation of muscle contraction. Testing the efficiency and speed of calcium antagonists would be beneficial to further advance the application of calcium antagonists within treatments commonly used throughout the medical world. 
In this experiment, the calcium antagonist’s effect on the sciatic nerve response is closely examined. The sciatic nerve is responsible for conducting nerve signals to the lower leg. In a study utilizing D600, a calcium antagonist, it was found that the introduction of the D600 to a rabbit ear artery did not alter the current of depolarization when the muscle was at rest; however, the calcium antagonist either blocked or increased the rate of relaxation of the muscle after activation [Hering: 1989]. Based on this research, we hypothesized that the introduction of the calcium antagonist, LaCl₃, would yield a decrease in the sciatic nerve response amplitude, in comparison with the controlll group. 


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we first gathered the necessary materials for the experiment: 3 frog legs, 1 syringe, frog Ringer’s solution, 0.6 Ml of diluted LaCl₃, iWorks software and probes, string, and scissors. We then began by dissecting the frog leg, carefully peeling the skin off the entire leg to reveal the underlying muscle. From here, the scissors were used to cut the extraneous connective tissue away from the gastrocnemus muscle, in order to fully isolate the muscle for our purpose. We then used a dissecting probe to separate the inner thigh muscles, find the white sciatic nerve, and separate it from the surrounding connective tissue. We made sure to keep the muscle moist by periodically wetting the muscle with frog Ringer’s solution. We then cut off the end of the sciatic nerve where the junction between the top of the foot and the end of leg lay. After doing so, the end of gastrocnemus muscle was tied with a string, the tension was adjusted, and then the two pin electrodes were placed just inside the muscle. The BNC connector for the sleeve electrodes was then connected to the stimulator output. Using the Labscribe toolbar, the pulse amplitude was set to 0.00 V, the frequency was set to 1 Hz, and the number of pulses was set to 5. This step was done in order to ensure that there were no external influences affecting our measurements, and to ensure that the probe was working properly. The amplitude was then set to 1 V, with the frequency and number of pulses remaining the same. After recording values for the controlll, we then injected the frog leg with 0.2 Ml of LaCl₃. Following injection, we set a timer for 10 minutes before sending an impulse to the sciatic nerve. This was done to ensure that the LaCl₃ had enough time to fully diffuse within the muscle. Once the 10-minute wait period was over, we sent a stimulus to the sciatic nerve, again following the same data measurement of 1 V, 1 Hz, and 5 pulses. This experiment was then conducted 2 more times, each time with a different frog leg. The data was then recorded and analyzed using a one-tailed, two sampled t_test to determine the statistical difference of the data. 

Results:
The general trend observed with each trial was that the nerve response amplitude decreased after injection of the LaCl₃, as compared to the nerve response amplitudes recorded for the controlll groups. Trial 1 yielded average results of 0.6446 V and 0.510 V, for the controlll and experimental groups respectively. The p value was calculated to be 0.000168, the Tstat was 5.965689, and the degree of freedom was 8. Trial 2 yielded average values of 0.8274 V for the controlll group and 0.5646 V for the experimental group. The p value was calculated to be 0.0000478 and the Tstat value was 7.165473. Degrees of freedom was 8. Trial 3 yielded averages of 0.5430 V for the controlll group and 0.2030 V for the experimental group. The p value was calculated to be 9.08×E^(-10), the Tstat value yielded 29.6949409, and the degrees of freedom was 8. All three trials yielded statistically significent results after data analysis. 
 



Discussion:
Our hypothesis that there would be significent decrease in sciatic nerve amplitude after the application of LaCl₃ was supported by the statistical data gathered, thus rejecting our null hypothesis that there would be no difference in the sciatic nerve response amplitude. These results were observed due to the properties of calcium antagonists working to inhibit the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as observed within the previously mentioned experiment where D600 was introduced to an artery within the rabbit ear. Thus, we could draw the conclusion that the decreased nerve response amplitude portrays the inhibition of these calcium ions, as fewer Ca²⁺ ions were able to flow down the ion channels and exit the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A complete lack of nerve response was not observed, signifying that the calcium antagonists did not full inhibit the release of Ca²⁺ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 
Regarding human error, the measurement of LaCl₃ to the 0.2 Ml line using the syringe could have been slightly off as the reading was based upon a human eye. As well, the injection site could have been slightly different each time, possibly causing a difference in the rate of absorption or distribution of the calcium antagonist solution. Additionally, the frog ringer solution and LaCl₃ solution possibly could have mixed when on the tray, causing some LaCl₃ solution to be absorbed in the other frog legs before the experiment was conducted on them. 
To further this experiment, it would be beneficial to test other application method of introducing the LaCl₃, other than injections, such as spritzing the muscle with the solution and massaging the solution into the muscle. The experiment could be further tested by utilizing an increased concentration of LaCl₃, and observing the amount of time needed for diffusion as a result of a higher concentration, and examining whether there is an increased inhibition of Ca²⁺ ions.
This experiment revealed that calcium antagonists reduce muscle contraction, thus enabling the muscle to attain longer periods of relaxation without the generation of a contraction. This concept is important to study because it can help advance the field of medical technology. Generating more knowledge on this subject matter can help with the production of more effective, efficient medicine that can help relax a patient’s muscles in order to maximize patient benefits, such as anesthesia, patients suffering from dystonia, asthma sufferers, and a multitude of others.
