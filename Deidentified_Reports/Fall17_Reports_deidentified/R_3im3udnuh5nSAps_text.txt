Title: Effects of CO2 concentration on Rubisco activity in Brassica oleracea

Abstract:
The effect of CO2 concentration on Rubisco activity in kale (Brassica oleracea) was studied using the Hill reaction.  CO2 was added to the Hill reaction solution in different concentrations, alongside isolated chloroplasts in solution.  DCPIP was used in the Hill reaction as an electron acceptor.  It was predicted that a higher CO2 concentration would result in higher photosynthetic activity.  No significant difference was found between CO2-treated groups.  This may be attributed to our using the incorrect method to measure Rubisco activity.  Rubisco is part of the "dark" reactions, while the Hill reaction assay measures only the activity of the "light" reactions.  We concluded that Rubisco activity is best studied by measuring gas exchange.

Introduction:
Rubisco is perhaps the most abundant protein on Earth (Ellis 1979).  It catalyzes the addition of a carbon, from carbon dioxide, to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, yielding two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (Spreitzer and Salvucci, 2002).  This is the central reaction of photosynthetic carbon fixation.  However, Rubisco can be inhibited by binding O2, in which case it catalyzes a process called photorespiration, instead of carbon fixation.  The fixation of carbon by Rubisco, despite the enzyme’s inefficiency, is an energetically favorable reaction.

We are using kale (Brassica oleracea) to study Rubisco.  Kale is an important food crop and a C3 plant (it synthesizes a 3-carbon sugar in carbon fixation).  It is important to study the effects of CO2 concentration on crop plants, considering that CO2 levels in the atmosphere are rising.  Like other C3 plants, kale should be responsive to changes in O2/CO2 levels.  Since Rubisco is considered an inefficient enzyme, we are interested in manipulating the level of CO2 in the plant.

Rubisco binds CO2, as well as O2.  We are interested in changing the level of CO2 in the plant’s environment and measuring the change in photosynthetic activity.  We will change the level of CO2 in a solution with isolated chloroplasts.  Increased CO2 should result in increased photosynthesis, as an increased concentration of CO2 would lead to an increase in the likelihood of CO2, instead of O2, binding to Rubisco.


Materials and Methods:
Part I.
A mortar and pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 ml size), and 3 50 ml centrifuge tubes were packed into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle were cooling, the large central veins from 4 medium-sized kale leaves were removed. Veins and excess moisture were removed from rinsed leaves. Kale leaves were then added to the (dried) mortar and pestle.  10 ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added, and the kale leaves were ground until they were a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left.An additional 10 ml of grinding buffer was mixed with the kale slurry and then the entire volume of green slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker.  The remaining green liquid was then transferred to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun at 200 x G (1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4oC.  The supernatant was then poured out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. Do not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A”.  The 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) was centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC.  The supernatant (Tube “B”) was poured into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C”. Tube “B” was placed on ice.  10 mL of sodium-free Original Seltzer and 10 mL of 2x Hill Rxn buffer were mixed in a clean 50 ml centrifuge tube and marked with “1x CO2 Hill Rxn”. 10 mL of 1x CO2 Hill Rxn and 10 mL of 1x Hill Rxn buffer were also mixed in a clean 50 ml centrifuge tube and marked with “0.5x CO2 Hill Rxn”. 

Part II
13 large test tubes were labelled as shown below, and placed in a tube rack.  3 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes were prepared (1 replicate of the blank).  Absorbances were measured at 600nm and recorded at 0 min and after 30 minutes of mixtures sitting in light

Results:
Both test groups showed a decrease in absorbance over the control.  ANOVA gives a p-value of about 0.001, showing that the results are statistically significant.  The Tukey-Kramer test shows that the difference between Group 1 and Group 2 is not significant.


Discussion:
The results were found to be significant.  However, there was little difference in measured photosynthetic activity with regard to CO2 concentration.  This can be attributed to our using the incorrect method to measure photosynthesis.  We used the Hill reaction to measure photosynthetic activity.  The Hill reaction is the process of electron transfer in chloroplasts in the presence of light (Johnson, AD. Biological Principles Laboratory Manual).  This is known as part of the so-called “light reactions.”  We planned this experiment with the intent of using the Hill reaction to measure the action of Rubisco.  However, Rubisco is part of the “dark reactions” (Alberts, et al. Essential Cell Biology, page 476).  The dark reactions are not affected directly by the light reactions.  This means that our experiment measured the wrong activity.  The Hill reaction in no way measures Rubisco activity.  A better measurement of Rubisco activity can be made by measuring gas exchange (Kobza and Edwards 1987).

Rubisco is a strikingly inefficient enzyme (Spreitzer and Salvucci, 2002), and can be inhibited by O2.  Manipulation of Rubisco in crop plants would be beneficial in helping to alleviate the problems of water shortage and rising CO2 levels, especially in the developing world.  Therefore, it is important that the effects of O2/CO2 concentration on Rubisco activity are studied.  Genetically engineered plants could be made that have a more efficient Rubisco enzyme, leading to higher productivity.

It is also known that Rubisco is inhibited by high temperatures (Sharkey, 2005).  With the current problem of climate change, it is extremely important that the effects of rising temperatures on plants are studied.  Again, genetically engineered plants may be used to solve this problem.
