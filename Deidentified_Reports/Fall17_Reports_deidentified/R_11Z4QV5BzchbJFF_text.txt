Title: The increase of photosynthetic rate due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide in enriched chloroplasts of kale leaves.

Abstract:
Many environmental factors, such as CO2 concentration, sunlight and temperature, affect the photosynthetic rate of plants. This experiment observed the effect of elevated CO2 concentrations on the photosynthetic rate of kale leaves. CO2 concentration was elevated by using two different treatments of 0.5 molar CO2 Hill Reaction and 1 molar CO2 Hill Reaction on enriched chloroplasts of kale leaves. It was predicted that an increase of CO2 concentration will increase photosynthetic rate. The absorbance at 600 nm of these two treatments and a control group was measured after 30 minutes. The electron acceptor used in this experiment was 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), which becomes colorless when reduced. From this, it can be determined that the lower the absorbance of treatment groups, the higher the photosynthetic rate. The results of the experiment showed that the treatment groups had a lower absorbance and that there is a significant difference between the treatment groups and the control group, and thus concludes that increasing the concentration of CO2 increases the rate of photosynthesis. As rising levels of CO2 are becoming more prominent in our atmosphere, it is crucial to examine the short and long term effects of this phenomenon on plants.


Introduction:
Plants and other organisms depend on the process of photosynthesis to harness light energy from the sun into chemical energy. Photosynthesis involves two processes the light dependent and the light independent reactions. The light dependent reaction generates the proton gradient that drives the production of ATP, which is then used in the light independent reactions to convert CO2 into glucose. The summary reaction of photosynthesis can be given by the equation: 6 CO2 + 12 H2O  C6H12O6  +  6 H2O +  6 O2 .The electrons on ATP  and other electron carriers are then used in chemical reactions that synthesize 6-carbon glucose from 1-carbon carbon dioxide molecules. This lab will use the Hill Reaction to help examine the rate of photosynthesis, which is the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts plus light [Johnson, 2016]. The electron acceptor is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) will be used to measure the rate of photosynthesis. Since, oxidized DCPIP is a dark blue compound and reduced DCPIP is colorless, one can measure the light absorbance, which correlates with the rate of photosynthesis [Johnson, 2016]. If the rate is higher, more DCPIP will be reduced and thus become colorless. In this lab, the Hill Reaction and DCPIP will be used to measure the rate of photosynthesis when kale leaves are treated with different levels of CO2 concentrations. It can be seen that increasing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 stimulates photosynthesis of C3 plants; however, such stimulation is not seen in longer periods of time [Arp, 1991]. Similarly, photosynthesis will be stimulated by 25–75% when the CO2 concentration is doubled from 35 to 70 Pa; however, differences in the long‐term response to CO2 may vary [Stitt, 1991]. From this, the predicted outcome for a short period of time for this experiment is that increasing the concentration of CO2 will cause an increase in the rate of photosynthesis of the enriched chloroplasts of kale leaves. Kale leaves are practical for this experiment because they are C3 plants, which are most common among land plants and provide a good basis to relate the results of this experiment to other C3 plants. CO2 concentration’s effect on the photosynthesis of plants is important to study because the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is increasing due to excess consumption of fossil fuels [Bazzaz, 1990]. By studying this further, we can begin to see the potential catastrophic effects on ecosystems worldwide.


Materials and Methods:
To obtain the enriched chloroplasts, use a mortar and pestle to grind four kale leaves, without their major veins, and ten mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine, pH 8) until it is a thick paste. Then add ten more mL of the grinding buffer and strain the thick paste through a cheesecloth into a beaker placed on ice. Put the strained liquid into a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and spin it at 200 times the force of gravity (1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for about three minutes at four degrees Celsius. Separate the resulting mixture by pouring the liquid into another tube and leaving the chunks at the bottom. Spin this new centrifuge tube at 1,000 times the force of gravity (2400 rpm) for ten minutes at four degrees Celsius. Separate this resulting mixture by again pouring out the liquid into another tube and leaving the debris at the bottom of the previous tube. This debris should be the enriched chloroplasts extracted from the kale leaves. Next to make the “1x CO2 Hill Rxn” treatment, mix ten mL of sodium-free Original Seltzer and ten mL of two molar Hill Reaction buffer. To make the “0.5x CO2 Hill Rxn” treatment, mix ten mL of the “1x CO2 Hill Rxn” and ten mL of the one molar Hill Reaction buffer. To prepare the different reaction mixtures, first make one test tube of the blank, which contains eight mL of water and two mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). First make three test tubes of the control, which contain six mL of water, two mL of DCPIP, and two mL of the one molar Hill Reaction Buffer. Next make three test tubes of the first treatment, which contain six mL of water, two mL of DCPIP, and two mL of the “1x CO2 Hill Rxn” treatment, and make three test tubes of the second treatment, which contain six mL of water, two mL of DCPIP, and two mL of the “0.5x CO2 Hill Rxn” treatment. Finally, add 100 uL of enriched chloroplasts to all of the test tubes, and record each test tubes absorbance at 600 nm at time zero and after 30 minutes of the mixtures sitting in sunlight. A One-Way ANOVA statistical test will be used to compare the absorbance of the control and of the two treatment groups after 30 min. The Tukey–Kramer test will say if the results are significantly different from each other.


Results:
The results show that there was significant difference (P=0.001081) in absorbance after 30 minutes between the control group and the two treatment groups. By looking at the Tukey Kramer test, the data also show a significant difference between groups A and B, and groups A and C (Group A is the control, group B is the first treatment, and group C in the second treatment). However, groups B and C did not have significant difference between them. 


Discussion:
The data show that there was significant difference between the treatment groups and the control group. The increased CO2 concentration treatments showed a lower absorbance, which correlates with a higher photosynthetic rate because reduced DCPIP becomes colorless. While the two treatments showed significant difference from the control, they did not have significant difference between each other. This could be a result of a lack of sufficient CO2 concentration difference between the two to create a significant difference on photosynthetic rate. These results support the prediction for this experiment that increasing the concentration of CO2 will increase the photosynthetic rate of enriched chloroplasts of kale leaves. The Hill Reaction observes the reduction of DCPIP, which occurs in the light dependent reaction; however, the fixation of CO2 occurs in the light independent reaction. Since the light independent reaction depends on the high energy electron carriers reduced in the light dependent reaction to occur, then this can explain why increasing the concentration of CO2 increases the amount of DCPIP reduced, and thus, increases the rate of photosynthesis observed. It is plausible that the rate that electron carriers are reduced depend on the number of CO2 molecules present. Since a higher concentration of CO2 molecules are introduced, more DCPIP was reduced in order to compensate for this new concentration. CO2 acts as an activator and a substrate for the major enzyme of photosynthesis, rubisco [Bowes, 1993]. When the concentration of CO2 increases, more rubisco can be activated, which drives the process of photosynthesis, and thus, increases the rate of photosynthesis. While this experiment only looked at the short term effect of increased CO2 concentration, it is important to consider the long term effect as well. Projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predict that increased temperature and decreased soil moisture, which would otherwise reduce crop yields, will be offset by the effect of rising carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere [Long, 2006]. However, this report concluded that long term rising CO2 concentration does not yield a higher rate of photosynthesis. Research has also been done that states that growth in high CO2 environments usually causes a decrease in stomatal density [Bazzaz, 1990]. We would expect this to decrease photosynthesis in the long run, because vital molecules, like CO2 and O2, would not have as efficient access to enter the plant to drive to photosynthesis. Since this experiment only observed photosynthetic rate for 30 minutes, further testing should be done to examine the long term effect to be able to better predict the potential harm of a high CO2 atmosphere on plant life.
