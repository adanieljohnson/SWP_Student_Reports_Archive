Title: Measuring nerve and muscle activity of a Rana pipiens frog leg injected with Lidocaine resulting in a negligible difference from the control leg

Abstract:
Sodium channels are responsible for activating action potentials, which can lead to muscle contractions. The goal of this experiment was to test the effect of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on nerve stimulation of a Rana pipiens frog leg muscle. It was hypothesized that the lidocaine would increase the threshold at which the frog leg muscle would respond or twitch. The muscle was suspended from a force transducer and the sciatic nerve was stimulated at different voltages until there was a muscle twitch and the threshold at which the twitch occurred was recorded. The muscle was then injected with lidocaine and the process was repeated. This was repeated on two more legs. From this experiment, it was found that the lidocaine did not increase the threshold of signaling to the muscle and the difference between the control legs and legs injected with lidocaine was not statistically significant. 

Introduction:
Muscle contractions are an important part of frog legs as that is how they are able to move. Motor neurons stimulate these muscle contractions. Motor neuron axons innervate myofibers at neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses at this junction induce the release of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal of the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell. This acetylcholine opens sodium channels on the muscle fiber membrane. This opening of the sodium channels generates an action potential that stimulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and activates the contractile mechanism, shortening the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2017]. Sodium is important for creating action potentials because the currents through the sodium channels drive the depolarization phase of an action potential and changes to the sodium current affect neuronal firing [Scheuer: 2006]. Lidocaine binds to the voltage-gated sodium channels, blocking the flow of the sodium ions through their channels [Cummins: 2007]. The goal of the experiment was to test what effect an injection of lidocaine into the muscle of Rana pipiens frog legs would have on their muscle’s reaction to stimuli. The Rana pipiens frogs were a good model organism to use in the experiment because their legs are small and easy to manipulate to easily see the response to stimulation in the muscle. The independent variable was the threshold at which control frog legs responded to stimulus compared to the threshold of frog legs injected with lidocaine. Due to the effect lidocaine has on sodium channels, it was hypothesized that an injection of lidocaine into the muscle of the frog legs would increase the threshold of stimulus needed to signal a response in the leg muscle, or a twitch.

Materials and Methods:
The Rana pipiens frog leg was first placed in a dissecting pan where it was skinned and moistened with frog Ringer’s Solution. The inner thigh muscles were then separated with a dissecting probe and the sciatic nerve was freed from the connective tissue with a dissecting needle and forceps. Then, a piece of thread was tied to the end of the muscle and attached to a hook, suspending the muscle from a force transducer at a 90 degree angle to the sciatic nerve. Next, the sciatic nerve was attached to a sleeve electrode that transfers stimuli from the FT-302 transducer to the nerve. The software iWorx was used to transmit signals to the sleeve electrode for the stimulations. Starting at 0 volts, the amplitude of the stimulus was increased by 0.05 volts until there was a response, or twitch, in the muscle. The amplitude threshold at which a twitch occurred was recorded as well as the amplitude of the response. The stimulus at that amplitude was repeated to ensure the response was due to the stimulus. The muscle of the leg was then injected with 25mM of lidocaine, which was diluted with the Ringer’s Solution, while still suspended, and five minutes were given for the lidocaine to spread. After the five minutes, the amplitude of the stimulus was increased by .05 volts until there was a response in the muscle again. The threshold amplitude and response amplitude were recorded. The same amplitude was repeated to ensure the cause of the response. This process was then repeated with two more Rana pipiens frog legs to compare results. The Rana pipiens frogs were kept according to IACUC standards. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to compare the threshold of the response of control frog legs and the threshold of the response of frog legs injected with lidocaine.

Results:
The first and second trials were collected by the research group. The third trial collected by the research group indicated a lower threshold in the lidocaine injected leg. This is counter to what has been found in the past so the third trial was discarded as it was an outlier. Lab pool data from lidocaine was then substituted in for this trial. As shown in Figure 1, the difference in threshold of the control leg and lidocaine injected leg in each trial was between 0 and 0.11. A paired t-test comparing thresholds of the control legs to thresholds of lidocaine injected legs produced a p-value of 0.18. This is not statistically significant.

Discussion:
The third data set was discarded because it indicated a lower threshold in the lidocaine injected leg, this is counter to studies that have found that lidocaine causes sodium channels to be in an inactivated state, meaning lidocaine should not indicate a lower threshold [Chen: 2000]. This caused us to discard this set and use lab pool results. The results from the two trials and lab pool data did not support the hypothesis that injecting the frog leg with lidocaine would increase the threshold at which the leg muscle would respond as the difference in threshold of control legs compared to legs injected with lidocaine is not statistically significant. There was minimal to no difference in the thresholds, see Figure 1. This hypothesis was created based on the knowledge that lidocaine blocks sodium channels preventing sodium ions from flowing through the channel [Cummins: 2007]. Since the flow of sodium through the channels is responsible for depolarization in an action potential, manipulation of the flow would affect the neuronal firing [Scheuer: 2006]. The action potential stimulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and activates the muscle’s contractile mechanism [Johnson: 2017]. This knowledge of the role sodium has in action potentials that induce contractions led to the hypothesis that signaling from the nerve to the muscle would be prevented if lidocaine was introduced because depolarization would be affected stopping the action potential that would allow for signaling. In this experiment, a concentration of 25 mM of lidocaine was used, however in another study it was found that an injection of 40 mM concentration or more of lidocaine causes nonreversible loss of impulse activity in a frog nerve [Bainton: 1994]. It is possible that if this experiment was completed with the same concentration of lidocaine as the study previously mentioned it would produce results with no response to the stimulus, supporting the hypothesis. The next step for this study would be to repeat the experiment with a higher concentration of lidocaine. Another change to this study would be to have more legs to test in order to make the data more representative as well as have more reference in case of outliers as what happened with the third frog leg in this experiment that was discarded. This is important because lidocaine is used as an anesthetic in humans for issues such as epilepsy by blocking the excitatory currents [Fozzard: 2011]. This experiment is important because it can be used to learn more about the effects of lidocaine in order to make the use of lidocaine on humans safer.
