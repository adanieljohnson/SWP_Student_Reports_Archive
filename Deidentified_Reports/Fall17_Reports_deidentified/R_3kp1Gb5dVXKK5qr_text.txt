Title: The Effect of Sodium Chloride in the Hill Reaction Buffer on the Photosynthetic Rate of Sinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
This experiment tested the rate of absorption change over thirty minutes in the chloroplast of Sinacia Oleracea under three levels of salinity. Through the utilization of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol or DCPIP, we were able to calculate the degree to which altering salinity conditions affected photosynthetic ability. In order to do this, we placed one group in 0.00M NaCl conditions, one in 0.25M NaCl conditions, and one in 0.50M NaCl conditions. Once the chloroplast was isolated and mixed with DCPIP, we recorded absorbance levels with a mass spectrophotometer of the three different groups for thirty minutes (recording at each ten-minute interval, and at minute zero). We hypothesized the addition of both low salinity and high salinity in the Hill reaction buffer would have an inhibitory effect on photosynthesis in the spinach plant sample. Our results taken from time zero to thirty for the average absorption, however, were ultimately insignificant (p-value 0.922)

Introduction:
In order for organisms to survive, they must extract their energy from outside sources. For example, plants capture and store energy acquired from the sun through photosynthesis that will eventually be released by glycolysis and respiration. [Johnson: 2017] Cellular respiration and photosynthesis, therefore, are integral metabolic processes. During photosynthesis, the chloroplasts absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll molecules. This action then triggers a chemical reaction that will cleave water to replace electrons that left carriers. Additionally, the absorption of solar radiation generates a proton gradient that will allow high energy electrons to be stored as NADPH+ (the H+ gradient that powers the ATP synthase. This is then used to synthesize six carbon glucose from one carbon dioxide molecule. [Johnson: 2017] Overall, minimal quantities of the ATP generated by the photosynthetic reaction will be readily available for other cell processes. [Johnson: 2017] The rate at which plants are able to perform photosynthesis is dependent on the function of electron transport chains that are readily altered by external factors including: herbicides, temperature, light, and environment nutrients. [Coles: 2001] An environmental nutrient, such as Sodium Chloride is an integral external factor to examine. Global warming is a present issue, that continues to effect multiple facets of our planet including rising sea levels. As sea levels continue to rise, soil in increasing in salinity in many areas of the world. [Leisner: 1999] Current data suggests that rising sea levels, storm frequency, and atmospheric Carbon Dioxide levels are directly effecting crop cultivation in coastal areas. [Leisner: 1999] The process of electron transfer is known as the Hill Reaction. The DCPIP Hill reaction is utilized to measure ATP production or reduction by mimicking the effects of NADP, while providing a color change that enables the experimenter to document changes. DCPIP or 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol is an artificial electron acceptor that tests the Hill reaction. [Johnson: 2017] This placed in the chloroplast of Sinacia oleracea (commonly known as spinach leaves), enables the testing of the rate the Hill reaction occurs. This is why the spinach leaf was chosen as our plant sample. According to a study on the effects of salt stress on photosynthesis, sodium chloride causes a decrease in plant growth and productivity by disrupting photosynthesis. [Sudhir: 2004] This occurs as a result of a change in the ratio of Sodium to Potassium which effects photosynthesis. [Sudhir: 2004] To examine salinity effects on the photosynthetic rate of the spinach plants, we performed an experiment utilizing spinach leaves at varying levels of salinity and determined their absorbance as well as percent change over thirty minutes. A control group made with no Sodium Chloride and two experimental groups (low salinity; 0.25M NaCl, and high salinity; 0.5M NaCl) were utilized. We hypothesized that the addition of both low salinity and high salinity in the Hill reaction buffer would have an inhibitory effect on photosynthesis in the spinach plant sample, lowering the absorbance level. 

Materials and Methods:
The first step in this experiment was to isolate the chloroplast, the main component of photosynthesis, from the spinach leaves. Pack the mortar and pestle, 250mL beaker, and 3-50mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While this is cooling, remove the large central veins from the spinach leaves and ensure the remains are dry. Once the mortar and pestle are cooled, add 10mL of cold grinding mix with the spinach and strain the entire volume through three layers of cheese cloth into chilled 250mL beaker. Then transfer 200ul of filtered solution into microtubule “Sample of A” and spin at 200xG for 3 minutes at 4℃. Pour supernatant out of “sample of A” into the second chilled 50mL centrifuge tube “B” Centrifuge 50mL of tube “B” and label it “Sample of B” then store on ice. Centrifuge 50mL tube “B” at 1,000xG for 10 minutes at 4℃. Pour solution from tube “B” into a clean 50mL tube marked “C” and add 20mL of grinding buffer to pellet then suspend it by stirring with a transfer pipet. Transfer 200ul from tube “C” and place it in into a microtube “Sample of C” and store it on ice. To test salinity effects, the chloroplast must be mixed in different salinity levels. Label ten test tubes: three testing 0.00M NaCl, three testing 0.25M NaCl, three testing 0.5M NaCl, and one blank. Add 6mL of water into each test tube (aside from the blank in which you add 8mL). After this, add 2mL of 130mM DCPIP to each tube (aside from the blank in which you add no DCPIP). Add 2mL of normal buffer to the blank tube and the three controls (the tubes with 0.00M NaCl). Add 2mL of 0.25M NaCl to the three tubes testing the low salinity. Lastly add 0.5M NaCl to the three tubes testing high salinity. To measure the initial absorbance (using a mass spectrophotometer), zero using the blank tube and measure the absorbance of the remaining nine test tubes (this is time zero). Place the ten test tubes under the light and leave for ten minutes. Use the blank test tube to zero the spectrophotometer and take the absorbance of the remaining nine tubes, the place the ten tubes back under the light. Repeat this once more after ten minutes. After the conclusion of this experiment, we found the average absorbance of each ten-minute interval for each level of salinity, and then calculated the percent change of the absorbance of the three samples tested for each salinity level per ten-minute interval. These results were then averaged together to find the average percent change for each salinity level at each time interval. The final step was to calculate the p-value for our data by performing a ANOVA test on our absorbance per time interval. Additionally, we performed a Turkey-Kramer test to compare each level of salinity, looking to see if there was a significant difference between any two. 

Results:
The results of this experiment were determined through the calculation of the average absorbance of each level of salinity at each of the three, ten-minute time intervals and at time zero, and the calculation of their percent change over this period of time. Average Absorbance is shown in Graph one, and Average Percentage is shown in graph two. To obtain these results, the two experimental groups, low salinity (0.25M NaCl) and high salinity (0.5M NaCl) were both compared to the absorbance of the control (0M NaCl), and the low salinity was compared to the high salinity. There was no significant difference shown in any of the tests ran (p-value: 0.922). Overall, for average absorbance, the 0.5M NaCl solution experienced the highest absorbance levels, the control experiencing the lowest absorbance levels. Additionally, the 0.5M NaCl solution experienced the highest percent change over the thirty minute interval.

Discussion:
This experiment aimed to analyze the absorption levels of DCPIP in order to enable us to determine the rate of electron transport chains function and thus, photosynthetic activity. Oftentimes, sodium chloride causes a decrease in plant growth and productivity by disrupting photosynthesis as a result of changes in the ratio between Potassium and Sodium. [Sudhir: 2004] Additionally, salinity tends to have an effect on water relations and ionic relations in plants. When exposed to salinity, plants experience water stress that leads to the reduction of leaf expansion. [Leisner: 1999] Long term exposure to salinity can cause plants to experience ionic stress which leads to the reduction of photosynthetic activity. This can be attributed to the early senescence of adult leaves, decreasing the photosynthetic area available to support continued growth. [Cramer: 1992] We hypothesized the addition of both low salinity and high salinity in the Hill reaction buffer would have an inhibitory effect on photosynthesis in the spinach plant sample, lowering the absorption levels. However, as demonstrated to us in Graph one titled “Average Absorption,” the average absorbance did not decrease at a rate high enough to be considered significantly different. Thus, our alternate hypothesis was not supported. This is further supported when analyzing Graph two. Overall, the average percent change for each level of salinity did not vary by a significant value over the duration of thirty minutes. Although our hypothesis was partially supported in the sense that there was an increase in percent change as the level of salinity increased, it was not to a degree high enough to be considered statistically significant. For plants growing in conditions with salinity present, there appears to be a threshold where photosynthetic activity will be affected. This threshold is determined by the level of salinity, the amount of time exposed to this level of salinity, and the type of organism growing. In a study testing the effects of NaCl on photosynthesis in two mangrove species, it was found that while increasing NaCl caused a decrease in net photosynthetic rate, the inhibitory effects varied between the species. [Li: 2008] It is possible that for the purposes of our experiment, the incorrect organism was chosen to increase the probability of finding results that were significantly different. Additionally, it is possible that the level of salinity being tested required an increase in percent NaCl to produce statistically significant results, or that we did not allow the spinach leaves to be exposed to increased levels of salinity for a period of time that would yield significant results. In a study conducted to examine the effect of NaCl on photosynthesis of four popular genotypes, it was found that increased salinity affected photosynthetic reaction, but these results were produced over the course of four to five days. [Fung:1998] It is possible that changing one or more of these factors could have altered the results of our experiment. For future studies, one could increase salinity and time of exposure as well as test a plant that tends to grow in areas of the planet closer to sea water in order to study the inhibitory effects global warming may have on certain organism’s growth in the future due to rising sea levels. Additionally, one could focus the lenses of this study to examine other potential factors that may affect photosynthetic activity in plants and other organisms. [Fung: 1998] As global warming is becoming an increasingly prevalent factor in most populations, it is beneficial to understand and attempt to find cures for potential changes in the environment that may affect our populations existence and necessity for adaptations in the future.

Figure Legends: 
Graph 1: This graph represents the average absorbance calculated during each ten-minute time interval for each of the three levels of salinity tested. In order to calculate the values graphed above, we used the Tukey-Kramer statistical test on ANOVA to average the absorbance results from the three test tubes per salinity level tested. The initial absorbance for 0.00M NaCl, 0.25M NaCl, and 0.5M NaCl were 0.336, 0.344, and 0.386 respectively. The final average absorbance were 0.268, 0.250, and 0.276 respectively. The p-value, determined from absorbance levels at three salinity concentrations after thirty minutes did not yield a significant difference (p-value= 0.922)

Graph 2: This graph represents the average percent change calculated over the duration of the thirty-minute time interval. The average percent change was calculated through the determining of the individual percent change of each of the three samples per salinity level (0M NaCl, 0.25M NaCl, and 0.50M NaCl) and then finding the average of these percent changes. Over the thirty-minute period, the final average for the three salinity levels were found to be: 20.238%, 27.326%, and 28.584%. 

Image 3: this is a picture of the statistical test ran (on ANOVA(. I am not sure how to read the p-values comparing the three salinity levels, so I am putting this in.
