Title: Food decreases the amount of aggressive behavior of Betta splendens in the presence of other betta splendens

Abstract:
Each behavior or action has costs and benefits to animals, and knowing what animals do in certain situations can give insight to what they allocate their resources for. Betta fish (Betta splendens) regularly exhibit aggressive behaviors when in the presence of other bettas. What would happen if betta fish were given the chance to act aggressively in the presence of food? What would they choose to do and how would costs and benefits factor into what they decided? In this experiment, the aggressive behaviors of betta fish were examined with and without food, and the statistical tests showed that there was a significant difference between the amount of aggressive behavior with and without food. The decrease in aggressive behavior could have been caused by the costs of acting versus the benefit of gaining resource.


Introduction:
When an animal exhibits a certain behavior, it is to maximize its fitness or pass its genes onto the next generation [Broom: 2010]. This could be in the form of reproduction or in the form or surviving long enough to reproduce later on. Allocating resources to reproduction may negatively affect its ability to survive or conversely if resources were allocated to surviving, reproductive success may be negatively affected. What animals choose to allocate their resources for affects their current and future fitness. When a betta fish (Betta splendens) displays aggressive behaviors to another of its own species, it is attempting to protect its own reproductive success by harming another. The aggression in betta fish may be caused other underlying motivations rather than the prospect of reproductive success [Shapiro: 2009]. Other factors that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of aggressive behavior is the levels of serotonin in the betta fish [Eisenreich: 2015]. If betta fish experience a change in serotonin levels, they may not exhibit aggressive behaviors as often as they would normally [Eisenreich: 2015]. If consuming food causes a change in serotonin levels, the betta fish may not react to seeing another opponent. Although, in the presence of nutrition, betta fish may choose to eat rather than engage another opponent in order to have more resources rather than because of a change in serotonin. After learning about the aggressive behavior of betta fish, there was a desire to investigate how food would affect those behaviors in male betta fish. Male betta fish were chosen because they have a higher tendency to act aggressively toward each other. It was hypothesized that the food would cause a decrease in aggressive behaviors in male betta fish. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between aggressive behavior before and after food. The alternative hypothesis will be that there will be a difference between the amount of aggressive behavior before and after food in male bettas. 


Materials and Methods:
Two male betta fish (Betta splendens) were placed in a tank where they were separated by an opaque and clear partition. As the control, they were allowed to see each other for five minutes. During those five minutes, each aggressive behavior of one fish would be recorded. The other male betta would be just an opponent and would remain in the tank until all three experiments were complete. The behaviors were quantified by giving each behavior a point value based on its level of aggressiveness before the experiment was started. The point values for the behaviors are as followed; pelvic fin flickering – 1, tail flashing – 2, red maning – 3, and darting – 4. After the behaviors were observed, the fish were allowed to rest for five minutes with the opaque partition back in place. The partition would be removed again with a clear partition remaining and the fish being observed would be given the normal amount of food for a daily feeding. The behaviors of the fish with food would be observed for five minutes and recorded with point values. The fish whose behaviors were observed will be replaced with a new male betta fish after each experiment. This will be repeated for three trials. 


Results:
After collecting the data from the three trials, a paired t-test was performed. The paired t-test, when comparing the aggressive behaviors before and after food, gave a p-value of 0.015. Each of the three-male fish observed showed a significant decrease in the amount of aggressive behavior when presented with food. This p-value shows that the food did have an effect on the amount of aggressive behavior displayed by betta fish. Figure 1, 2, and 3 display the amount of aggressive behavior when the male betta fish are alone, in the presence of another, and in the presence of another while having access to food. 
Figure 1. This graph displays the amount of aggressive behaviors when the first male betta fish experienced no stimulus, was able to see another male opponent, and able to see another opponent in the presence of food. The point values for aggressive behavior for each of the stimuli are as followed; control – 8 points, see the other male betta – 46 points, and food stimulus – 7 points. 


Discussion:
In this experiment, the hypothesis was supported. It was expected that the food stimulus would cause a decrease in the amount of aggressive behavior in male betta fish because they would focus on the extra resources available to them rather than an opponent which would expend resources. The p-value for the paired t-test showed that the data was statistically significant and displayed that there was a difference between the aggressive behaviors before and after food. After this experiment, other things that might be explored is the effect of seeing food but not being able to reach it or the aggressive behaviors in females when presented with food. For the experiment with the females, the same procedure would be repeated, but with females instead of males. For the experiment where the fish cannot reach the food, the same procedure will be repeated with the exception of putting the food where they can see it but not reach it.
