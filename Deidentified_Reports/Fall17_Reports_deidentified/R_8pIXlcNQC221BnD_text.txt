Title: Exercise and its effect on Specific Metabolic rate in the Procambarus spp.

Abstract:
Metabolic functions occur in animals in order to maintain homeostasis. When an animal or human achieve homeostatic imbalances our metabolic functions fire in order to return to baseline. Respiration is the homeostatic function we are observing in the Procambarus spp. When the crayfish are placed in stressful situations it has to find another way to produce energy or increase its metabolic function. It was hypothesized that the addition of exercise would cause an increase in specific metabolic rate (SMR) for the crayfish when compared to the control situation. This prediction is based on what is known about homeostatic regulation. To test the hypothesis three crayfish were used and at first, they were tested as a control. After control testing, they were forced to exercise for two minutes and then placed back in the testing chamber. The hypothesis was rejected after testing due to a high P-value of 0.578602. After testing was concluded it was observed that exercise did not produce a statistically significant effect on the specific metabolic rate.

Introduction:
In this lab, we will be testing the effects on respiration rate when exercise is done and its effects on the metabolic rate in the crayfish. Metabolic processes are those in which energy is transferred directly and can be measured as such. [Johnson: 2017] Metabolic rate is described as the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass per unit of time.  Many species similar to the Procambarus spp. are able to respire anaerobically when placed in stressful conditions. [Newell: 1973] This anaerobic respiration is called glycolysis which is the conversion of glucose into energy. Unlike a Human a Crayfish, also called the Procambarus spp., is an ectotherm. Being an ectotherm means that they use less food during respiration and that they can go long periods of time without eating. We are using the Procambarus spp. because it is easy to measure their oxygen consumption, easy to visually observe, and they are easy to force to exercise. In our experiment, we will be testing the rate at which a crayfish metabolizes when it is forced to exercise versus when it is at resting rate and at a constant temperature. In this experiment, we will monitor the oxygen consumption using a dissolved oxygen meter. Using that data, we will be able to calculate change in oxygen consumption under the exercise as well as the control group and in turn calculate the crayfish’s specific metabolic rate (SMR). We hypothesize that when forcing the crayfish to exercise we will see an increase in respiration rates and in turn an increase in metabolic rate.

Materials and Methods:
In the beginning of the experiment, we received three Procambarus spp. from their respective holding tanks. We began by weighing each of them and preparing them for testing. To prepare we first had to saturate the water in which we are using with a respirator so that the water is fully oxygenated. We then filled our testing tank with the saturated water that was held at a constant temperature. The first crayfish was then placed in the tank and sealed off with the oxygen saturation testing probe to begin the control experiment. Once sealed inside the tank we started a timer for twenty minutes and recorded the oxygen saturation level at the start time, after five, ten, fifteen, and twenty minutes. Once the twenty minutes has elapsed the crayfish is removed from the container, the water volume used is measured, and then we place the crayfish in the exercise testing container. To begin the exercise condition, we poke around the crayfish for a total of two minutes and force him to run around the container until exhaustion has occurred. Once tired the crayfish goes back into the oxygen saturation testing container with freshly saturated water. Again, the crayfish’s oxygen consumption is marked at the start and the same increments as in the control condition. Crayfish numbers two and three also go through the same testing as did crayfish one. With our results, we used the paired T-test, which is most useful for us because we are comparing two conditions for the same population.  

Results:
The three Procambarus spp.’s showed no direct correlation of whether or not exercise caused a change in respiration rate. Crayfish one showed an SMR value of 0.0051 which is a 0.00341 mgO2(g•min)-1increase from the control rate. [figure2] Crayfish two showed the opposite effect with the control achieving a higher SMR value than the exercise treatment by 0.00044. Crayfish 3 also had a higher control SMR value by 0.00044 mgO2(g•min)-1 than its test with the exercise treatment. The paired t-test in our experiment showed a p-value of 0.578602, a t-value of 0.657143, 2 degrees of freedom, and a pooled variance of 0.002835476.

Discussion:
In our experiment, we did not have statistically significant results between the control and the exercise treatment. Our P-value of 0.578602, small degrees of freedom and the overlap in the error bars confirmed that we had results that were not statistically significant. Having results that were not statistically significant fails to reject our null hypothesis and therefore proves that the alternative hypothesis is false. The three-control crayfish we tested had an average SMR value of 0.00451 mgO2(g•min)-1. Post-exercise we can see an inconsistent increase in the mean by a mere 0.000843333 mgO2(g•min)-1. [figure1] When we added the exercise component to the crayfish it appears that crayfish number two and three resulted to anaerobic respiration which has been documented by the Oxford academic article [Newell: 1973]. On the other hand, it appears crayfish number one stuck with increasing respiration rate instead of resulting to anaerobic respiration or glycolysis. This would explain why crayfish number one had a much higher SMR than that of numbers two and three. Another reason for number two and three to no have had an increased SMR value was that during parts of their exercise time they decided to hunker down and try to fight off our poking device resulting in them not being as exhausted as number one who ran the entirety of his experimentation time. I believe that this experiment needs more testing with a higher test population of all about the same size and weight. Since this is a paired samples t-test we automatically have higher internal validity than that of an independent samples t-test, but with the larger population, it can cause an increase in effect size as well as a smaller p-value. [Zimmerman: 1973] With our testing, again we failed to reject the null and therefore have to state that our experimental mean is not statistically significant enough to say it had an effect on SMR values.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 is a graph representing the average specific metabolic rates on crayfish when going through both the control and the exercise conditions. The green bar represents after exercise and the red bar is representative of the control SMR. The error bars above represent the pooled standard deviation (0.002835476) for both the control and exercise condition.

Figure 2 is a bar graph showing the SMR values for all three subjects in our experiment. As seen above you can clearly see that there is not a consistent correlation between the exercise condition when compared to the control. Again, in figure 2 the green bar is representative of the exercise condition and the red bar represents the control.
