Title: Allocation of Potassium in Avena sativa (Oat Plants)

Abstract:
When differing potassium levels are in the soil, plant allocation will take effect to alter the root:shoot ratio. An excess amount of potassium added to the soil will result in an overall reduced plant growth, while enriching the soil with a low amount of potassium will enhance the overall oat (Avena sativa) plant growth. Over a period of 3 weeks, we added 25 mL KCl to 3 high KCl bins, 5 mL KCl to 3 low KCl bins, no KCl to the 3 control bins. Once testing was done, we determined the root:shoot ratio based on weight and height for each group. Using a one tailed t-test, the mean of our control group was found to be statistically significantly different than the experimental group. The high KCl groups failed to grow shoots, so they were ignored for the remainder of the experiment. The hypothesis was rejected because the R:S ratio based on both weight and length was smaller for the control than for the oats with low potassium. This could be due to the potassium overcrowding the roots and preventing them from water access, causing the roots to grow in order to reach water. In addition, this would explain the lack of shoot growth because of the limited access to water.

Introduction:
Plants distribute and use their limited resources in different ways when exposed to differing environmental conditions. Potassium functions at the cell level of the plant, contributing to the osmotic potential and the electrochemical process of the cytoplasm (Spalding. 1999). Potassium supplies the plant with activation enzymes involved in photosynthesis and phloem and xylem transport. By being a main component in photosynthesis and phloem and xylem transport, plants are able to grow. Photosynthesis provides the molecules needed for plant growth, while the phloem and xylem transport growth regulators throughout the plant (Yilmaz, Kahraman, Ozgur, Uzilday, Turkan, Ozturk. 2017). Plant growth due to potassium is important because in low potassium soil, adding a potassium fertilizer can be important to enhance plant growth. In addition, it is useful for farmers to grow larger plants. Due to potassium being essential for plant growth, we hypothesized that enriching the soil with a low amount of potassium would enhance the overall plant growth and result in a smaller root:shoot ratio. However, we also hypothesized that an excess amount of potassium added to the soil would result in an overall reduced plant growth. The plants used were oats (Avena sativa) because they are easily accessible and easy to measure the length and weight of the roots and shoots.

Materials and Methods:
We used three groups of 3 pots with oat plants. Group 1 was the control, Group 2 was the experimental with low KCl, and Group 3 was the experimental with high KCl. The control group had 3 pots (Control 1, Control 2, and Control 3) and each experimental group had 3 pots (Low KCl 1, Low KCl 2, and Low KCl 3 and High KCl 1, High KCl 2, and High KCl 3). 
We filled 9 pots with vermiculite to the rim. We then soaked the soil with water. Then we added more vermiculite and 50 mL of Miracle Gro. We got an abundance of oat seeds and planted them in the dirt of each of the 9 pots. Then we pushed the seeds down in the soil with our fingers. We separated 3 pots for the control, 3 pots for the experimental with low KCl, and 3 pots for the experimental with high KCl. We labeled as Control 1, Control 2, and Control 3, and as Low KCl 1, Low KCl 2, and Low KCl 3 (Repeated with High KCl). Then we added 5 mL of KCl to the 3 low KCl experimental pots and we added 25 mL KCl to the 3 high KCl experimental pots. We watered both experimental and control groups with 50 mL water and placed them in black tray in the greenhouse for further procedure. After two days, we added more 5 mL KCl and 25 mL KCl to the low and high experimental groups and none to the control group. We added 50 mL water to the both experimental groups and the control group. We kept repeating this every two days over a period of 2 weeks. Each lab partner alternated their day of the week to add KCl and to water the oat plants. When injection was finalized, we harvested 3 plants from each of the 9 pots (3 plants from low KCl pot 1, 3 plants from low KCl pot 2, and 3 plants from low KCl pot 3), as well as 3 from the high KCl pots and 3 from the control pots. We massed the weight of the whole plants, the weight of the roots, and the weight of the shoots. We averaged the three plants’ weights for roots, shoots, and whole plants in both the experimental and the control groups. Then, we measured the max length from three plants of the roots and the shoots for each control and experimental groups. We used this data to determine the root:shoot weight ratio and the root:shoot length ratio. We used a one-sample t-test to determine the p-value of the control and experimental groups. 

Results:
The High KCl groups failed to grow shoots, so they were disregarded for the remainder of the experiment. The Low KCl groups had extensive roots that wrapped around the bottom of the soil (Figure 1). The experimental R:S ratio for weight was more than twice as big than the control group R:S ratio for weight (Figure 2). In contrast, the experimental R:S ratio for length was almost twice as big as the control group R:S ratio for length (Figure 3). The experimental R:S ratio for overall growth was bigger than the control R:S Ratio (Figure 4). For the control oats, the average weight of the whole plant, roots, and shoots was 0.477 g, 0.107 g, and 0.33 g, respectively. The determined R:S ratio was 0.35 (Table 1). For the experimental oats, the average weight of the whole plant, roots, and shoots was 0.497 g, 0.207 g, and 0.243 g, respectively. The determined R:S ratio was 0.867 (Table 2). For the control oats, the average max root length was 150.00 mm, while the average max shoot length was 210.33 mm (Table 1). For the experimental oats, the average max root length was 183.67 mm and the average max shoot length was 143.33 mm (Table 2). Using a one tailed t-test, we found the mean of our control group to be statistically significantly different than the experimental group (t-stat = 1.20, df = 4, P = 0.426). 

Discussion:
It is evident that the R:S ratio based on both weight and length was smaller for the control than for the oats with low potassium, rejecting our hypothesis (Table 1 and Table 2). Initially, it was thought that because potassium was so accessible in the experimental group, the roots would not need to grow much in order to gain the nutrients and the shoots would grow larger, resulting in a smaller root:shoot ratio. However, the data shown above in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4 shows the contrary, that the root:shoot ratio is larger after adding potassium. An explanation for this is that the potassium overcrowded the roots, preventing them from accessing water. This would cause the roots to grow in order to reach water, as seen in Figure 1. This would also explain the lack of shoot growth because they could not access water appropriately. In an experiment done by Siddiqi, Glass, Hsiao, and Minjas, “Genetic differences among wild oat lines in potassium uptake and growth in relation to potassium supply”, a similar approach is taken, but with two different species of plants. They used oats and barley and compared the growth while in competition with each other for potassium. They conducted experiments in both low and high levels of potassium and found that the growth of barley and oats was critically reduced by the competition for potassium (Siddiqi, Glass, Hsiao, and Minjas. 1987). Similarly, in our experiment, plant growth was reduced in the presence of potassium. Our experiment could be improved if we changed the plant source to like what is done in Siddiqi, Glass, Hsiao, and Minjas’ experiment. Barley may allocate potassium in different ways than oats do. Another alteration could be using a different mineral such as calcium or magnesium, which are important for plant growth as well. This could be useful because oats may allocate magnesium differently than they did with potassium. In different environmental situations, differing plants respond in unique ways that are essential to the plants survival mechanisms. It is important to understand how different minerals affect plants because it can be useful for farming techniques and the farming industry in general.
