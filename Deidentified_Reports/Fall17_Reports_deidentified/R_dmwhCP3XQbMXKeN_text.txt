Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Rania pipiens Frog Leg Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to observe if an injection of caffeine influences the overall contraction of a Rania pipiens frog leg gastrocnemus muscle. We hypothesized that the injection of caffeine would increase overall muscle amplitude of contraction of the leg muscle as more calcium would be released. To trigger a muscle contraction, an action potential is sent down the axon to the axon terminal where neurotransmitters are then released into the synaptic cleft. Next, the neurotransmitters that were released bind to the receptors on a nearby cell of the muscle. The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium into the sarcoplasm which triggers the contraction of the muscle after a signal is then sent from the receptors down the t-tubules. The injection of caffeine has been observed to induce greater muscle contraction because higher levels of calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Using electrode stimulus on the gastrocnemus muscle, a myogram was created to determine the contractile, latent, and relaxation phases as well as the average amplitude of contraction. The P values calculated using a paired t_test for the amplitude of contraction, the contractile phase, and the threshold through the sciatic nerve were determined to be not significent. 


Introduction:
The purpose of this study is to observe if an injection of caffeine influences the overall contraction of a frog leg muscle. This process will portray how an action potential from a motor neuron stimulates contraction of a muscle. An action potential is sent down the axon to the axon terminal where neurotransmitters are then released into the synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the nearby cell of the muscle. A signal is then sent from the receptors down the t-tubules where the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium which triggers the contraction of the muscle. Since the action potentials will not be generated by neurons, a stimulator box will be used to send an electrical stimulus to the frog leg muscle. A myogram, a graphic representation of the muscular contractions, will then be used once the threshold and maximum contraction has been determined. The myogram will be used to find the lengths of the contraction phase. The muscles will be tested at 1V five times. However, we will be testing the contraction of the frog leg muscle after an injection of caffeine has been administered. A study, similar to the one we will conduct tested the relationship between caffeine contracture of muscle and the effect caffeine has on that muscle (Weber: 1968). It was concluded that caffeine ultimately led to more calcium release, thus resulting in larger contractions of the leg muscle. This was due to a greater amount of calcium being released. The controlll group will be tested first, as an electrical stimulus on the gastrocnemus will be administered. Based off the Weber study, we hypothesize that as a result injecting caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog legs, higher contraction levels will be observed as more calcium will be released. 


Materials and Method:
Each group will be given three frog legs which the skin will be removed from the legs first, careful not to damage the muscle.  The gastrocnemus muscle will be separated from the connective tissue. The achilles tendon will be cut where it attaches to the foot of the frog. Next, a small loop with thread will be formed, and will be tightened around the achilles tendon. Another loop at the opposite end of the thread will be made, and will be attached to the hook on the computer software equipment. The inner thigh muscles will be separated. The sciatic nerve (white string-like appearance) will be released from its connective tissue. This process will be done carefully and meticulously to not let it come in contact with metal. Next, the frog leg will be pinned down to the dissecting tray with as many pins needed to keep it from moving. The thread will be attached to the hook on the force probe, bringing the gastrocnemus to about 90° vertically. The thread will be tied rather tightly, but some slack will be kept. Next, the sciatic nerve will be attached to the nerve probe so the nerve comes into contact with the two electrodes. The voltage stimulus will be set to 0 volts. To record, the record button will be clicked to stimulate the muscle. There should be no contraction. Next, the voltage stimulus will be set to 1 volt. Click record to stimulate the muscle. Once the twitch has been performed, the recording will be stopped. 
 
To test the gastrocnemus muscles without caffeine, the voltage stimulus steps will be repeated four more times (five total) with 1 volt stimulation. Record these amplitude of contractions as “tested without caffeine” (mV). This will be the controlll group. Frog Ringer’s solution will be applied to the leg to keep it moist frequently. Using a needle and syringe, 0.1 Ml of caffeine will be loaded to the middle of the gastrocnemus muscle. Next, the voltage stimulus parameter will be repeated at 1 volt five times after the injection of caffeine. The data collected will be recorded under the “tested with caffeine” group. Once the fifth contraction has been reached following the addition of the caffeine, procedure will be repeated with a different leg. This procedure will be repeated for three separate trials.
The controlll group will be tested first for each of the trials. Testing the frog legs with the injection of caffeine first will result in inadequate data as the caffeine will already be present in the muscle. Essentially, there would be no experimental group.  


Results:
Average amplitude of contraction (mV) for Rania pipiens frog legs with treatment of caffeine and without the treatment. Three trials were ran, one trial per each leg. The error bars on both graphs represent the standard deviation. A T-test was used to calculate the P-value (0.043). The data is significent as the P-value is smaller than 0.05.

	The average amplitude of contraction for the controlll group was 1.321mV±0.213 and 1.713mV±0.271 for the experimental group. The tests were conducted on the same legs, the controlll group tested first. Both groups were tested at 1V of electric current five times for data collection. The data collected was averaged as seen in Figure 1. The average amplitude observed in the treatment group was greater than the average amplitude observed in the controlll group. 


Discussion:
In the end, the data collected from the experiment was determined to be statistically significent as the calculated P-value using a paired T-test was 0.043. The results supported our original hypothesis that the gastrocnemus muscle treated with caffeine would experience a greater amplitude of contraction than the gastrocnemus muscle without treatment as observed in Figure 1. This was also observed in the Weber, 1968 study. The administration of caffeine has been seen to increase the amplitude of contraction in muscles. Muscles treated with caffeine have been seen to contract at higher amplitudes as a result of a larger release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The more calcium released, the more powerful the muscle contraction. 
One result that was found interesting was that the third leg treated with caffeine experienced a value decrease. This could have been a result of the muscle running out of available ATP or calcium, thus the muscle fatigued rather quickly. We believed this fatigue was due to chemically induced muscle tetany, as calcium levels were low.
In a further study, we would want to obtain frog legs that would be larger and that would not fatigue quickly ideally. We want to also test other chemicals that would stimulate the release of calcium and then compare the average amplitude of contraction with the values from this study (caffeine). Also, the method of administering the caffeine could be different, maybe using the method of topical rub. Maybe there is a certain method of application that works better than direct injection. Lastly, it would be interesting to see what effects caffeine would have on muscle contraction if it was administered in a higher amount, maybe 0.3 Ml.
