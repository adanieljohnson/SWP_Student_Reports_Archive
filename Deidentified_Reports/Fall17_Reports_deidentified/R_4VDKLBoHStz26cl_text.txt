Title: Effects of Caffeine on the Contraction of Rania pipens Muscle

Abstract:
This lab was conducted to determine the effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens.  An electric current was sent through the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg in order to generate a twitch.  The amplitude of the twitch was then recorded five time with and without caffeine for each leg.  Through comparison of the average force generated by the muscle contraction before and after the injection of caffeine, the injection of caffeine caused an increase in the absolute amplitude of the muscle contraction.  This increase in amplitude was statistically significent with a p_value of .038.  Since the p_value was less than .05 the difference in the twitch amplitude was statistically significent. 


Introduction:
When a muscle contracts, an action potential is sent from a motor neuron to a muscle cell. The motor neuron releases acetyl choline into the neuromuscular junction, creating an action potential across the muscle cell.  This results in calcium ions (Ca2+) being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ultimately resulting in the muscle contracting.  While it can be extremely difficult to measure the changes in acetyl choline or calcium ions, a myogram can be used to measure the force generated over a period of time.  As a result, the muscle contraction shows up as a force generated.  The properties of caffeine allow it to affect many human tissues: central nervous system, cardiovascular system and smooth as well as, skeletal muscle [Cafarelli, Kalmar: 1999].  Additionally, caffeine induces sustained contraction in skeletal and smooth muscle of frogs, specifically Rania trigrina [Kumar et. all: 2015].  As a result, it is possible the same reaction could occur in the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipens, also known as the Northern leopard frog.  This specific species of frog is used because it is a good muscle model and easily accessible. The gastrocnemus muscle has a large amount of fast twitch fibers that will undergo greater contractions because a frog uses its legs to jump great distances often.  Caffeine also propagates the release of calcium which ultimately causes muscle contractions.  This sustained muscle contraction could lead to an increase in the absolute twitch amplitude of the muscle contraction.  


Materials and Method:
First de-skin the leg of Rania pipiens.  The leg then needs to be suspended perpendicular to the lab table while the leg is stabilized.  Then insert the electrodes into the gastrocnemus muscle.  Then stimulate the muscle for five pulses at one hertz with a width of five and then record the subsequent data.  Inject a solution of .1 Ml of 200mM of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle.  Then repeat the previous two steps for the same frog leg with injected caffeine.  After, repeat all previous step with an additional two frog legs.  The myogram is connected to a computer that uses the program IWorkx.  This program allows the experimenter to controlll the number of shocks given while recording the strength of the muscle contraction.  Each individual frog legs acts as its own controlll before injecting caffeine.  This is due to the fact that the comparison is comparing the amplitudes between before and after the injection of the caffeine. After the experiment, conduct a single tailed paired t_test.  The test is single tiered as the hypothesis state that there would be an increase in the amplitude rather than a change in the amplitude. 


Results:
Figure 1: An average in the twitch amplitudes between the controlll and experimental groups with a sample size of three legs of Rania pipiens.  The mean of the controlll group was an amplitude of .9515 mV while the mean of the experimental group was 2.0615 mV.  The standard deviation for the average of the controlll group is 0.874506861 and the standard deviation for the average of the experimental group is 0.514080976. 


Discussion:
Our alternate hypothesis was supported because our statistics showed a p_value of .038.  The p_value of .038 is less than the alpha value of .05 showing that there the change in the averages of amplitudes between each leg was most likely not due to chance.  As shown in figure 1 there was a greater and one hundred percent increase between the averages of the experimental and controlll groups.  Since caffeine causes sustained muscle contractions in frog muscles, it is possible that the muscle contraction due to the injection of caffeine in combination with the shock created a much greater amplitude [Kumar et. al: 2015].  Caffeine also propagates the release of calcium ions which cause muscle contraction.  It would be interesting to study how different amounts of caffeine would affect the amplitude of the muscle.  During this experiment, the muscle immediately tensed up when injected but would less caffeine cause the same or a different reaction. Since the second leg did not properly absorb the caffeine solution, this could have caused a decrease in the experimental amplitude, skewing the date towards not being statistically significent.  In order to improve this experiment a greater number of frog legs should be used as the sample size was only three legs which is a small amount.  Additionally, it would be interesting to see how greater concentrations of caffeine would cause a greater contraction and therefore a greater amplitude or if a lesser concentration of caffeine would cause the same reaction because our second frog leg had less caffeine than the others but still had a significent increase in the controlll and experimental groups.
