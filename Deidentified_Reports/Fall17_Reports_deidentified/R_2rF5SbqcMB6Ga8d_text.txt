Title: Effects of 1 mM Lanthanum Chloride on Twitch Threshold and Muscular Response in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog Leg

Abstract:
The objective of this investigation was to determine whether Lanthanum Chloride would decrease the strength of muscle contraction in a Rania Pipien’s gastrocnemus muscle. The hypothesis for the experiment is that if we would inject 1mM Lanthanum Chloride, then the twitch threshold will be higher and the twitch amplitude will be significently weaker. This was proposed because Lanthanum Chloride is a calcium channel blocker and if Ca2+ is not present then the muscle will not contract since it is a necessary mechanism in the muscles ability to shorten. The procedure for this experiment requires the frog leg to be immobilized, and then the sciatic nerve is stimulated with the iWorx software. In addition, we found that there was no statistical difference in the twitch threshold because the p_value of .205 was not less than the alpha of .05. Similarly, there was no statistical significance in stimulus response because the p_value of .838 was not less than the alpha of .05. Lastly, some extensions of the experiment (trying stronger concentrations of Lanthanum Chloride) should be made to truly determine the relationship testing between Lanthanum Chloride and twitch threshold because the results did show some difference between the two groups.  

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to quickly sense and respond to their internal and external environments. This ability for animals to have rapid responses in their neuromuscular controlll is due to a few key steps in the excitation-contraction coupling process. First, action potentials traveling along an axon within a nerve arrive at the neuromuscular junction. Next, depolarization of the neuron causes release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal and ACh diffuses to the muscle fiber where it binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. Then the action potential spreads throughout the length of the fiber, stimulating the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Afterwards, the release of Ca2+ activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber. Myosin filaments use energy from ATP cleavage to walk along actin filaments. The movement of millions of myosin heads over and over causes the entire myofibers to shorten. Lastly, a re-uptake of Ca+2 back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum allows the muscle fiber to relax once again. In an experiment, investigators dealt with this process and looked at the effects of Lanthanum on intestinal smooth muscle contraction. Smooth muscles were likely chosen in their experiment because they are non-striated and involuntary muscles that have whole muscle contractions; conversely, skeletal muscles are striated, voluntary, and do not have whole muscle contractions which makes them less favorable for analyzing full muscle contraction. They found that Lanthanum inhibited muscle contraction by blocking Ca2+ which prevents the muscle from shortening [Weiss and Goodman: 1969]. With this being said, we wanted to create an experiment isolating the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens’s leg and see what effects Lanthanum Chloride had on muscle contraction. The Rania pipiens, a northern leopard frog, was selected because its unique physical properties; for instance, its sciatic nerve is extremely easy to isolate, and its muscle can remain in vitro for a long period of time without deteriorating. Our hypothesis for the experiment is that if we would inject 1mM of our independent variable Lanthanum Chloride into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens’s leg, then the dependent variable twitch threshold will be significently higher and other dependent variable twitch amplitude will be significently weaker. We predict this to happen because Lanthanum Chloride in the muscle will act as a calcium channel blocker in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and if Ca2+ is not present then the muscle will be lacking its contractile apparatus, which will prevent the muscle from contracting. 


Materials and Method:
: To set up this experiment, acquire a Rania pipien’s leg and peel off the skin. Next, expose the inside of the thigh by pulling on opposite sides of the cleft. This should expose the white sciatic nerve and its accompanying blood vessels. Gently separate the sciatic nerve from the rest of the muscles. Then detach the gastrocnemus muscle from the Tibialis anterior by moving the scissor back and forth between the muscles to clear the connective tissue, and then cut towards the toe detaching the gastrocnemus muscle and keeping the Achilles tendon. Now cut a piece of string approximately 20 cm long; afterwards, tie a knot around the Achilles tendon so that there is loop that can suspend the leg. Hang the leg on the ring stand so that the frog leg is sitting on the tray. Subsequently, pin across the tibia bone and Tibialis anterior to immobilize the leg. After, adjust the string to a 90-degree angle using the precision tension mechanism. Now that the setup is complete the stimulus amplitude can be applied to the nerve. Using the iWorx software on the computer, apply a stimulus amplitude of 0.0V and go up in 0.1 V increments until there is a response. Once a response was observed, we stimulated nerve with decreasing intervals of 0.01V. The lowest stimulus amplitude that yielded a response was the twitch threshold. Record the value that the twitch threshold produces this is the strength of response. After recording this information, inject the frog leg with .2 Ml of 1mM Lanthanum Chloride using a syringe and wait 10 minutes. After waiting 10 minutes, repeat the stimulation process and collect the twitch threshold and strength of response for the treatment frog leg. Repeat this setup and stimulation process for two more frog legs and record the data. Also, a one tailed paired t_test with a directionality saying that the controlll would be significently less than the experimental was used to compare the twitch thresholds of the controlll frog legs and the twitch thresholds of the treatment frog legs. Lastly, a second one tailed paired t_test with a directionality saying that the controlll would be significently stronger than the experimental was used to compare the strength of response (twitch amplitude) of the controlll and treatment groups.

Results:
The first graph shows the averages of the twitch amplitudes for the controlll and experimental groups. The controlll had a much smaller average twitch amplitude at .137V compared to the experimental average twitch amplitude of .206V. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the controlll was .068V and experimental standard deviation was .12V which means the controlll had less variation in its data points then the experimental group. However, even though there was a difference in mean twitch threshold it was no statistically significent because the p_value of .205 was not less than the alpha of .05. The second graph shows the averages of the stimulus amplitude (response) for the controlll and experimental groups. The controlll had a greater stimulus response of .415V compared to the experimental average of stimulus response of .397V. In addition, the standard deviations of the two groups were .412V for the controlll and .520 for the experimental, which means the data points for the controlll has less variation. However, even though there was a difference in mean twitch threshold it was not statistically significent because the p_value of .838 was not less than the alpha of .05.


Discussion:
After analyzing the results, our hypothesis that if we would inject 1mM of our independent variable Lanthanum Chloride, then the dependent variable twitch threshold will be higher and the other dependent variable twitch amplitude will be significently weaker cannot be statistically supported. The results of the twitch threshold being lower for the controlll and the stimulus response being greater for the controlll both fit our prediction, but the difference was not great enough to yield significance. Specifically dealing with twitch threshold, the fact that it did show some difference between the two groups means that the Lanthanum Chloride blocked some of the calcium channels making it more difficult for an action potential to be produced and a contraction to ensue. In addition, with our sample size only being three and their responses to stimulation drastically varying it is tough to tell if there is truly no significent relationship between Lanthanum Chloride and muscle contraction. However, the results that emerged regarding stimulus response not varying significently between the two groups makes sense. Moreover, an action potential is outlined as an all-or-nothing event so if it hits threshold and transpires the strength of the response should be practically the same every time. Our results differ from the study performed by Weiss and Goodman because they found that Lanthanum inhibited muscle contraction by blocking Ca2+ which prevents the muscle from shortening [Weiss and Goodman 1969]; conversely, our results didn’t show any significent difference in twitch threshold or stimulus response when Lanthanum Chloride was present. Some possibilities of why are results differ from their study are: they used a stronger concentration of Lanthanum (1.8 mM), and they measured intestinal smooth muscle contraction of a guinea pig which is considerably different from our test subject and muscle of choice. In the future, we should perform more trials of this experiment testing different concentrations of Lanthanum Chloride to get a better understanding to see if this calcium blocker really results in significently weaker contractions.
