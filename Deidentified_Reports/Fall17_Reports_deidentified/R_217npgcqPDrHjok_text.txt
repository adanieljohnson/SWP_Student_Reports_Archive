Title: Slime Mold Growth Does Not Depend on Inhibitor Concentration

Abstract:
Uncleanliness regularly results in lots of preventable illnesses such as bacterial or viral infections.  Scientists regularly need to develop new cleaning agents in order to remain effective in inhibiting growth of the harmful organisms.  In this experiment, we tested whether or not different concentrations of lidocaine results in different amounts of growth inhibition.  Lidocaine is used as a cleaning agent because lidocaine inhibits the growth of many different organisms by regulating the function of sodium ion channels in nerve cells.  After the experiment that tested the growth of slime mold in lidocaine-soaked PDA dishes of different concentrations, a one-way ANOVA test with an alpha value of 0.05 was applied to the data that came from the 3 test groups (1.25 mM, 0.625 mM, and 0.3125 mM).  The statistical test resulted in an insignificent p_value of 0.067.  We concluded that the growth of physarum is not dependent on the concentration of the inhibitor lidocaine.  Further experiments should be conducted to determine which inhibitors or which inhibitor combinations are more effective over a long duration of usage.  There has been an increasing issue with bacteria building up a tolerance/immunity to our chemical agents, so scientists need to be prepared to adjust cleaning agent

Introduction:
There are many different types of bacteria and molds.  Not all of the species are toxic, but it is important to prevent the growth of the hazardous organisms.  A good understanding of how concentrations of inhibiting chemicals effect the overall growth of the target organism would help prevent many unnecessary illnesses such as viral and bacterial infections.  Pharmaceutical companies can use this information to formulate the most cost-effective cleaning products. In this experiment we utilized the test organism Slime Mold (Physarum).  Slime Mold is a good model organism because it shares many physiological properties with its harmful relatives of the mold family such as black mold. [USDHS: 2017].  Slime Mold is known to seek out food sources while avoiding chemicals that it is averse to, as a result its amount of growth is inversely proportional to its inhibition by a chemical. [Konijin: 1969].  We will be testing the effect of different concentrations of Lidocaine on the growth of Slime Mold.  Lidocaine is known to inhibit slime mold growth by preforming nerve blocks.  In order to have an action potential the electrochemical gradient must be built up via the sodium-ion channels.  Lidocaine specifically acts on nerve cells by inhibiting the sodium channels from passing sodium ions across the membrane, thus preventing an electrical signal from firing [USNLM: 2017].  We hypothesis that as the concentrations of the lidocaine decrease, so will the solution's ability to inhibit the Slime Mold's growth.

Materials and Method:
First, we created 3 different lidocaine solutions by diluting an original micro-tube of 25 mM lidocaine solution.  The three different concentrations of Lidocaine solutions used were 1.25 mM, 0.625 mM, and 0.3125 mM.  Next a total of 10 petri-dishes were made, 3 dishes for each of the test groups and one controlll group.  Each dish was made by soaking the original potato agar dishes in 5 Ml of solution for 10 minutes then draining the excess.  After each of the dishes were made, a cubic centimeter chunk of slime mold agar was placed in the centers of each agar in a precut cubic hole.  Each of the dishes were then wrapped in aluminum foil to eliminate light and placed in a warm incubator (25 degrees C) for 24 hours.  The amount of growth was then estimated using an online program called ImageJ.  ImageJ calculates the square area of growth by taking a picture and outlining the perimeter of the mold. The growth data was then analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test.



Results:
The one-way ANOVA test resulted in a non-significent p_value of 0.067.  There was a trend in the data that showed that any of the concentrations of lidocaine resulted in a noticeably lower amount of growth than in the controlll group (1.25 mM: 0.00635 cm2, 0.625 mM: 0.0239 cm2, 0.3125 mM: 0.00592 cm2).  There was a peak in the experimental groups in the 0.625 mM Lidocaine.



Discussion:
Based on the p_value of 0.067, we can conclude that there is no correlation between concentration of the lidocaine inhibitor and the growth of the Physarum.  We saw the trend that any of the three concentrations of lidocaine resulted in a lower amount of growth than that of the controlll. The amount of slime mold growth was noticeably lowered by all of the experimental concentrations.  This trend can be explained because the sodium-ion channels are highly affinitive to localized anesthetics because of nature of the drugs binding site and the charge.  Even low concentrations are able to bind to the binding sites and effectively act on the channels.  [Fozzard: 2011].  Future tests could include even lower concentrations of lidocaine to find the effectivity threshold that is often present in chemotaxis effecting chemicals [Bonner: 1977]. Pharmaceutical companies can use the results from this experiment to focus on using specific inhibitors or combinations rather than focusing on concentrations.  When making a cleaning product, chemists should focus on testing other chemicals that inhibit other pathways that can possibly be used in tandem with one another.   Combinations of inhibitors are often used in cleaning agents in order to maximize the inhibition rate and avoid a buildup of resistance.  Populations of organisms can adapt by developing tolerances to specific inhibitors.  By adding a mixture, the rate of adaptation significently lowers [Bushway: 1976]. Although this experiment resulted in a result that showed no correlation between lidocaine concentration and inhibition effectivity, other inhibitors should be tested.
