Title: Green Light May be Just as Effective as Red and Blue Light at Increasing the Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinach (Spinacia oleraca).

Abstract:
Plants have a unique system for creating glucose as a source of energy for cellular function called photosynthesis, which occurs in the chloroplast of the cell.  Many factors affect photosynthesis, the objective of this report was to determine how different light wavelengths play a role.  Chloroplasts were obtained from spinach leaves (Spinacia oleraca) and were used to measure the change in absorbance of 3 samples in a controlll group (white light), and experimental groups (red, green, blue, and black light).  Based on other studies, such as Muneer et al’s claim that biomass production decreases under green light, we hypothesized that green light would show a decrease in photosynthetic rate, while red and blue might show an increase; we did not know what would happen in black light.  However, contrary to our hypothesis and our previous research, our data demonstrated that green light along with red and blue light was more effective than white light, and black light was less effective.  While this was unusual, there are certain factors that could explain it, such as exposure to other wavelengths of light and unequal light intensity.  

Introduction:
	Energy powers every cell in an organism and drive the organism’s daily functions. Heterotrophs, such as animals, receive energy in the form of glucose when they consume other organisms.  Autotrophs like plants, on the other hand, create their own glucose using carbon dioxide, water, and light from the sun in a process known as photosynthesis.  In plants, photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast of the cell, an organelle that animal cells lack.  It uses a series of chemical reactions called the light independent reaction and the light dependent reaction to harness the suns energy and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.  The glucose is then used in cellular respiration to create energy to power the cell and for plant growth [Johnson: 2017].
	Many factors affect the rate of photosynthesis in plants, including but not limited to temperature, soil pH and salinity, amount of light, and carbon dioxide availability.  The purpose of this lab was to examine the effect of different light wavelengths on photosynthesis in spinach leaves (Spinacia oleraca) over a period of 30 minutes.  Spinach was an ideal organism to use because it has a high concentration of chloroplasts in its leaves, which is favorable for photosynthesis.  In 2014, Muneer et al found that rate of photosynthesis and biomass production in lettuce leaves was increased under blue lights, but decreased under green lights [Muneer: 2014].  A different study by Folta et al claimed that when it comes to plant processes, green light generally has the opposite effect of red and blue light, so while red and blue light may increase the rate of photosynthesis, green light decreases it [Folta: 2007].  By determining which wavelength best promotes photosynthesis, we also determine which wavelength best promotes plant growth.  This information would be ground-breaking in the world of agriculture; farmers could use certain types of light on the plants in their greenhouses to encourage faster plant growth and flowering, thereby producing larger crop yields faster.  We could even use this information at home to promote healthy and rapid plant growth in our vegetable gardens by placing them under certain favorable wavelengths of light.
	In this experiment, the absorbance of 130mM DCPIP in photosynthesis reactions was measured after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes.  Three samples of chloroplasts were placed under white light (the controlll), red, green, blue and black light (the experimentals), and the rate of photosynthesis was approximated based on percent change of absorption.  Due to previous research we read, it was our hypothesis that green light would be less effective than the white light, and red and blue light would be as effective or more effective than the white light; we did not know what would happen under black light.

Materials and Method:
	To begin, four spinach leaves without their central veins were ground in 20Ml of cold grinding solution with a mortar and pestle.  After the spinach was completely ground up and filtered into a 150Ml beaker, we centrifuged it in a 50Ml centrifuge tube labeled Sample A at 200 G for 3 minutes at 4°C.  When spinning was finished, we transferred the supernatant into a different 50Ml centrifuge tube labeled Sample B and centrifuged it again, this time at 1000 G for 10 minutes at 4°C.  When centrifuging was complete, we removed the supernatant from the tube and disposed of it.  We then added 20Ml of the cold grinding buffer to the remaining pellet in tube B, and stirred it with a micropipette to attain our sample of chloroplasts for the experiment.
	Once we had our chloroplasts, we created a set of reaction mixtures in test tubes for each of the samples.  We had one blank, three controlll (white light) samples, and three samples per experimental (red, green, blue, and black light).  We added 8Ml of water, 2Ml of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate at pH 6.5) to the blank test tube.  The rest of the test tube samples for the controlll and experimentals had 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP, and 2Ml of reaction buffer.  To start our assay, we added 100uL of the chloroplasts we harvested earlier to each test tube and mixed each one immediately.  We measured the absorbance of every sample before any time had passed, then after 3 ten-minute periods to reach a total of 30 minutes.  During each 10 minute interval we placed the samples of the controlll and experimentals under their respective light colors.  
	After completing the assay, we calculated average absorbances, percent change in absorbance for each sample over time, average percent changes, and ran t_tests assuming unequal variance between the controlll and each experimental to calculate the p value and t stat of our data.  Additionally, we created a line graph to show change in absorbance over time and a bar graph to compare the percent change in absorption of each group after the full 30 minutes.

Results:
	Over time, the average percent change in absorbance for the controlll and all four experimentals increased.  Blue had the highest rate of change after 30 minutes (86.57%), followed by green (85.97%), red (84.57%), white (74.04%), then black (68.73%).  Similarly, the longer the samples were under the lights, the clearer and less blue they became, indicating that photosynthesis was occurring.  This trend applied to all the samples of all the groups except for two.  Two of our samples were outliers and did not match the rest of the data in their groups.  One of the red samples and one of the green samples demonstrated very little change in photosynthesis over time, and did not show a change in color over the 30-minute period.  These two outliers were removed from the data to make more accurate calculations.
	When red light was compared to white light, the p value was 0.34 and the t Stat was -1.13.  Green light vs. white light showed a p value of 0.16 and a t Stat of -1.19.  Meanwhile, blue light compared to white light had a p value of 0.22 and a t Stat of -1.44, and black light vs. white light yielded a p value of 0.55 and a t Stat of 0.67.  These p values indicate that the results of our experiment were statistically insignificent.


Discussion:
	Our results were very different from what we expected them to be.  While we thought that green light would prove to be somewhat ineffective, our results demonstrated that red, blue, and green light were more effective and had a higher rate of photosynthesis than white light, our controlll, while black light had a lower rate of photosynthesis than the controlll.  The main reason why we expected these results is due to the biology of the leaf, as well as previous studies of the effect of light wavelength on photosynthesis.  All plant cells have organelles called chloroplasts, where photosynthesis takes place.  These chloroplasts are home to the pigment chlorophyll, a green pigment, which absorbs most visible light wavelengths, but reflects green light [Terashima: 2009].  It was our belief that because plant leaves reflect green light rather than absorb it, subjecting spinach leaves to only green light would cause photosynthesis to slow down or stop.  This is because photosynthesis in plants requires light absorption to excite electrons and begin the process of the electron transport chain [Johnson: 2017].  If the spinach leaves reflected the green light, then it would not be absorbing an energy to excite electrons and begin the photosynthetic process.
	This idea was supported by many other studies in the biological field.  A study by Terashima et al explained that plants absorb about 90% of red and blue light, while they only absorb about 70% of green light [Terashima: 2009].  We believed it possible that the less light that is absorbed, the slower the rate of photosynthesis will be.  In another study, Muneer et al claimed that biomass production in lettuce leaves decreased under green light, which indicated that putting lettuce under green light slowed down photosynthesis rate, and therefore slowed down plant growth and biomass production [Muneer: 2014].  Similarly, Folta et al explained that green light generally has the opposite effect on plant leaves as red and blue light does, meaning that while red and blue light could be beneficial for photosynthesis, green light is not [Folta: 2007].  This idea is further supported by research from Kim et al in 2004 that suggests that light which includes red, green, and blue wavelengths is effective for inducing photosynthesis, but as the proportion of green light compared to red and blue light increases, the rate of photosynthesis slows down [Kim: 2004].
	One reason why our results did not support our hypothesis and did not match with some of the primary literature could be due to the intensity of the lights used, such as if the green light bulb was more intense than any of the other light bulbs.  Johkan et al showed that red and blue light were more effective at increasing the rate of photosynthesis than green light, however they also showed that coupling green light with intense white light actually proved to be more effective for increasing the rate of photosynthesis than using only red light [Johkan et al: 2012].  Maybe our samples under green light had a high rate of photosynthesis because our green light bulb was so much more intense than the rest of the lightbulbs.  Furthermore, the high rate of photosynthesis in the green light could also be from the samples exposure to white light while we were measuring their absorbances between ten-minute intervals.  It is possible that the green light samples were exposed to lights from the classroom or from the lamp of white light that was next to the lamp of green light, and this white light paired with the green light promoted photosynthesis in the green light sample.
	Although our data did not support our hypothesis and our p values made our results statistically insignificent, we can still use this experiment to design better, more conclusive experiments in the future.  By having more examples in each group, isolating the samples so that they are only exposed to their specific wavelength of light, and ensuring that the intensities of the lights used for each group are the same, we can perfect this experiment, so that we can obtain conclusive results.  Hopefully then we can find a more definitive way to enhance photosynthesis in plants using different light wavelengths, and we can implement this research in the agriculture field to increase size and rate of production of crop yields.
