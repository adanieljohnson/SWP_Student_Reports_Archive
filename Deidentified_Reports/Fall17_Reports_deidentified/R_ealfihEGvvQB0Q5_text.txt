Title: Nerve and Muscle Function: The Effect of ACh Esterase Inhibitor on the Amplitude Muscle Twitches in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
This study’s object was to measure the effect that ACh Esterase Inhibitor has on the muscle contraction in a Rana pipien leg. Neuromuscular control is important in our understanding of how the muscular and nervous systems work together to generate movement. We chose to study the effect of this drug because it inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine. We hypothesized that the AChE Inhibitor has an effect on the uptake of the ACh, therefore there will be a statistically significant increase of the amplitude of the muscle with the AChE Inhibitor in comparison to the amplitude of the muscle without the AChE Inhibitor. We tested this by measuring the amplitude of the muscle contractions in three different Rana pipien legs after locating the voltage level that allowed for the threshold to be met and maximum contraction to occur. For each of the three legs we first measured the contraction without the AChE Inhibitor and then followed it by the same test after the AChE Inhibitor was injected into the muscle. We obtained p-values of 0.001163, 0.330066, and 4.93e-5 with the first and third p-value being significant but in opposite directions and the middle p-value showing no significance. Our results were inconclusive and our hypothesis was not supported.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system responds to certain conditions and changes within milliseconds of a given stimuli [Johnson: 2017]. When nerve impulses reach the neuromuscular junction it causes the release of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). This binds its receptors to receptors on the membrane of the muscle resulting in the opening up the sodium channels. This action potential then stimulates the release of calcium ions and activates the contractile mechanism in the muscle, causing the muscle to shorten [Sadava: 2017]. In order to further investigate this process, we chose to recorded the amplitude of the muscle contraction in a Rana pipien leg using a myogram before and after injecting the Rana pipien leg with ACh Esterase Inhibitor. We chose to study this organism in particular because its neuromuscular control system functions similarly to humans. In addition, it was fairly simple to isolate the nerve and muscle in the Rana pipien leg making it easy to send pulses to the sciatic nerve to make the gastrocnemius muscle twitch. We hypothesized that the ACh Esterase Inhibitor has an effect on the uptake of the ACh, and therefore there will be a statistically significant increase of the amplitude of the muscle with the ACh Esterase Inhibitor in comparison to the amplitude of the muscle without the ACh Esterase Inhibitor. Our null hypothesis argued that the ACh Esterase Inhibitor has no effect on the uptake of the ACh, therefore there will be no statistical difference between the amplitude of the muscle with the ACh Esterase Inhibitor and the amplitude of the muscle without the ACh Esterase Inhibitor. Other studies involving the muscles in Rana pipiens have shown that anti-esterase treatment has led to an increase in the depolarization [Katz: 1975]. Katz suggest that prolonged depolarization arises from the continued action of ACh. This study supports our hypothesis and gives reason for us to believe that by inhibiting AChE from removing the ACh from the receptors, the sodium ion channels will stay open generating a greater amplitude of the muscle twitch.

Materials and Methods:
Place Rana pipien leg on dissecting pan and grasp the skin at the top of the leg with a pair of forceps and pull it down toward the foot. Make sure to moisten the leg with frog Ringer's solution as needed. Gently separate the inner thigh muscle (upper end to knee) using a dissecting probe and free the white sciatic nerve using a dissecting needle and forceps. Cut the end of the gastrocnemius and leave the medial end attached. Next, make a loop with the thread provided and tie one end to the tendon and attach the loop of the string to the flat spring of the transducer arm. Place the transducer so that the leg is at a 90angle to table. Pin down the muscle of the leg while avoiding touching the nerve and insert the 2 muscle stimulators into the muscle. Using LabScribe, send nerve impulses to the muscle starting at 0.1V until you reach the threshold or what seems to be a maximum contraction. After locating this voltage, send five nerve stimuli to the muscle and record the amplitude of each; this is your control. Next inject the muscle with 0.1mL of ACh Esterase Inhibitor (2% solution of Sevin) using a syringe. After two minutes, send five nerve pulses to the muscle at the same voltage as the control. Record the amplitudes of these muscle contractions; this is your experimental. Repeat all steps with two more Rana pipien legs. Using a paired T-test and compare the control groups (the untreated muscles) to the experimental group (ACh Esterase Inhibitor treated). 

Results:
Figure 1: For Rana pipien leg 1, maximum contraction was at 3.0V. The control had an average amplitude of muscle contraction of 0.365V with a standard deviation of 0.004. The concentrated AChE Inhibitor had an average amplitude of 0.492V with a standard deviation of 0.037567273. This resulted in P-Value=0.001163 and df=4.

Figure 2: For Rana pipien leg 2, maximum contraction was at 2.0V. The control had an average amplitude of muscle contraction of 1.721V with a standard deviation of 0.043820087. The concentrated AChE Inhibitor had an average amplitude of 1.728V with a standard deviation of 0.04037945. This resulted in P-Value=0.330066 and df=4.

Figure 3: For Rana pipien leg 3, maximum contraction was at 1.0V. The control had an average amplitude of muscle contraction of 0.842V with a standard deviation of 0.024172298. The concentrated AChE Inhibitor had an average amplitude of 0.589V with a standard deviation of 0.016637307. This resulted in P-Value=4.93e-5and df=4.

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis and appeared to be drastically different inhibiting us from making and significant conclusions. The first test we conducted at 3.0V supported our hypothesis while the third test at 1.0V did not. The second test showed no significant difference between the control and the experimental. We shocked the third muscle at 3.0V after receiving our results and found the amplitude to increase. This could possibly mean that we incorrectly identified the threshold and maximum muscle contraction. Another limitation is that we did not clean the muscle stimulators off after the first Rana pipien leg which could have slightly contaminated our second from muscle with ACh Esterase Inhibitor prior to the injection. To further study this concept, I would test more than just three Rana pipien legs. Having such a small sample size made it difficult to gather enough information in order to prove or disprove our hypothesis. I would also add a third group to compare the effect of ACh Esterase Inhibitor to the effect of another variable such as caffeine or nicotine. This would show the difference in the extent to which each of these variables alter the muscle contraction. There were many flaws with this experiment, however, I believe that our hypothesis would be proven correct if these issues were to be resolved. This inference is due to the findings in the study published by Katz where the use of an ACh Esterase Inhibitor does indeed increase the magnitude of the muscle contraction. Katz suggests that this “phenomenon” may be due to the ACh Esterase Inhibitor “stabilizing” the open gated ion channels and continues to act during the depolarization [Katz: 1975].
