Title: The effect of varying temperatures on the photosynthetic activity of Spinacia oleraca  

Abstract:
Ecosystems depend on primary producers to maintain high levels of productivity, but these producers can be directly affected by many environmental factors. In this study, photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleraca was observed at cool, room, and warm temperatures by conducting a Hill assay in order to measure absorbance. The hypothesis predicted that the chloroplasts from the spinach leaves at the highest temperature would experience the highest photosynthetic rate. After gathering data at 10, 20, and 30 minutes, it was determined that the leaves in the coldest temperature experienced the highest percent change in absorbance and increase in the rate of photosynthesis. This statistically significent percent change signified high levels of photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts in the cold bath and significently lower levels of activity in the chloroplasts in the warm bath. Although these results do not support the original hypothesis, they do continue to support the theory that external environmental conditions can and will directly affect productivity in plants. 

Introduction:
As global climate patterns are changing rapidly, the scientific world has been evaluating the countless effects of this larger process by conducting specific, detailed studies that may be applied at a larger scale. Photosynthesis, for example, is a process that occurs within the chloroplasts of plant cells, but its interactions with its environment play a key role in ecosystem function and maintenance. Through the process of photosynthesis, plants are able to capture and store energy from the sun. This energy is crucial for producers because it is later released by glycolysis and respiration. The ATP created during glycolysis can be used from any cellular processes. Requiring CO2, H2O, and sunlight, a plant can produce glucose, water and oxygen, while any ATP produced during photosynthesis is consumed in the production of glucose [Johnson: 2018]. By measuring the transfer of electrons through reactions in the chloroplast, one can learn more about a plant’s rate of photosynthesis. Primary productivity, or the amount of energy converted into usable forms by plants, can be affected by many factors, and it is important for ecosystems to maintain high primary productivity amidst environmental changes [Johnson: 2018]. 
In this lab, the effect of temperature on photosynthetic rate was evaluated. Temperature does not affect the light dependent reactions in photosynthesis; however, it can have a drastic affect on the light independent reactions [RSC: 2009]. These reactions are primarily controlllled by enzymes that each function at an optimal temperature, so the correlation between temperature and photosynthesis is indisputable. RUBISCO, an enzyme complex, uses NADPH reduction and ATP to create the glucose that is essential for cell functioning [Johnson: 2018]. Although the effect of temperature on the photosynthetic rate in plants is widely studied, responses and sensitivity to temperature may vary between species. In this lab, Spinacia oleraca (spinach) were chosen because existing research displays that spinach leaves can more rapidly induce a tolerance to freezing and/or warming more so than other plants [Guy: 1987]. Being a strong and common producer, spinach was an applicable plant due to its accessibility and widespread agricultural and nutritional impact. Additionally, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) was used in this experiment as an electron receptor in photosynthesis, allowing for an accurate conversion of light absorbance to photosynthetic rate. Because sunlight is a necessary reagent for photosynthesis, heat may also play a role in this experiment. Recently, studies have been conducted to determine the benefit of heated greenhouses to increase their solar energy collection [Esen: 2013]. Based on existing data, we hypothesized that the rate of photosynthesis in the spinach leaves would be the highest at the warmest temperature. To test this hypothesis, the photosynthetic activity of spinach leaves was observed at different temperatures. 


Materials and Method:
6 medium Spinacia oleraca leaves were stripped of their central veins, grinded into a paste, and strained into a centrifuge tube. This paste was centrifuged twice so that a sample of concentrated chloroplasts was created. A Hill assay was then conducted in test tubes by combining water, 130 mM DCPIP, a reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5) and the enriched chloroplast. After mixing immediately, a sample from each tube was transferred into a cuvette, and the absorbance was recorded with a spectrophotometer set to 600 nm. Tubes 1-3 were then placed in a 1̊C water bath, tubes 4-6 in a 20̊C water bath, and tubes 7-9 in a 73.3̊C water bath. In addition to these 9 tubes, one tube did not have chloroplast and served as the negative controlll, and one tube served as the blank without DCPIP and chloroplast. Using the blank sample to blank the spectrophotometer between each trial, the absorbances of each tube (which correlated directly to photosynthetic rate in the chloroplasts) were read at 600 nm after 10, 20, and 30 minutes. The absorbances and percent changes between the negative controlll, cold temperature, room temperature, and hot temperature were compared, and a statistical analysis including an ANOVA test (p = 0.05) and a Tukey-Kramer test was used to analyze the data. 

Results:
When the low, room, and high temperature chloroplast absorbances were recorded, the percent change at 30 minutes from the low temperature group was significently higher (p = 0.000000635). According to the Tukey-Kramer test, the difference between the percent change at all three groups was significent. The average percent change of the rate of photosynthesis in the negative controlll group was 22.04 +/- 0.79, and the chloroplasts at 0̊C had an average percent change of 35.5 +/- 3.38. The chloroplasts at 20 ̊C experience an average percent change of 20.81 +/- 0.76, and the chloroplasts at 73.3̊C had an average percent change of 2.03 +/- 0.71. Figure 1 displays the percent change of the respective groups at 10, 20, and 30 minutes, along with the standard deviation shown through error bars. Figure 2 displays the final change in absorbance at 30 minutes in each group, with the error bars representing standard deviation. 

Discussion:
After analyzing the data, the hypothesis is not supported because the photosynthetic rate of the spinach chloroplasts in the 0̊C bath experienced the highest increase in percent change. This may be because the hot bath provided an environment that was too hot for the spinach leaves to reach optimal photosynthetic activity or, as mentioned in the introduction, because the spinach leaves used in this experiment tend to adapt more rapidly to freezing temperatures than to warming temperatures [Guy: 1987]. Another explanation for this could be linked to research done at the University of New Hampshire, where The Department of Animal and Nutritional Sciences discovered that biomass production and elemental nutrient accumulation was higher for spinach in colder temperatures, in contrast to some species such as Brassica oleraca (kale) [Lefsrud: 2005]. Biomass production and nutrient accumulation are closely linked to photosynthesis, as photosynthesis is the process that ultimately leads to the energy for plants to carry out the processes necessary for functions such as these. Additionally, recent studies have provided evidence that the temperature during plant growth affects both the balance of photosynthetic processes and also the temperature that will ultimately become that plants optimal and preferred temperature [Yamori: 2005]. Although the use of a Hill assay in this experiment allowed us to quickly measure photosynthetic activity [Johnson: 2018], this methodology may not be as comprehensive in evaluating the effect of temperature on plants because things such as plant growth were not considered. Furthermore, there may have been errors in the amount of various solutions placed in the test tubes and time discrepancies for how long the tubes were left in their respective water baths. Moving forward, it may be beneficial to conduct a more extensive experiment, measuring photosynthetic activity through a Hill assay in combination with other factors such as overall plant growth and nutrient accumulation over a longer period. This type of wide-ranging, all-encompassing study has the potential to build upon existing research to further investigate the effect of external factors on the earth’s primary producers that are being directly affected by current global climate patterns.
