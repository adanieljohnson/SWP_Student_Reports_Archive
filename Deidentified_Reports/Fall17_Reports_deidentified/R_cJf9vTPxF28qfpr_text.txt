Title: The Effect of Light of Varying Wavelengths on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts of plants, protists, and some bacteria. The rate at which photosynthesis occurs varies depending on environmental factors such as wavelengths of light. Thus, we hypothesized that by exposing varying wavelengths of light to chloroplasts of Spinacia oleraca, we would find a general decrease in photosynthetic activity in comparison to visible light. Chloroplasts were first isolated from Spinacia oleraca leaves and then suspended in solution along with DCPIP, an alternative electron acceptor. The solutions were placed under lights of varying wavelengths, and a spectrophotometer was used to measure change in absorbance values. Our results supported our null hypothesis in that visible light had the highest change in absorbance, (and thus the highest theoretical photosynthetic output), followed by UV, blue, and green light, while a “no chloroplasts” group served as our negative controlll. Visible light likely produced the highest change in absorbance because it contains a wide range of wavelengths, while blue light, for example, only contains a small range. Green light had low changes in absorbance because the chlorophyll pigments actually reflect rather than absorb green light. Lastly, UV light’s data plateaued due to damage to Photosystem II.


Introduction:
All living organisms must harvest energy from external sources in the form of either ingesting other organisms or physically creating energy through biochemical processes. Plants, protists, and some bacteria are all able to synthesize their own energy in the form of carbohydrates through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis involves harvesting the photons in light energy and using this energy (coupled with water) to convert oxidized molecules of carbon dioxide into their most reduced form, as carbohydrates [Johnson: 2017]. This process takes place in three distinct steps. The first two stages are named the Light-Dependent Reactions, while the final stage is called the Light-Independent Reactions (or, more commonly, the Calvin Cycle). During the Light-Dependent Reactions, chlorophyll, a green pigment in chloroplasts, absorbs light energy and coverts it into chemical energy in the form of photons. These photons are then imputed into a process called the Electron Transport Chain, where they undergo a series of reduction-oxidation reactions as they pass through multiple protein complexes such as Photosystem II and Photosystem I. At the end of the electron transport chain the photons are accepted by a final electron acceptor. The energy from this process is then used in the Light-Independent reactions to reduce carbon dioxide molecules into carbohydrates [Johnson: 2017].


The rate at which photosynthesis occurs, however, may vary depending on various environmental factors. For example, a study that focused on photosynthetic output in Cymodocea nodosa plants, found that changes in the temperature of water as well as the plants’ exposure to light can alter how much and how quickly photosynthesis can occur [Drew: 1978]. Another particularly curious factor that seems to drastically effect the efficiency of photosynthesis is changes in the particular wavelength of light. For example, in a study done in 2012, Lactuca sativa plants were found to be extremely sensitive to changes in the wavelength of green light, down to the particular nanometer [Johkan, etc.: 2012].


Since plants are normally exposed to sunlight, which mainly consists of light from the visible light spectrum, a surplus of information on the effect of different wavelengths of visible light on the rate of photosynthesis has been compiled. Visible light, itself, ranges from about 380 to 780nm, almost directly in the middle of the known light spectrum. These particular wavelengths of light are aptly named “Visible Light”, because they are physically visible to the human eye in different shades of colors. While the lowest wavelengths of visible light such as violet (380-450nm) or blue (450-495nm) and the highest wavelengths of light such as orange (590-620) or red (620-750mn) are seen by the human eye as relatively darker colors, the median ranged wavelengths such as green (495-570nm) or yellow (570-590nm) are seen as brighter colors to the human eye [The Electromagnetic and Visible Spectra: 2017]. Objects that we see, for example, reflect a certain wavelength of light which makes them appear colorful to our eyes. For instance, when we see an object and classify it as “yellow”, in reality the object is simply absorbing all the non-yellow wavelengths of visible light and reflecting yellow light. This same logic can be applied to the chlorophyll pigments responsible for absorbing light energy in chloroplasts. Chlorophyll pigments are said to be colored “green”. Thus, the composition of these pigments lends them to readily absorb all non-green wavelengths of visible light while it reflects green light (giving them their green color) [Folta, 2007]. 


Ultra Violet light is an example of another form of light and is located directly below visible light (ranging from around 10 to 315nm) on the light spectrum. Ultra Violet light, unlike visible light, however, is not truly visible to the human eye (therefore, we generally only see one color of UV light over the entirety of its spectrum) [The Electromagnetic and Visible Spectra: 2017]. While most visible light can be readily absorbed by chlorophyll pigments in chloroplasts, UV light has been shown to be potentially harmful to the protein complexes inside chlorophyll pigments. For example, a study done in 1994 on terrestrial plants found that Ultra Violet light may cause potential damage to Photosystem II in chloroplasts, and as a result lower the plants’ photosynthetic capacity [Teramura: 1994].


Therefore, based on primary literature, we hypothesize that by testing the effect of varying wavelengths of light on the rate of photosynthesis, we will find an increase or decrease in photosynthetic activity in comparison to visible light. More specifically, we expect that green light will not be absorbed well by chloroplasts, and will thus, have a relatively low photosynthetic output [Folta, 2007]. Blue light, however, should be readily absorbed by the green chlorophyll pigments and should produce a similar photosynthetic output as visible light. Ultra violet light, however, will damage the contents of Photosystem II, and thus, lower the photosynthetic output of the plant [Teramura: 1994]. However, if our results support our alternative hypothesis (and in turn reject our null hypothesis), our results will show that these varying wavelengths of light (green, blue, and UV) would show an increase (rather than a decrease) in photosynthetic activity in comparison to our controlll, visible light.    


To test this hypothesis, we will first harvest the chloroplasts from Spinacia oleraca (more commonly known as Spinach) leaves. The Spinacia oleraca plant is a leafy green vegetable commonly produced in large scales in the agricultural community [Koh, etc.: 2012]. This plant was not only chosen as our test subject because it is mass produced and consumed across the United States, but also because of its soft green color which stems from its green chlorophyll pigments mimicked in a variety of other plants [Bunea, etc.: 2008]. This plant, will thus allow us to generalize our results to a variety of other green plants with similar chlorophyll pigments. Furthermore, Spinacia oleraca plants are also being tested as subjects involved in sustainable farming, which may help us contribute to a greener future [Pretty, etc.: 2008]. Lastly, this plant has a variety of positive health benefits. Thus, discovering how to best mass produce this plant is not only going to bring in a large income for agricultural communities, but it may also increase the health of our community at large. For example, Spinacia oleraca contains a variety of flavonoids which act as efficient antioxidants, and carotenoids which allow the plant to be stored at a variety of different temperatures [Bunea, etc.: 2008]. Furthermore, Spinacia oleraca provides a good source of vitamin C, iron, and minerals such as calcium and magnesium [Koh, etc.: 2012]. 


To quantify the amount of photosynthesis that has taken place in the chloroplasts of our Spinacia oleraca leaves we will use a chemical reaction involving DCPIP to quantify the Hill Reaction that occurs during photosynthesis. The Hill Reaction refers to the general process of electrons being transferred from an electron carrier to the electron transport chain. The more electrons that are imputed into the Electron Transport Chain, the more photosynthesis can occur. DCPIP, or 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, is an alternative electron acceptor that can accept, and thus, donate electrons to the Electron Transport Chain in photosynthesis. Scientists can use DCPIP to measure the rate of photosynthesis objectively because of its unique ability to change color in its oxidized and reduced form. When oxidized, DCPIP is a colorful blue liquid, however when it accepts electrons and becomes reduced it takes on a colorless form. We can then use a spectrophotometer to accurately measure the amount of color present in our solution. The presence of a dark color in our solution indicates that most of the DCPIP is still in its oxidized form and thus has not accepted electrons. Therefore, the more colorless that our solution becomes the more electrons DCPIP could, in theory, donate to the Electron Transport Chain and increase the photosynthetic output of the system [Johnson: 2017]. 



Materials and Method:
4 Spinacia oleraca plant leaves were selected and stripped of their central veins. The leaves were placed in a mortar with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). A pestle was then used to grind the spinach leaves to a thick paste. After an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added, the spinach leaves were ground into a slurry. This solution was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a 50 Ml centrifuge tube. Next, the tube was spun in the centrifuge for 3 minutes at around 1200 rpm. The supernatant was then poured out of the original tube and into a second 50 Ml centrifuge tube. The second tube was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at around 2800rpm. The supernatant from this tube was discarded as waste. The remaining pellet in the tube was suspended in 20 Ml of grinding buffer. This solution served as our “enriched chloroplasts” solution. 


We then added 100 μl of enriched chloroplasts to the test tube labeled “blank”, as well as the tubes being tested with visible, blue, green, and UV light (making sure to omit the tubes labeled “no chloroplasts”). Next, we added 8Ml of water to the test tube labeled “blank”, and 6Ml of water to the remaining test tubes. 2Ml of 130 mM DCPIP were then added to all test tubes (excluding the blank). Finally, 2 Ml of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) was added to all tubes.


Next, the mixtures were immediately transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes, the spectrophotometer was blanked (using the “blank” test tube we prepared) and the initial absorbances of each sample was recorded at 600nm. We then placed the cuvettes under the particular wavelength of light they were assigned: test tubes 1-3 (no chloroplasts) and test tubes 4-6 (chloroplasts in visible light) were placed under visible light, test tubes 7-9 were placed under UV light, test tubes 10-12 were placed under green light, and finally, test tubes 13-15 were placed under blue light. Note that the group labeled “chloroplasts in visible light” will serve as our positive controlll, while the “no cholorplasts” group will serve as our negative controlll. After 10 minutes, the spectrophotometer was blanked again, and each of the samples absorbances were recorded at 600nm. This process was repeated every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. Thus, 4 separate absorbance measurements (including absorbances at time zero) were recorded. 


Percent change between the absorbances of each interval and time zero was then calculated. A statistical analysis of the data in the form of a 1 tailed t_test was also generated through excel. Furthermore, a graph of the percent change of absorbances over time for the 4 treatments was generated. 


Results:
The results from our experiment indicate a general linear correlation between the time lapsed and absorbance levels of the prepared solutions. This general trend is illustrated in the results shown in Fig 1. In this graph, the percent change in absorbance values after being exposed to varying wavelengths of light were plotted against time (in intervals of 10 minutes). The data with no chloroplasts indicated the lowest percent change in absorbance values over time; this group’s absorbance values, actually very slightly increased and then decreased with time. The data from the group exposed to visible light illustrated the highest values of percent change of absorbance over time; these values showed a steady linear increase in percent change in absorbance over time. The Ultra Violet light group had the second highest percent change in absorbance values over time, however, the percent change seemed to plateau in the last 10-minute time interval. The group labeled “blue light” had the next highest percent change in absorbance values; this data set followed a similar linear increase in percent change in absorbance as did visible light over time. Finally, the “green light” group showed very low levels of absorbance (similar to the group with no chloroplasts) that only slightly increased over time. 


The calculated p_values from the single-tailed t_test of the data suggests that while the no chloroplasts, green, and blue light groups were statistically different from visible light (the controlll group), the UV light’s data was not shown to be statistically significent. The no chloroplasts group, for example, was calculated to have a p_value of 0.0396, the blue light group was calculated to have a p_value of 0.035, and the green light group was calculated to have a p_value of 0.0398. Since these p_values are all below 0.05, statistically speaking, the data from all of these groups is said to be statically different than the data from visible light. The Ultraviolet group, however, was calculated to have a p_value of 0.1048. This p_value indicates that the data from the Ultra Violet group does not statically differ from the data set in visible light. 



Discussion:
We hypothesized that by exposing chloroplasts of Spinacia oleraca to varying wavelengths of light, we would find a general decrease in photosynthetic activity in comparison to our controlll, visible light. We hypothesized that green light would have the lowest absorbance values (closest to our negative controlll or group with no chloroplasts), that blue light would had the next lowest absorbance values, and finally, that UV light should have only slightly lower absorbance values as compared to visible light. Furthermore, our alternative hypothesis stated that our results would show that these varying wavelengths of light (green, blue, and UV) would show an increase (rather than a decrease) in photosynthetic activity in comparison to our controlll, visible light.    


Since the DCPIP in the solution, did in fact change from blue to colorless (as indicated by the results in Fig. 1), we can then conclude that the DCPIP was accepting electrons; and thus we can assume that higher changes in absorbance values indicated higher theoretical photosynthetic outputs [Johnson: 2017].


The no chloroplasts, green, and blue light groups all supported our initial hypothesis (with p_values less than 0.05: 0.0396, 0.0398, and 0.035, respectively) that they would all have lower absorbance values, and thus, lower values of photosynthetic output than our controlll. The UV light group, however, did not statistically support our null hypothesis because it had a p_value of 0.1048 which exceeded 0.05.


For example, our “Green Light” group produced absorbance values only slightly higher than our negative controlll (the no chloroplasts group). This data was considered statistically different than our visible light group (because it had a p_value less than 0.05, of 0.0398). These results were likely due to the fact that the chlorophyll pigments do not readily absorbed green light, in fact, they reflect most wavelengths of green light [Folta, 2007]. Interestedly, the change in absorbance values of the green light group was slightly higher than the no choloroplast group even though chlorophyll pigments, in theory, reflect all green light. In reality, however, although most wavelengths of green light are reflected by chlorophyll, a very small percentage of these wavelengths can actually be absorbed [Folta, 2007]. 


The next (or third) highest percent change in absorbances were from our “Blue Light” group. We originally hypothesized that blue light would have similar absorbance values to visible light, because unlike green light which is reflected by chloroplasts, we expected this light to be readily absorbed [Folta, 2007]. However, we found that this data was actually quite statistically different from our controlll (indicated by its p_value of 0.035 which remained below 0.05). After doing further research, we concluded that although the blue light was being readily absorbed by the chloroplasts, this groups simply lacked many of the other colors that contributed to the visible light spectrum, and thus produced lower changes in absorbance as a result. These results were confirmed by a study that showed how blue light alone produced lower photosynthetic outputs than it did when combined with other wavelengths of the visible light spectrum, such as red light [Hogewoning, etc.: 2010]. 


The UV light group had the second highest percent change in its absorbance values over time. This groups’ data, however, did not support our null hypothesis, because statistically speaking it was not statistically different from our controlll (because its p_value of 0.1048 exceeded 0.05). However, it is still reasonable to rationalize why this groups percent change in absorbance values were slightly less than that of our positive controlll. The smaller slope of the line was likely due to the fact that the UV light was simply not absorbed as well as visible light by the chlorophyll pigments of the chloroplasts. Furthermore, the plateauing effect of the data during the last 10 minutes likely illustrates how UV light can cause damage to Photosystem II (and even the plasma membrane of cells) if the cells are exposed to UV light over a long period of time. These results are supported by the findings of Termaura who observed that UV light causes a decrease in photosynthetic activity overtime because the harshness of these particular wavelengths can cause damage to Photosystem II as well as the plasma membrane of cells [Teramura: 1994]. Lastly, I found it interesting how high the UV light’s percent change in absorbances were when this light was said to be damaging to the cells’ plasma membranes and protein complexes inside of its cytoplasm. A possible explanation for this may be that the chlorophyll pigments in chloroplasts are actually well adapted to absorbing UV light because they naturally exposed to certain types of UV lights hidden in sunlight. 


Furthermore, we can conclude from Fig. 1 that our negative controlll (labeled no chloroplasts) had the lowest percent change in absorbance values, and thus, had the lowest rate of photosynthesis. These results were said to be statistically different from our positive controlll group (since they had a p_value of 0.0396 less than 0.05). Furthermore, these values showed that without chloroplasts, there was essentially no change in absorbance values and thus, no production of photosynthesis.  


Finally, our positive controlll, visible light, showed the highest percent change in absorbance values, and thus had the highest theoretical photosynthetic output. This was expected, as UV, blue, and green light were either theorized to produce similar or lower than normal values of photosynthetic output (as compared to visible light) [The Electromagnetic and Visible Spectra: 2017]. No p_value was calculated for this group, because the information would be meaningless in comparing the data to results from its own group. Furthermore, this group showed a steady linear increase in absorbance values over time, likely due to the fact that chlorophyll pigments were constantly absorbing more visible light over time [Folta, 2007].


Since the majority our results supported our hypothesis that varying wavelengths of light did, in fact, decrease the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca plants, these results could potentially be applied to an agricultural setting. For example, spinach plant growth in greenhouses could potentially be optimized based on only exposing plants to the most ideal wavelength of light while other forms of light (that inhibit photosynthesis) are minimized. For example, since we found that visible light does indeed produce the highest rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca, while UV light may potentially damage the plasma membrane and Photosystem II in plants over time, Spinacia oleraca plants grown in greenhouses could potentially be put under synthetic visible light lamps, while sheets block UV light from entering from the outside.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 describes the percent change in absorbance values after being exposed to varying wavelengths of light over a set period of time. Exposure to visible light was shown to produce the highest percent change in aborbances over time while the no chloroplasts group had the lowest (nearly zero) percent change in aborbances over time. The UV light group had the next highest percent change in absorbances over time, followed by blue and then green light.
