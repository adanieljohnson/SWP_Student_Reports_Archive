Title: Effects of increased calcium ion channel activity in the gastrocnemius and sciatic nerve of Rana pipens

Abstract:
When stimulation from a nerve generates action potential in a muscle, calcium cations are released within the muscle and cause depolarization of the myofibril cell. Depolarization initiates the process of myosin filaments binding to actin filaments and causing the skeletal muscle to contract. Using the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg as a representative muscle, this experiment used A23187, a calcium channel activator, to observe the effects of increased calcium within both the gastrocnemius and sciatic nerve on threshold. The gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve were isolate in three frog legs. Threshold voltage was determined for both the gastrocnemius and sciatic nerve by applying an electric stimulus to these structures. Afterwards, A23187 was injected into the muscle and threshold measurements for the nerve and muscle were taken again. Frog legs treated with A23187 were expected to have a lower threshold, however our data was inconclusive, and the null hypothesis could not be rejected. Further investigation on the effects of calcium on nerve action potentials and muscle contraction is needed. 

Introduction:
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the skeletal muscle controls hundreds of cylindrical, fused aggregates of cells called myofibers. Myofibers are bound together to form the skeletal muscles proper, which are innervated by motor neurons. The axons of motor neurons extend into muscle to innervate individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses at a neuromuscular junction cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh), which generates an action potential in the muscle. The release of Ca2+ causes depolarization of the cell and the muscle fibers to contract. The amount of Ca2+ released correlates directly with the observed muscle contraction. [Johnson: 2017] An organism with prominent and observable muscle contraction is the frog. Frogs have immense muscle capabilities in their legs that enable the ability to jump horizontal distances exceeding more than ~30 times the length of their body because of the immense power in the gastrocnemius muscle. [Moo: 2017] Rana pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog, is considered to be a medium sized frog that is not threatened environmentally, which made it a good model species for this study. [Rogers: 2012] We plan to manipulate the amount of calcium available to the muscle and nerve via opening calcium ion channels. A23187 is a known calcium ion channel activator which will serve as our independent variable when injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. Muscle threshold, or the minimum amount of voltage needed to create a muscle contraction will be the measurable dependent variable. It was hypothesized that if calcium channel activator A23187 is administered to the sciatic nerve of a frog leg, the gastrocnemius muscle will have a lower threshold voltage because of the increased availability of calcium.

Materials and Methods:
Preparation of Frog Legs:
1.	To prepare the three frog legs: Place the frog leg in a dissecting pan. Use the forceps to grasp the skin at the top of the leg and pull the skin down towards the foot. Lay the leg in the dissecting pan and moisten with frog Ringer’s solution. 
2.	Use the dissecting probe to separate the inner thigh muscles from the upper end to the knee. Gently free the nerve from the connective tissue. Free the sciatic nerve using the dissecting needle and forceps. Keep exposed tissues moist with Frog Ringer’s solution. 
3.	With cotton string, tie the end of the gastrocnemius muscle to the force transducer and tighten until a light load is placed upon the muscle, while leaving the nerve exposed.
Experimental Runs
1.	Follow Part I and Part II procedures for all three frog legs and record data. These are your control values. Remember to keep legs moist with Frog Ringer’s solution.
2.	Inject each frog leg with 0.1 mL of 100 mM A23187. Wait 1 minute and follow with Part I and Part II procedures. Record all experimental values.
Part I: Twitch Threshold Determination for Muscle
1.	Click stimulator preferences icon on the Labscribe toolbar to open the stimulator control pane and set stimulus parameters to 0.000 V.
2.	Apply light load by raising the force transducer with the tension adjuster until trace marks are a few MV above the baseline.
3.	Once light load is applied, Click Stop.
4.	Change the stimulus to 0.1 V. Record and mark when the muscle twitch is finished.
5.	Determine threshold voltage by increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1 V increments. 
6.	Save file and record data.
Part II: Twitch Threshold Determined by Nerve Stimulation
1.	Disconnect pin electrodes and connect the sleeve electrodes.
2.	Reset pulse Amp to 0.000V. 
3.	Determine threshold voltage for nerve stimulation by increasing stimulus voltage in 0.1 increments.
4.	Save file and record data. 
Data Analysis
1.	After all threshold values for both the gastrocnemius and sciatic nerve have been determined, use two separate two-tailed paired t-tests to determine if there was significant difference in threshold before and after the application of A23187. 


Results:
When looking at threshold, there was no difference in threshold after the application of A23187 for the stimulation of the sciatic nerve (Fig. 1). With no difference of threshold between control and experimental groups a paired t-test could not be run. However, as seen in Figure 2, the application of A23187 caused a higher threshold for muscle in two of the three frog legs but a paired t-test determined the results to not be significant (p=0.269703). Outside of threshold, amplitude of both the nerve and muscle at threshold was observed and recorded. According to Figures 3 and 4, application of A23187 proved to not provide threshold amplitudes with a significant difference from the observed amplitudes at threshold of the control group for both the muscle and the nerve. There was no observable trend in nerve amplitude (Fig. 3) at threshold which was proved by a paired t-test (p=0.897492). However, a slight trend was seen in muscle amplitude at threshold values in which a lower amplitude was observed after the application of A23187 for all three frog legs (Fig. 4). Despite the trend, a paired t-test determined the results to be nonsignificant (p=0.266494).

Discussion:
Based on the data, the hypothesis was not supported. The calcium ion channel activator was expected to make both the muscle and neurons have lower threshold values because less energy would be required for the muscle to react if more calcium was made available to the muscle. Threshold values were not significant for nerve (Fig. 1) nor muscle (Fig. 2). However, an analysis on the observed amplitude at threshold also showed no significant trends between control and experimental groups for threshold measurements of both the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of the frog as shown in Figures 3 and 4. 
An experiment done by Statham et al. used electron microscopy to determine the effects that A23187 has on myofibril tissue. A23187 is confirmed to cause contraction, however, the chemical also causes extensive damage to the muscle. Statham et al. observed a complete dissolution of filaments that when accompanied by contraction, served to pull the muscle apart. This is caused by the chemical’s effect on the sarcoplasmic reticulum either directly or indirectly. [Statham: 1976] Therefore, our experimental design could have been flawed by the damage that the calcium activator caused to the muscle and our experiment could not have accurately observed the effects of elevated calcium levels on skeletal muscle and nerve function. If this experiment were to be performed again, using another less muscle-damaging calcium ion activator or directly administering calcium to the muscle could provide more accurate insight on the effects of calcium levels on muscle and nerve thresholds. Too much calcium in muscle is thought to be the cause of muscular diseases such as muscular dystrophy in vertebrates. [Duncan: 1978] Further research in the effects of increased calcium on muscle could be very useful in coming closer to a cure for Muscular Dystrophy and other skeletal muscle diseases.
