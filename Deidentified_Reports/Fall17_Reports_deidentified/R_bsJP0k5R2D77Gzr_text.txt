Title: Lidocaine Prevents Response to Stimulation in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
In this experiment, we injected the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens with 25 mM of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker.  By blocking sodium channels, lidocaine prevents the cellular membrane from becoming depolarized, and thus, prevents action potentials from firing.  Since action potentials cannot fire in the presence of lidocaine, then movement should be prevented in the presence of lidocaine.  Based off of this knowledge, our hypothesis was that this could cause a decrease in response (in Volts) to 1.000 Volts of stimulus.  To test this, we measured the response strength to 1.000 Volts of stimulus before and after injecting lidocaine.  We used a paired t test to find the statistical significance of our study.  We found that our null hypothesis was not rejected; however, there was an increase in response strength in one out of the three gastrocnemus muscles.


Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to their internal and external environments.  The neuromuscular system allows for a response to a stimulus within milliseconds.  To allow for movement, an action potential must travel down the axon of a motor neuron.  To allow for an action potential to fire, and thus travel down the axon of a motor neuron, voltage-gated sodium ion channels must be opened in order to depolarize the cell.  The depolarization of the cellular membrane causes voltage-gated potassium ion channels to open and repolarize the cell.  This repolarization of the cellular membrane allows an action potential to fire, which allows for muscle stimulation.  Acetylcholine is the hormone that is released in order to allow for muscle contraction.  Acetylcholine release is also dependent on sodium channels. 
 
In this experiment, we want to determine what will occur if these voltage-gated sodium ion channels are manipulated.  Lidocaine is a chemical that blocks sodium ion channels.  To test how lidocaine will affect the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog, we are going to inject a frog leg with 25 mM of lidocaine.  According to “Coapplication of Lidocaine and the Permanently Charged Sodium Blocker QX-314 Produces a Long-lasting Nociceptive Blockade in Rodents,” blocking voltage-gated sodium channels disrupts the generation of action potentials and prevents the transmission of nociceptive information to the central nervous system [Binshtok, Gerner, et al. 2009].  In this case study, it was determined that, “by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in axons, local anesthetics disrupt action potential generation and prevent transmission of cociceptive information to the central nervous system” [Binshtok, Gerner, et al. 2009].  This indicates that a sodium channel blocker, such as lidocaine, would be useful as an anesthetic because the chemical does not allow action potentials to fire in motor neurons, and thus, prevents movement.  

Because of this information, we hypothesize that if we inject lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscles of a Rania pipiens, then the response (in Volts) to 1.00 Volts of stimulation (i.e. contraction amplitude) will be less than the response (i.e. contraction amplitude) to 1.00 Volts of stimulation in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog that has not been injected with lidocaine.  We believe that lidocaine will cause a decrease in the contraction amplitude in volts.  This means that our null hypothesis is that lidocaine will have no effect on the contraction amplitude or that the contraction amplitude will increase.  This is because we are using a one-tailed, paired t test.  The dependent, continuous variable in this experiment is the response to the stimulus.  The independent, categorical variable is the presence or absence of lidocaine in the gastrocnemus muscle.  


Materials and Method:
Prepare three legs of the Rania pipiens according to the videos available.  By the time the legs are prepared, the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of the frog leg should be isolated.  The skin of the frog should be fully removed. 

In this experiment, we used Labscribe software, and thus, these method are based off of this software.  Click “stimulator preferences” icon on the Labscribe toolbar in order to open the stimulator controlll panel on the main window.  Check the values for the stimulus parameters that are listed in the stimulator controlll on the main window: pulse amplitude (amp) should be set to 1.000 V and the number of pulses (#pulse) to 1, frequency (F(Hz)) to 1, and pulse width (w) to 5 ms.  The value for a stimulus parameter can be changed via two method.  One way is to click on the arrows buttons to the right of the window that displays the value of the parameter in the window that displays the value of the parameter to increase/decrease the value.  The other way is to type the value of the parameter in the window next to the label of the parameter.  Click the “apply” button to finalize the changes in any stimulus parameter.  

Type 1.000 V in the mark box to the right of the mark button.  Click record to stimulate the nerve with 1.000 V and press the mark button to attach the comment to the recording.  Apply a light load to the muscle by raising the force transducer with the tension adjustor until the trace moves a few mV above the baseline.  Once a light load is applied to the muscle, click on Stop.  Repeat these steps for the 3 legs.  This is the controlll group.  

Once the controlll group is completed, inject each of the three legs with approximately 2 Ml (does not have to be exact) of 25 mM of lidocaine.  Repeat the previous steps with each leg.  Use a paired T test to analyze the data.


Results:
The results of the one-tailed paired t test are as follows: the T-statistic was 0.666377, the degrees of freedom was 2, and the P-value was 0.57375.

Once lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg, the contraction amplitude response to 1.000 Volts of stimulus decreased in two out of the three legs.  In one leg, the response increased in strength after the injection of lidocaine.

The average of the controlll group was higher than that of the experiment group.


Discussion:
Since the P-value of the paired T test is above 0.05, there is weak evidence against the null hypothesis.  Thus, the data supports that lidocaine does not cause a decrease in response to 1.000 volts of stimulus in the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens. Our results are not in line with the results of “Coapplication of Lidocaine and the Permanently Charged Sodium Blocker QX-314 Produces a Long-lasting Nociceptive Blockade in Rodents,” because they found that, “when injectedin therapeutic concentrations…into the hind paw or adjacent to the sciatic nerve, lidocaine produces a short-lasting…nonselective sensory and motor block in keeping with its nonselective sodium channel blocker action” [Binshtok, Gerner, et al. 2009].  While the presence of lidocaine caused a decrease in response to two out of the three legs, there was an increase in response strength in one of the legs.  Since lidocaine blocks sodium channels, there truly should have only been a decrease in response strength.  Therefore, this result could have occurred due to our error.  Error could have occurred when injecting the leg with lidocaine: too much or too little lidocaine could have been injected or the injection could have occurred in wrong location on the leg.  Error could have also occurred if the instructions on how to prepare the leg were not followed all of the way.  Based on the fact that one leg experienced an increase in response strength, further testing could determine if the volume or concentration of lidocaine injected into the gastrocnemus muscle affects the decrease of response to the stimulus.
