Title: The Effect of Aggression on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambris Sp. 

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine how the presence of a large Procambris Sp. affects the oxygen consumption of a small Procambris Sp. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy an organism expends and can be used to find the specific metabolic rate of an organism. We examined the effect of aggression/ stress on the oxygen consumption of a small Procambris Sp. We were able to measure the oxygen consumption with a dissolved oxygen probe. We hypothesize that the oxygen consumption of the small Procambris Sp. will be affected if it sees a large Procambris Sp. near it. Our data showed that the oxygen consumption of small Procambris Sp. increases in the presence of a larger Procambris Sp. however, our results were statistically insignificent and we determined that the presence of a larger Procambris Sp has no effect on the specific metabolic rate of a small Procambris Sp (p=0.251080). 

Introduction:
The metabolic rate of an organism refers to the amount of energy used to maintain all of the body’s physiological processes [Johnson AD: 2017]. One way to measure an organism’s specific metabolic rate is to examine oxygen consumption. During the cellular respiration process, glucose is converted to energy. As a part of these reactions, ATP is converted from low to high energy. In order for this process to occur, electrons are transferred from the electron transport chain to the molecular oxygen we inhale, thereby converting the oxygen into water [Johnson AD: 2017]. The relationship between oxygen and energy production shows that the amount of oxygen consumed is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended. Some animal groups create dominance hierarchies in which one organism, usually through some form of aggressive behavior becomes the leader of the group [Issa: 1999]. In general, the trend shows that dominance is directly proportional to size; the larger crayfish tends to dominate, the smaller, more submissive crayfish [Bouvbjerg: 1956]. With this information in mind, we expect that a large crayfish will dominate a small crayfish. This in turn will affect the specific metabolic rate of a small crayfish. Additionally, when two brown trout were placed in a confined area, the results showed that the subordinate fish had a significent increase in SMR. The more aggressive the dominant fish, the greater the increase in SMR of the subordinate fish [Slowman:2000]. We chose to measure the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish species Procambris Sp. This a good model organism because it is easy to affect and measure their metabolism. Additionally, they tend to exhibit aggressive behavior often. Based on this information, we hypothesize that the presence of a large Procambris Sp. will have an effect on the oxygen consumption of the small Procambris Sp. 
Materials and Method 


Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, we chose three small crayfish (each serving as its own controlll) and 1 large crayfish to act as the aggressor. We then weighed each of the small crayfish, placed one of the small crayfish in the glass chamber, and then filled the chamber with room temperature water (22°C). After this we placed the filled chamber in a pan with more room temperature water and inserted the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber. Then we proceeded to measure the oxygen consumption every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. Once we finished measuring the oxygen concentration, we recorded the volume of water that was in the chamber and calculated the specific metabolic rate. We then repeated this process with the same crayfish but this time put the larger crayfish inside the pan that the chamber sat in, to antagonize the smaller crayfish. We then determined the specific metabolic rate once again. We repeated this process with the other two small crayfish as well. After collecting all the data, we performed a paired two-tailed T-test to further analyze our data. 
Specific Metabolic Rate= [∆O₂ (mg/L) x volume H₂O (L)] / Time (min) x weight (g)
 

Results:
The general trend of our data showed that the oxygen consumption of Procambris Sp. increased in the presence of a larger crayfish.  The average SMR before the physiological stimulus was applied was 0.00111533 mg O ₂ * g⁻¹ * min⁻¹, while the average SMR after the physiological stimulus was applied was 0.00156667 mg O₂ * g⁻¹ * min⁻¹ (Figure 1). The standard deviation of the controlll group was 0.000338851 while the standard deviation of the experimental group was 0.00051316 (Figure 1). The p_value was 0.25108, meaning our data is statistically insignificent because the p_value is higher than 0.05. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported because our data proved to be statistically insignificent. Similar to our experiment, another study found energy expenditure to increase in submissive cichlid fish in the presence of an antagonist fish. This is likely due to prevention of attacks and injury [Grantner: 1998].  Although the small and large Procambris Sp. did not directly come in contact with each the other, it’s likely that just the presence of the large Procambris Sp. caused the small Procambris Sp. to perceive a threat and experience stress. The presence of the perceived threat caused the small Procambris Sp. to increase oxygen consumption and thereby increase its specific metabolic rate. Additionally, another study examined how the agnostic behavior of Siamese fighting fish affects oxygen consumption. When the fish expressed aggressive behavior (tail beating, dorsal spread, and gill cover erection) towards their mirror image, the rate of oxygen consumption significently increased. In contrast with our experiment, the study also showed that the routine metabolism of fish who won the fight was higher than losers. It also showed that although winners and losers of the fight did not initially have significent differences in the expenditure of energy, the next day, winners of the fight showed higher metabolic rates. However, similar to our study, male fish who did not have direct contact with another fish showed signs of an increased metabolic rate [Castro: 2006]. Our experiment was limited by sample size and experiment time. If we had more crayfish to test or had measured oxygen consumption our results could have differed. Furthermore, the large crayfish was not extremely aggressive which we could not controlll for. In order to improve the experiment in the future, we could increase the number of small Procambris Sp. that are exposed to an aggressor. Additionally, we could examine how the oxygen consumption of a large Procambris Sp. is affected in the presence of another large Procambris Sp. The results of this experiment can be used to examine the energy costs of submissive behavior in the presence of an aggressor.
