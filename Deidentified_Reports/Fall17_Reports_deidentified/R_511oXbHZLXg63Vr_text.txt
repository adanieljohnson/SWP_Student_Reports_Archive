Title: Effect of color morphism on male-male intraspecific agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens

Abstract:
Color polymorphism is a common phenomenon in nature. Body color influences an organism’s fitness both by natural selection and the mating preference of its female conspecifics. This experiment aimed to study the relationship between the male conspecific’s body color and the level of aggression a male organism exhibits during the interaction. Agonistic behavior is a warning signal during a contest. Both intraspecific and interspecific aggressive behavior enhances the displaying individual’s fitness. We expected a difference in level of aggression in response to changing body colors. The study was performed on three randomly selected male Betta splendens (Betta), which is a territorial species. A random red male Betta and a random transparent male Betta were selected to provide stimulus. The level of aggression was assessed by measuring how long the exhibition of the most aggressive behaviors was during a five-minute interaction. The focal fish and stimulating fish were physically separated with a glass divider during the contest. The durations of display were not statistically different with a transparent conspecific and a red conspecific (P=0.811), suggesting male Betta fish do not alter level of aggressiveness in response to opponents of different colors.

Introduction:
Color polymorphism is defined as the presence of two or more color morphs within a single interbreed populations because of genetic polymorphism [Huxley: 1955]. Body coloration influences both inter- and intraspecific interactions of organisms [Andersson: 1994; Ruxton: 2004]. This study focuses on the effects of color polymorphism on intraspecific interactions only. The wide range diversity in color within species plays an important role in individual’s fitness. In nature, predators may prefer preys with a color to another. In addition to natural selection, color polymorphism can also act on mating choices. Males generally have no preference for the phenotypes of female, while female more often copulate with males with a preferred trait [Nakayama: 2015]. It can be deducted that color polymorphism may accelerate the generation of a new species [Hugall: 2012]. Since female mate-choices are the primary determinant of a male’s fitness, it is of interest whether males display different behavioral responses to their counterparts of various colors. In this study, we tested how color of conspecifics influences level of aggression in male Betta splendens (Betta). 
Betta fish is a highly aggressive and territorial species. It has been recognized for its agonistic behaviors when confronting intruders [Simpson: 1968]. The distinct aggressive displays against its conspecifics not only provides a warning signal to its intruders, they also make it easy to assess the level of aggression in their social interaction. There are different colors and patterns of Betta fish as a combined result of natural selection and human selection. Therefore, it is an ideal species to study how male Bettas respond to their conspecifics of different colors.  
Previous study suggests that the spread of gill covers (red mane) and caudal fin (tail flashing) are the two most common highest level of aggressive displays in male Betta during a contest, either with another male or a female [McGregor: 2001]. The control stimulus was a transparent male Betta fish and the experiment stimulus was a red male Betta fish. The total duration of the betta fish being tested displaying the highest level of agonistic behaviors in a five-minute interaction with stimulus was recorded as an indicator of overall degree of aggression. We assumed that the total duration will vary significantly when encountering with conspecifics of different body colors.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, all the Betta fish were collected and maintained by the laboratory. 
A glass aquarium was divided evenly to three compartments with opaque dividers. A randomly selected red male Betta fish was placed into a compartment at one end. In the compartment at the other end was a randomly selected colorless male Betta fish. Since it was almost at all colorless and did not have colored fins, we decided its color was transparent. The two male Betta fish acted as stimuli to focal fish. We did not specifically pick the color of focal fish.
The degree of aggression was quantified by measuring how long red mane and tail flashing lasted during the interaction. Both behaviors were categorized as the highest level of agonistic behavior. Therefore, displaying either red mane or tail flashing or both of them was accounted as one behavior.
A randomly selected male Betta fish was placed in the middle compartment of the aquarium. It was allowed to settle for 5 minutes while it was visually and physically isolated from the other two male Betta fish. After 5 minutes, one of the opaque divider was replaced by a transparent glass divider so that the focal fish and the transparent fish were physically separated yet they could see each other. The interaction lasted for 5 minutes, and the duration of time for the focal fish to exhibit the highest degree of aggressive behaviors was recorded. The opaque divider was immediately put back after 5-minute interaction. The focal fish was then allowed to rest for five minutes, followed by another 5-minute interaction with the red fish. The total duration of exhibiting red mane and tail flashing was also recorded.
The above procedure was repeated with another two randomly selected male Betta fish from the tank. After that, the three pairs of data were analyzed by paired t-test (α=0.05). Values reported are means of three replicates.


Results:
Figure 1 shows the difference in overall degree of aggression in response to interaction with a red conspecific and a transparent conspecific. The mean duration of exhibiting the highest level of agonistic behaviors when interacting with a transparent conspecific (n=3, x=50.7, s.d.=43.9) was statistically insignificantly different from that when interacting with a red conspecific (n=3, x=45.5, s.d.=30.3) (t-stat = 0.272, df = 2, P = 0.811).

Discussion:
The present study does not support our hypothesis; it has not demonstrated a significant difference between the level of aggression triggered by a transparent conspecific and that triggered by a red conspecific. The result indicates that male Betta fish do not exhibit a bias in level of aggression toward different color morphs. Previous study on the effect of size on mating found that the size-assortative mating makes it invalid to predict whether or not copulation occurred based on male size alone [Nakayama: 2015]. If mating choice is assortative based on colors in Betta fish, it is unlikely that male Betta fish changes behavior in response to conspecifics of different color morphs. In a similar way, male morphs may have developed unique mating strategies to help maintain their fitness [Hurtado-Gonzales: 2008]. The mating strategies could have minimized the impact of males’ phenotypes such that the differences among color morphs have little effect on a female’s mating choice. As a result, it may be unnecessary for the male Betta to distinguish between colors.
Our observation is consistent with previous study on cichlid fish, which proved there was no difference in a male’s attack frequency in mixed-color assemblages [Dijkstra: 2009]. We need to recognize, however, that the large error bars corresponding to the calculated average duration in Figure 1 suggest inconsistence of our collected data. It indicates that our subjects may not have been a valid representation of the species. We do not know how long the subjects had been kept in the laboratory and how many similar experiments they had been through. It is possible that the some of the focal fish were habituated to coexisting with another Betta without physical interaction.
The male-male agonistic behavior with presence of a female is not tested in this study. However, it is conceptually reasonable to expect a change in level of aggression with a female audience, if body color does influence fitness. We suggest further studies include a female Betta as a background stimulus. We also propose future studies should use wild Betta fish as subjects so that the likelihood of habituation would be small. In addition, the present study tested the influence of two colors only. A more detailed study would add more color morphs to the range of stimulus.
