Title: The Effect of Gravity on Direction of Growth in the Presence of Negative and Positive Chemotactic stimuli in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
The direction and amount of growth in Physarum polycephalum is affected by many factors, two of which are chemotaxis and gravitaxis. The purpose of this experiment was to test the effect of gravitaxis in the presence of a positive (glucose) and negative (acetic acid) chemotactic stimuli on the direction of growth against gravity in Physarum polycephalum. Slime mold experiences negative gravitaxis, growing toward the Earth and its moisture. We hypothesized that chemotaxis will have a greater effect on Physarum growth compared to the effect of gravitaxis. We tested this by placing glucose and acetic acid in locations on agar plates that would go against slime mold’s normal response to gravity if the slime mold grew in response to the chemicals. The Physarum grew upward in each experimental plate under the effect of gravity. We tested significance in the length of the longest strands in each environment and found the growth upward toward glucose was significantly smaller than growth in the plates on flat surface (p-value = 0.0137), but the growth upward and away from acetic acid was not significantly shorter compared to growth on the flat surface (p-value = 0.627). Our study proves the intelligence of Physarum through their response to critical signals or threats in the environment.

Introduction:
We will be studying the strength of the effect of gravity on the direction of growth in Physarum polycephalum while a positive stimulus (glucose) and then a negative stimulus (acetic acid) is present. Physarum polycephalum is a unicellular, multinucleate protist that relies on reactive navigation to explore its environment [Beekman: 2012]. Slime mold reacts to its environment through sensing and signaling pathways. For example, slime mold detects the presence of glucose in the environment through specific binding to receptor molecules presented on the outer membrane surface, causing the oscillation frequency in the area closest to the glucose to increase leading to the cytoplasm to flow toward the glucose [Beekman: 2012]. There are several studies on chemotaxis in slime mold, but few on gravitaxis. No specialized gravireceptors have been identified yet in Physarum [Hader: 1999]. Certain parameters have been identified, regardless of the presence of gravireceptors. Gravity influences the velocity of cytoplasmic streaming in the strands and slime mold use gravity for spatial orientation (geotaxis) [Block: 2015]. Slime mold are extremely intelligent organisms, despite their lack of structural complexity. Slime mold can be chopped up and placed in a plastic maze, and still grow and find one another, and then even grow in the shortest path possible towards the nutrients at the end of the maze [Jabr: 2012]. We decided to study a combination of chemotaxis and gravitaxis in Physarum. Slime mold experiences negative chemotaxis toward acetic acid (grows away) and positive toward glucose (grows toward) [Kincaid: 1978]. Based on studies and contemplation, we agreed that slime mold experiences negative gravitaxis due to the presence of moisture and water closer to the ground of the Earth, which is their ideal environment. We wanted to know whether chemotaxis or gravitaxis has a greater effect on the direction and amount of growth in slime mold. We hypothesized that Physarum will grow based on positive (glucose) and negative (acetic acid) stimuli, regardless of the effects of gravity, but will grow significantly less in plates under the influence of gravity compared to plates on the flat surface. 

Materials and Methods:
First, we obtained an alcohol lamp, ethanol, forceps, and spatulas. Then we obtained 8 water agar plates and 6 PDA plates for our experiment. We then soaked a water agar plate in 2% acetic acid and let it sit until we needed acetic acid for the 6 PDA plates. We sterilized the spatula, let it cool, and cut out approximately 1cm x 1 cm square slabs in the center of the 8 water agar plates and the 6 PDA plates. Then we placed blocks of Physarum culture from the stock plate in the center of the fourteen plates. The blank plates are now completed. We then focused on the six glucose plates. We cut out a block of agar on the edge of each of the six remaining water agar plates and placed a block of glucose in the empty spot. The glucose plates are done. Then we cut out a block on the edge of each PDA plate and placed a block of acetic acid from our soaked plate in the empty spots. Finally, we wrapped all 14 plates in foil and made sure to label where the glucose and acetic acid blocks were in the plates. We placed one blank, 3 glucose, and 3 acetic acid plates flat on the surface of the incubator. Then, we placed the rest of the plates in a Styrofoam stand, ensuring the plates were completely upright and parallel to the surface of the incubator. It is also crucial to make sure the glucose was upward and the acetic acid was downward in the plates. We left the plates in the incubator overnight and measured growth and direction of growth the next day. We averaged the lengths of the longest strand of growth in each group (Figures 1 and 2). We then used a two sample T test to find the p value and determine if there was significance in the amount of growth in plates experiencing no gravity compared to plates under the influence of gravity. 

Results:
The average length of the longest strand that grew toward glucose in plates on a flat surface was 4.5±0.866 cm, and in plates that stood upright was 2.4±0.153 cm. The average length of the longest strand that grew away from acetic acid in plates on a flat surface was 2.1±1.17 cm, and in plates that stood upright was 1.7±0.603 cm. Using a two sample T test, we calculated a t-value of 4.20 and a p-value of 0.0137 for growth towards the glucose in the plates experiencing no effect of gravity compared to plates experiencing gravity. We calculated a t-value of 0.526 and a p-value of 0.627 for growth away from acetic acid in the places experiencing no effect of gravity compared to plates that did experience the effects of gravity. The direction of growth in all the experimental plates that experienced the effects of gravity was upward, and the direction of growth in the blank that experienced gravity was downward.

Discussion:
We first analyzed the direction of growth in our experimental groups. This is qualitative data. Physarum grew downward in the blank plate that stood perpendicular to the surface of the incubator. This supports other studies in that slime mold have negative gravitaxis. The six experimental plates that had either glucose at the top of the plate or acetic acid at the bottom of the plate each experienced slime mold growth upward. This supports part of our hypothesis in that Physarum grew against its natural gravitaxis due to chemotaxis. Then we analyzed the average length of the longest strand of growth in each of the four groups (glucose flat and perpendicular, acetic acid flat and perpendicular). We compared the lengths in flat vs perpendicular environments because it is already proven that the slime mold grew upward despite the effects of gravity. We tested significance on if gravity caused shorter length of growth compared to the growth on the flat surface. The growth upward toward glucose was significantly smaller than the growth toward glucose in the plates on flat surface (p-value = 0.0137). The growth upward and away from acetic acid was not significantly smaller or shorter compared to the growth of the acetic acid on the flat surface (p-value = 0.627). These data somewhat support our hypothesis because slime mold did grow against its normal gravitaxis growth in the presence of chemicals, and the slime mold experienced significantly less growth toward the glucose due to gravity toward. The data, however, does not support our hypothesis in that there was no significant difference in the amount of growth in the acetic acid plates due to gravity. Overall, the slime mold did grow based on the location of glucose and acetic acid more so than the effect of gravity. The insignificance seen with acetic acid could be due to the high concentration of acetic acid we used, resulting in the slime mold more eagerly growing upward and away from the acetic acid, against the effect of gravity. The acetic acid was of higher concern than growing down and towards the Earth. The results of this experiment are important in the study of the effect of gravity on slime mold, especially because there are few studies about this topic. Our results prove that gravity does influence Physarum growth, even if it is smaller compared to chemotaxis. Further studies could study gravitaxis compared to other taxis in Physarum. One group studied gravitaxis and phototaxis, and discovered possible involvement of mitochondria in how slime mold perceives gravistimulus [Block: 1989]. This is critical because the scientific community is unsure how Physarum receive signals of gravistimulus. Our study, like others, is important to Physarum in general because it proves that these single-celled ameboae can remember, make decisions and anticipate change, urging scientistis to rethink intelligent behavior [Jabr: 2012].
