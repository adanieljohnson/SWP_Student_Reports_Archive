Title: Higher Temperature Exposure to Raphanus raphanistrum Does Not Lead to Higher Root:Stem Ratios for Length or Weight

Abstract:
Biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the phenotypic variation in the resource allocation in plants. Some plants require larger roots, and some require larger stems. These differences in structure are often due to the environment, altering the plants’ root:stem ratio. Additionally, varying ranges of temperature can also affect different species’ root:stem ratios. In this experiment, we tested temperature exposure to Raphanus raphanistrum (wild radish) seeds in relation to root:stem ratio by growing a sample of seeds for two weeks in a room temperature incubator and in a high temperature incubator. After letting the two temperature groups to grow, we measured root:stem ratio by taking the weights and lengths of the roots and the stems. When compared with two t-tests (one testing length and one testing weight) against a α of .05, there was not enough statistical evidence to accept the null and conclude that higher temperatures in Raphanus raphanistrum growth lead to higher root:stem ratios for either weight and length. 

Introduction:
Temperature differences can have very quantitative effects on root:stem ratios for length and weight in certain plants. Raphanus raphanistrum, or the wild radish, seems to be particularly affected by seed growth in extreme temperatures, as is a common trait in many large-production plants grown in large crops. According to one study, the growth of height of a production of wild radishes, including their roots, was much lower than in a similar sample size under “normal” temperature conditions (Chu, Aspinall, Paleg: 1974). Besides height, the chlorophyll absorption was much lower in those Raphanus raphanistrum grown in normal temperatures. The explanation for these differences in growth was the production  stress put on the Raphanus raphanistrum seeds when there was a shortage of water in the higher temperatures. Interestingly, another study found that significantly lower temperature exposure to Raphanus raphanistrum also had negative effects on growth and production of the seeds (Kumaratilake & Preston: 2003). Comparing root:stem ratios for the length and weight of plants, including Raphanus raphanistrum, helps give a qualitative analysis of the amount of allocation of roots and stems and therefore, different functions utilized by the different plant parts. Our experiment’s goal was to test the effects of high temperatures and room temperature growth compared to the Raphanus raphanistrum root:stem ratio In our experiment, we went against this research to hypothesize that Raphanus raphanistrum seeds exposed to higher temperature over a period of two weeks will have both a higher root:stem ratio for both length and weight. We tested this hypothesis by growing two pots of Raphanus raphanistrum seeds over two weeks, one placed in a high temperature incubator and one placed in a room temperature incubator.


Materials and Methods:
Two pots, one to be placed in higher temperatures and one to be raised at lower temperatures, were filled with soil and then soaked in water for around five minutes. About 10 milliliters of vermiculite was added to each pot, plus 50 milliliters of miracle grow. Twenty seeds of Raphanus raphanistrum were placed in each pot. The pots were then labeled and then one was placed in a high-temperature incubator and one was placed in a low-temperature incubator. The seeds were let to grow for two weeks, and watered every day with approximately 75 millimeters of water. At the end of the two weeks, root length and weight were measured, as well as stem length and weight, to then calculate the root:stem ratios for each.  


Results:
Numerically, both sets of data (comparing root:stem ratio for the weights and the lengths of the radish roots) seemed to support the hypothesis that increased temperature exposure would lead to higher root:stem ratios, as the means for root:stem ratio for weight were .362 (high temperature) (Fig 1)and .160 (low temperature) (Fig 2), and the means for root:stem ratio for length were 1.01 (high temperature) and .833 (low temperature). There was a noticeable outlier for the root:stem weight ratio in the first sample of high temperature sample group. However, after two t-tests were run on both sets of data, it was found that the p-value for the root:stem ratio for length was .241, and the p-value for weight was .405. Since these t-tests were run against the α of .05, there was not enough statistical evidence to accept the null and conclude that higher temperatures in Raphanus raphanistrum growth lead to higher root:stem ratios for both weight and length. 


Discussion:
Our results were not statistically strong enough to accept the hypothesis that higher temperatures in Raphanus raphanistrum growth lead to higher root:stem ratios for both weight and length. Although the means of both samples seemed to show that higher temperatures did indeed lead to a higher root:stem ratio for weight and length, the appropriate t-tests performed on the two sets of data (high temperature seeds and room temperature seeds, both tested for weight and length root:shoot ratio) were not statistically strong enough at the α of .05 to accept the hypothesis. This could be due to the lack of need for Raphanus raphanistrum to produce longer/heavier stems and roots when exposed to higher temperatures, as the higher temperatures would automatically allow for higher nutrient production without a need for increased biomass. It could also be due to a higher stress for water accumulation in higher temperatures that leads to lower growth. It has been demonstrated before that Raphanus raphanistrum seeds to not grow well in high temperatures and in addition, is also negatively correlated with pollen production and spread (El Murabaa: 1957).  However, this study measured the effects of the root: stem ratios for Raphanus raphanistrum seeds at an even higher temperature than in our experiment, so it would be interesting to explore a larger range of temperature effects on seed growth. Further testing on this subject should, if possible, use higher sample sizes to make the data more statistically accurate. Additionally, since the seeds were watered at random times every day by different people, future testing might try to water the samples at the same time every day. Finally, a further study could also investigate lower temperature effects on Raphanus raphanistrum root:stem ratio in addition to high temperature and room temperature effects.
