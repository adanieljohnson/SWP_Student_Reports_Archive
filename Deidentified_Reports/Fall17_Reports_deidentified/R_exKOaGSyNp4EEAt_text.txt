Title: Nerve and Muscle Function: The Effect of ACh Esterase Inhibitor on the Amplitude Muscle Twitches in Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
The object of this lab was to measure the effect that ACh Esterase Inhibitor has on the muscle contraction in a Rania pipien leg. We hypothesized that the ACh Esterase Inhibitor has an effect on the uptake of the ACh, therefore there will be a statistical increase of the amplitude of the muscle with the ACh Esterase Inhibitor in comparison to the amplitude of the muscle without the ACh Esterase Inhibitor. We tested this by measuring the amplitude of the muscle contractions in three different Rania pipien legs at a selected voltage. We first measured the contraction without the ACh Esterase Inhibitor and then followed it by another test after the ACh Esterase Inhibitor was injected into the leg. This allowed for a total of six tests. Our results were somewhat inconclusive due to a variety of reasons.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system responds differently depending on certain conditions and changes. Unlike hormones which take seconds to days to react, the neuromuscular system reacts within milliseconds (Manual, 19). In this experiment, we recorded the amplitude of the muscle contraction using a myogram after injecting the Rania Pipien leg with ACh Esterase Inhibitor. During the muscle contraction, the action potential reaches the axon terminals, opening voltage gated Na+and Ca2+channels. The presence of these ions push the ACh vesicles as they fuse with the membrane to release ACh into the synapse. ACh crosses the synaptic cleft and binds to the ligand gated ion channels on the membrane of the muscle fibers, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The ACh Esterase then takes off the ACh from the receptors on the muscle fibers which closes the sodium channels (Sadava). We hypothesized that the ACh Esterase Inhibitor has an effect on the uptake of the ACh, therefore there will be a statistical increase of the amplitude of the muscle with the ACh Esterase Inhibitor in comparison to the amplitude of the muscle without the ACh Esterase Inhibitor. Other studies involving the muscles in Rania pipiens have shown that anti-esterase treatment has led to an increase in the depolarization (Katz).

Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipien legs, 3Ml of 2% ACh Esterase Inhibitor solution, transducer, thread, syringe, Labscribe software, frog Ringer's solution, forceps, dissecting needle.

Place Rania pipien leg on dissecting pan and grasp the skin at the top of the leg with a pair of forceps and pull it down toward the foot. Make sure to moisten the leg with frog Ringer's solution as needed. Gently separate the inner thigh muscle (upper end to knee) using a dissecting probe. Free the white sciatic nerve using a dissecting needle and forceps, being sure to not mistake it with muscle tissue. Make sure to not free it too close to the knee. Make sure to minimize the metal contact with the nerve. Cut the end of the gastrocnemus and leave the medial end attached. 
Next, make a loop with the thread provided and tie it too the tendon. Then attach the loop of the string to the flat spring of the transducer arm. Place the transducer so that the leg is at a 90angle to table. Pin down the muscle of the leg while avoiding touching the nerve. Insert the 2 muscle stimulators into the leg being sure to avoid touching any of the pins.
Using LabScribe, send nerve impulses to the leg starting at 0.1V until you reach the threshold or what seems to be a maximum contraction. After locating this voltage, send five nerve stimuli to the leg and record the amplitude of each. This is your controlll.
Next inject the leg with 0.1Ml of ACh Esterase Inhibitor (2% solution of Sevin) using a syringe. After two minutes, send five nerve stimuli to the leg at the same voltage as the controlll. Record the amplitudes of these muscle contractions. This is your experimental. Repeat all steps with two more Rania pipien legs.
Using a T-test and compare the controlll groups (the untreated legs) to the experimental group (ACh Esterase Inhibitor treated).


Results:
For our first Rania pipien leg, we found the maximum contraction to be at 3.0V. We then measured the average amplitude of muscle contraction to be 0.365V for the controlll and 0.492V after the leg that was injected with the ACh Esterase Inhibitor. This showed an increase with a P-Value of 0.330066. This P-Value, is considered to be a significent increase and work in favor toward our hypothesis. On the second Rania pipien leg, we shocked it with 2.0V. We measured the average amplitude of muscle contraction to be 1.721V for the controlll and 1.728V after the injection. We the calculated a P-Value of 0.001163. This P-Value, however, is too small to conclude any significent difference in our data. For the third Rania pipien leg, we shocked it at 1.0V. We measured the average amplitude of muscle contraction to be 0.842V for the controlll and then 0.589V after the leg that was injected with the ACh Esterase Inhibitor. This showed a dramatic decrease with a P-Value of 4.93e-5. These results work against our hypothesis.


Discussion:
Our results appeared to be drastically different inhibiting us from making and significent conclusions. I believe that this is due to a number of reasons. The first test we conducted at 3.0V supported our hypothesis while the third test at 1.0V did not. To further study I would test all three frogs at the same voltage, keeping it a constant variable. We shocked the third leg at 3.0V after receiving our results and found the amplitude to increase. This could possibly mean that we incorrectly identified the threshold and maximum muscle contraction. Second, I would test more than just three Rania pipien legs. Having such a small sample size made it difficult to gather enough information in order to prove or disprove our hypothesis. Thirdly, we did not clean the muscle stimulators off after the first Rania pipien leg which could have slightly contaminated our second from leg with ACh Esterase Inhibitor prior to the injection. There were many flaws with this experiment, however, I believe that our hypothesis would be proven correct if these issues were to be resolved.
