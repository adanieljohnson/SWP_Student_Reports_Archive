Title: How the crowdedness of plant affects the root-to-shoot ratio

Abstract:
For the goal of understanding how plants allocate energy, we have designed an experiment to see how mung beans react to the different degree of crowdedness. Our hypothesis is that the plants grew in a high crowdedness would have a bigger root-to-shoot ratio with those grown in a lower crowded environment. Because of the limitation of resource which acted as both the abiotic factor and the natural selection force. Our target species is mung. We had two level of crowdedness for the mung to grow, the mung would grow for a week before we harvest the examples. After harvesting the plant, we used root-to-shoot ratio as our measurable variable and our dependent variable to understand how plants react to the crowdedness of their growing environment. We analyze the raw data with the two-sample t-test. After the experiment, we found out that our data is not strong enough to support our hypothesis, which does not support the concept of plant allocation of energy in plants, that the plants will change their body composition in response to their environment. 


Introduction:
In our experiment, our target species is mung. Mung is one of many species recently moved from the genus Phaseolus to Vigna. Scientists recently discovered that the origin of mung bean is China actually. Mung beans are tropical crops and require warm temperatures. Loamy soil is best for pusap cultivation. (Herbalist of MDidea Extracts Professional, 04/15/14). In any ecological community, the resident plants and animals must interact with and adapt to each other (biotic factors) and the environment (abiotic factors). However due to resource limitations and the fact that organisms can extract only a finite quantity of resources from their environment for growth and reproduction. In response to these natural selection forces, plants would have to evolve to allocate their resources in a particular pattern (Johnson AD.8/11/17). For example, because the portion of the plant above and below ground can absorb a different kind of resources. In this report, we will mainly focus on how plants react to the different degree of crowdedness through their root-to-shoots ratio.
Because plants in the wild environment have different degrees of crowdedness, however, the amount of resources in a certain area is limited. Since every plant needs lots of energy from the soil in order to support their growth and reproduction, we believe that the degree of crowdedness for the mung would cause the plant to make some “trade-off” to absorb enough energy. We decided to use root-to-shoot ratio as our measurement variables. In our experiment, the independent variable is the crowdedness of the plants. We believe that the plants which were placed in a group will have bigger root-to-shoot ratio than the plants which has been placed solo in a pot. Which is due to the reason that the plants grow in higher crowdedness level would have less resource to absorb from the soil. Among all the part of the plant, the root is the part to absorb nutrient from the soil, therefore, they need more roots for their growth. Whereas for the plant grow individually in a pot, the resource they could absorb from the soil in abundant, they don’t need long roots to search and absorb nutrient. Therefore, we believe they will have lower root-to-shoot ratio than those plants grow in a pot with very high crowdedness.


Materials and Methods:
We prepared 6 pots and lots of mung seeds for the experiment. After the preparation, we planted seeds in the pots and wait for them to germinate. For the next week, we watered every pot with the same amount of water every day and gave them enough sunlight. Because some seeds might not be able to germinate, so we planted lots of mug seeds in every pot. After 3 days, we removed most of the plants from 3 of the pots, only left 4 mungs that are far away from each other, to make sure they have very low crowdedness. But for the other three pots, we left all the germinated seeds in the pots. After a week of growth, we harvest all the four mungs from the 3 pots with low crowdedness and chose four random samples from the other three groups with high crowdedness. After harvesting the mungs, we weighed the whole plant together and record the data. After gathering the data, we break apart the vermiculite to separate the root. Gently wash the plants in a container of water and pat them dry with a paper towel. After cleaning each part of the mung, we weighed the root and the shoot of each mung and calculated the root-to-shoot ratio. After gathering all the data, we analyze the data with standard deviation to measure each group and then use the Two-sample t-test to compare the means from two groups of data. 


Results:
The average whole weight of mungs grow in the uncrowded environment is 1.897g, the standard deviation for this is 0.554. The average whole weight of mungs grow in the crowded environment is 0.342g, the standard deviation of this is 0.166. The average root weight for the mungs grow in the uncrowded environment is 0.688g, the standard deviation of this data is 0.221. The average root weight for the mungs grow in the crowded environment is 0.126g, and the standard deviation for mung grow in a highly crowded environment is 0.054. The average shoot weight for mungs grow in the low crowded environment is 1.164g, and the standard deviation for that is 0.341. The mung grew in high crowdedness has an average weight of 0.211kg, and the standard deviation for that is 0.130. Finally, for the root-to-shoot ratio, mungs grew in low crowdedness has the average ratio of 0.590 and the standard deviation is 0.069. As for mungs grew in high crowdedness, their average root-to-shoot ratio is 0.749, and their standard deviation is 0.382. 
Because our experiment has two groups of data of the mean of a control group to the mean of an experimental group, therefore, we should use a two-sample t-test to analyze our data. Also, because our hypothesis is the mungs grow in the crowded environment would have bigger root-to-shoot ratio than mungs grow in a uncrowded environment, so we should use two-tail test instead of one-tail test. The t-value for the root-to-shoot is 1.422, and the P-value for it is 0.169, which is bigger than 0.05, therefore, our data is not strong enough to support our hypothesis. 
From the graph above, we can see that mungs grew in low crowdedness have bigger body weight, which leads to their bigger roots and shoots weight. Also, mungs grew in high crowdedness have larger root-to-shoot ratio than the other mungs that grew with lower crowdedness. 


Discussion:
From the data I presented before, we think that our data do not support our hypothesis, that the mungs grow in higher crowdedness would have bigger root-to-shoot ratio than the mungs grew in the less crowded environment. The reason we believe that the hypothesis might be true is that we thought the mungs grew in high crowdedness needs to have more root to search for the energy they need. However, those mungs that grew in the less crowded environment already have enough energy, therefore, instead of spending much energy in growing roots, they could spend more energy on growing shoots and to absorb all the other nutrients that it cannot absorb under the ground. Comparing two plants grew in different environments, the plants grew in a higher degree of crowdedness would have more roots and shorter shoots than the plants grew in an environment with a lower degree of crowdedness. In our experiment, the crowdedness of their environment is acted as a force of natural selection pressure, and the plants grew in higher crowdedness means they are facing greater pressure than those that grew in a lower degree of crowdedness. However, because the data, we know that our hypothesis cannot be supported. We think there are lots of reasons to explain this result. For example, when the plant faces the pressure from the environment, such as lack of water or nutrients, just like our own experiment, they would have smaller body sizes in general. In our experiment, the average whole weight for the uncrowded mungs is 1.89, and the average whole weight is 0.34, which is a great difference for plants that grew for the same amount of time. So, from our experiment, we realize that plants would tend to have a smaller body weights in general than have a different ratio for each part of the body. We believe the reason for this outcome is because they have very little nutrients and water, so they may not be able to grow roots or shoots, also, growing longer roots doesn’t mean that they would have access to more nutrients, therefore, plants would just have smaller body weight in general, instead of using lots of energy to grow roots and search for nutrients. 
From our experiment, we gain better and deeper understanding about how plant allocation, when they are facing the environmental pressure, instead of changing each part of their body, they would have a smaller body in general. But, because the roots for mungs that grow in a crowded environment are really tangled, so we could only separate the mungs that grew at the edge of the pot, due to that, the examples we choose are not entirely random. The other explanations for the data could be that we didn’t grow them long enough for them to show the significant difference for the root-to-shoot ratio. For the further experiment, we would like to do experiments that grow the plant for longer time and chose different species to see whether the way they allocate their energy would change for different species.
