Title: Neither Curcumin, Neomycin nor a mixture of EDTA and Strontium Chloride has a significant inhibitory effect on the migration rate of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
This study explored the chemotactic effects of various signal transduction antagonist compounds on Physarum polycephalum or what is commonly known as slime mold. Signal transduction is the mechanism used by Physarum to respond to its environment, and it was hypothesized that inhibiting just one step of any signal transduction pathway would lead to decreased growth area. Physarum was cultured on PDA plates that were soaked in specific antagonistic compounds that targeted signaling pathways in order to observe the effect of signal inhibition on growth area. It was found none of these compounds had a significant effect on cell growth and the hypothesis was rejected. Similar experiments on this model have the potential to reveal even more complexity as far up as the innately intelligent signaling pathways of Homo sapiens.

Introduction:
Many organisms sense and respond to their environments through signal transduction pathways. Signal transduction is the process in which a chemical or physical signal from the environment is transmitted through a series of chemical reactions that evoke a response in the cell. In this experiment, Physarum polycephalum was treated with three different antagonist compounds known to inhibit specific steps of the three different signal transduction pathways. Physarum polycephalum is an ideal candidate for this experiment because it is inexpensive, small, easy to grow and replicate, and easy to maintain. It was also a great model organism for experimentation on signal transduction pathways since it shares similar mechanisms of signaling with animals. The objective was to observe whether or not inhibition of these pathways had an effect on Physarum cell migration. Migration is the process by which Physarum grows in a particular direction based on the whether it receives a positive or negative signal from its environment. The present study was interested in whether Physarum chemotaxis (the sensing of molecules) would be positive or negative in response to the provided antagonists. Physarum is known to use the cAMP-mediated, the IP3 mediated and the Ion channel-coupled pathways for signal transduction. Curcumin was known to target Protein Kinase A in the cAMP-mediated path, EDTA + Strontium Chloride inhibited surface Ca2+ receptors in the Ion channel-coupled pathway, and Neomycin targeted the IP3 molecule itself in the IP3 mediated pathway. Previous studies have indicated that uniformly distributed chemorepellents on the substrate are known to increase the period of contractility and to decrease the growth area of the organism [Costello, B: 2014]. It is expected that area growth will be less under all three antagonist compounds. If inhibition of signaling pathways decreases growth, it is expected that all three antagonist compounds will cause growth area to decrease [Johnson: 2016].

Materials and Methods:
Physarum was cultured for 48-hours on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates that were soaked with the antagonist compounds. The plates were soaked for 10 minutes with the antagonist compounds diluted to specific concentrations and excess liquid was drained out after the 10-minute interval. The EDTA + Strontium mixture was 1mM for each compound. The Neomycin was diluted to 1mg/ml and the Curcumin was diluted to 10mM. Three replicates were used for each antagonist and three replicates were also used for a blank. Since PDA plates are food sources for Physarum, no other food source was added. A 1 cm cube of stock Physarum was placed in the center of each plate with the Physarum flat against the agar. All plates were covered with a lid and sealed with parafilm to prevent a loss of moisture. All plates were incubated in a dark cubie in order to avoid the confounding effect of light on migratory response. After 48 hours, area was measured. An ANOVA test and subsequent Tukey-Kramer tests were performed for analysis of the data.

Results:
An ANOVA test (Table 2) and subsequent Tukey-Kramer (Table 3) tests revealed no significant difference between any of the treatment groups. One replicate of EDTA + Strontium Chloride was determined to be an outlier. An ANOVA test was conducted both with (α=0.05, p= 0.317) and without the outlier (α=0.05, p=0.2). The test results used for interpretation were only those calculated without the outlier, even though significance was not present in either test.

Discussion:
Signal transduction pathways are the main mechanisms by which Physarum polycephalum can sense and respond to its environment. It was hypothesized that the inhibition of any of the known signaling pathways would drastically impair Physarum migration since inhibiting any of them could have prevented the reception of a growth signal. According to the results (Table 1, 2) of this experiment, this hypothesis is rejected because no significant difference in growth area was found between the treatment groups and the Physarum given no inhibitor. Perhaps, the inhibition of one signaling pathway is not sufficient for significant growth inhibition. Another possibility is that all three mechanisms play a role in cell migration and that the inhibition of one pathway only affects part of the growth mechanism rather than stopping growth altogether. On the other hand, growth may not have been impeded because the inhibitor was present at every location of the agar dish. Physarum might have ignored the inhibitory signal because no other route for growth existed. Similarly, the Physarum might have overridden the inhibitory signal with that of a positive food signal since food was present throughout the agar dish. Though, this is unlikely because a previous study indicates that inhibition from a chemorepellent is preferred over attraction from a chemoattractant [Costello B: 2014]. Granted the results of the present study do not represent this trend, it is still possible that some growth signaling was inhibited since the chemorepellent covered the entire agar dish. In addition, one article indicates that combinations of agonists and antagonists can produce a unique signal response based on the relative number of stimuli given by each [Brown A: 1991]. In the present study, this implies that even though an inhibitory signal was received, the Physarum could continue to grow towards the chemoattractant food. Contrastingly, a different study indicates that inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase or its ability to interact with A kinase anchoring proteins prevents chemotactic cell migration [Howe A: 2005]. In the present study, curcumin was used as the inhibitor that would target protein kinase A in the cAMP-mediated path. However, the results indicate that no significant difference in migration existed. This means that either not enough inhibitor was used or that inhibition of protein kinase A does not necessarily stop chemotactic cell migration. It is also important to note that the amount of cell migration observed directly correlates with the time allotted for growth in the presence of an inhibitor. Interestingly, one experiment found that calcium causes significant growth in the first 48 hours of incubation, but after 72 hours, calcium significantly decreased the growth [Terry L: 2009]. Perhaps, if the present study took measurements for 72 hours in 24-hour increments, similar trends of migration could have been observed. Another important factor in the migration of Physarum is the functionality of its actin microfilaments that extend the leading edges for growth. Recent experiments performed on Dictyostelium discoideum found that the family of WASPs (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins) mediate the complex that produces the branching actin filaments. The homologs of WASP in D. discoidium localize to the poles of migrating cells. Cells with low levels of WASP are unable to aggregate [Franca-Koh J: 2006]. Since WASP family proteins seem to be directly involved in cell migration, further studies should be conducted examining the effect on Physarum cells lacking this family of proteins. Doing so would determine whether or not this WASP related mechanism could exist in other migrating species. Such studies would also allow researchers to explore the applicability of this knowledge on other species’ cell processes such as mitosis. Overall, more research must be conducted to fully understand the mechanism by which growth occurs in Physarum and the extent to which various antagonistic compounds impede growth in the simultaneous presence of a chemoattractant.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 depicts the average growth area for each of the treatment groups after a 48-hour time interval. Error bars represent the standard error above and below the mean for replicates within each treatment group. An outlier within the EDTA + Strontium Chloride group is represented with an X. Trends shown above were calculated and a represented without this outlier datum. The most growth was observed in the blank, followed by EDTA+Strontium Chloride, Curcumin and Neomycin. Differences in growth area between groups varied at most by just over 1 cm2.
