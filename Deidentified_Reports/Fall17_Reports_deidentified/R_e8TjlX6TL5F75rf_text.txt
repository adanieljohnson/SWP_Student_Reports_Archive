Title: The Effect of Exercise on the Metabolic Rate of Cambarus sp. 

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to see how the metabolic rate of Cambarus sp., commonly known as crayfish, is affected by exercise. We hypothesized that if we exercised the crayfish, then their metabolic rates would be higher compared to the metabolic rates of crayfish at rest. Metabolic reactions occur in the mitochondria where ATP is produced, supplying energy to the rest of the cell and metabolic rate refers to the amount of energy being expended by all physiologic processes. To measure metabolic rate, oxygen consumption was measured because it is directly proportional to metabolic rate. Three crayfish of similar weights were placed in a screw-top glass testing chamber one at a time and their initial oxygen consumption was measured. Then, lab partners took turns swirling a straw around inside the crayfish tanks, causing them to move. The crayfish were placed back into the testing chamber after exercise and oxygen consumption was measured again. A paired t_test was run and the p_value was 0.501. Our hypothesis that an increase in exercise would lead to an increase in metabolic rate was not supported nor rejected.

Introduction:
We hypothesized that if we exercised the crayfish, then their metabolic rates would be higher compared to the metabolic rates of crayfish at rest. Animal studies have generally shown that single exercise events and longer-term training produce increases in metabolic rate [Speakman, J.R.: 200]. In this experiment, Cambarus sp., or commonly known as crayfish, was the organism that was studied in order to understand how metabolic rate can be influenced. Crayfish are found in freshwater and their bodies are broken into segments. They also have powerful claws for defense and for obtaining food. Metabolic reactions occur in the mitochondria which is where nutrients are broken down and converted into energy that can be used by the organism. First, glucose is broken into two pyruvates which is converted into acetate and carbon dioxide. During this process, electrons are released which travel between molecules in an electron transport chain. The electron transport chain uses energy released from electrons to generate ATP. ATP is the main source of energy for metabolic functions [Johnson: 2017]. There are a few ways to measure metabolic rate, but for the purpose of this experiment, oxygen consumption was measured. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose. The dependent variable is metabolic rate and the independent variable is rest or exercise. We used crayfish because they can be put into water chambers to measure oxygen consumption. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, Cambarus sp. was used to determine the effect of exercise on metabolic rate. First, three crayfish of similar weight were collected and placed in tanks. Next, a crayfish that had been resting was placed in the screw-top glass testing chamber and the chamber was placed in a room-temperature tub. The oxygen consumption was recorded every five minutes. After twenty minutes, the crayfish was gently placed back into the tank and the volume of the water in the chamber was recorded. Next, the crayfish was exercised. We exercised the crayfish by taking a straw and swirling it around the tank and prodding the crayfish to move for ten minutes. These steps were repeated for the second two crayfish. The statistical test used was a paired t_test comparing the same crayfish while at rest and directly after exercise. 

Results:
Figure 1. 
Cambarus sp. was used to measure metabolic rate. The p_value for this experiment was 0.501, n=3, the t-value was 0.814, and the degrees of freedom was 2. The standard deviation for the controlll crayfish was 0.00925 and the standard deviation for the experimental crayfish was 0.00414. For the first trial, the metabolic rate of the exercised crayfish was much higher than the metabolic rate while the crayfish was at rest. For the second trial, the metabolic rate for the resting crayfish was higher than the metabolic rate of the exercised crayfish. For the third trial, the exercise metabolic rate for the crayfish was slightly higher than the resting metabolic rate. It is odd that the metabolic rate for the second crayfish was higher when resting than after exercise. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that an increase in exercise would lead to an increase in metabolic rate was not supported nor rejected because the p_value was 0.501. This contrasts with the literature which states that animal studies have generally shown that single exercise events and longer-term training produce increases in metabolic rate [Speakman, J.R.: 200]. Exercise should stimulate the rate at which the mitochondria produces ATP, therefore increasing metabolic rate. There are some errors that could have occurred in this experiment. For example, it is possible that each of the experimental crayfish were not exercised equal amounts. Some crayfish were more reluctant to move than others. In addition, some of the controlll crayfish that were supposed to be resting may have been moving more on their own. This may be why the second trial shows that the metabolic rate when the crayfish was resting was higher than its metabolic rate directly after exercise. The literature also states that studies in animals that measure the effect of voluntary exercise regimens on metabolic rate are less commonly performed and do not show the same response as that to forced exercise [Speakman, J.R.: 200]. The next logical step in this study would be to modify the experiment by measuring involuntary exercise. As stated in the article, voluntary exercise may yield different results than involuntary exercise.
