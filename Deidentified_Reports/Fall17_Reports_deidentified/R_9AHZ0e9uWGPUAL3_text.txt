Title:  Body Size Influence Aggressive Behaviors of Species

Abstract:
It is common to see that in nature, intraspecific competition between the same species is always along with the display of certain degree of animals’ aggressive behaviors. Our goal is to study whether body size is associated with the degree of animals’ aggressive behaviors, when referring to intraspecific competition. We mainly choose to study Betta Splenden, because they are perfect example of displaying aggressive behaviors. We hypothesize that the fish that are larger is more aggressive than the smaller on, because their difference in body size. For our experiment, we choose several median size fish and put them into eye contact with the larger size fish and the smaller size fish, and we mainly record the time interval of the duration of aggressive behaviors displayed by smaller fish and the larger fish. Not surprisingly, our result from the experiment successfully support our hypothesis to be valid--- body size does influence the aggressive behaviors of Betta fish and the larger one is more aggressive. In later part of the discussion, we try to explain this phenomenon by applying the knowledge we learnt and the resources we collect.

Introduction:
The study of animals’ aggressive behaviors is always associated with the understanding of intraspecific competition, the competition within the same species. In nature, competition is unavoidable, since resources are limited and individuals can get into contact with each other as they reach the same resource, especially for males [Birch: 1957]. It is a rather normal for males to combat to win over the favor of females and dominance rights in order to increase their own reproductive success, such as the certain species of deer or chimpanzee. However, the capability of a male to compete is depended on its both physical and social environment. [Zajitschek: 2008]. For example, the competitor who owns big body size is able to gain certain advantages in competition and have higher reproductive success. Thus, in our experiment, we want to find out that whether body size can influence animals’ aggressive behaviors due to intraspecific competition. We chose to use Betta Splenden, because this kind of species is identified with easily observable aggression behaviors that are sort to different levels. We hypothesized that body size can influence the aggressive behaviors of Betta fish, and the bigger one tends to be more aggressive.

Materials and Methods:
We selected six male middle size Betta fish, one small fish and one big. Every time, we choose one middle size fish with the small fish and the big one, and put them independently in to three glass boxes which were separated by opaque board to prevent the fish from seeing each other. We first remove the board between the small size male fish and the middle size one, and record the endurance of time that the small fish start to show aggressive behaviors, for example, tail beating, showing “red mane”, standing dorsal fin, and so on to the time that it starts to ignore its competitor. Later, we put the board back and let the middle size fish rest for about five minutes, and then remove the board between the middle size fish and the big one. This time, we record the duration of aggressive behaviors of the big size fish. We repeat the same process for five times with the changing of the middle size fish, and we keep tracking the behaviors of the small and big size fish.  
Statistical Analysis: we use paired T test to examine how different the duration of the aggressive behaviors of the small size and the big size fish. We intentionally remove the data from the trial 1 and trail 3, because the big size fish does not show any aggressive behaviors, which contains significant difference than the other data.


Results:
From the figure, we can find out the average duration of displaying aggressive behaviors of larger fish is significantly longer than that of the small fish. Also, we have calculated the P value for the paired T test. And the result is that, P value equals to 0.047508 for the comparison of the duration of time of aggressive period for the small size fish and the big size fish. Since this value is bigger than 0.05, we can conclude that our experiment provides convincing evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is that there is no correlation between body size and aggressive behaviors. 

Discussion:
From our experiment, we conclud that the species that who have larger body size is more aggressive than the one who is smaller, and since the smaller owns obvious disadvantages in the combat, they are less active in showing aggressive behaviors, and it correlates to the observation that even in the same gender of crabs, smaller crabs are especially dominated, spending more time to avoid contact with other male or female crabs [Beattie: 2012]. Additionally, we can also explain this phenomena by applying to Game Theory, which generally, is to predict the behavior of individuals in contest: individuals tend to assess each other’s competitive abilities, or resource-holding potentials (RHPs) [Enquist and Leimar: 1983]. According to the Game Theory models, individuals with the lower RHP are likely to quite competition early or totally avoid to fight, because it is possible for them to have greater cost if they make the wrong decision [Beattue: 2012]. Thus, we can understand our result by applying the game theory, as since both the larger size (with higher RHP) and the smaller size (with lower RHP) individuals understand well their own advantages and disadvantages during combat, so the larger one tends to maximize its advantages, by being more aggressive, while the smaller choose to retreat or avoid from the conflict in order to minimize the cost.

The figure depict the difference of the duration of the aggressive behaviors of small size Betta fish and the big one. In the figure, we include the data collected from trial 1 and trial 3, though they can be regarded as outlier.
