Title: Display of Branchiostegal Membranes in Betta splendens is Not Affected by Size of Opponents 

Abstract:
Through the planned interactions between Betta splendens, this study attempts to show how sizes of individuals within species can impact the threat felt by the individuals. Other studies have shown that size of fish influences the assertion of dominance through aggressive displays. The most aggressive display of the Betta splendens is the protruding of the branchiostegal membranes. The Betta splendens that are smaller in comparison to their opponent will likely have more displays of the protruding of the branchiostegal membranes in order to attempt to assert their dominance since the larger the opponent is, the greater the threat may be perceived as. Through several trials involving four replicates and a small and a large fish, the hypothesis was tested, however it was not supported by the experiment because of ambiguity of the data.


Introduction:
Animals often have reactions when perceiving or facing a threat, whether that threat is coming from an opponent of their own species or from another species. These reactions are examples of either interspecific or intraspecific behaviors. Interspecific reactions occur between individuals of different species and intraspecific behaviors occur between members of the same species [Johnson: 2017]. Betta splendens, more commonly known as betta fish or Siamese fighting fish, commonly display intraspecific behaviors of broadside movements and facing movements, both of with are acts of aggression. This experiment focuses on the intraspecific interactions between betta fish, more specifically the most aggressive facing movement display of the protruding of the branchiostegal membranes, also called red “mane”. Other aggressive behaviors include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, erect pectoral fins, and spreading of opercula [Lynn: 2007]. Since betta fish have aggressive tendencies, like red mane, they were an appropriate species to use when testing how size of an opponent influences how often and how long the most aggressive tendencies are shown. Studies of other fish have shown that the size of opponents influences which fish will assert dominance over the other fish [Beaugrand: 1991]. The purpose of this experiment is to test the hypothesis that if the betta fish is smaller, then the opponent will have a higher frequency and longer duration display of red mane because the opponent perceives its opponent as more of a threat.


Materials and Methods:
After deciding upon which betta fish were going to be the small fish and the large fish, we then had to find four medium sized betta fish to be used as the replicates for each of the trials; all of the betta fish used in this experiment are male. Required materials for this experiment are a fish tank with three glass partitions (as seen in Image 1), seven male betta fish (one small, four medium, one large), and a device to time red mane. The betta fish were all collected at a pet store and they were maintained by the Wake Forest Biology Department. The hypothesis was tested by exposing each of the four medium-sized replicates to the small fish and the large fish for five minute periods, at different times and with a glass partition in between, with a minimum of five minute rests for all of the fish in between the trials. While the fish are in their resting period an opaque partition is placed in between the fish so that they can no longer see one another and with hopes of preventing habituation. While the fish were exposed to one another the frequency of red mane was recorded in number of times and the duration of red mane was recorded in seconds. After all of the trials are completed, the frequencies and durations of red mane were compared through paired t-tests.


Results:
While the experiment was taking place there were noticeable differences between the betta fish in whether some fish would respond or not. The paired t-tests also exemplified the large scale of reactions between the betta fish. The results from the paired t-test for the frequency of the red mane can be seen in Chart 1. While it appears that the small fish overall have a much greater red mane reaction than the large fish when facing an opponent, which is what happened with the specific betta fish that we used, but this might not necessarily be true if the test were to be done again because the p-value from this set of data is 0.391, meaning that it does not have significance. This p-value is very high, especially considering that the p-value should be below 0.05 for something that could be easily repeated. The results from the paired t-test for the duration of the red mane can be seen in Chart 2. The p-value from this set of data is 0.345, meaning that it is not significant, and that the results of the duration of red mane could vary greatly if this experiment were to be done again. Overall the results of the paired t-tests further prove that the frequency and duration of the display of red mane can fluctuate from one betta to the next, resulting in high p-values.


Discussion:
The results from this experiment did not support the hypothesis, especially because of the lack of uniformity of the display of red mane in response to both the small and the large betta fish. Being that betta fish are highly aggressive in most contexts, it is somewhat odd that there was not a more frequent display of red mane, however, there were displays of the other aggressive behaviors like: tail beating, tail flashing, and erect pectoral fins. The extreme behavior of the protruding of the branchiostegal membranes might not have occurred as frequently as predicted because there was the glass partition in between the betta fish, and due to possible habituation. The betta fish that were used in this study had been used in biology labs all throughout the week prior as well. Despite giving the betta fish resting periods, it is still very possible and very likely that some, if not most, of the betta fish that were used in this experiment had habituated. The waning of aggressive tendencies is found to be a common result when betta fish are put in environments where they are repeatedly exposed to stimulating environments [Peeke 1970]. This could be a source of error in that it is not known the extent in which the betta fish that were used in our experiment were habituated or not. If this experiment were to be repeated it is important to use betta fish that are not habituated. Other explanations of the data could be that the sizes were not different enough, or not extreme enough for the fish to want to assert dominance, or to subdue to the larger fish. The next logical step for this study would be to add in more replicates and find betta fish with more drastically different sizes and repeat the general procedure. Most species can get violent when it comes to asserting authority or dominance over one another, and betta fish are no exception, unless they are used to being around the larger and greater perceived threat.
