Title: The Effect of Salinity on Specific Metabolic Rate

Abstract:
The objective of this lab is to study the effect salinity has on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. Oxygen consumption is important when looking at metabolic rate because it is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended by an organism. Three crayfish were used, and each served as their own controlll. A dissolved oxygen probe was used to measure oxygen use over the time span of twenty minutes for both controlll and treatment trials. Our hypothesis is that an increase in salinity will lead to an increase in specific metabolic rate because the crayfish will expend more energy by having to push out an excess of Na+ and Cl- ions. The alternative hypothesis is that salinity would increase specific metabolic rate. After doing a paired t_test, the p_value was 0.4644, meaning there was not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The data came to be inconclusive. Further studies should be with more crayfish to get more accurate and reliable results. 

Introduction:
Metabolic reactions play an essential role in organisms, allowing plants and animals to grow and function. These reactions consist of breaking down and building complex molecules. The mitochondria of a cell are mainly responsible for these biological reactions. When high energy molecules are converted to low energy molecules, the energy released is captured in the form of ATP. This unit of “molecular currency” is then used to carry out bodily functions. The amount of energy used by the biological processes is the metabolic rate. This could be measured through ATP synthesis, but the process for finding this out is complex. A simpler way to look at metabolic rate is through oxygen consumption. It is directly proportional to the amount of energy used up, and can be used to calculate specific metabolic rate, which is the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass over time.
    Many environmental factors can affect oxygen consumption, having a direct effect on specific metabolic rate. Salinity could be one of these factors. We will be using crayfish, Procambris sp., to test how salinity affects specific metabolic rate. Na+ and Cl- ions could potentially cause the cell to shrink through osmosis. Water potential explains this shrinkage of the cell. When there is an increase in solute(ions) outside of the cell, water flows out of the cell to bring the water potential to an equilibrium. This decrease of water in the cell causes it to shrink. To prevent the shrinkage of these cells, an organism has to find a way to push out these ions through active transport, which requires energy. Supporting this idea is study done on the Euryhaline milkfish, Chanos chanos, which stated that an increased salinity would pose energetic regulatory costs for the transport of ions outside of the body [Swanson 1998]. The Euryhaline milkfish is comparable to the crayfish because they both have to regulate for changes in an underwater environment, such as salinity. The crayfish like the milkfish has to use up more energy to push out excess Na+ and Cl- ions that are entering the body. With this information, our hypothesis is that an increase in salinity will cause a direct increase in the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish, Procambris sp. 


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, obtain three crayfish that are all relatively the same size. Each one will serve as their own controlll. Doing one crayfish at a time, weigh the first one and record its weight. Then, fill up the container that the crayfish will be placed in with room temperature water. Keep the temperature of the water constant throughout the experiment to prevent any cofounding variables from affecting the results. Once the container is filled, place it in the water bath and carefully place the crayfish inside. Then, seal it with the dissolved oxygen reader. Once the reader stabilizes for the initial measurement, oxygen use should be recorded every five minutes. After twenty minutes of recording dissolved oxygen, pour the water from the container into a graduated cylinder and record the volume of the water. Once the water is disposed of, the salt solution must be made for the treatment trial. Mix 100 Ml of 6.5% NaCl with 900 Ml of water, and pour this solution into the container with the same crayfish. Like the controlll, record the dissolved oxygen every five minutes for twenty minutes and record the volume of the water from the container once done. For the following two crayfish, repeat the same steps for both the controlll and treatment trial. Once all data has been recorded, use the volume of the water, change in dissolved oxygen, elapsed time, and weight in grams to calculate the specific metabolic rate. Multiply the change in dissolved oxygen and volume of the water from the graduated cylinder. Divide this number by the elapsed time and weight of the crayfish. To finalize results, conduct a paired t_test to determine if the data was able to reject the null hypothesis.




Results:
After doing a paired t_test with a sample size of three and two degrees of freedom, the p_value came out to be 0.4644. In our data, the first and largest crayfish, weighing 33.74 grams, had a specific metabolic rate of 0.00101 (mgO2/(g*min)) for the controlll trial. The second crayfish was the smallest, weighing 28.98 grams and had a specific metabolic rate of 0.000314 (mgO2/(g*min)) for the controlll trial. These two data points themselves do not make sense based on previous experiments done on how size affects metabolic rate. The error bars from Figure 1 show that the data was spread out. The values for these error bars for the controlll and treatment group are respectively 0.00121± 0.000827 mg O2*g-1*min-1 and 0.00124± 0.00044 mg O2*g-1* min-1.  

Discussion:
With a significance level of 0.05, the p_value of 0.4644 from the paired t_test does not provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. According to the data, salinity does not increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. Although the data failed to reject the null hypothesis, there is reason to believe our data was flawed. As mentioned in the results, the specific metabolic rates for the controlll trials of the first and second crayfish suggest that something is wrong. Based on previous experiments done on lab, the smaller crayfish is supposed to have a larger specific metabolic rate than the larger crayfish because metabolic rate decreases as size increases and vice versa. This data also goes against Swanson’s study that concluded that higher salinities led to energetic regulatory costs [Swanson 1998]. The increase in salinity should have caused an increase in specific metabolic rate because the crayfish needs more energy for active transport, which regulates for the Na+ and Cl- ions. Overall, there is evidence for flaws in our data. Further tests should be done on the effect of salinity on specific metabolic rate for more reliable results. The use of more crayfish could also help results be more accurate. It is essential to understand how salinity affects organisms like the crayfish because it tells us whether or not it can survive in areas of high salinity, such as the ocean. While the Procambris sp. was the model organism for this experiment, it can also help us understand how other freshwater animals would react in high salinity.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This figure shows the average metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. for both the controlll and increased salinity trials. The sample size of this study was three (n=3). The values for the error bars of the controlll and treatment group are respectively 0.00121± 0.000827 mg O2*g-1*min-1 and 0.00124± 0.00044 mg O2*g-1* min-1. The p_value for a one tailed paired t_test came out to be 0.4644.
