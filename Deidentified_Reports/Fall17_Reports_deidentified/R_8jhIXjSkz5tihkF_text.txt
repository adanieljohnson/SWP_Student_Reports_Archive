Title: The Effect of Increased Salinity on Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambris sp. 

Abstract:
In this study, we investigated the effect of increased salinity on specific metabolic rate in Procambris sp. When the salinity of an environment is increased, an organism must expend more energy in order to maintain their internal water levels, and because of this, we hypothesized that when salinity is increased, the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. will also increase.  The Procambris sp. were placed into test chamber with water that had a salinity of either 0‰ or 0.0065‰ and allowed to respire for 20 minutes. The dissolved oxygen concentration was measured before and after the 20 minutes and the specific metabolic rate was calculated for each trial. There was an increase in specific metabolic rate as salinity increased from an average of 0.00240 +/-7.7 x 10⁻⁴mg O2/(g*min.) to 0.00278 +/-9.5 x 10⁻⁴ mg O2/(g*min.); however, this increase was not statistically significent. Overall, more testing needs to be done with more organisms, longer experimental run times, and higher salinities in order to determine the effect of increased salinity on specific metabolic rate.     

Introduction:
In order to carry out the physiological functions necessary to survive, an organism must capture, convert, and expend energy.  Maintaining homeostasis is one of the main energy expenditures of an animal, and maintaining internal water balance is a primary component of maintaining homeostasis for all organisms but especially aquatic organisms where the salinity, or total number of salts dissolved in the water, of their environment threatens their livelihood.  When the salinity of an organisms’ environment differs from the optimal range, they must expend energy in order to balance their internal water levels.  Water passively moves by osmosis from areas of low solute concentration to areas of high solute concentration, meaning that an increase in the solutes in the aquatic environment of an organism will cause water to flow out of their cells and into the environment, and vice versa if solute concentration is decreased.  Energy, in the form of ATP, is used to either pump out excess water that enters the cells or retain the water that is in the cells already.  This energy usage, along with all the energy an organism uses, can be measured by measuring metabolic rate.  Metabolic rate can be measured by recording oxygen consumption since an organism converts O2 to H2O during respiration by donating an electron to O2 in order to power the conversion of ADP to ATP, the energy source of cells [Johnson: 2017].  Thus, metabolic rate, or energy expenditure, can be measured by measuring respiration rate, or oxygen consumption.  Allan, et. al examined the effects of increased salinity on respiration rate in the caridean shrimp Palaemon peringueyi and found that an increase in salinity led to an increase in respiration rate [Allan, et. al: 2006].  Due to these findings, we designed an experiment to test the effect of increased salinity on the metabolic rate of the crayfish Procambris sp.  Procambris sp. was chosen as the test species in our experiment because they are tolerant of a wide range of temperatures allowing them to survive during testing and because they are similar organisms to the species studied in the Allan, et. al study.  We tested the effects of increased salinity on the metabolic rate by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed in order to determine the amount of energy expended in order to maintain water balance.  The independent variable in our experiment is the salinity level of the water, either 0 parts per thousand or 0.0065 parts per thousand.  Our null hypothesis is that increasing the salinity of the water will have no effect on the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp.  Our alternative hypothesis is that increasing the salinity of the water will increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. because the organisms will have to expend more energy by working to retain the water in its cells in order to maintain internal water balance and homeostasis.      

Materials and Method:
First, we filled the test chamber with 22 degrees C water.  Then, we weighed a Procambris sp. and put it into the test chamber.  We put the test chamber into the dishpan filled with water at 22 degrees C and sealed the test chamber with the probe.  We allowed the probe to stabilize and then took the initial reading of dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/L.  We took a reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration every 5 minutes for 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, we determined the volume of water in the test chamber in Ml.  Then, we emptied the test chamber and refilled it with water that had a salinity of 1: 10.  To make the water with this salinity, we diluted 100Ml of 6.5% NaCl with 900Ml of distilled water.  We put the same Procambris sp. as used in the first trial in the test chamber with increased salinity and repeated the same procedure.  We ran two trials, one with distilled water and one with high salinity water, on the remaining two Procambris sp.  We calculated the specific metabolic rate of each trial and used a one-tailed paired t_test to determine if the difference in specific metabolic rate between the distilled water and high salinity water trials was significent.     

Results:
Increasing salinity from 0‰ to 0.0065‰ produced a larger decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration, and thus increasing salinity increased both respiration rate and specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp.  The average specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. in water with salinity of 0‰ was 0.00240 +/-7.7 x 10⁻⁴mg O2/(g*min.), and the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. in water with salinity of 0.0065‰ was 0.00278 +/-9.5 x 10⁻⁴ mg O2/(g*min.). The one-tailed paired t_test produced a t_statistic of 3.001 and a P-value of 0.095 for 2 degrees of freedom and an alpha value of 0.05.  In all trials of both salinities, the Procambris sp. were not moving very much while undergoing testing.  

Discussion:
Because the P-value of 0.095 was larger than the alpha value 0.05, we fail to accept our alternative hypothesis that increasing salinity will increase specific metabolic rate.  We must accept our null hypothesis that increasing the salinity of the water the Procambris sp. are in will have no effect on their specific metabolic rate.  While we fail to accept our alternative hypothesis, it appears like increased salinity did have an impact on specific metabolic rate as the average specific metabolic rate increased when salinity increased from 0‰ to 0.0065‰.  The increased salt concentration in the surrounding environment caused water to begin to rush out of the Procambris sp. cells by osmosis, and the Procambris sp. had to expend more energy in order to stop this efflux of water.  This increased energy expenditure resulted in higher respiration rates as more ADP needed to be converted to ATP, causing more O2 to be converted to H2O, and thus, greater reduction in dissolved oxygen concentration over the 20 minutes for the trials at a salinity of 0.0065‰.  It is likely that our results were not statistically significent because our sample size was too small and the amount of time we ran the experiment over was too short.  If we had run the experiment for a longer amount of time, then the dissolved oxygen concentration would have decreased by a larger amount allowing more time for the difference of specific metabolic rate between a salinity of 0‰ and 0.0065‰ to become more pronounced.  Furthermore, our results may not have been significent due to the level of salinity we used.  In the experiment carried out by Allan, et. al, a salinities of up to 45‰ were used indicating that higher salinities may need to be used in order to get significent results [Allan, et. al: 2006].  More tests need to be done to examine the effects of higher salinities on the specific metabolic rates of Procambris sp.  While our results differed from the study carried out by Allan, et. al in that we did not find a significent increase in metabolic rate after increasing salinity, our results began to indicate this trend [Allan, et. al: 2006].  We need to further test the effects of increased salinity on specific metabolic rates of Procambris sp. by using more test subjects, running the experiment for longer than 20 minutes, and testing salinities higher than 0.0065‰.
