Title: Comparing Specific Metabolic Rate in Procambarus spp in Oxygenated and Carbonated Water

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to study how different aqueous environments affect the specific metabolic rate in Procambarus spp, or the common crawfish. This experiment involved the use of 3 Procambarus spp, and measured their oxygen consumption in a normal room temperature water solution, and a solution that had been diluted with 100 mL of carbonated water. It was hypothesized that when in the solution with carbonated water, the Procambarus spp would experience an increase in specific metabolic rate, as the increased molecular presence in the water makes it more difficult for the Procambarus spp to pull oxygen from the surrounding water across their gill membranes. However, the results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis and were instead highly inconclusive. A paired t-test produced a p-value of 0.246, showing the lack of correlation between the control and experiment group. Based on the results, it can be concluded that carbonated water does not affect specific metabolic rate. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we are observing metabolic rate in Procambarus spp, and how it changes in different aqueous environments. This phenomenon of elevated CO¬2 content in water, or hypercapnia, is being observed all over the world, making this experiment relevant to our current society (Pörtner 2004). Hypercapnia is becoming more common as CO2 content of the atmosphere is rising due to global warming, causing the CO2 content of water to also rise. Hypercapnia leads to reduced performance and movement in organisms, causing them to expend more energy in order to the same tasks (Dissanayake 2011). 
Similar to this investigation, the experiment of Dissanayake used oxygen consumption as a surrogate measurement for metabolic rate. Oxygen consumption is the most accurate way to measure metabolic rate, as oxygen is required for cellular respiration, and its intake is directly proportional to energy expenditure. 
The experiment of Dissanayake studied the effects of hypercapnia on Metapenaeus joyneri, a species of prawn, while this investigation studied Procambarus spp. While this has not been studied before directly in Procambarus spp, it is believed that this experiment should produce similar results, as both are species of crustaceans. Crustaceans undergo respiration by pulling an “external medium past their gas exchange surfaces”, or by pumping external water across their gills (Lake 2008). If this external medium is filled with excess particles, additional energy is required to pump water across the gills. Therefore, it is hypothesized that increasing the CO2 content of the water will cause metabolic rate to rise, as the Procambarus spp will have to expend more energy in order to undergo respiration. 


Materials and Methods:
Gather 3 crawfish of about equal size and weigh them. Take one crawfish and place it in a full mason jar of room temperature water. Seal off the mason jar entirely with the oxygen reader inside, and read the starting O2 content. Read the O2 content of the water every 5 minutes for the next 20 and record the results. When 20 minutes has passed, record the volume of water in the mason jar. Repeat steps 2-5 for the other two crawfish. Then, take the first crawfish again and place him a mason jar filled with 100 mL of carbonated water and the rest filled with room temperature water.   Once again, seal off the system entirely with the oxygen reader inside and read the initial O2 content of the water. Read the O2 content of the system every 5 minutes for the next 20 and record the results. After 20 minutes has passed, record the volume of liquid in the mason jar and determine the carbonated water content of the system.   Repeat steps 7-10 for the other 2 crawfish. Metabolic rate will be determined by measuring oxygen consumption, determined by measuring the change in oxygen consumption of the system. Once all results are recorded, calculate specific metabolic rate in each crawfish for the control and experimental procedures. Specific metabolic rate will be calculated using the formula SMR=((∆O2 × Volume H2O (mL)) )/((Time × Weight (g))  Run a paired t-test to determine the statistical difference between the control and experiment group.

Results:
The paired t-test produced a p-value of 0.246. The standard deviation in the control group was 0.00052915, and the standard deviation in the experiment group was 0.001069268. 

Discussion:
As can be seen in Figure 1, and Figure3, the results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis, and instead produced inconsistent results. Figure 1 shows the calculated values for specific metabolic rate in each Procambarus spp tested in normal oxygenated water and in the carbonated water solution. Reading the data clearly displays the differences in specific metabolic rate, and shows the wide range in results. Figure 3 is a bar graph displaying the average specific metabolic rate in the control and experimental group, with high and low error bars that represent the standard deviation in each group. While experiment 1 supported the hypothesis by experiencing a higher specific metabolic rate when in the carbonated water, both experiments 2 and 3 produced results that did not. In fact, experiments 2 and 3 produced significantly lower specific metabolic rates after being placed in the carbonated water solution. Therefore, it can be concluded that hypothesis was proven incorrect. 
It is interesting that this experiment found that carbonated water on average lowered specific metabolic rate, as this result is not conclusive with the results of prior experiments. In theory, an increase in CO¬2 content in water should cause an increase in metabolic rate, as it is more energy is required for cellular respiration (Pörtner 2004). No other experiments were found that test specific metabolic rate in Procambarus spp; however, one experiment was found that tested specific metabolic rate in Metapenaeus joyneri. This is a good comparison, as both the Procambarus spp and the in Metapenaeus joyneri are classified in the Decapod order. The experiments of Dissanayake found that in hypercapnia, the specific metabolic rate of Metapenaeus joyneri was almost 500% greater than Metapenaeus joyneri in a standard oxygenated environment, therefore proving their hypothesis (Disssanayake 2011). 
This experiment with Procambarus spp produced results that were exactly opposite. Since other, similar experiments produced different results in line with current scientific thought and reasoning, it can be concluded that there was error throughout this experiment. Although only experiment 2 and 3 produced results inconclusive with the hypothesis, the error is not limited to these two experiments, as every trial for each Procambarus spp was conducted in the same manner using the same tools. The most likely source of error is a leak in the system that allowed excess O2 to enter, affecting the O2 content of the water. In future experiments, the researchers need to make sure that there are no issues with the system and the recording device that would compromise the experiment. Another source of error could have arisen from the Procambarus spp that were used. Prior to conducting the experiment, one of the Procambarus spp was hardly moving, and did not react to being placed in the closed system like the other 2 Procambarus spp did. Future experiments should make sure that all subjects used are healthy and alive in order to study a correct and accraute specific metabolic rate. Additionally, future experiments should be carried out with more Procambarus spp and over a longer period of time. An increased amount of test subjects would allow for more accurate calculations for specific metabolic rate, and allow any outliers to be eliminated from the results.
