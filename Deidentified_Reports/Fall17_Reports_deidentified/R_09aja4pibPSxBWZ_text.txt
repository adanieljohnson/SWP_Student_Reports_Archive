Title: Resource Allocation: Competition for Resources Between Rye and Alfalfa Plants

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an organism’s ability to delegate its resource intake and contribute it to necessary energy costs. As resources are limited, however, this might mean that for creatures and life that grows in tougher survival conditions must optimize the situation. Usually, this results in organisms competing for the same resources, which can be seen its development and performance. This study was conducted to test whether resource allocation is affected by competition for limited resources between two species of garden plants: Medicago sativa (alfalfa) and Secale cereale (rye). To do this, we planted both types of plants in two different environments: growing in isolation and growing together in the same environment. We hypothesized that the presence of more than one species of plant in the same environment will affect the Root:Shoot ratio in length and weight of the species involved. Through the process of planting, measuring their root and shoot lengths and weights, and conducting an appropriate significance test, we concluded that there is a significent influence of competition on resource allocation. The results allowed us to further our understanding of resource allocation and the abilities an organism must change the way its limited resources are distributed.

Introduction:
Resource allocation is a biological term used to describe how an organism distributes its limited resources. As biologists we know that resource allocation is important to the survival of both an individual organism and an entire species, and really in all of life in general. On a personal scale, an individual may redistribute its use of resources in the case that either a certain resource is limited or a specific task is a higher priority than others. On a larger scale, specifically through an evolutionary lens, a species may adapt to changes in the environment by allocating its resources so that the necessities for survival are met under these new conditions. In the case of plants, organisms will allocate its resources to grow certain parts (such as the shoot of the plant, the foliage, etc.) to accommodate for a lack or surplus of a limited resource. The presence of differing species of plants may serve as a factor for a plant allocating its resources in a specific way. Thus, we were interested in determining whether competition for resources significently affects the resource allocation of different species of plants. A prior experiment that tested the competition and reproductive allocation of Chenopodium acuminatum versus other plants concluded that competition strongly influence plant size and reproductive output (Wang, 2014). Other studies agree on a general basis that competition does in fact affect the outcome of plants, with exceptions to specific resources being altered when distributing them to the plants of interest, and what specific variable of the plant is being measured (i.e. root competition, shoot competition, reproduction rates, etc.). Another experiment suggests that certain aspects of allocation, such as root competition, are more easily affected by competition than other aspects. Specifically, when comparing Fraxinus excelsior seedlings to the grass Dactylis glomerate, root competition was vital for the survival of these competing plants, while shoot competition had little effect (Bloor, 2008). Our experiment is specifically concerned with the differences in root:shoot competition of both types of plant, rather than specifically root or shoot competition. In our experiment, we chose to compare alfalfa plant—a small, green garden plant that grow in larger numbers due to their small size—with rye plants—a taller plant in comparison to alfalfa that grow in smaller numbers for similar reasons to that of the alfalfa—due to their relatively varying features. By comparing the controlll groups of rye and alfalfa plants grown separately and the same plants grown together, we asked the following questions: What are the typical allocation patterns for the plants being observed? Do these patterns change under when the presence of a competing species is introduced? How does the allocation pattern change if at all? Through the manipulation of presenting differing species of plants to each other, we predicted that the presence of both alfalfa and rye plants in the same growing space will cause a difference in the root:shoot ratio of rye and alfalfa plants grown separately from each other due to competition for limited resources.

Materials and Method:
Firstly, we obtained the following materials: plenty of vermiculite soil, nine pots, plenty of seeds for both alfalfa and rye plants, a source of water, and appropriate measuring tools. Once the appropriate materials are collected, we placed plenty of seeds in a container of water and let the seeds soak for thirty minutes. While the seeds soaked, we filled all nine pots with vermiculite to the top of the pot, and soaked the soil with water. The water broke down the vermiculite, so we filled the pot again to the top with vermiculite and added fifty milliliters of MiracleGro to each pot. We waited until thirty minutes have passed since the seeds were soaked, then planted alfalfa seeds by themselves in three pots, rye plants by themselves in another three pots, and then both types of seeds in the remaining pots. We labeled each pot as either “alfalfa only, “rye only”, or “both” depending on which seeds were planted. Finally, the plants were ready to grow—we placed them in an appropriate growing space and allowed them to grow for two weeks, and watered each plant equally every other day. Once the two weeks passed, the plants were ready for harvest; we carefully removed fifteen alfalfa plants from every pot that contained this plant, and three rye plants from each pot as well. With each group of plants from each pot, we cut the plants at the point where the roots and shoots meet, measured the individual weight and length of each root and shoot, and recorded the data by the way the pots were labeled. This data was analyzed through a single factor ANOVA test at a significance level of 0.05, and thus further analyzed via Tukey-Kramer test for statistical significance.

Results:
We conducted an ANOVA test for R:S ratio for length (in millimeters), and another for weight (in grams). The significance test for R:S ratio of length yielded a p_value of 2.76E-05, which displays a high statistical significance when compared to 0.05. Similarly, the significance test for R:S ratio of weight yielded a very low p_value of 1.14E-06, which is also much lower than our significance value. Below are graphical data of the average of measurements observed of our plants:  The following graph (figure 1) displays the average R:S ratio for length of both types of plants grown in different competitive conditions. The average R:S ratio length for alfalfa plants that grew without competition was 1.556 mm ± 0295. mm, while the average R:S ratio length for alfalfa plants grown in a competitive environment was 1.659 mm ± 0.423 mm. The average R:S ratio length for rye plants that grew without competition was 0.864 mm ± 0.341 mm, while the average for rye plants grown in a competitive environment was 0.945 mm ± 0.287 mm. The next graph (figure 2) displays another average R:S ratio but for weight in grams of rye and alfalfa plants grown in different competitive conditions. The average R:S ratio for weight of alfalfa plants grown without competition was 0.309 g ± 0.054 g, while the average R:S ratio for weight of alfalfa plants grown in a competitive environment was 0.398 g ± 0.128 g. The average R:S ratio for weight of rye plants grown without competition was 1.048 g ± 0.449, while the average R:S ratio for weight of rye plants grown in competitive conditions was 1.125 g ± 0.362 g. A Tukey-Kramer test was carried out to further determine the minimum significent difference in averages between each group. This test suggested a significent difference between rye plants grown alone and alfalfa plants grown alone (0.7406), rye plants grown in competition and alfalfa plants grown alone (0.8174), alfalfa plants grown in competition and rye plants grown alone (0.6498), and rye plants grown in competition and alfalfa plants grown in competition (0.7267).

Discussion:
Based on the p_value conduced from the ANOVA significance test for the R:S ratios of weight and length in alfalfa and rye plants grown in competitive or noncompetitive environments, it is safe to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in resource allocation of plants grown in different competitive environments, and accept the alternative hypothesis that there is, in fact, a significent difference. The data shows that, on average, the R:S ratio of height and weight for both plants was higher for the alfalfa and rye plants grown together than the plants grown individually, which implies the strain for attaining resources was also higher for the competitive plants. These plants had to compete for resources with other species, thus, the nature of their allocation habits changed to accommodate for said competition. We established that resource allocation is a vital form of behavior for species to survive and thrive in the case of changes in living conditions. Our results so happened to generally reflect the results of previous studies of similar fashion, showing a general trend of competing plants having to make greater attempts at survival than the same species of plants grown in isolated environments (Bloor, 2008). This pattern makes sense, as certain resources (i.e. water, soil nutrients, light, etc.) are limited in natural environments to species of plants, and these plants must adapt and accommodate for the lack of certain resources. Plants that grow in the understory of rain forests must react to the lack of sunlight they receive, and plants that grow in arid lands must make up for a lack of water availability to survive and maintain the existence of its species (on a larger scale, at least.) If this study were to be conducted again, an alternative step would be to test another variable: reproductive capabilities of plants in competitive environments. Understanding whether competition for resources also affects the reproductive levels of plants is another obvious example of why resource allocation is important to the survival of a species. Nonetheless, the concept of resource allocation is an important one to understand when studying biology—it is vital for life, and our understanding of it.
