Title: The Effects of Lidocaine on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
This experiment done on Rana pipiens frog legs was performed to explore the effect of lidocaine on muscle contraction. The sciatic nerve of the leg was stimulated to produce muscle contraction, and this was done before and after lidocaine injection. Lidocaine will cause sodium channels to have a longer refractory period, making its effects numbing on the areas it is injected into. It is used commonly, as it is an effective numbing agent on human muscle. With this information in mind, it is hypothesized that lidocaine will slow the nerve impulse propagation in the neuromuscular junction of the gastrocnemius muscle. The gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens was separated from the leg and connected to a stimulator on an FT302 transducer. The muscle is stimulated to determine threshold amplitude before injection, then again after injection at the same voltage to see the difference. After performing the experiment and recording the data, it is clear that the lidocaine affected the muscle significantly. The amplitude of contraction at the same voltage, 0.3V,  for the unaffected muscle and the lidocaine-injected muscle was drastically different in value for all three frog legs. A T-test was performed on this data to ensure significance, which were determined to support the hypothesis.

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to observe the effects of lidocaine on muscle contraction. The threshold of contraction will be measured for each leg once before the lidocaine injection, and once after for comparison. The independent variable in this experiment was lidocaine, a discrete variable. The dependent variable was the voltage, which was also continuous. The amplitude of the contractions was dependent but discrete, as the muscle after lidocaine injection did not reach a threshold at the voltage inputted from the determination of the threshold before injection but did with increasing voltage.When an action potential is fired in a neuron, sodium ion channels that are voltage sensitive are triggered to open and allow the influx of Na+ ions, causing depolarization. This will travel down the axon and cause the opening of calcium channels and release of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, leading to contraction of the postsynaptic muscle (Johnson: 19-35)1. Lidocaine is a numbing agent, a local anesthetic, used mainly for anesthetic purposes in the medical field. The molecule will bind to amino acids near the sodium inactivation channels in the presynaptic cell, and will cause the channels after an action potential to recover much slower than a normal refractory period for an Na+ channel after depolarization (Bennett et al.: 1995)2.  This causes the neuron to be unable to fire action potentials in rapid succession for sustained contraction. It is hypothesized compared to the amplitude of contractions of the legs before injection, the amplitude of contractions after injection will be a lower amplitude voltage (IE much weaker contractions).


Materials and Methods:
This experiment was performed on three individual frog legs, kept moist with frog ringer. Once the achilles tendon was cut with forceps, the gastrocnemius muscle was tied with a string and hung from a hook at a 90ยบ angle. An FT302 transducer machine was utilized to generate the charge sent by the experimenters through the LabScribe software installed prior to the experiment. After the first pulses sent through the muscle to determine threshold contraction, 0.025 M lidocaine (~2 mL per leg) was injected into the gastrocnemius muscles and the experiment was repeated. The skin was removed from the frog leg to expose the gastrocnemius muscle. The inner thigh muscles were separated to expose the sciatic nerve, which was carefully pulled away from the muscles for stimulation. The achilles tendon on the ankle of the Rana pipiens leg was clipped, and the leg was tied up loosely at a 90ยบ angle. A banana electrical stimulator was secured onto the sciatic nerve, and beginning with 0.1V and increasing in 0.1V increments, the threshold amplitude was determined. Once the threshold was reached, the voltage was increased by 1.0V without exceeding 5.0V to observe amplitudes of contraction of the muscle. Amplitudes were recorded.
After this process, ~2 mL of 0.025 M lidocaine was injected into the middle and base of the gastrocnemius muscle and was left to sit unstimulated in the muscle for 3-5 minutes. Once the muscle has rested with the injected lidocaine, the entire process is repeated, recording the threshold amplitude and amplitudes of contraction up to 5.0V. This experiment was repeated once on each of the three frog legs, and a paired T-test followed to show statistical differences between the control thresholds and the experimental data. 


Results:
The results collected from the amplitudes of each frog leg before and after lidocaine injection for the same voltage are averaged into one table. This comparison can be observed in a graph, which includes the measured standard deviation amplitudes. The T-test p value performed on the averaged results of the experiment shows a statistically significant comparison between the control and experimental values. The data collected shows a statistically significant effect of lidocaine on the threshold of contraction of the gastrocnemius muscles of the Rana pipiens legs. Before the injection of lidocaine, the thresholds of all three muscles were reached at an input of 0.3V, with an average amplitude of 0.4934V and standard deviation of 0.08055. After injection, for the same input of 0.2V, the average amplitude of all three legs recorded at 0.0125V with a standard deviation of 0.00843. The same trend was observed at each increased voltage inputted through the LabScribe program. The T-test produced a p value of 0.0112, a value less than 0.05, indicating a statistically significant result. 


Discussion:

	Every test performed produced a significant result, and no outliers or obvious areas of error were observed. This experiment was slightly limited; only three frog legs were used, a small number for both control and experimental groups to produce significant data. Also, the transducer machinery was difficult to attach and work with, which may have altered our results due to human error. After finding that lidocaine is an effective inhibitor of muscle contraction, this study can be applied to other experiments and uses. For example, lidocaine could be used to treat spastic muscle conditions in addition to its use as an anesthetic. As noted in the journal of urology, lidocaine has properties that induce muscle relaxation, making it a possibility for treatment of constipation and sphincter spasticity(Smith: 1976). This can also be applied to conditions like tetanus or chronic seizures, giving lidocaine potential as a commonly prescribed treatment.
