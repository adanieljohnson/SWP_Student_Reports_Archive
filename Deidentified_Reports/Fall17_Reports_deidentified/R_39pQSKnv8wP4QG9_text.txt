Title: Increased salinity in environmental water of the Procambris sp. causes no statistical change in metabolic rate because of osmotic regulation

Abstract:
Because of the laws of diffusion, an organism taking up ions in a highly saline environment should have to use active transport to excrete ions. To analyze this, three Procambris sp. of similar size were inserted into a mason jar containing room temperature water and then a mason jar containing water with sodium chloride. Using an oxygen probe, oxygen levels of the water were measured every five minutes, and specific metabolic rate was then calculated. Increased uptake of sodium and chloride ions in the crayfish should initiate active transport to extract excess ions. Control groups produced an average specific metabolic rate of .0019 and experimental groups produced an average specific metabolic rate of .0009. Upon performing a paired t_test, a p_value of .08 was obtained, indicating a lack of statistical difference between the two metabolic rates. This is thought to be due to an increase of passive osmotic action to produce ionic equilibrium in the organism to counter the highly saline environment.


Introduction:
	The notion of Salinity refers to the presence of inorganic solutes in an aqueous environment (Rhoades, 1996). These ions are capable of diffusing throughout the medium of the surrounding environment and into/out of other organisms in the area. The laws of diffusion govern this movement of ions through their medium. Specifically, ions will always passively move from regions of relative low concentration to regions of relatively higher concentration. In order to move ions in the reverse direction, against their natural concentration gradient, energy must be used in the form of ATP to enable such active transport (Sadava, 2016). Generally speaking, the term metabolic rate describes the amount of energy being used in physiological processes at a given time (Johnson, 2017). Such energy is the product of aerobic cellular respiration in animal cells, which uses oxygen to convert glucose into energy. For this reason, measuring oxygen uptake of an organism in water will equate directly to their energy consumption. The crustacean, Procambris sp., is a common freshwater marine animal. Because this animal has evolved to live specifically in freshwater environments of very low salinity, it is a great organism to study the effects of increased salinity on their metabolic processes. Water-breathing animals in water will engage in ion transfer with its surroundings. Through the gills, an organism, in a salty environment, will consume ions from the surroundings to be used in the body (Sadava, 2016). Thus, the large buildup of internal ionic concentration necessitates that the organism needs to eliminate these ions. Previous studies have found that at increased salinities, metabolic rates shrimp have shown to significently increase (Villarreal, Hinojosa, & Naranjo, 1994). We hypothesize that the organism will do this via active transport. Because many crustaceans need maintain an internal ionic standard, they need eliminate many ions back into a highly concentrated saline environment (Greenaway, 1985). This should initiate active transport mechanisms of ions against their concentration gradients, expending energy in the process. Thus, we believe that inserting Procambris sp. into a saline environment will inherently increase its specific metabolic rate. 


Materials and Method:
Three crayfish of similar sized were each used in both controlll and experimental trials. Under controlll conditions, the crayfish was initially weighed and inserted into a mason jar overflowing with room-temperature water. Oxygen levels of the water containing the crayfish were measured initially and every five minutes until 20 minutes passed using an oxygen probe. The volume of water was then measured and specific metabolic rate calculated. The same crayfish was then inserted into a mason jar consisting of 100 Ml of 6.05% aqueous sodium chloride solution and diluted to the top with room-temperature water. The same procedure was used to measure the oxygen levels in the water. The metabolic rate under controlll and experimental conditions were averaged among the three crayfish and compared using a two-tailed t_test.


Results:
Under controlll conditions in room-temperature water, the first crayfish had a specific metabolic rate of .0017 mg O2 min-1g-1 while under controlll conditions it had a metabolic rate of .0011mg O2 min-1g-1. Thus, the controlll and experimental conditions produced a difference of -.0006 mg O2 min-1g-1. The second crayfish had a specific metabolic rate of .0017 mg O2 min-1g-1  under controlll conditions and .0009 mg O2 min-1g-1  in the experimental environment, producing a difference of -.0008 mg O2 min-1g-1. The third crayfish, which was smaller than the other two, produced a controlll specific metabolic rate of .0024 mg O2 min-1g-1, an experimental specific metabolic rate of .0008 mg O2 min-1g-1  and thus, a difference of -.0016 mg O2 min-1g-1 . This data led to an average of .0019 mg O2 min-1g-1 in controlll conditions and .0009 mg O2 min-1g-1 in experimental conditions (figure 1). Upon performing a t_test, we obtained a p_value of .08.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that upon inserting crayfish into an environment of increased salinity, theyre metabolic rate should increase because of increased active transport. However, we unfortunately were unable to demonstrate statistical significance between the two groups because our p_value (.08) was above .05. This matches up with the findings in a previous study analyzing the effects of salinity on metabolism in red-clawed crayfish. According to them, the reason that the high uptake of ions did not result in increased active transport is because of osmosis. They claimed that increased osmotic activities balanced out the significent bodily concentration increase (Meade, Doeller, Kraus, & Watts, 2002). If water movement via osmosis puts ionic concentration into equilibrium, this mechanism logically makes sense. An additional study actually did find an increased salinity in shrimp when exposed to increased salinity. They claimed that there was a critical water temperature that was needed to produce such results (Vargas-Albores, Hinojosa-Baltazar, Portillo-Clark, & Magallon-Barajas, 1998). Thus, it would be useful to study the effects of temperature and salinity in future studies of metabolic rate. This would serve to further analyze how the two physical properties interact to affect metabolic activity. Also, it could be interesting to study whether specific salt concentrations produce different effects on metabolic rate. That is, whether a potassium salt would have a different effect than a chloride based salt. A final future area of study is the determination of whether there us a critical concentration of NaCl necessary to cause changes in metabolic activity. In this experiment, we only used one small concentration which limited the range which we could analyze. With larger concentrations, more changes could occur. While running this experiment, we also ran into several sources of potential error. For one, we only examined the oxygen uptake by the crayfish for twenty minutes. If we had put the crayfish in increased salinity for longer periods, it’s possible that osmosis would not be sufficient to sustain equilibrium so the organism may have to initiate active transport. Additionally, we may not have filled the mason jar until overflow in every trial. Without overflow, the oxygen could diffuse into the unoccupied air and account for water loss not attributed to the organism.
