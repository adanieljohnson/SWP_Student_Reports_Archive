Title: Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, increases voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens to contract

Abstract:
In this experiment, we examined the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, in order to further understand the basic properties of neuromuscular control. We determined the twitch threshold for each leg before the injection of lidocaine and after. We used lidocaine to study its effect on the voltage needed for the frog leg to contract. We predicted the injection of lidocaine would increase the voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle to contract. The mean of the experimental values (2.8) was higher than the mean of the control values (0.3). This may have been due to the injection of lidocaine which may have blocked the sodium channels, thus hindering the contraction of the muscles. The muscles in the experimental needed more voltage to cause them to contract than the control groups. The degrees of freedom were 2 and the t- value was 9.5. We found this data to be significant because the p- value was 0.00109. Our hypothesis was supported because the voltage required for the gastrocnemius muscle to contract after the injection of the lidocaine was higher than the voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle without the lidocaine injection. 

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system, composed of nerves and muscles, allows for organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments. Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads, stimulating the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of calcium activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten [Johnson: 2017]. Sodium channel blockers, like lidocaine, block the sodium channels by binding to the channel. Voltage-gated sodium channels initiate and propagate the nerve, skeletal muscle, and cardiac action potentials [Wood: 2004]. Lidocaine decreases membrane excitability by blocking the sodium channels [Hoang: 2006]. We studied the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, in order to further understand the basic properties of neuromuscular control. Rana pipiens is a good model organism because it is able to jump high. It has good muscle power in its legs from a larger gastrocnemius muscle. The sciatic nerve was also easy to isolate. The twitch threshold is the minimum amplitude needed to elicit a reaction in the muscle, or contraction. We predict the lidocaine will increase the voltage needed for the gastrocnemius muscle to contract. 


Materials and Methods:
First, our lab group was given three frog legs that were prepped before experimentation. The frog legs were then placed on the dissecting pan. We dissected the frog legs and isolated the sciatic nerve in each leg. We kept the legs moist by squirting them with Ringer’s solution. Then, once we isolated the sciatic nerves, we attached a string to each gastrocnemius muscle from the hook between the string that is tied around the frog leg. We secured the frog leg to the tray with pins, ready for the first test. Then we laid the sciatic nerve on the end of the stimulator and secured the nerve in place. We hooked up the iWorx machine to the frog’s sciatic nerve to determine the twitch threshold. We increased the stimulus voltage by 0.1V increments until we determined the twitch threshold. We repeated this process for each of the legs. Once we determined the twitch threshold for each leg, we determined the twitch threshold once lidocaine was injected. We used 25mM of lidocaine and dissolved 0.6g of lidocaine into 100mL of Ringer’s solution. Then, we injected the gastrocnemius muscle in the frog leg with about 2 mL of the lidocaine solution. We increased the stimulus voltage by 0.1V increments until we determined the twitch threshold. We repeated this same exercise for each of the legs. Then, from our data we created a scatter plot of the data points and indicated the standard deviation. 



Results:
Figure 1 demonstrates that experimental values were significantly higher than the control values for twitch threshold. The experimental values are 2.5, 3 and 3; the control values are 0.5, 0.2, and 0.2. From our data, we were able to find the mean, degrees of freedom, and the p- value. The mean of the control group was 0.3 and the mean of the experimental group was 2.8. The degrees of freedom were 2 and the t- value was 9.5. We found this data to be significant because the p- value was 0.00109. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported because the amount of voltage needed to cause the muscle to contract increased once lidocaine was injected. The injection of lidocaine may have caused for the sodium channels to be blocked, thus hindering the contraction of the muscles. The experimental values for the twitch threshold were significantly higher than our control values, perhaps due to the injection of lidocaine. The muscles needed a much larger amount of voltage to cause them to contract than the control groups needed. Our results support our hypothesis because we predicted the injection of lidocaine would cause the voltage needed to be much higher for the experimental groups than the control groups. In this experiment, lidocaine was used to block the sodium channels. Lidocaine has many other uses in than the one that we observed in lab. Lidocaine can be used to prevent seizures that are caused by glutamate and for treating asthma [Hoang: 2006]. I think that it would be an interesting experiment to safely explore the benefits of utilizing lidocaine to treat asthma. Asthma is especially prevalent in children and can lead to hospitalization. I personally have asthma so helping those who also have asthma would be an experiment that is appealing to me. This experiment demonstrated that the injection of lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens may have caused for the contraction of the muscle to be hindered.

Figure 1. This graph represents the twitch threshold of the three gastrocnemius muscles from the organism Rana pipiens. Both the control and experimental groups are represented as well as the error bars that indicate the standard deviation of each group. For the control group, the standard deviation is 0.173 and has a mean of 0.3. For the experimental group, the standard deviation is 0.289 and has a mean value of 2.8.
