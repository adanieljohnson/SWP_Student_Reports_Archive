Title: Effects of Salinity on the Absorbance and Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts

Abstract:
Areas of drought or aridity have higher salt ion concentrations in the soil which can affect crop production. Considering this, our goal was to test the effects of sodium chloride on photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts. We hypothesized that chloroplasts in a saline environment would produce lower absorbances than the chloroplasts that weren’t, indicating a decrease in photosynthesis. Significant finds from studies examining this can lead to advancements in stabilizing crop performance. In the study, spinach leaves were ground in a grinding buffer and centrifuged to obtain a pellet. Samples were exposed to light for 30 minutes, with absorbances recorded at time zero and at every 10 minute interval. These were averaged for each group and higher absorbances for chloroplasts in the saline solution resulted. A two sample, one tailed t-test was run comparing this data. A large p-value of 0.436 was obtained, indicating our results were not significant. This could be because of spinach’s high salt tolerance. In a future study, we look to test chloroplasts from other plants of varying salt tolerances, and to use a range of higher sodium chloride concentrations.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process for most life on earth and it is done by all plants by capturing light energy to ultimately generate glucose. Glucose is the basic form of sugar that is used by plants as energy to fuel other processes throughout the plant. In plant cells, photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast. Measuring the absorbance rate of the chloroplast and the percent change over time can indicate whether or not those chloroplasts that were tested are undergoing photosynthesis. More specifically, by using the Hill Reaction, or the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts plus light, and DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) as an electron acceptor, which absorbs maximum light at 600 nm, DCPIP reduction can be measured as a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm, which in turn can indicate any effects on photosynthesis [Johnson:2017]. When thinking about different environmental conditions that can affect photosynthesis, salinity comes to mind. Here, we want to test how the salinity of the environment affects the absorbance of chloroplasts and thus the photosynthetic properties in Spinacia oleracea, also known as common spinach. Common spinach was used for this experiment as it is a staple to many people’s diets, so it is relatable to the real world in terms of it being a common agricultural crop. This question we are testing is important in a larger context as salinity concentrations in soil can affect agricultural production throughout the world. This is largely seen in areas of drought and in arid regions where agriculture is performed using intense irrigation. By understanding how salinity influences photosynthesis and plants overall, farmers and other agriculturalists can learn how to stabilize crop performance [Chaves:2008]. In order to test and answer this question, we need to be aware of the other factors that can also influence photosynthesis. These include the amount of light in the environment, the amount of chloroplasts in the plant, the amount of water, and the concentration of salinity in the environment. The amount of light that is present controls the rate of photosynthesis because light is used to cleave water and initiate photosynthesis. The more intense the light in the environment is, the more water can be cleaved in the same length of time. For chloroplasts, the greater the number of them that are present in plants, the greater amount of area that is available to conduct photosynthesis. The amount of water regulates the speed of the reaction because it is cleaved to induce photosynthesis. So, the higher the amount of water present in the environment means the faster photosynthesis can proceed. The salinity of the environment is significant because the higher the concentration of salt in the environment, the higher the uptake of sodium ions into the plants will be and thus the higher the extrusion of water will be from the plants due to osmotic potential. As a result, there will be less water to be cleaved and the rate of photosynthesis will be lowered. In this model system, we hypothesize that the chloroplasts introduced into a saline environment will produce lower absorbances than the chloroplasts in a normal environment, indicating a decrease in the ability for them to conduct photosynthesis. Given this, we predict that the percent change in absorbances over time for chloroplasts in a saline environment will be lower than the percent change in absorbances observed for the chloroplasts under normal conditions. 

Materials and Methods:
Our hypothesis was tested by measuring the absorbances of the control (chloroplasts under normal conditions) and experimental groups (chloroplasts in a saline environment) after 10 minute increments of light exposure for a total of 30 minutes and then calculating the percent change in absorbance from time zero. A negative control group (containing no chloroplasts) was also implemented to serve as a comparison for our results from the other two groups to detect any unsuspected sources of interference. Spinach leaves were collected from an outside company or store and were maintained in the refrigerator. A mortar and pestle was used to ground four deveined spinach leaves in 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) until it became a thick paste. An additional 10 ml of grinding buffer was added, and the green slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. This was then transferred to a 50 mL conical tube which was placed in a centrifuge and spun at 200 x G (1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was poured out into another 50 mL conical tube which was then spun again at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet from this was then isolated and suspended with a transfer pipet after 20 mL of the grinding buffer was added. Following this, a blank test tube containing 8 mL water, 2 mL reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 100 µl enriched chloroplasts was prepared. Three replicates of the negative control, control, and experimental groups were prepared as well. Test tubes used for the negative control included 6 mL water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 mL reaction buffer. Test tubes used for the control included 6 mL water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, 2 mL reaction buffer, and 100 µl enriched chloroplasts. Test tubes used for the experimental included 5 mL water, 2 mL DCPIP, 2 mL reaction buffer, 1 mL 10% sodium chloride in water, and 100 µl enriched chloroplasts. The independent variable was the 1 mL of 10% salinity solution added to each tube of the experimental group. Each test tube was mixed after chloroplasts were added and the mixtures from each tube were transferred to cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was then set to 600 nm and blanked using the contents from the blank tube. Immediately following, the absorbances of all the samples were measured. All samples were then placed in the light for a total of 30 minutes. At each 10 minute interval, the spectrometer was blanked again using the blank sample, and absorbances were recorded for each sample. Percent change in absorbance was then calculated at each time interval from time zero for all samples. Following this, a two sample, one tailed t-test was run comparing the average absorbances recorded from all time points in the control group and the experimental group.

Results:
Overall, our results show that after being exposed for 30 minutes in light, the chloroplasts that were immersed in a saline environment exhibited a relatively lower percent change in absorbance from time zero as compared to those in a non-saline environment. This is shown in Figure 1 where the percent change in absorbance for the chloroplasts in saline solution was at 85% and the percent change for the chloroplasts under normal conditions was at 90%. The chloroplasts in a saline environment yielded higher absorbances than the chloroplasts in a normal environment. However, the absorbances observed for these two groups were not statistically significant from one another as a p-value of 0.436 was calculated. A t-stat value of -0.1672 was calculated as well, also showing that our data was not significant, as seen in Figure 1.

Discussion:
Following our experiment, we concluded that our results did not support our hypothesis. The absorbances for the chloroplasts in the saline environment were higher than those observed for the chloroplasts in a non-saline environment, and we obtained a large p-value, indicating that our results were not significant. This can be explained by similar results found in a study examining the photosynthesis of leaves and isolated chloroplasts of salt-stressed spinach. They found that the photosynthetic activity of the spinach leaves was not majorly decreased by the salt treatment and suggested that it could be due to effective compartmentation of ions within the cell which may have prevented the accumulation of levels of Na+ and Cl- in the chloroplast that would cause inhibitory effects on photosynthesis [Robinson:1983]. This indicates that spinach could have a relatively high salt tolerance. A study that examined the effects of salt stress on chloroplasts in pea plants, which are salt sensitive, concluded that the addition of 70 mM NaCl caused important decreases in photosynthetic activity in those pea plant chloroplasts. Conversely, they found that in tolerant plants, the addition of 70 mM NaCl had little effect on photosynthetic activity [Hernandez:1995]. An alternative explanation to our data may be that the concentration of the saline solution was too low to cause any significant inhibitory effects on the absorbance and photosynthetic activity of the spinach leaf chloroplasts. Considering these results, it could indeed be the case that spinach is relatively salt tolerant and a greater concentration of sodium chloride is needed to cause any inhibition to photosynthetic activity. To best explain if this was a factor, the next logical step in our study would be to repeat the study and to either keep the existing procedure the same but test various sodium chloride concentrations higher than what we previously tested (i.e. alter the independent variable), or to keep the sodium chloride concentration the same at 10% but test chloroplasts from other plants species of various salt tolerances. This experiment is important because an increase in climate change predicts an increase in aridity for the semi-arid and Mediterranean regions of the globe in the near future. Coupled with overpopulation, this could lead to an overexploitation of water resources for agricultural purposes and, as a result, an inhibition in plant growth and survival and overall crop harvest [Chaves;2008]. If significant results were to be obtained from either of our possible future studies, it could contribute to agricultural advancements to yield better crop production in these arid regions now and as the climate continues to change throughout the future.
