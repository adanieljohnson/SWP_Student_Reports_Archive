Title: Caffeine’s effect on the contraction of the  Gastrocnemius muscle of the Rania pipiens leg

Abstract:
Abstract-  The Rania pipiens muscles contract by the same mechanism as humans. Calcium is released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum when an Action Potential is in the muscle fiber which causes the muscle to contract. It is thought that Caffeine enhances the Calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which will cause the muscle to stay contracted since Calcium keeps getting released. Since the Calcium keeps getting released this will cause the amplitude of the muscle contraction to go up since the extra released calcium will cause the muscle to stay contracted for longer. The goal of this experiment is to see if Caffeine will cause the amplitude of the frog leg contraction to be higher.  This was done by finding the twitch threshold of a frog leg without Caffeine injected in it and took the amplitude for five myograms and while still recording the leg was injected with  0.1 Mls of 200mM Caffeine into the gastrocnemus in the leg. The amplitude was recorded for five more myograms.   After this experiment, It was determined that the data was significent, by a T-test, and that the hypothesis was supported that the Caffeine injected in the Rania pipien’s leg caused the amplitude of the muscle contraction to go up.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles contain hundreds to thousands of myofibers, Individual myofibers are bound by connective tissue to form functional groups. Skeletal groups are innervated by motor neurons. The axons of the motor neurons extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate several and individual myofibers. Acetylcholine(AcH) is released when nerve impulses arrive at neuromuscular junction. AcH binds with the receptor of the muscle fiber which opens Sodium ion channels that generate action potential into the muscle fiber. The Action Potential  spreads and stimulates the release of Calcium ions from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. The release of the Calcium ions activates the contractile mechanism of muscle fibers. Caffeine crosses the cellular membrane and activates the RyR-Ca2+ channels directly (Huang, 1998) .Then, Caffeine release calcium ions from the fragmented reticulum( Hoock,1996). Since extra Calcium ions are released, the caffeine will cause the muscle to contract at a higher amplitude. This experiment will be done on a leg of the Rania pipiens. It is easy to stimulate the sciatic nerve on the Rania pipens’ leg and produce a measurable twitch. The twitch will be produced before, during, and after the injection of Caffeine into the Gastrocnemius of the leg.  This will allow people to see the change of amplitude. The Caffeine will cause the muscle to contract and the amplitude will go up since the Calcium will be released from the fragmented reticulum of the Rania pipiens’ leg and will activate the contractile mechanism of muscle fibers more strongly.


Materials and Method:
The skin on the frog was deskinned. The sciatic nerve was then exposed and the gastrocnemus was separated from the leg by cutting it at the achilles tendon.  The bottom of the gastrocnemus was tied with a knot and the excess string was used to attach it to the stand. With the exposed sciatic nerve it was connected to the sleeve electrodes to the BNC connector. The gastrocnemus muscle can be stimulated through the sciatic nerve   Now the leg was prepared for the study, the first step was to determine the twitch threshold by using a force transducer, which puts electrical current into the frog leg and it can tell you the maximum contraction at the lowest voltage of the frog leg by doing twitch threshold. The twitch threshold was determined by setting the first amplitude to 0.0 V, number of pulse 1, frequency 1 Hz, and pulse width (W) to 5ms. You go up in 0.1 increments until you see the highest twitch possible, and that is your twitch threshold. Once you determine the threshold and set the pulses to 0(as it will cause the muscle to be stimulated continuously), frequency to 1 Hz, and pulse width(W) to 5 ms.  Start the experiment and  after 5 myograms inject via a syringe  0.1 Mls of 200mM  Caffeine while recording. Let 5 myograms pass and then click stop to finish the experiment.  This was done  on two frog legs. Next, a 2 sample T- test was ran to see if the amplitude is significent.


Results:
Based off of first glance the data seems to be significent. Once the The p_value of the T-test ran was 0.0422 and this means it is significent since it is less than 0.5.  As you can see the amplitude of the frog leg with the Caffeine in it is so much higher than the same leg without Caffeine injected into it.   When caffeine is injected you can see/ feel the muscle contract and it stays contract the whole time, it never relaxes.


Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported as the amplitude went up when the Caffeine was injected into the frog’s leg.  This supports the biological theory that Caffeine causes the Calcium to  be released from the fragmented reticulum of the Rania pipiens’ leg and will activate the contractile mechanism of muscle fibers more strongly. The only major error during this experiment is that one of the legs sciatic nerve was not working and would not stimulate. To overcome this, we just used the data for the two other legs. For the next time, we should probably do more legs as it would help us confirm our hypothesis more strongly as we would have more test subjects.
