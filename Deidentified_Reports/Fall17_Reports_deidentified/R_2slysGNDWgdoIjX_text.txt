Title: Intraspecific Aggressive Behavior in Betta splendins when Placed in Contrasting Visibility Environments

Abstract:
Visibility is an environment characteristic that could affect how fish behavior in an intraspecific way. An intraspecific behavior change can be observed through the aggressive, or agnostic behaviors that a fish species exhibits on each other. In this experiment, aggressive behavior is quantified in a bin system from least to most aggressive and counted for number pf times displayed to determine if different types of visibility affect the aggression of fish, specifically Betta splendins. Our prediction was that in a low visibility environment male Betta fish would show more aggression towards each other compared to clear visibility. Using two different water environments, clear water and dirt filled water, three Betta fish were observed in different combinations. From the data collected, fish in the higher visibility environment show more aggression than in the lower visibility one. This shows that even though Betta fish once lived in muddy water and were aggressive, they are now limited to show aggression only in clear water.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior through observations of history, lab method, and insights from ecology and evolution. Behaviors should be understood from a physiological purpose and should be looked at by how they have been shaped by evolution. Using a method called patient observation, ethologists study data on behaviors done by animals through patters, which can lead them to a question to experiment with. Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are common household fishes that due to selective breeding, male fish retain fighting colors. In intraspecific behavior, fish use visual communication in interaction with aggressing, sexual activities, and species recognition. There are two types of intraspecific behaviors to study in Betta fish: broadside movement and facing movement. Broadside movement, which occurs when fish have their sides to the other fish, include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing (listed in least to most aggressive order). Facing movements include pectoral fin erecting, spreading of gill covers, and protruding of branchiostegal membranes (red mane). There are plenty of other agnostic behaviors, like biting and jaw-locking. By looking at all these behaviors, we can study the interactions between a species and understand how it might have evolved (Johnson: 2017).
	Visibility is an abiotic factor that fish have to experience in the wild. They depend on their sense of sight as a major source of information and most fish, due to this most have well developed eyes to see in different environments (Guthrie: 1986). Wild betta fish live in an environment that is normally muddy and has low visibility, yet they still go through their intraspecific aggressive behaviors that are show more aggressive behaviors, like jaw locking, than the domesticated pet store ones. (Johnson: 2017). Other fish as well, have shown that when put in a sediment environment, the social hierarchy is broken down, and more aggressive behaviors are displayed (Berg; 1985). Betta splendins that are now found have been domesticated due to selective breeding and artificial selection, and have not live in this sediment filled environment in their lives (Johnson: 2017). We predicted that when two male Betta splendins ate put together in a tank filled with clear water and on with murky water, the fish in the murky water will be more aggressive due to similar conditions to the original environment of wild Betta fish.


Materials and Method:
To test how visibility affects the aggressive behavior of Betta splendins, two tanks of water were set up. One tank had clear fresh water, and the other tank had 40 Ml of dirt per 4 L of water. In the clear tank and the murky, three divided sections were made by using glass dividers and opaque dividers so that the fish so not attack and see each other. In each of the sections in the clear tank, one blue male betta fish was place, making a total of three blue male Betta fish (Fish 1, Fish 2, and Fish 3). The opaque divider was then removed from the between Fish 1 and Fish 2 for 5 minutes. Once the divider was removed an observation of aggressive behaviors was done with a bin system of least to most aggressive behaviors. One person watches Fish 1 and another person watched Fish 2 and would say the numbers 1, 2, or 3, which represented the behaviors tail flashing (1; least aggressive), displaying red mane (2), and biting/hitting glass divider (3; most aggressive behaviors). While this was occurring, two other people would record the number that was said for each fish.
	After the five minutes were up, the opaque divider was placed back in between the fish and a ten-minute resting period would insure. Each fish’s score was then added all together (ex. 3+2+1=6) and then those scores were added together. After the ten-minute resting period, the experiment was then conducted the same way, but with Fish 2 and 3, and Fish 1 and 3. After all the clear water observations were done, the same three observations were done, but the fish were placed in the less visible, sediment filled environment. When the trials were finished and the fish were put back into their original environment, the three clear trials data was averaged together, the three less-visible environment trials were added together, and a one-tailed t_test was performed.


Results:
Through observing the Betta fish’s behavior in both the visible and less visible environments, there was a significent difference with aggression. When put in a visible water environment, the fish showed a larger average of aggressive behaviors than when put in the less-visible sediment-filled environment. The average aggressive behavior in the visible water came out to be 114±50 (Figure 1). The average aggressive behavior in the less visible water was 1±1.41 (Figure 1). There was one trial in the visible water that had less aggression than the others in the environment, but still showed a larger amount aggression than all the trials in the less visible environment. After completing a one-tailed, two-sample t_test the average of the aggressive behavior in the visible water was statistically significent from the average aggressive behavior in the lower visibility water (t_stat=3.19 d.f.=5 P=0.012).


Discussion:
After looking at the results from the aggressive behavior exhibited by three Betta splendins in two different water visibility conditions, we can say that our results do not support the hypothesis that male Betta splendins will be more aggressive to each other in less visible conditions. Betta fish may have once lived in muddy waters in Thailand and exhibit more aggressive behaviors in the wild, but with domestic Betta’s less visibility shows less aggressiveness towards each other (Johnson: 2017). This result with domesticated, or artificially selected, Betta matches with similar experimental results on different artificially selected fish. In an experiment done by Doyle and Talbot, artificial selection of fish indirectly caused less aggression (2011). In a different experiment done on teleost Fish, it was found that long term artificial selection caused increase vulnerability due to domestication (Cooke: 2007). Both of these experiments show that when domesticated through artificial selection, fish tend to become less aggressive. Wild Bettas, when living in a similar environment to the less-visible environment that the domestic Bettas were introduced to, would be aggressive, showing behaviors like jaw locking and biting, but the domestic fish showed almost no aggression in this environment. Visibility is now an important factor to Betta splendins that have been domesticated.
	There could be two places for error in our experiment. One was that the fish did not have enough resting time between trials, in order to not show habituation in the next trial. This might have resulted in false aggressive behaviors or lack of aggressive behaviors. Another error could be from the interpretation of the aggressive behaviors exhibited from the fish. Since two different people were observing behaviors, their definition of what counts as aggression could have been different. This could of affect the number of times that the fish actually showed aggressive behaviors of tail flashing, the red mane, or biting. To proceed further into this experiment, I suggest three differences in the procedure. The first one would be to make a larger resting time in between trials, to make sure that the fish would not be affected by habituation. The second would be to have more fish and more trials to get stronger data. The third would be to material to use as the dirt/sediment material in the lower visibility environment. 
	Artificial selection is a process that humans use to bring out successful or wanted traits in other organisms. Many animals and plants have been bred a certain way for our benefit, different crops and pet animals are a large example of this. We are breeding for a certain trait, but do not think of the impact on other aspects or characteristics of the organisms. This experiment concluded that artificial selection and domestication of Betta fish decreases aggression in an original, wild environment (cloudy water). If Bettas were put back into the wild now, their lack of aggression would impact not only their survival, but their fitness. If this is true for other animals that have gone through a domestication process, then a decrease in aggression could further impact the life and survival of species if ever reintroduced to their natural habitat.
