Title: The effect of temperature on photosynthesis in spinach leaf chloroplasts

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of temperature on photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of spinach leaves. Photosynthesis is a metabolic process carried out by plants to collect and store glucose for later use as energy. Photosynthesis is impacted by a plant’s environment, with certain conditions maximizing the process and others hindering it. Photosynthesis involves many processes, many of which are temperature dependent.  Spinach chloroplasts were placed in three environments, an ice bath, room temperature, and a hot water bath, to determine how each would impact photosynthesis. The dependent variable, photosynthetic activity, was quantified by determining the absorption of the chloroplasts after 30 minutes which indicates how much DCPIP was reduced, a direct indicator of photosynthetic activity. It was hypothesized that if spinach chloroplasts are placed in various temperature conditions, then photosynthesis will decrease at hot and cold temperatures as compared to room temperature. After 30 minutes the average absorption of spinach chloroplasts were lowest in the samples left in room temperature, suggesting that more photosynthesis had occurred. A two sample one tailed t_test found the difference in absorption to be statistically significent.

Introduction:
In this experiment, the effect of environmental conditions such as temperature on photosynthesis in spinach plant chloroplasts was investigated. Photosynthesis is a metabolic process carried out in the chloroplasts of plants to create and collect energy as glucose. Photosynthesis begins with the absorption of light by chloroplasts, which excites electrons. This excitement causes electrons to leave carrier molecules and triggers a chemical reaction, known as the light-dependent reactions, that generates a proton gradient. It is this proton gradient that powers ATP and NADPH synthesis, which in turn allows the synthesis of glucose from CO2 molecules in the light-independent reactions. Photosynthesis can be a difficult to quantify. However, a compound called DCPIP can be used as alternative electron acceptor in place of NADP+ in a process known as the Hill Reaction. DCPIP is blue in color, but as it interacts with and is reduced by electrons it loses this hue. This change can be quantified using a Spec 20 machine at 600nm to determine how absorbance changes over time, which directly indicates how much photosynthesis has occurred [Johnson: 2016]. Photosynthesis can be impacted by environmental conditions. In conducting this experiment, we were specifically interested in determining how temperature alters photosynthesis in spinach. We wanted to see what temperature was optimal and how the process was able to persist in less than ideal temperatures. It is logical to suspect that photosynthesis could be impacted by temperature because it is a multi-step pathway that includes temperature sensitive reactions and enzymes. Some reactions cannot occur at all temperatures and enzymes have very specific temperature ranges at which they can optimally function [Allen, et. al: 2011]. Investigating the effect of temperature on photosynthesis is pertinent because the climate in areas across the globe differ so vastly. Some areas naturally support high levels of plant growth, while others are barren. This disparity in the presence of plants in different geographical areas could be because plants cannot conduct photosynthesis at certain temperatures and, therefore, are not viable in some environments. Interestingly, climate change is currently a widely discussed topic. Climate change does have negative impacts on native species to these areas, but the temperature change in historically colder climates may make them more viable to a wider variety of plant species. Conversely, areas with already warmer climates could become unsuitable for many plant species if temperatures rise too much. We hypothesized that if spinach chloroplasts are placed in cold, hot, and room temperature conditions, then photosynthesis will decrease at hot and cold temperatures compared to room temperature. This hypothesis was based on an article which found that the photosynthetic rate of spinach is sensitive to temperature. The study also gave us ideas for the temperatures that should be used for the independent variable to elicit a change in photosynthetic activity of the spinach chloroplasts, for example, that spinach plants at 42 degrees Celsius had significently lower photosynthetic rates than spinach plants at room temperature [Song, et. al: 2014]. For comparison, a negative controlll mixture without chloroplast was included and the positive controlll was the chloroplast samples placed in room temperature. The dependent variable photosynthetic rate was quantified by the change in absorbance of each sample. Low absorption of the samples shows that DCPIP was reduced by electrons, which directly indicates that photosynthesis has occurred. This sensitivity to temperature is a major reason why we selected spinach as our model organism. In addition, spinach chloroplasts can be easily extracted.


Materials and Method:
The veins were removed from four medium-sized spinach leaves and ground with 10Ml of cold grinding buffer in a chilled mortar and pestle. An additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was then added and mixed, then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. This liquid was then added to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tubes marked “Spinach”, and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then poured into another chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube and the debris at the bottom of tubes was transferred to a discard beaker. The 50 Ml tubes containing the chloroplast suspension were centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4°C. The remaining pellet was the suspended with the grinding buffer [Johnson: 2016]. 10 test tubes were numbered and filled with 6Ml water, 2 Ml 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml reaction buffer to create samples for three experimental groups a negative controlll. Another test tube was labeled “blank” and filled with 8 Ml water and 2 Ml reaction buffer. The blank contained everything other than the substance of interest, DCPIP. This allows it to zero out the spectrophotometer so that only the absorbance of the substance of interest was measured. 100 μl of the enriched prepared chloroplasts was added to the blank test tube and #1-9, but not tube #10 the negative controlll, and mixed immediately. The mixtures were then transferred spectrophotometer cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was immediately blanked at 600nm and then the absorbance of all the samples were measured. Samples #10 and #4-6 were placed in room temperature at 23 degrees Celsius, #1-3 were placed in the ice bath at 0 degrees Celsius, and #7-9 were placed in a water bath set for 42 degrees Celsius. After 10 minutes the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbances of all samples were measured. After a sample’s absorbance was recorded, it was returned to its temperature condition. This procedure was repeated after 10 minutes, and then again after 10 more minutes. Two sample 1 tailed t_tests were performed to analyze the difference in the absorption after 30 minutes of spinach chloroplast in room temperature with those in cold and hot environments.

Results:
The negative controlll had an absorption of 0.610nm and 0.327% chance over 30 minutes. The spinach chloroplasts placed in an ice bath had an average absorption of 0.802 +/- 0.034 nm after 30 minutes. The spinach chloroplasts placed in room temperature had an average absorption of 0.510 +/- 0.029nm after 30 minutes. The spinach placed in a warm water bath at 42 degrees Celsius had an average absorption of 0.556 +/- 0.004nm after 30 minutes. These average values can be seen in Figure 1. The difference between the average absorption at 30 minutes room temperature and cold temperature was statistically significent with a p_value of 0.00018. The difference between the average absorption at 30 minutes in room temperature and hot temperature was statistically significent with a p_value of 0.0282.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment supported our hypothesis. The absorptions of the spinach chloroplasts after 30 minutes in hot or cold environments were statistically different than that of the spinach chloroplasts in room temperature. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that temperature has no effect on the rate of photosynthesis is spinach chloroplasts. Figure 1 depicts this trend very clearly. At the beginning of the experiment, all of the chloroplasts had absorbances within a 0.1 nm range of one another. After 30 minutes, this range nearly tripled. The absorbance of the chloroplasts in room temperature steadily decreased, while those in hot and cold environments increased. This decrease in absorption for plants in room temperature indicates that DCPIP was reduced and photosynthesis had occurred. Allowing the chloroplasts to undergo photosynthesis for a longer period of time may have allowed for an even more statistical difference in absorbance to develop. Testing them at more extreme temperature changes could have resulted in stronger effects as well. A study on photosynthesis in plants found that to an extent plants are able to adapt and withstand unideal temperatures. However, after a long time at these adverse temperatures, the plant is no longer able to photosynthesize [Ruelland, et. al: 2010]. While the chloroplasts in hot and cold did change in absorption, this change was an increase in absorption, indicating that DCPIP was not reduced. Figure 2 shows percent change in absorbance of the chloroplast over the course of the study. The figure depicts that chloroplasts in cold temperature experienced the greatest percent change, however, it was in the opposite direction of the change in absorbance that would indicate photosynthetic activity. This is odd, since even a slight amount of photosynthetic activity should have caused DCPIP to be reduced in Hill Reactions and lose color, causing absorbance to decrease. The reason that absorbance increased could have been that DCPIP accumulated in the chloroplasts over time since it was not being reduced. Essentially, this would mean that no photosynthesis had occurred in the hot and cold chloroplasts that increased in absorbance. This absence of photosynthesis could have occurred because the chloroplasts were placed in such unviable temperatures, but it could also potentially be due to experimental error. An error was made when placing our test tubes in the hot water bath. The bath had a lid that should have been removed while allowing the tubes to sit. For the first 10 minute period the lid left on, leaving these tubes in darkness. This absence of light likely hindered the photosynthetic activity of these spinach chloroplast in the light-dependent reactions. The light-dependent reactions, however, still would have been able to occur in this period of darkness which explains why some chloroplasts in the hot water bath still experience some change in absorbance during the first 10 minute period. Another possible source of error was that we did not place the samples under a lamp. The samples, therefore, received a more limited amount of light. A stronger source of light could have made photosynthesis occur more readily and could have resulted in more pronounced changes in absorbance over the course of the experiment. This could have strengthened the results obtained. When transferring to cuvettes there was no way to ensure completely that each same quantity of chloroplast. While measures were taken to make this as consistent as possible, like mixing the tubes immediately, there was no way to accomplish complete accuracy. If one cuvette happened to receive a greater quantity of chloroplasts it would experience a greater change in absorption due to the greater amount of resources for photosynthesis. This could have resulted in an outlier that could have skewed the results that we obtained. The could possibly explain the one chloroplast in the cold environment that had a lower much lower than the other two, bringing down the average final absorption of chloroplast in cold temperature. A major limitation of this study is that it only involved one plant. We chose to use spinach because other studies suggested that spinach can tolerate temperature change to some extent, but at a certain point its photosynthetic ability was compromised[Song et al: 2014]. We chose a good model organism which could lead us to suspect that other plants may respond similarly, but we can’t make any generalizations based solely on the results of this study on only spinach. This study could be done again using a variety of plant chloroplasts to see how different plants vary in their ability to continue to conduct photosynthesis at adverse temperatures. Another limitation was that we only investigated the effect of three different temperatures on photosynthesis. This study could be improved by expanding the number of temperature conditions that the spinach were placed in. This could provide a more accurate understanding about what temperatures maximize photosynthesis in spinach. As previously states, the study could also be improved by allowing the plants to undergo photosynthesis for a longer period of time. This may allow for the differences between each temperature condition to become more pronounced, strengthening the results of our study. The fact that we only ran this study for 30 minutes was a major drawback. A study on the effect of temperature on seagrass photosynthesis did find that temperature had a significent effect on photosynthesis in their subject plant at some temperature. However, they studied plants in their natural environments for multiple weeks [Bulthius 1987]. This suggests that if our spinach chloroplasts in hot and cold environments had been left in their adverse environments for an extended period of time, their photosynthetic processes could have been even more compromised over time. This study on the effect of temperature on photosynthesis is important because temperatures differ widely around the world. In some places, lots of plant growth is naturally supported. In other places, very little vegetation grows. Our study suggests that this disparity in plant growth across various geographical areas could be due to the inability of plants to conduct photosynthesis at certain temperatures. Therefore, are not viable in environments with certain climates. Investigating this is especially pertinent today because climate change is such a widely debated issue. The changing in temperature of some areas could potentially alter their ability to support vegetation. In historically cold and unviable environments, a temperature increase could allow more plant species to flourish there. However, temperature increase could also make an environment that once supported lots of plant growth too hot to support optimal photosynthesis. An interesting study that could build on ours would be to investigate photosynthesis of plants in their natural setting.
