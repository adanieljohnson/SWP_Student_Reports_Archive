Title: Effects of Colored Light on Plant Growth

Abstract:
Photosynthetic rates were observed in Spinachia oleraca under various light conditions. Absorbance was measured to detect photosynthetic activity. Red light was expected to increase growth the most in spinach. However, the effects of white, red, blue, and green LED lamps had minimal differences. This suggests that wavelength does not impact photosynthesis when spinachia oleraca is treated for 30 minutes under light. Understanding how environmental conditions affect plant growth is important for optimal food production.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants convert energy from light into glucose, which can then be used in the cell for various functions. Photosynthesis is crucial for plant growth. The pigment chlorophyll is located in chloroplasts and has a green color.  Chlorophyll absorbs photons of two different wavelengths. These photons are used to create electron reducing power in the form of the nucleotide NADPH. Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis generate ATP, the energy currency of the cell.  [Johnson:2017]. 

In this experiment, we examined the the effects of various colored lights on rates of photosynthesis in spinach. When photosynthesis occurs, the electron acceptor NADPH is reduced in chloroplasts. The hill reaction refers to the process in which electrons are transferred in chloroplasts that have received light. We measured reduction of 2, 6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) because it is easier than measuring NADPH reduction. Oxidized DCPIP is a dark blue color.  It changes to a clear color when it has been reduced. A low absorbance indicates that this color change occurred, DCPIP was reduced, and therefore the rate of photosynthesis is high [Johnson:2017]. A high absorbance indicates that the color did not change and rate of photosynthesis is low. 

In past literature, the effects of colored light has varied depending on the plant used [Sanmartin: 2016]. One study showed that photosynthetic rate was highest under red light in the plant savoy. Additionally, the combination of red and blue light increased the leaf chlorophyll content in the savoy [Chen]. However, another study showed that red light inhibited growth more than green or white light in phototrophic cyanobacteria [Hsieh:2013]. Therefore, the effects of LED light appears to very in different types of phototrophs, and under different light treatments.

This variation depends on the pigments contained. Phototrophs can contain a range of photopigments, like  chlorophyll, carotenoids, and phycobiliproteins, therefore not all organisms react to the same spectral compositions [Sanmartin:2015]. When wavelength matches the plant photoreceptors, it causes more optimal growth.

Spinach has a high chloroplast content, so it is an appropriate organism to observe. The photopigment found in chloroplast, chlorophyll, mainly absorbs red light. Organisms rich in chlorophyll should be more vulnerable to the effects of red light [Sanmartin: 2016]. It is generally accepted that red LED lights are most effective on land plants like spinach [Miku:]. 

If we expose spinach to red, blue, green, and white LED lights, photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts will be different under varying light treatments. We expect that the rate of photosynthesis will be higher under red light and lower under green light. The controlll sample with no chloroplast will show very low photosynthesis, if any at all. 



Materials and Method:
The effects of varying light treatments was observed. White, Red, blue, and green lights were tested. The effects of a solution with no chloroplast was measured as the negative controlll. 

Six spinach leaves were mixed with 10 Ml of grinding buffer. The buffer was 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer pH 8.0. It was mixed with the spinach until a thick paste was formed. The mixture was placed into a centrifuge, until a mixture enriched by chloroplast was formed.  

Tubules were prepared for the treatments with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 100mM reaction buffer pH 6.5, and 2 Ml of DCPIP. They were numbered 1-12.  3 tubules were prepared without the chloroplasts as negative controllls and labeled 13-15. 2 Ml of DCPIP were added to 8 Ml of water to use as a blank. The tubules were transferred to labeled cubettes. 

For each color, one light emitting diode was used.  LED lights enable controlll of the spectral composition, emitting specific wavelengths. White, blue, red, and green bulbs were used. Threes samples of spinach were placed under each respective LED light. The three tubules that lacked chloroplasts were placed under the white light. 

The spectrometer was set to 600 nm and blanked. The absorbance was measured at the start of the experiment, then every 10 minutes following for 30 minutes total.  Data was recorded at every time interval, and a one-factor ANOVA was used to analyzed data. A post-hoc was also performed to check for significance. 


Results:
The variations in absorbance between the colored LED treatments had no significance, which was indicated by the difference (n>0.164). The white light and the red light had the greatest difference (n=0.152) but it still was not statistically significent. Only tubules 13-15, which contained no chloroplasts, showed a significently higher absorbance than the treatments.  


Discussion:
Out of the colored light, we found that red light had the lowest rate of photosynthesis and green light had the highest. This contradicts our expectations. We suspected that chlorophyll would absorb more red light, and therefore react more to the red LED. However, it is important to note that the green light bulb had a greater intensity due to experimental issues. Thus, it is logical that the green treatment resulted in higher photosynthetic rate. We also expected that red LED would cause more photosynthesis than blue light, but it did not.

Although these differences are interesting, it does not prove any effect of LED lights. There was no significent difference between the white, blue, red, and green lights. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The wavelength of LED lights caused no changes. 

This lack of change may be due to the brevity of the light exposure, and the small sample size. Three spinach mixtures were tested under LED light. If more samples are used, more reliable data would be observed. Each plant was treated under the light condition for a total of 30 minutes. This is a short period of time to reveal a notable difference. Lastly, the LED lights were in a room lit by white, fluorescent lights as well as sunlight through the windows. This may have compounded the results, explaining why there was no significent difference between the positive controlll of white light, and the light treatments 

In a future study, it would be logical to treat plants under light for an extended period of time in an isolated location. Measuring absorbance every hour across a six hour period of time could reveal the effects of the light better. The LED lamps should be isolated from all other light sources. This could be done by placing the lamps and the plants in a dark cabinet. It would be interesting to not only measure absorbance, but  also look at chlorophyll content. After an extended time period, this data should be observed with a microscope. This would show potential long-term effects of varying spectrums of light. 

Rate of photosynthesis is crucial for the growth of plants. If a certain wavelength produces higher rates of activity, the spinach will be able to grow faster and more efficiently. This is important for farmers and other producers. It may affect the quantity of spinach,and also the nutritional quality. 

In America and beyond, there is a lack of access to healthy foods, such as spinach, kale, and other dark green vegetables. Many towns and cities are plagued by obesity. Particularly in lower class areas, fast food restaurants and convenience stores provide much of the nutrients. Those living in poverty cannot afford healthy foods. Vegetables are more expensive and difficult to mass-produce. Observing the optimal light conditions for growth reveals how production should occur. By enabling better production of spinach, it could lower the cost, and more people could enjoy the nutritional benefits of this food.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The absorbance after 30 minutes varied among the light treatments. Absorbance is inverse to photosynthetic rate. Therefore, the white light had the highest rate of photosynthesis and the dark  Error bars indicate the standard error of means. 

Table 1. A significent difference was found only between the negative controlll (dark treatment) and the light treatments. No significent differences were found between the various light treatments. The difference between white light and red light was 0.152, which is near significent.
