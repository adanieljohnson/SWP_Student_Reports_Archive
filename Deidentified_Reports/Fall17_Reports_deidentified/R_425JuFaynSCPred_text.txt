Title: Decrease in temperature increases the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp.

Abstract:
In this experiment, we examined three Procambris spp. in order to further understand the impact that a decrease of water temperature has on specific metabolic rate. We measured the oxygen consumption of Procambris spp. at room temperature, or 22°C, and then at 12°C. Because the amount of oxygen consumed is proportional to the amount of energy consumed, we determined the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. at each temperature. We predicted that a decrease in temperature would lead to a decrease in the specific metabolic rate of the three Procambris spp. The data demonstrated that the experimental specific metabolic rate was significently greater than the controlll specific metabolic rate. This response may have been due to increased stress levels of the Procambris spp. due to the sudden change in the environment. From our statistical test, the paired t- test, the t_stat was 8.1362 and the degrees of freedom were 2. We found this data to be significent because the  p- value was 0.0148.  Our hypothesis was not supported because the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. increased in response to the decrease in temperature. 


Introduction:
When an organism converts glucose into energy, the carbon and oxygen atoms that are present in the glucose molecules are converted  into carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. Two molecules, NAD+ and FAD, transfer electrons to the electron transport system, and as the electrons move between the transport molecules of the chain, they give up energy [Johnson: 2017]. This energy is used to convert low energy ADP into high energy ATP,  generating considerable ATP. The amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose is directly proportional to the amount of energy consumed, or the amount of carbon dioxide excreted. By measuring oxygen consumption rates, energy utilization and stress in aquatic animals can be examined [Meade: 2002]. In this experiment, we will measure the amount of oxygen consumed when the temperature is decreased, thus determining the relationship between environmental temperature and the rate of metabolism in crayfish (Procambris spp.). Procambris spp. are good model organisms  for studying oxygen consumption for various reasons. They are invertebrates, so their biological systems are, by design, much simpler for studying metabolism. Procambris spp. are relatively large and they consume enough oxygen to make noticeable changes on the testing equipment. Most water- breathing animals are ectotherms so their body temperatures are closely tied to the temperature of the water around them. As the water temperature rises, an ectotherm’s body temperature and metabolic rate rise as well. Thus, water breathers need more oxygen as the water gets warmer. By examining the relationship between temperature and specific metabolic rate, we can better understand the impact that climate change will have on aquatic organisms. If we decrease the water temperature, then the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. will decrease as well. 


Materials and Method:
We measured oxygen consumption of three Procambris spp. at the temperatures of 12°C and 22°C. First, we filled the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air at a temperature of 22°C. Then, we set the test chamber into a full plastic dishpan. We weighed a crayfish, placed it into the test chamber and screwed the top on. Then, we placed the entire tank set up to the neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature water. We then inserted the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber. We turned the instrument on, let the readings stabilize and took the baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. We took the oxygen concentration every five minutes for twenty minutes. We poured the water from the test chamber through a funnel into a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of the water. We repeated these steps two more times with two other crayfish. Then, for the 12°C measurements, we filled the chamber with oxygen saturated water from the container and placed it in a container with ice and waited for it to reach 12°C. We took the baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen and wrote down the oxygen concentration every five minutes for twenty minutes. Then, we poured the water from the container through a funnel into a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of the water. We repeated these steps two more times with the other two crayfish. We then calculated the specific metabolic rate for each crayfish at 12°C and 22°C. The statistical test that we ran was the paired t- test. 


Results:
In this experiment we found the amount of oxygen consumed for each Procambris spp. and then calculating the specific metabolic rate. The specific metabolic rate of Control 1 was 0.00087, Control 2 was 0.0021, and Control 3 was 0.0011. The significent difference for the controllls was 0.00065394. The specific metabolic rate of Experimental 1 was 0.0045, Experimental 2 was 0.0077, and the Experimental 3 was 0.0061. The significent difference for the experimentals was 0.0016. Figure 1 demonstrates that the mean of the experimental specific metabolic rate was 0.018, while the mean of the controlll specific metabolic rate was 0.0014. The experimental specific metabolic rate was significently greater than the controlll specific metabolic rate (t_stat = 8.1362, d.f. = 2, P = 0.0148).


Discussion:
Because the specific metabolic rate increased when the temperature decreased, our hypothesis was disproved. The solubility of a gas, like oxygen, in a liquid determines the amount of gas in a liquid. Solubility of a gas is a function of temperature so solubility is higher at lower temperatures [Sadava: 2017]. Because water breathing animals use energy to move water, it must expend more energy to obtain an adequate amount of oxygen as the water temperature rises. With these principles in mind, we hypothesized that the high solubility in oxygen would facilitate the breathing of the crayfish, thus decreasing the specific metabolic rate. The sudden decrease in temperature may have caused the stress levels of Procambris spp. to increase. This increase in stress level may have caused their oxygen consumption to increase in response to the sudden change in their environment, thus causing the specific metabolic rate to increase as a result. Metabolism can be impacted by the stress effects of temperature, due to the role of energy balance in stress adaptation and tolerance [Sokolova: 2008]. This increase in metabolism was contrary to what was expected, because the Procambris spp. were more stressed than anticipated, counteracting the properties of the cold water. Though our hypothesis was disproved, the p_value is 0.0148; therefore our data is significent. In a similar study, the oxygen consumption rates that were monitored in response to different temperatures were typical of aquatic poikilotherms, because when the temperature increased, the metabolic rate increased and when the temperature decreased, the metabolic rate decreased [Meade: 2002]. However, in this study the experimenters allowed for a great deal of time for the crayfish to adapt to their new surroundings. A source of error in our experiment was that we did not allow adequate time for the crayfish to adapt to their environment. Another way to improve this experiment would be to increase the number of crayfish so the results would be more accurate. On a global scale, aquatic ecosystems are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, because the vast majority (> 95 %) of species in aquatic realms are ectotherms [Willmer: 2000]. Whether this change be an increase or decrease in water temperature, the specific metabolic rate of aquatic organisms will most likely increase. This increase in specific metabolic rate is most likely due to an increased need for oxygen because either the organisms are stressed when adapting to the change in their environments or there is a less oxygen available for consumption. Paleontological records, as well as the recent history of global warming, demonstrate that even modest changes in environmental temperature by a few degrees result in major shifts in ectotherm distributions and in mass extinctions of their populations [Sokolova: 2008]. Ectotherms struggle to adapt to even slight changes in their environment due to the close relationship between the water temperature and their internal body temperature. This may cause for increased metabolic rates of organisms as they adapt to their new environment.
