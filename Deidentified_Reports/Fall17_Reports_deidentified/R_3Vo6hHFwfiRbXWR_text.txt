Title: Effect of Light and Darkness on specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp

Abstract:
The objective of this lab was to examine the effect of light and darkness on the oxygen consumption of Procambris sp. Specific metabolic rate is calculated because it is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended by that animal. Our hypothesis is that lack of light in an environment will affect the rate of oxygen consumption, so the rate of oxygen consumption decreases due to the amount of light in an environment. Specific metabolic rate was calculated. It already takes into consideration the weight of the Procambris sp. Observations were made through taking readings from an instrument every five minutes for twenty minutes. The results did not support our hypothesis for any of the three Procambris sp. All of the specific metabolic rates were higher in the dark environment. The p_value was not significent at 0.167904 because it is not less than 0.05. 


Introduction:
Aerobic respiration is the main source for animals to create ATP energized molecules. In order for this first to occur, there must first be a reaction such as glucose into energy release high-energy electrons. These electrons are then captured by NAD+ and FAD which then transport the high energy electrons to the electron transport system that uses the energy of the electron to convert ADP into ATP. These electrons become removed when they are changed to molecular oxygen, O2, which is then converted to water. The water is then used to either join the body fluids or is excreted as necessary. 

Aerobic respiration is important for our lab because oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended by that animal. We are measuring the specific metabolic rates of Procambris sp which has a direct correlation to the amount of oxygen consumed. Specifically, we are going to look at how darkness may affect the oxygen consumption of three different Procambris sp.  In a similar study, the “Effect of variation in photoperiod and light intensity on oxygen consumption, lactate concentration and behavior in crayfish Procambris clarkii and Procambris digueti,” the conclusion drawn was that the two species showed a decrease of oxygen uptake under light/ dark conditions. Since Procambris clarkii and Procambris digueti types of ectotherms, like our Procambris sp, we can hypothesize that lack of light in an environment will affect the rate of oxygen consumption, so the rate of oxygen consumption decreases due to the amount of light in an environment. 


Materials and Method:
1.	Weigh one of the three Procambris sp 
2.	Place the Procambris sp into the mason jar, the chamber
3.	Fill the mason jar up to the top with 22C room temperature water that has been saturated by air 
4.	Set the test chamber into a dishpan that is also filled with water and then screw on the top so that the tops overflow slightly 
5.	Turn on instrument and take a baseline reading 
6.	Take reading every 5 minutes for 10 minutes 
7.	Keep the same Procambris sp but switch the water and this time, cover the mason jar with aluminum foil 
8.	Place in dishpan 
9.	Screw on top with probe 
10.	Turn on instrument and take baseline reading 
11.	Take reading every 5 minutes for 10 minutes 
12.	Repeat entire process of light and dark readings with the two other Procambris sp
13.	Calculate specific metabolic rate for all the Procambris sp using the formula 


14.	Compare results to see if darkness had an effect on the amount of oxygen the Procambris sp was getting using a bar group and a two tailed t_test


Results:
In Figure 1 the mean for the controlll is 0.000605667 mg of O2/min(g) and for the experimental is 0.001488667 mg of O2/min(g). The standard deviations are 0.000229106 for the controlll and 0.000503156 for the experimental. The p_value is 0.167904 so the values are not statistically significent because they are greater than 0.05. The general trend of figure 1 shows that the averages of the specific metabolic rate for the controlll and the experimental was higher for the crayfish in the experimental, the dark environment. The error bars are smaller for the controlll than for the experimental. 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis for the Procambris sp. The specific metabolic rates in the darkness increased compared to the specific metabolic rate for Procambris sp in the light environments. 

In a similar study that compared Gammarus fossarum and Niphargus stygius our hypothesis was not supported. The light in the environment was used to calculate oxygen consumption of the two species. The epigean G. fossarum lives in caves so it is used to darkness while the hypogean N. stygius lives on the surface. The results show that specific metabolic rate increased when placed in a dark environment. In the study, the G. fossarum showed a higher oxygen consumption than the species that is used to living on lighter surfaces. [Simcic, Tatjana, and Anton Brancelj; 2007]. However, in another study done with mice, our hypothesis was supported. The study concluded that the metabolic rate of the mice increased in a bright environment compared to a dark one [Evans, Addy; 2015]. Both studies involved endotherms, so having one article that supported our hypothesis another article that did not support our hypothesis may be simply due to the fact that different organisms and different species adapt to their environments. The organisms we experimented with are different from the three organisms in the studies so therefore they all maintain homeostasis in a different manner. 

Limitation to our study are that our sample size only contained three Procambris sp. The aluminum foil used to cover the chamber may have not caused complete darkness and there may have been parts where light was able to enter. Lastly, the organism may have been stressed when he was taken out of his “home” with a net and placed into a smaller environment, the chamber. For a future study, we could add a transition period for it to relax before switching from the light to dark period. We could also change the water temperature because in the ocean as you get deeper, the light gets darker and the water gets colder. In order to make the study more realistic, we could also make the water in the darker environment colder because in the ocean, the deeper you go, the less sunlight is available making the water colder.

Figure 1. Bar graph showing the three Procambris sp in both the light and the dark environments. The bars show the averages of the specific metabolic rates in the 20 minutes’ interval of both light and dark. The error bars in the figure show the variability of data collected before and after the treatment.
