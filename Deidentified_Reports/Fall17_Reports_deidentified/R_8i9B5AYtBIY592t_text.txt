Title: The effect of different wavelengths of ultraviolet (UV) light on the photosynthetic rate in spinach leaves

Abstract:
The effect of different wavelengths of light on the photosynthetic rate of spinach leaves was studied in this experiment. The wavelengths were emulated by using different light colors: red, blue, and green, and a white light to emulate natural conditions, due to the fact that the procedure was performed in evening conditions without natural light. The hypothesis was that under blue light conditions, the rate of photosynthesis would be highest. The differences photosynthetic rates between groups were found to be statistically insignificent. This could be due to the use of indoor, unnatural light conditions, and the use of only colored bulbs to emulate varying UV wavelengths. However, it has been shown in various other studies that varying UV wavelengths can affect photosynthetic rates. This and similar studies are important for uses such as agriculture in a world with an increasing population [Ma:2014] 

Introduction:
All living organisms derive their energy either directly or indirectly from a variety of sources. For plants, that energy is extracted from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is essentially the key to most life on this planet, and it is the basis of plant growth and metabolism. Oxidation-reduction reactions, electron transport chains, and proton motive forces are used in photosynthesis to capture and store energy in the organism. Chloroplasts in plants absorb solar radiation to excite electrons, which subsequently leads to the replacement of those electrons that were removed from electron carriers in photosystem II and in the light-dependent reactions,  and the generation of a proton gradient. The proton gradient then drives ATP synthesis, and that energy is then used for gluconeogenesis in the cell [Johnson: 2012]. Wavelengths of light that a plant is exposed to is a factor that affects photosynthesis. Different plants absorb different wavelengths of light optimally, and thus a plant that is intended to absorb a specific range of wavelengths may have varying photosynthetic rates under varying light wavelengths [Kieller:2003]. This allows us to question: under what wavelength, or range of wavelengths, does the spinach plant have the highest rate of photosynthesis? We hypothesized that under blue light (~470 nm), the rate of photosynthesis would be the highest [Ma:2014]. Then, in descending order of rates of photosynthesis: under red light (~780 nm), and green light (530 nm).

Materials and Method:
For the first part of the experimental procedure, the spinach leaves were removed from their large central veins, and ground up in a mortar and pestle along with a grinding buffer - 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0. It is mixed until a spinach slurry is formed. The slurry is then filtered through a cheesecloth and into a beaker. The solution is then transferred to a centrifuge tube, and goes through 2 trials of centrifuging at various speeds (increasing each time). After the last centrifuging, there should be a pellet at the bottom of the tube, and more grinding buffer is added and the pellet mixture SHOULD be the most enriched chloroplast solution. This solution is then divided into 12 test tubes (100 L) along with water (6 Ml), 130 mM DCPIP (2 Ml), and reaction buffer (2Ml). There are 4 light sources: red, green, blue, and white for the controlll. 3 test tubes are placed under red, 3 under green, 3 under blue, and only 1 under the white controlll. The remaining 2 tubes will be the positive and negative controllls; the negative controlll is placed in the dark, the positive is left under normal light conditions. The absorbance of all mixtures is taken and recorded, and then repeated after 10 minute increments under appropriate light conditions, for a total of 30 minutes. The absorbances are then used in the Hill reaction to calculate reaction rates. 

Results:
The results above show the absorbance values from each test tube, 3 of each under each light source. The following tables show the ANOVA tests ran on the results to test for significance of results. 
The average percent change for photosynthetic rates under blue light conditions increased, from 113% to 150% to 184%. For red light conditions, the averages were 555%, 666%, and 622%. For green light conditions, 546%, 772%, and 749%. 
Through the ANOVA test, the calculated p_value was 0.22.


Discussion:
The results proved to be insignificent according to the p_value attained in the results, and thus the hypothesis of blue light conditions producing the highest rate of photosynthesis is not supported. The null hypothesis is accepted. It has already been discussed the significance of photosynthetic rate on the growth of plants, and this experimental design aimed to test the effect of different wavelengths of light on the photosynthetic rates of the spinach plant. As seen in Table 3 above, the difference in means of photosynthetic rate between the red, blue, and green lights were not significent. Using the ANOVA test, the data obtained from the experiment was used to see whether the means between the groups differed and subsequently indicate whether photosynthetic rates were affected by different lights. There was no statistical significance. With the ANOVA test, we want the P-value to be higher than 0.05, to indicate a significent difference between groups; however, as seen in Table 2, the P-value for this experiment was 0.22.  Our experimental errors could possibly include the fact that it was performed in the evening, with no natural light conditions for the controllls, and the lack of being able to accurately manipulate wavelengths of UV light. Despite our results being insignificent, one study showed that using UV radiation centered at 313 nm caused a significent reduction in photosynthetic rate [Keiller:2003]. Another experiment focused on the effect of light on the rate of photosynthesis showed light intensity had a significent effect on photosynthetic rates in apple trees. The decline of water content in leaves declined faster in full light than in 60% and 25% sunlight [Ma:2014]. These results were significent because they were set in drought-like conditions; the study was intended to provide for better responses to droughts in the future. Different targets for affecting photosynthetic rates can also be explored, for both academic and application purposes. One study focused on photosynthetic rates for the purpose of greater food security in the coming world as the population increases [Evans:2013]. Rubisco is arguably the most important target, as it catalyzes both carboxylation and oxygenation reactions; and most responses photosynthesis to light, CO2, and temperature are observed and reflected in its kinetic properties [Evans:2013].
