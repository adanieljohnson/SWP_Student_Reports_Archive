Title: Metabolic Costs by Crayfish in the Presence of Agricultural Waste

Abstract:
In this experiment, we exposed Procambarus sp. to agricultural waste in order to determine the effect on specific metabolic rate.  By adding agricultural waste to the environment, we believed that it would make it more difficult for the crayfish to maintain its baseline bodily functions.  Our hypothesis was that by adding agricultural waste to the environment, then the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish would increase.  To test this, we measured the oxygen consumption of the crayfish with and without the presence of agricultural waste.  We used a paired t test to find the statistical significance of our study.  Our null hypothesis was that the presence of agricultural waste would either cause no change in specific metabolic rate or would cause the specific metabolic rate to decrease.  Our results failed to reject our null hypothesis, meaning we failed to support that agricultural waste increased the metabolic rate of crayfish.


Introduction:
Organisms obtain energy by one of two methods: autotrophy or heterotrophy [Johnson; 2016].  Autotrophs obtain energy via sunlight and chemical energy, meaning that autotrophs produce their own energy.  By consuming autotrophs and other heterotrophs, heterotrophs obtain high-energy molecules.  Crayfish are heterotrophs, and thus, obtain mitochondrial enzymes in order to produce ATP.  ATP is used by organisms as energy, which is used for basic bodily functions, movement, and other energy-consuming processes.  When ATP is produced, carbon dioxide and water are released as byproducts.  Measuring oxygen consumption is a valuable way to measure specific metabolic rate, which is a measure of energy expended to maintain bodily function [Johnson; 2016].  The units for specific metabolic rate are mg O2 * g-1* min-1. 

Environmental and physical conditions affect the specific metabolic rate of an organism.  It has been determined that the smaller an organism is, the higher its metabolic rate.  It has also been determined that the higher the temperature of the environment is, the higher the metabolic rate of the organism is.  This is because these conditions cause the organism to have to work harder and expend more energy to maintain its baseline level of functioning.  In this experiment, we want to determine the effect of agricultural waste on the specific metabolic rate of smaller-sized Procambarus sp., or marbled crayfish.  We are using this organism because it is a model organism, meaning that there is much data on this organism which can be generalizable and used across multiple studies.  Based off of previous experiments, it is indicated that exposure to agricultural waste led to a higher specific metabolic rate in crayfish [Rowe; 2001].  

Our hypothesis is that exposure to agricultural waste will increase the specific metabolic rate in smaller-sized Procambarus sp.  We hypothesize this because we believe that in the presence of agricultural waste, the crayfish will have to expend more energy for bodily function [Rowe; 2001].  Our null hypothesis is that exposure to agricultural waste will cause the specific metabolic rate (mg O2 * g-1* min-1) of the crayfish to either remain the same or decrease, and we will use a one-tailed, paired t-test in order to test the validity of our data and hypothesis.  We will test our hypothesis by measuring the oxygen consumption of crayfish with or without the presence of agricultural waste.   


Materials and Methods:
We set the temperature of the water to be 32 degrees Celsius and filled a screw-top jar with water that had been saturated with air.  We placed this jar into an empty plastic dishpan.  Next, we weighed a small crayfish and then placed it into the jar and screwed the lid on top.  Once the top was secure, we filled the container with 32 degrees Celsius water so that they jar slightly overflowed.  We placed the jar up to its neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature water.  We inserted the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the jar and filled the jar with water.  We turned on the instrument and allowed the readings to stabilized.  We took a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen reading, and we read the concentration of oxygen again after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, we removed the probe from the jar and measured the volume of water that the crayfish was in via a funnel.  We repeated all of these steps with a second crayfish, and then again with a third crayfish.  We then added agricultural waste to the water in the jar and repeated the steps with three crayfish.  The agricultural waste was a 1:10 solution made of 100 mL waste with 900 mL of distilled water.  We had to swirl the solution in order to properly mix the agricultural waste.

To measure specific metabolic rate, we used the equation: SMR = (change in oxygen (mg) multiplied by volume of water (mL)) divided by (time (minutes) multiplied by weight of crayfish (grams))  .  The units for specific metabolic rate are mg O2 * g-1* min-1.  We used an one-tailed, paired t test in order to test statistical significance.  In this t test, we used an alpha-value of 0.05.  

In this experiment, the control group also acted as the experiment group.  The control group was testing the oxygen consumption without the presence of agricultural waste.  The independent variable was the presence of agricultural waste, which is a categorical and discrete variable.  The dependent variable was the oxygen consumed (and thus, the specific metabolic rate), which is a quantitative and continuous variable.  


Results:
The average specific metabolic rate for the control group was 0.00161 mg O2 * g-1* min-1 and the average specific metabolic rate for the experimental group was 0.00116 mg O2 * g-1* min-1. The p-value of the t-test was 0.151673.  The t-statistic of the t-test was 1.768677.  The alpha-value of the t-test was 0.05.



Discussion:
Because the p-value from the two sample t-test was 0.151673 and our alpha value was 0.05, we failed to reject our null hypothesis.  The t-statistic from the one-tailed paired t-test was 1.768677.  Our null hypothesis was that the presence of agricultural waste would either cause the specific metabolic rate (mg O2 * g-1* min-1) of Procambarus sp.   to remain the same or decrease.  

Once the crayfish were exposed to agricultural waste, their specific metabolic rate decreased in all three cases.  Our results do not align with results of previous experiments.  This mismatch of results could have been because the exposure to agricultural waste in this experiment was short-term while the exposure to agricultural waste in previous experiments was chronic [Rowe; 2001].  There also could have been differences in concentration of agricultural waste in previous experiments compared to our experiment that led to a difference in results.  

Future experiments could test the effects on specific metabolic rate of other pollutants besides agricultural waste, such as soil and manure being compared to acid rain.  Our results occurred because the agricultural waste allowed it to be easier for the crayfish to maintain bodily function, and thus, decreased the specific metabolic rate.  It would be interesting to determine the effects of different kinds of pollutants on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp.

Figure 1. The Average Change in Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp. Without the Presence of Agricultural Waste and With the 100 mL Agricultural Waste Diluted With 900 mL Water.  Error bars represent the standard deviation while the data bars represent the observed response in Volts.  The standard deviation for the group without waste was 0.00038742741255621 and the standard deviation for the group with waste was 0.00021.  Difference between the Experimental and Control group was insignificant with a p-value of 0.151673 and an alpha-value of 0.05; the control group (n=3) had an average specific metabolic rate of 0.0.00161 mg O2 * g-1* min-1 with the experimental group (n=3) having an average response of 0.001143333 mg O2 * g-1* min-1.
