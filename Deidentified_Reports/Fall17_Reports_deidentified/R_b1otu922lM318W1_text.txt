Title: The Effect of Light Intensity on Photosynthetic Rate in Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
Organisms called photoautotrophs have cells with the ability to perform photosynthesis: the conversion of light energy and carbon dioxide into a usable form of energy [Iwasa and Marshall: 2016].  In this experiment, the photoautotroph Spinacia oleraca was placed in different conditions varying by luminosity of light, and the resulting effects on the rate of photosynthesis of each group were observed.  This was done by conducting five different hill reactions with purified chloroplast solutions under five varying light intensities in order to measure the excitation of electrons in photosystem II during photosynthesis.  With these results, the photosynthesis of Spinacia oleraca could potentially be optimized by using a certain light intensity, maximizing the growth of Spinacia oleraca and the ability to manipulate photosynthesis in future studies.  After experimentation, it was observed that the highest light intensity produced the highest rate of photosynthesis in the spinach.  Since we originally hypothesized that the optimal light intensity for photosynthesis would be neither the highest, nor the lowest value tested, the original hypothesis was rejected.

Introduction:
The organism Spinacia oleraca belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Since Spinacia oleraca is a plant, it is an autotroph, meaning that it contains cells that can carry out photosynthesis  [Iwasa and Marshall: 2016].  Photosynthesis is the process through which select light energy, water, and carbon dioxide are used to synthesize glucose. These cells carry out photosynthesis in an organelle called the chloroplast [Iwasa and Marshall: 2016].  Chloroplasts contain flattened sac-like structures called thylakoids, and the membrane of these thylakoids contains a number of protein complexes, including photosystems I and II.  To initiate the first step of photosynthesis, the light reactions, the chlorophyll pigment in photosystem II called P680 absorbs photons of light, which excites electrons that are passed down to the other protein complexes through an electron transport chain.  [Iwasa and Marshall: 2016].  
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the optimal value of light for the highest rate of photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleraca.  This will be determined by varying the independent variable, the light intensity the chloroplasts are exposed to, and using the percent change in absorbance of chloroplast activity as a measurement for photosynthetic activity of the organism’s chloroplasts, the dependent variable.  As seen in a study by Dr. Bohning and Dr. Burnside, there is an optimal light intensity for the rate of photosynthesis in sun plants such as Spinacia oleraca [Bohning & Burnside: 1956].  Furthermore, they found that as light intensity increases the photosynthetic rate increases until a certain optimal value, after which the photosynthetic rate plateaus and eventually decreases.  [Bohning & Burnside: 1956].  Based off of these findings, the hypothesis is that if spinach chloroplasts are placed in different light intensities, than there will be an optimal light intensity for photosynthetic activity that will be neither the highest nor the lowest intensity tested.  


Materials and Method:
 The spinach leaves were bought from the local grocery store and refrigerated for 24 hours before beginning the experiment.  First, the mortar and pestle, the beaker and the centrifuge tubes were set on crushed ice, while four spinach leaves were deveined. These spinach leaves were then ground in a mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0).  An additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the mixture and it was ground until it became soupy with no precipitate.  This liquid mixture was then poured into a centrifuge tube and was centrifuged for 3 minutes at 200 x G (1200 rpm).  Then, the liquid from the centrifuge was poured into a different centrifuge tube and centrifuged again for 10 minutes at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm), and the resulting supernatant was set aside.  After centrifuging, fifteen test tubes were labeled 1–15.  Then, the following mixture was added to these test tubes: 6 Ml of water,  2 Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5).  In this experiment, DCPIP is the reactant that allowed us to obtain visual results.  When DCPIP enters the electron transport chain of the chloroplasts, it accepts the electrons excited by the light, causing it to become reduced.  This reduction causes the DCPIP to turn from blue to colorless, and this color change is can be detected by a spectrophotometer [Harrison, R.P: 1989].  Another test tube mixture was made with 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of the reaction buffer which served as a blank for the spectrophotometer and was labeled accordingly.  After all of the test tubes were prepared 100 μl of the prepared supernatant containing the chloroplasts was added to each test tube using a micropipette, and each test tube was immediately shaken.  After being shaken the mixtures were each poured into a separate cuvette about three quarters full and starting with the blank their absorbance was taken with a spectrophotometer set at 600nm.  These values were recorded as an initial value and the cuvettes were placed in the following conditions: cuvettes 1–3 were placed under the 1630 lumen bulb, cuvettes 4–6 were placed under the 890 lumen light, cuvettes 7–9 and the blank were placed in the room’s light as controlllled conditions, cuvettes 10-12 were placed under a lamp of 690 lumens weaker than the room’s light, and cuvettes 13-15 were placed in complete darkness.  Every 10 minutes the absorbance of each cuvette was taken until 30 minutes passed.  After the 30 minutes had passed the percent change of each cuvette was calculated using Formula 1 as seen below.  Finally, the results were recorded and analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired t_test with a critical value of 0.05
Formula 1. Percent Change of Absorbance (%)
Percent Change (%)=[(Absorbance at time ‘N’)/(Absorbance at time zero)]x100%


Results:
The percent change of chloroplast absorbance averages ∓ standard deviation were found to be as follows for the following light intensities in lumens: 85.74% ∓ 15. 36 (1630 lumens), 77.17%∓27.56 (890 lumens), 69.86%∓1.067 (600 lumens), 50.26%∓4.761 (room lighting), -3.567%∓1.413 (darkness).  The following groups were found to be statistically significent: the 1630 lumen group with t(4)=3.99, p=0.01, the 600 lumen group was statistically significent with t(4)=6.96, p=0.002,  and the dark group was statistically significent with t(4)=-52.6, p=0.000.  The 890 lumen group was statistically insignificent with t(4)=2.64, p=0.057.  


Discussion:
The results found rejected the biological hypothesis that there would be an optimal light intensity for photosynthetic activity that was neither the highest nor the lowest light intensity.  As seen in Figure 1, the percent change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in increasing order were: the dark conditions, the chloroplasts in the room’s lighting, the chloroplasts under 600 lumens, the chloroplasts under 890 lumens, the chloroplasts under 1630 lumens. Therefore, the chloroplasts under the highest light intensity had the highest rate of photosynthesis. The results did not correlate with the hypothesis nor the results from Bohning and Burnside’s study, which stated that photosynthetic rate plateaus and decreases after a certain optimal intensity in multiple species of sun and shade plants [Bohnig and Burnside: 1956].  However, Gauslaa and Solhaug’s study found that at a high enough light intensity, in their experiment 1000µmol photons, or 820, 000 lumens, the chlorophyll was bleached, or damaged by the light and in result could not function, causing the decrease in rate of photosynthesis seen in Bohning and Burnside’s study [Gauslaa and Solhaug: 2000].  Likewise, another experiment studying photobleaching in spinach found that photobleaching can begin to occur around 650µmol photons, 324, 000 lumens [Yamashita et. al: 1968].  The findings on photobleaching found in these studies may have accounted for a source of error in our experiment.  The highest light intensity used was only 1630 lumens, which was not high enough to cause photobleaching in the chloroplast, resulting in the chloroplast under the highest light intensity having the highest rate of photosynthesis rather than what was predicted.  Another unexpected finding was that the cuvettes turned clear after only 20 minutes rather than the expected 30 minutes, which caused the experiment to end early since the spectrophotometer could not pick up on any more absorbance changes once the solutions were clear.  This may also have served as a source of error in our experiment since the chloroplasts were only exposed to the light for 20 minutes rather than 30, which may not have been enough time for photobleaching to occur.  Lastly, the data from the 800 lumens group was found to be insignificent due to an outlier, which made the results less reliable.  In order to obtain more accurate results, the experiment should be repeated with the chloroplasts exposed to the light for a longer period of time and the highest light intensity used should be above 320, 000 lumens.  With the results from this future study photosynthetic rate can be manipulated using light intensity.  This may allow further experiments on the effect of photosynthesis in spinach to be done efficiently or may allow spinach to be grown in conditions for optimal growth.
