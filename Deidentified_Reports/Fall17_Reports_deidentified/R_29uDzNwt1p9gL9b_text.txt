Title: The presence of food causes a decreased agnostic effect between male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins is a common aquarium fish that is a model organism to use for studies on animal behavior because they are easily accessible and are known to display aggressive intraspecific behavior. Based on varying factors such as the presence of males, females, or food, B. splendins will display a range of aggressive behaviors in an effort to defend territory and secure a mate. Given that food is a basic necessity, it was predicted that the presence of food would have a significent effect on level of aggression in male B. splendins that are also in the presence of another male. We observed the behavior of several fish that were separated by a clear partition, first without food and then with food. We used a Likert scale to assign values to different displays based on their level of aggression. Our results yielded a statistically significent difference between levels of aggression shown in fish without food and in the same fish with food. 


Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, attempts to understand the relationship between physiology and behavior and how behavior has been shaped by evolution and selection. Observation is a key way to study and quantify patterns of animal behavior.  

Betta splendins is a model organism for the study of animal behavior because these fish are easily obtainable and they show high levels of aggression in the presence of other male B. splendins through quantifiable behaviors. Also called Siamese fighting fish, this species originated in southeast Asia but have been domesticated as common aquarium fishes in the United States and other countries (Johnson: 2017). The domesticated form, which began being bred around 1910, is around 4.5 cm in length and come in many shades of red, blue, and purple (Johnson: 2017). When male B. splendins are visible to each other, they show aggressive behaviors such as broadside movements and front facing movements. These fish use these agnostic displays to exchange information about readiness to engage in a fight (Castro: 2006). During their lifetime, B. splendins court females, build bubble nests for offspring, and defend their territory through such aggressive behaviors (Forsatkar: 2001). 

The visible levels of aggression change depending on factors such as fish isolation, presence of a female, or presence of food. Studies on changing levels of aggressive behavior in variable situations can provide insight about the factors that most influence such energy-costly behavior. We predicted that the presence of food will have a significent effect on the level of aggressive behavior displayed by the focal fish. 


Materials and Method:
We used one male B. splendins as the aggressor and a total of four male B. splendins as the focal fish. All of the fish were comparable in size and color. For each trial, we placed the aggressor on one side of a tank and a focal fish on the other side of the tank, separated by an opaque or transparent partition. We observed the behavior of the focal fish for five minutes upon the removal of the opaque partition. We kept a count of the frequency of three broadside movements (in order of increasing aggressiveness): pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing that occurred during the five minutes. Then, the opaque partition was replaced and five minutes of rest was allowed. After the rest period, the focal fish was given a small pinch of food flakes and the opaque partition was removed. The occurrence of the three aggressive behaviors was counted again for five minutes. The process was repeated for the remaining three focal fish. We used a Likert scale in which we assigned one point for each occurrence of pelvic fin flickering, two points for tail beating, and three points for tail flashing. We totaled and averaged the points for each fish and in each condition (with food or without food). 
A two-tailed two-sample t_test was used to determine the significance of the difference between the aggressive behaviors of the focal fish with and without the presence of food. (Johnson: 2017)



Results:
With a cut-off level of 0.05, the two-tailed two-sample t_test revealed that there was a statistically significent difference between the average level of aggression of the focal fish without the presence of food and the average level of aggression of the focal fish with the presence of food (p = 0.031). The average of the total point count for with food is significently lower than the average total point count for without food. 



Discussion:
Based on our results, our hypothesis was supported. There is a statistically significent difference between aggression levels of B. splendins with food and those without food. Aggression levels were significently lower in fish with the presence of food than in the same fish without the presence of food. 

Aggressive behavior in B. splendins has evolved over time to be an effective yet costly mechanism to defend territory and win mates. These behaviors are costly in that they result in heightened metabolic rate, diminished energy reserves, and often physical harm (Castro: 2006). Therefore, fish who are well fed consequently have higher energy reserves and are better equipped to engage in fighting. One study shows that prolonged inanition for two weeks severely inhibits a male's ability to perform the energy-costly displays needed for defense, and thus harms his ability to fight successfully. Furthermore, starved fish's display periods were shorter on average since energy reserves were depleted more quickly (Haller: 1991). Therefore, it is logical that natural selection would act upon the fish that prioritized food obtainment since energy is so vital for successful fighting. It is not surprising to us that the focal fish in our experiment focused more on consuming food than displaying aggressive behaviors when food was present. 

However, we must remain skeptical, until further experimentation, about the significance of our results since habituation and energy depletion could be factors in decreased aggression. Aggression wanes after prolonged exposure to other displaying males, a pattern that is called habituation (Halperin: 1994). One way to observe habituation is to observe a fish after placing a mirror in front of the tank. Several studies have shown that placing a B. splendins in front of a mirror for a few minutes, where it displays against itself, before introduction of a male causes that fish to be less aggressive when the real threat appears (Castro: 2006). Since the same fish were available to all students conducting experiments on B. splendins, including observations with mirrors, it is possible that varying levels of habituation in different fish occurred. Furthermore, energy depletion is also a possibility since the fish we used may have spent prolonged periods of time displaying against other males. While we used the same fish for both conditions (with food and without food), it is possible that some habituation and energy depletion occurred in the fish from the time period without food to the time period with food. 
Our first subject with the lowest aggression score, then, may have been involved in numerous previous experiments. This experiment could be improved by observing fish that have not been involved in other experiments and by conducting many more trials. By doing so, determining statistical significance of the compared aggression levels could be done with more confidence. 

Nonetheless, our results reveal that the presence of food likely has a significent effect on aggression levels due to the prioritization of food over territory defense. The relationship between food and aggression can be applied to a broader scheme to examine and predict how different animals will react to competition for food.
