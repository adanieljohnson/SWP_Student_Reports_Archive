Title: The Effect of Opponent Fish Color on the Level of Aggression of Betta 

Abstract:
    Agonistic behavior is a common phenomenon for the purpose of resource acquisition and sexual selection. This paper predicts that Bettas with different colors would act more aggressively to each other, but Bettas with the same color would act less aggressively. We compared the level of aggression of Bettas by computing the amount of time they displayed red “mane”. We used ANOVA to analyze the data and there was no significent difference among group means. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to support our hypotheses. It is possible that factors other than color, such as the movement of opponents, could largely affect Bettas' agnostic behavior, causing no significent difference among group means. Long time of selective breeding for color could also possibly weaken Bettas’ sensitivity to color. Since color patterns are important for the balance between selection for crypsis by predators as well as sexual selection for conspicuousness by mates, artificially selective breeding of Bettas for color could largely decrease the survivorship of Bettas after they are released back to nature.  

Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, seeks to use observational skills to understand the physiological purpose of animal behaviors, and how certain behaviors have been kept and shaped by selection force [Johnson: 2017]. Agonistic behavior could be commonly observed in many animal species due to the resource limitation of food, shelters, and mates [Barrows: 1996]. Agonistic behavior is any form of behavior associated with aggression, including threat, attack, placation, and retreat with the intention of resource acquisition of food, territory, and mates [Bergman & Moore: 2003].      In this paper, we use Bettas as the subjects of our experiment because they require relatively little care to survive and they display conspicuous agnostic behavior that is easier for us to observe [Kuhn: 1970].  Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, originated in southeast Asia and their domesticated form as a pet was imported into the United States in 1910. During the 1960s and 1970s, Bettas started to be used in experiments to perform socially mediated operant conditioning due to their high-intensity and low-latency aggression in front of a same-sex conspecific[Greenberg & Haraway, 2016]. Bettas have two main types of movement when they display intraspecific agnostic behavior: First, they perform broadside movement with their sides turning to the opponent. Typical behaviors in this position involve pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. The second type of movement, which is more commonly seen, is facing movement with pectoral fins erecting. In more aggressive behaviors, Bettas spread their gill covers and protrude the branchiostegal, creating a noticeable red “mane” [Johnson: 2017]. This paper quantifies the level of aggression by recording the total amount of time that Bettas display their conspicuous red “mane”. But what factors could affect the intensity and endurance of Bettas’ agnostic behavior?           In the experiment of Thompson and Sturm, three Bettas with colors red, green, and blue were conditioned to emit an operant response after researchers presented them models of different color male Bettas. The result suggests that the subject Betta performed lowest response rates when confronting the moving model with its own coloration and performed the most when the reinforcers’ coloration is unlike its own [Sturm & Thompson: 1965]. Three years later, another experiment was performed by Grabowski and Thompson to determine whether the response rates of bettas toward a model of another male Betta splendins varied with its brightness as well as the coloration. The result of this study was consistent with earlier findings, indicating that models with the same color as the subject Betta were least effective at stimulating Betta to perform agnostic behaviors, whereas the interaction between color and brightness was still unresolved [Grabowski & Thompson: 1968]. Based on the previous studies, we predict that a Betta would perform more aggressive behaviors to a conspecific with different colors than to a conspecific with the same color.

Materials and Method:
We put three red bettas in one glass aquarium and three blue bettas in another glass aquarium, with an opaque board in between to block the fish in two aquaria from seeing each other. Two sheets of white plastic were placed inside each tank parallel to the short walls, and two sheets of glass were placed close to each plastic, dividing the aquaria into three compartments with one betta in each.      We removed the opaque white plastic and left the clear pieces of glass in the aquarium. The two bettas could see each other but were physically separated in this situation. We used the timer to record the total amount of time each Betta displayed the red “mane” in five minutes, and then we put back the white plastic to let them rest for another 5 minutes. We used the same procedure for three trials of red on red male bettas as a controlll group, three trials of blue on blue male bettas as another controlll group, and another three trials of blue on red male bettas as the experimental group.   After collecting the data, we converted all the time data into seconds and used ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer test to look for significent differences between the groups to analyze the data in order to see whether there are significent differences among group means. 

Results:
According to figure 1, which summarizes the mean time that Bettas displayed the red “mane” in blue on blue group, blue on red group, and red on red group, the mean amount of time Bettas in blue on red group showing the red “mane” is 103.33±87.59 seconds, which is smaller than the mean amount of time of blue on blue group, 143.33±61.94083 seconds, and red on red group, 172.83±90.82382 seconds most of the time. However, after using ANOVA to analyze the difference among group means, we found that there was no significent difference of means among the three groups (p=0.356).

Discussion:
According to our raw data, Bettas in the red on red group and the blue on blue group seem to show longer aggressive behavior than bettas in the blue on red group. Based on our use of ANOVA to further analyze the data, there was no significent difference among the mean time of displaying the red “mane” in three groups (p=0.356). Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and we cannot conclude that Betta would perform more aggressive behavior toward the conspecific with different colors than Betta with the same color. The result of our experiment seems to contradict the conclusion of the two previous studies, which are also about the effect of opponents’ color on Bettas’ aggressive behavior. There are two possible reasons to explain the difference.  First, the two previous studies used “models” with different color to study how Bettas’ operant response rate varied “as a function of the color of the model with respect to the color of the subject” [Sturm & Thompson: 1965], while our own experiment investigated how the color of another real opponent fish could affect Bettas’ agnostic behavior. Opponent fish in real life was more complex stimuli than models. They have color changes and movements, such as fin flickering, tail flashing, and branchiostegal protruding. An experiment performed to compare the capacity of three visual stimuli of eliciting aggressive display showed that agnostic behavior could more readily be released by a mirror than by moving models and static models with the same color of the subject Betta [Thomposon: 1962]. It is sufficient to illustrate that many factors other than color, such as the movement of the opponent, could affect Betta’s agnostic behavior in our experiment. Therefore, there is no significent difference of time that Bettas displayed red “mane” among groups.   Second, it is possible that today’s Bettas are not sensitive to color as they were before domestication and selective breeding. Wild Bettas in nature are inconspicuous, dull grayish brown or dull olive green and show no resemblance to the brightly colored fish in pet stores or laboratories. They briefly change color to intense blue or red only when they are provoked into agnostic behavior [Johnson: 2017]. After decades of selective breeding for visually appealing color and fantastic color combinations, the bright color that once only showed up when Bettas performed aggressive behaviors is now retained even when they are at rest. Domesticated Bettas as pets were imported into the United States in 1910 and were used in experiments to study socially mediated operant conditioning during the 1960s and 1970s [Greenberg & Haraway, 2016]. The two previous studies were performed in 1963 and 1965 respectively, the time when the domesticated Bettas just began to be used in the laboratory. It is possible that the selective breeding for color weakened the sensitivity of Bettas to color in aggressive sequence.  How would artificially selective breeding for color affect the survivorship of Betta after they are released back to nature? Many pieces of research showed that body colors and patterns are traits under strong selection pressures[Sköld et al: 2012]. Moreover, the color patterns in a particular place are the indication of the balance between selection for crypsis by predators and sexual selection for conspicuousness by mates [Endler: 1980]. In Endler’s experiment, which investigated the effect of natural selection on the color patterns of guppies, researchers found a loss of bright structural colors in guppies when guppies moved from places with relatively few predators to places with plenty of predators [Endler: 1980]. The selection force is similar for Betta splendins. They stay in form of grayish brown or green fish as camouflage when they are at rest in order to hide from predators, and display a hint of color when they perform agnostic behaviors to better protect territory and contend for food and mates. However, when those who retain their “fighting colors” are released back to nature, predators can easily detect them, and most of Bettas would die soon. Therefore, artificial breeding of fish for color benefits humans but also has catastrophic consequences to the breeding animals when they go back to the wild.
