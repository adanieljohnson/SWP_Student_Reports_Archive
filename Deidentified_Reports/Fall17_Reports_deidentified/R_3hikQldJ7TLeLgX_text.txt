Title: The Effect of Intracellular Calcium Inhibitors on Physarum polycephalum Growth and Cytoplasmic Streaming

Abstract:
The effect that intracellular calcium channel inhibitors had on Physarum polycephalum growth and cytoplasmic streaming was determined. It was predicted that if certain Physarum polycephalum were exposed to sodium butyrate, their growth would be more inhibited that others that were exposed to lanthanum chloride. Physarum polycephalum growth measured by direction and distance along with cytoplasmic streaming measured by the time it took for the cell to change direction were used to compare the experimental and control groups. After running a one-tailed, two sample t test, it was determined that there was no significant different among any of the groups in respect to cytoplasmic streaming. The sodium butyrate group had significantly greater Physarum polycephalum growth than both the lanthanum chloride or the control group, therefore rejecting the hypothesis. This experiment and others like it are important in determining treatments for calcium concentration related diseases, like Alzheimer’s Disease. 

Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways allow cells to respond to their internal and external environments. In Physarum polycephalum, the IP3 mediated pathway is important for signal transduction in many cells. This path includes the pathways of two second messengers, IP3 and Ca2+. In Physarum, which is a mass of multiple nuclei contained within a single plasma membrane, all pathways are present in the one cell, which allows cytoplasmic flow reversal and directional growth of the cell to be viewed. In this experiment, the ability of intracellular calcium channel inhibitors to block growth and flow will be observed by blocking IP3 and Ca2+. In nerve cells, an IP3 inhibitor greatly decreased outward growth, proving that IP3 is pertinent to directional growth of cells [Ishima:2008]. However, an overdose of Ca2+ channel blockers in heart cells is lethal, proving that Ca2+ is also vital to the cell’s ability to send signals [Buckley:2007]. Both of these second messengers will be individually inhibited in order to determine which is more crucial to Physarum growth and cytoplasmic streaming. If Ca2+ is involved in the IP3 and Ca2+ pathways, then sodium butyrate will have a larger inhibitory effect on the Physarum growth and cell streaming than lanthanum trichloride.

Materials and Methods:
In total, nine water agar dishes were prepared for this experiment. Three dishes were prepared by cutting 2 3x3 squares on opposite ends of the dish. One square was filled with a Physarum stock sample and the other was filled with the food source, oatmeal. These three dishes represent the control group in the experiment. Another three dishes were soaked in lanthanum trichloride (50µm diluted in 20ml of water) and left to soak for ten minutes. The excess solution was then drained. This same process was repeated for three more plates using sodium butyrate (100µm diluted in 20ml of water). 
All nine plates were placed in an incubator for 24 hours. After this time period, cytoplasmic streaming and growth were measured. Growth was measured in reference to the distance (mm) and direction of the Physarum growth. For cytoplasmic streaming, a phase microscope was used by focusing on the dish spot with the most Physarum growth. For each plate, an area was observed and the time it took for the cytoplasm to change direction was measured. After another 24-hour period, the growth of the Physarum was reassessed. 


Results:
The results from the t tests for Physarum cytoplasmic streaming on Day 1 indicate that there is no significant difference among the control, lanthanum trichloride (LaCl3), and sodium butyrate (Na(C3H7CO2)) groups, as seen in Table 1.
The results from the t tests for Physarum growth on Day 1indicate that there is no significant difference between the LaCl3 and control group. However, there was a significant different between the LaCl3 and Na(C3H7CO2) groups (p-value=0.04) and between the control and Na(C3H7CO2) groups (p-value=0.03), as seen in Table 2. Only two of the three data points collected for the Na(C3H7CO2) group were used in the t tests because the third data point was significantly different from the other two. Also, when the same plate was observed after another 24 hours, its growth still lagged behind the others in its group.
On Day 2, the growth of the Physarum was reassessed. All of the control dishes had all of the Physarum contained within the food source. Both the LaCl3 and Na(C3H7CO2) groups had one plate each that had Physarum growing around the edge of the dish, not around the food. All other dishes of these groups had the Physarum contained in the food.


Discussion:
The substances tested in this experiment, lanthanum trichloride and sodium butyrate, both inactivate intracellular calcium channels. Lanthanum trichloride inhibits IP3 activated channels and sodium butyrate inhibits Ca2+ activated channels. 
In measuring the cytoplasmic streaming of the LaCl3, Na(C3H7CO2), and control groups, there was no significant difference found among them. In an experiment conducted on tomato root hairs, auxin, a hormone that causes cell elongation, was added, yet there was no significant difference in the calcium concentration or in the cytoplasmic streaming in the cells [Ayling:1994]. This research indicates that neither growth inhibitors nor enhancers have a great impact on cytoplasmic streaming.
The growth of the Physarum exposed to Na(C3H7CO2) was significantly greater than that of the LaCl3 and control groups. In a summary of research on sodium butyrate on cells in culture, it was discovered that the substance constantly arrested cell proliferation, directly contradicting that results found in the conducted experiment. However, it was noted in this summary that this arrest could be reversed if the sodium butyrate was removed [Kruh:1981]. In our experiment, the inhibitors were left to soak into the agar for only ten minutes before being drained out. This might not have been sufficient time for the sodium butyrate to properly soak, allowing the Physarum to grow properly after a short period of inhibition.
Although the lanthanum trichloride treatment produced less Physarum growth than the sodium butyrate treatment, it still was not significantly different from the control group. In an experiment testing LaCl3 on its ability to inhibit leukemic cells, significant inhibition was not noted until 48 hours had passed [Dai:2002]. This minimum time requirement could explain why growth was no different between the LaCl3 and control groups after Day 1. After Day 2, one of the LaCl3 dishes showed less growth than the control dishes which can be explained by this research. This experiment also discovered that at low concentrations of LaCl3 (0.5 to 2.0 µm), growth was not inhibited at any time period. If the LaCl3 was not diluted properly, then no results would be able to be concluded from this inhibitor.
Research relating to intracellular calcium channels is important to many medical conditions, like Alzheimer’s Disease. Abnormal regulation of calcium homeostasis has been determined as a major indicator in the development of Alzheimer’s [Magi:2016]. If proper inhibitors and activators of intracellular calcium concentrations can be identified, treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease could be better determined. 
In conclusion, many factors could be responsible for the inconclusively of this experiment. If the inhibitors were not diluted precisely and if they were not able to soak properly, then no accurate results can be derived from this experiment. In the future, a better technique for soaking the dishes could be executed, like letting them soak for 24 hours before beginning the experiment. In this experiment, the null hypothesis that sodium butyrate does not have a greater effect on Physarum streaming and growth than lanthanum trichloride is accepted.
