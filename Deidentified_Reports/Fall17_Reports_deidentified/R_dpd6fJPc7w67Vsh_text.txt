Title: Effects of temperature variation on chloroplast activity in spinach leaves

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of low, high, and room temperature conditions on the photosynthetic activity in spinach leaves. This was done by using DCPIP to mimic the electron accepting activity of photosystem II in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. We predicted that low and high temperatures would decrease chloroplast activity while room temperature would maximize it. Our results instead indicated that chloroplast activity significantly increased in cold and room temperatures, while hot temperatures showed a statistically insignificant decrease in activity. These results show that crops grow better in colder temperatures and provide motivation to combat global warming. 


Introduction:
In plants and other autotrophs, the defining piece of their energy production system is in the light dependent reactions of chloroplasts. This is powered by the photosystems II and I which excite electrons in an electron transport chain, generating a proton gradient to drive ATP synthesis [Johnson: 2017]. There are many environmental factors that can affect the efficiency of these photosystems. In this experiment, we will be testing the effects of temperature change on chloroplast activity in spinach to find the optimal conditions for photosynthesis to occur. We used spinach as our model organism because it has a high concentration of chloroplast which makes it easy to isolate large samples for testing. Since we are testing the effects of temperature on the efficiency of the electron transport chain of photosynthesis, we will also use 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) which mimics NADP+ in the electron transport chain and turns colorless when its accepts electrons in the presence of light and chloroplasts [Johnson:2017]. In previous experiments, the photosynthetic membrane in plants like spinach are damaged at low temperature between 20 °C and -5 °C [Liu et al.: 2016] and high temperature above 30 °C [Zou et al.: 2017]. Based off this range, we will perform assays in an ice bath at 1.5 °C, room temperature conditions of 25 °C, and in a warm water bath set to 47 °C. We hypothesized that both low and high temperatures would decrease chloroplast activity (increase absorbance) in spinach over time, while maximum photosynthetic activity (decreased absorbance) would occur under room temperature conditions. Our independent variables would be temperature and time and the dependent variable is absorbance.

Materials and Methods:
The chloroplasts were isolated from 4 spinach leaves by discarding the veins and grinding with 20 mL grinding buffer then straining the liquid through a cheese cloth. This liquid was then spun in a centrifuge for 3 min at 1200 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was then isolated and spun again for 10 min at 280 rpm at 4 °C. The pellet at the bottom of the tube was isolated and re-suspended with 20 mL grinding buffer. Then, assays were prepared in test tubes labelled #0-11. The first, a blank labelled #0, was filled with 8 ml water and 2 ml reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). In test tubes #1-11, 6 ml water, 2 ml, 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 ml reaction buffer were added. Then, 0.1 ml of chloroplast (re-suspended pellet) were added to test tubes #1-10 to start the assay (Figure 1). Then all the samples were transferred into cuvettes. Sample #0 was used to blank the spectrophotometer at 600 nm and the absorbance of samples #1-11 were taken and recorded for “time 0”. Samples #0, 1 (positive control), 8-10, and 11 (negative control) were placed in room temperature (25 °C), samples #2-4 were placed in ice (1.5 °C), and samples #5-7 were placed in a warm water bath (47 °C). All samples were placed under a light source to activate the light dependent reactions. These assays were run for three 10 minute intervals, stopping to record absorbances at the 10, 20, and 30 minute marks, making sure to blank the spectrophotometer each time. The average absorbances of the replicates and the percent changes between each interval were calculated, and a two-sample t-test was run to test the statistical significance of the results.


Results:
Our positive control started at an absorbance of 0.532 nm and decreased to 0.382 nm after 30 min giving a 28.20% change. The negative control started at 0.554 nm and decreased to 0.529 nm for a 4.51% change. The samples set in cold conditions started with an average absorbance of 0.536 nm  0.009 and decreased to 0.321 nm  0.031 after 30 minutes giving a 40.10% change. The room temperature samples started at 0.530 nm  0.006 and decreased to 0.364 nm  0.092 with a 31.32% change. The hot samples started at 0.519 nm  0.003 and increased to 0.547 nm  0.008 for a -5.27% change. A two-sample t-test comparing the average absorbances between the cold and room temperature samples yielded t-stat= -0.36, df=6, and P= 0.366. A two-sample t-test comparing the average absorbances between room temperature and warm samples gave t-stat= 2.94, df= 6, and P= 0.013. 


Discussion:
The results of our experiment did not support our hypothesis. In comparison to the room temperature samples, the mean absorbance of the cold samples decreased insignificantly. This insignificance is most likely due to an error in temperature choice. In previous experiments, the photosynthetic membrane in plants like spinach are damaged at low temperature between 20 °C and -5 °C [Liu et al.: 2016]. This experiment used 1.5 °C as a low temperature but it may not have been low enough to great a significant difference. The warm samples, however, did show a significant increase in absorbance. This indicates that chloroplast activity is minimized at higher temperatures. These results are especially important when related to the issue of global warming. According to NASA, global temperatures have increased at a rate of about 0.15-0.20 °C every decade since 1975 [Carlowicz: 2010]. This increase can have detrimental effects on commonly consumed plants like spinach that grow better at low temperatures. This shows that it important for us to combat global warming to save crop production and keep food on our tables. In future experiments, we could test chloroplast activity with a range of warmer temperatures between 25 °C and 47 °C to determine the maximum temperature that the chloroplast in spinach can function under.
