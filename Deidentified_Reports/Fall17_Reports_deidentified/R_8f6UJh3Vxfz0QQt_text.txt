Title: The Impact of Temperature Conditions on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
As climate change becomes more of a real and pressing issue, we decided to conduct an experiment measuring the impact of changes in temperature on photosynthesis in spinach leaf chloroplasts; we hypothesized that outside an ideal range of temperature, the photosynthetic activity would be hindered. After obtaining these chloroplasts and suspending them in solution, we treated them with DCPIP to be able to use absorbance comparatively to gauge photosynthetic activity in three different temperature conditions. We used paired, two-tailed student t tests to determine the significance of results and found that there was a significent decrease in photosynthesis in high temperature conditions, but not in lower temperature conditions, meaning the null hypothesis was supported, because a definite hindrance outside of optimal conditions was not substantiated. 


Introduction:
The processing of energy in organisms is what makes the world go around, and the specific mechanisms for this are major differentiating factors between organisms. In autotrophs, photosynthesis allows for creation of chemical energy from light energy harvested from the sun, and allows the organism to live and function. The light-dependent process of photosynthesis is highly impacted by the intensity and level of light [Pedreira, 2015], but many other factors are pertinent to the process as well, as it takes place in various scenarios and environments. In our experiment, we decided to test the impact of temperature on the rate and efficiency of photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleraca (spinach), a good model organism due to its affordability and size. The dependence of photosynthetic rate on temperature of the environment is an increasingly relevant principle to study as global temperatures steadily rise due to the real climate change the planet is experiencing [Vos, 2008]. We hypothesized that outside of an ideal functioning temperature range of around 0-25 degrees Celsius [Vandam, 2017], photosynthetic rates would be negatively impacted, suggesting a decrease in function.  


Materials and Method:
	To collect the chloroplasts to work with in the experiment, we first deveined and crushed leaves in grinding buffer to create a paste that we centrifuged until a pellet containing the majority of the desired chloroplast matter was created that we could suspend in solution and test. After this Hill Assay, we mixed portions of the chloroplast solution with DCPIP to measure photosynthetic action, water, and reaction buffer in 3 different temperature conditions; 25-degree room temperature (ideal environment), a 47-degree water bath, and a 4-degree ice bath. In all three temperature conditions, starting at time 0, we took absorbance of the color-changing DCPIP at 600 nm to calculate percent change in absorbance to correlate with photosynthetic activity. We then conducted a paired, 2-tailed student t test.

Discussion:
Given the results of the study and the statistical confirmation, we must accept the null hypothesis, there is no significent impact of temperature on photosynthetic rate, because only one part of our hypothesis was proved true. Statistically, we saw that at the higher temperature, photosynthetic activity was inhibited, exhibited by an increase in absorbance at 600 nm due to the activity of DCPIP. The p value was significent, at 0.037, which was less than the alpha value of 0.05 but at the lower temperature, the difference in activity was barely observable, let alone significent, as visible in the graph of the data. Because of this, we cannot accept the entirety of our alternate hypothesis and therefore must reject it. We believed that putting a plant, or a plant’s chloroplasts in a temperature outside its individual comfortable range, that photosynthetic activity would be inhibited, as this is most common in spinach plants [Yamori, 2005], but the lack of change could be due to several factors. For example, the limited exposure to differed temperature could have not been enough to have an impact, as in another study, 6 hours was necessary to elicit change in photosynthetic activity of poplar plants [Song, 2014]. The difference between the impact of the two temperature extremes may also be due to the distance from ideal conditions the heated was, at 47 degrees, a 22-degree difference, whereas the 4-degree ice bath was within the possible range of conditions for growth though slightly low from the ideal temperature of 25 degrees [Vandam 2017]. Otherwise, the light level, pH, and other possible factors remained constant throughout trials. Though, our trials gave inconclusive results, understanding the impact of various environmental conditions on photosynthesis is critical. Temperature was a relevant issue as climate change becomes more and more pressing, raising the general temperature on the planet, but many other factors, such as pH in soil, or concentration of different gases in the air surrounding the chloroplast-containing leaves, are important to study as well, as environmental changes are constant. Understanding the impact of our dynamic world on organisms as crucial as autotrophs will always be necessary.
