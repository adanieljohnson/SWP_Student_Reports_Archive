Title: The increase of photosynthetic rate due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide in enriched chloroplasts of kale leaves.

Abstract:
This experiment observed the effect of elevated CO2 concentrations on the photosynthetic rate of kale leaves. CO2 concentration was elevated by using two different treatments of 0.5 molar CO2 Hill Reaction and 1 molar CO2 Hill Reaction on enriched chloroplasts of kale leaves. It was predicted that an increase of CO2 concentration will increase photosynthetic rate. The absorbance at 600 nm of these two treatments and a control group was measured after 30 minutes. The electron acceptor used in this experiment was 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), which becomes colorless when reduced. From this, it can be determined that the lower the absorbance of treatment groups, the higher the photosynthetic rate. The results of the experiment showed that the treatment groups had a lower absorbance and that there is a significant difference between the treatment groups and the control group, and thus concludes that increasing the concentration of CO2 increases the rate of photosynthesis. 


Introduction:
Plants and other organisms depend on the process of photosynthesis to harness light energy from the sun into chemical energy. Photosynthesis involves two processes the light dependent and the light independent reactions. The light dependent reaction generates the proton gradient that drives the production of ATP, which is then used in the light independent reactions to convert CO2 into glucose. The summary reaction of photosynthesis can be given by the equation:
6 CO2  +   12 H2O  ---------------&gt;  C6H12O6  +  6 H2O +  6 O2 .The electrons on ATP  and other electron carriers are then used in chemical reactions that synthesize 6-carbon glucose from 1-carbon carbon dioxide molecules. This lab will use the Hill Reaction to help examine the rate of photosynthesis, which is the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts plus light [Johnson, 2016]. The electron acceptor is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) will be used to measure the rate of photosynthesis. Since, oxidized DCPIP is a dark blue compound and reduced DCPIP is colorless, one can measure the light absorbance, which correlates with the rate of photosynthesis [Johnson, 2016]. If the rate is higher, more DCPIP will be reduced and thus become colorless. In this lab, the Hill Reaction and DCPIP will be used to measure the rate of photosynthesis when kale leaves are treated with different levels of CO2 concentrations. It can be seen that increasing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 stimulates photosynthesis of C3 plants; however, such stimulation is not seen in the long run [Arp, 1991]. Similarly, photosynthesis will be stimulated by 25–75% when the CO2 concentration is doubled from 35 to 70 Pa; however, differences in the long‐term response to CO2 may vary [Stitt, 1991]. From this, the predicted outcomes for this experiment is that increasing the concentration of CO2 will cause an increase in the rate of photosynthesis of the enriched chloroplasts of kale leaves. Kale leaves are practical for this experiment because they are C3 plants, which are most common among land plants and provide a good basis to relate the results of this experiment to other C3 plants. 


Materials and Methods:
Put a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker, and three 50 mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle are cooling, remove the large central veins from 4 medium-sized kale leaves. Throw away the veins, and rinse the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. Blot off any excess moisture from the leaves. When the mortar and pestle are cold, wipe them dry, and then add kale leaves. Add 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Grind the kale until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. Add an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer, mix with the kale slurry, and strain the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Transfer the remaining green liquid to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spin it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Pour the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “B”. Do not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A”. Centrifuge the 50 mL tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Pour the supernatant into a clean 50 mL tube marked “C”. Be careful not to disturb the pellet, and place tube “B” on ice. Mix 10 mL of sodium-free Original Seltzer and 10 mL of 2x Hill Rxn buffer in a clean 50 mL tube and mark it with “1x CO2 Hill Rxn”.  Mix 10 mL of 1x CO2 Hill Rxn and 10 mL of 1x Hill Rxn buffer in a clean 50 mL tube and mark it with “0.5x CO2 Hill Rxn”. Label 13 large test tubes as shown below, and place them in a tube rack. Prepare 3 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes. Only make 1 replicate of the blank. Record absorbance at 600 nm at 0 min and after 30 minutes of mixtures sitting in light. One tube will have 8 mL of water, 2 mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), which will be the blank. Three tubes will have 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130mM of DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer, which will function as the control. Three tubes will have 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP, and 2 mL of 1x CO2 Hill Rxn buffer. The last three tubes will have 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP and 2 mL of 0.5x CO2 Hill Rxn buffer. Add 100 uL of enriched chloroplasts to all of the test tubes. A One-Way ANOVA statistical test will be used to compare the absorbance of the control and of the two treatment groups after 30 min. The Tukey–Kramer test will say if the results are significantly different from each other. 


Results:
The results show that there was significant difference (P=0.001081) in absorbance after 30 minutes between the control group and the two treatment groups. Group 1 and 2 had significant difference between them, groups 1 and 3 had significant difference between them, but groups 2 and 3 did not have significant difference between them

Discussion:
The data show that there was significant difference between the treatment groups and the control group. The increased CO2 concentration treatments showed a lower absorbance, which correlates with a higher photosynthetic rate because reduced DCPIP becomes colorless. While the two treatments showed significant difference from the control, they did not have significant difference between each other. This could be a result of a lack of sufficient CO2 concentration difference between the two to create a significant difference on photosynthetic rate. These results support the prediction for this experiment that increasing the concentration of CO2 will increase photosynthetic rate of enriched chloroplasts of kale leaves. The Hill Reaction observes the reduction of DCPIP, which occurs in the light dependent reaction; however, the fixation of CO2 occurs in the light independent reaction. Since the light independent reaction depends on the high energy electron carriers reduced in the light dependent reaction to occur, then this can explain why increasing the concentration of CO2 increases the amount of DCPIP reduced and thus increases the rate of photosynthesis observed. It is plausible that the rate that electron carriers are reduced depend on the number of CO2 molecules present. Since a higher concentration of CO2 molecules are introduced, more DCPIP was reduced in order to compensate for this new concentration. While this experiment only looked at the short term effect of increased CO2 concentration, it is important to consider the long term effect as well. Projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predict that increased temperature and decreased soil moisture, which would otherwise reduce crop yields, will be offset by the effect of rising carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere [Long, 2006]. However, this report concluded that long term rising CO2 concentration does not yield a higher rate of photosynthesis. Since this experiment only observed photosynthetic rate for 30 minutes, further testing should be done to examine the long term effect.
