Title: The effect of a calcium channel activator on muscle contractions of a Rania pipiens leg

Abstract:
Calcium ions are responsible for the contraction of muscle when they are released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and bind to the troponin complex on actin. The gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens provides a good model system to analyze the effect of using a calcium channel activator on muscle contractions. We used an IMX 214 Stimulator to stimulate the sciatic nerve of the Rania pipiens to generate a contraction of the gastrocnemus. Each frog leg served as its own controlll and experimental group, because each leg was stimulated to find the threshold value for contraction, then injected with 1 Ml of 100mM calcium channel activator. The experimental stimulation exhibited a shorter contractile period than that of the controlll group, although the difference is not statistically significent (P = 0.443, P = 0.820). From our data and observations, it is statistically supported that calcium channel activator does not cause longer contractile periods.

Introduction:
Calcium is the primary ion that causes muscles to contract. When an action potential is received by the target muscle of a motor unit, calcium (Ca2+) gated ion channels open in the presynaptic neuron which releases acetylcholine (ACh) into the muscular junction and onto the motor end plate. ACh triggers sodium channels to open, which allows the action potential to continue and travel down the T-tubules of the muscle. When the action potential reaches the voltage sensitive DHP and ryanodine receptors, they change shape. This allows the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ ions, which attach to the protein troponin allowing for the myosin and actin filaments to bond eliciting contraction from the muscle. In an experiment performed by Daher, et al, they sought to analyze a new Ca2+ ion pathway by using caffeine. Their study concluded that caffeine could activate TRPV1 proteins and allow for Ca2+ influx through a new pathway (Daher: 2008).  From this it lead us to the question of what would happen if more Ca2+ ions were present in the muscle? The hypothesis that will be tested is that more Ca2+ ions will still cause the same number of contractions, but the length of the contractile period will be longer. To analyze the effect of excess Ca2+ions. Rania pipiens will be the model system due to its prominent gastrocnemus muscle and the ease of separating the sciatic nerve to stimulate. To measure the change in time, myographs will be used as the primary tool to determine the time of the contractile period. In the experiment performed it is expected to see the time of the contractile period be greater when the gastrocnemus muscle is given the calcium channel activator. 

Materials and Method:
The Rania pipiens were kept by the Biology Department at Wake Forest University under proper institutional guidelines. Shortly before the experiment was performed the legs were removed from the frogs following proper institutional guidelines as well. They were removed soon to allow optimal contraction to occur. The frog legs were placed inside a dissecting tray where the skin was removed leaving the soft tissue and bones of the leg exposed. The thigh muscle of the frog was separated gently to expose the sciatic nerve of the frog. Careful attention was taken not to mistake the sciatic nerve for the other connective tissue as they appear similar, because of their color. Once the nerve was separated from the thigh muscle, the gastrocnemus muscle was removed from the lower knee joint by using a pair of scissors to cut away the Achilles tendon. Most of the tendon was left attached to the gastrocnemus, because it would make the leg easier to suspend. A knot was tied around the upper part of the gastrocnemus near the left-over tendon, leaving a loop to hang to the gastrocnemus from the force transducer. Once the leg was hung on the force transducer by the loop attached to the gastrocnemus muscle, the rest of the leg was pinned down to minimize movement when the frog leg contracted. Careful attention was taken to avoid damaging the sciatic nerve. Once the leg was suspended and pinned down, the sciatic nerve was laid on to a sleeve electrode, already connected to the stimulator, and secured with a plastic cover. A IMX 214 Stimulator would stimulate the leg. This process was repeated each time a frog was used. To avoid having multiple legs for the controlll group, each leg was its own controlll and experimental group. Each leg would be stimulated to find its threshold stimulus by stimulating at 0.0 V, increasing by 0.1 V until a significent response was seen and measured. Each frog leg had a different threshold value, but each of their values fell between 0.2-0.7 V. Once the threshold value of the frog leg had been determined, the frog leg was stimulated at its threshold voltage by five pulses, the amplitude (in mV) and contractile period (in seconds) was recorded, and the average of the amplitude and contractile periods was calculated. After the controlll data was collected, the same leg was injected with 100mM calcium channel activator. The calcium channel activator was delivered via syringe into the gastrocnemus muscle. In each frog leg, after the controlll data was collected, 0.1 Ml of calcium channel activator was injected into the gastrocnemus with 0.05 Ml being injected into the higher part of the muscle closer to the knot and 0.05 Ml being injected closer to the knee joint. To allow the activator to diffuse throughout the muscle, the frog leg was allowed to rest for thirty seconds before being stimulated again. The same process was used to stimulate the frog leg when collecting the controlll data. For our experiment, we repeated this process three times. After each frog was used, the frog leg and removed skin were placed inside a biohazard collecting bag, the syringes were put inside of a sharps collection box, and each of the metal tools and pins used were cleaned with 70% ethanol solution. 

Results:
For both the contractile and total contractile periods, the experimental stimulation contracted for a shorter length than the controlll stimulation. The difference between the mean of the controlll and experimental contractile period (t_stat = 0.948, P = 0.443, d.f. = 2) was not statistically significent. The difference between the mean of the controlll and experimental total contractile period (t_stat = 0.259, P = 0.820, d.f. = 2) was not statistically significent. 

Discussion:
An influx of calcium causes the contraction of a muscle due to their release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and binding to troponin. According to our hypothesis, the increase in calcium channel activator should have been statistically relevant and caused longer contractions. Statistically, our null hypothesis proved to be the one that was supported: the increase in calcium channel activator did not cause longer contractile periods. This could be due to the muscle already contracting and calcium being used or a calcium channel activator causes a more robust contraction, but not necessarily a prolonged contraction since extra calcium ions are not being added to the organism. While there is data to support that the experimental group did contract for a shorter period of time, the data is not statistically viable to enough to dictate a significent finding. This is similar to Daher’s experiment, because they saw an influx of calcium ions due to the possibility of a new pathway. This was the point of using caffeine, because it could be used to open possible calcium ions in rabbit nodose ganglion neurons (Daher: 2008). The first frog used could also serve as an outlier, because the experimental group did contract longer. Due to the number of frogs used this could have skewed the statistical data. 
	
Logically, the next step for this experiment would be to perform it again to validate the results, using more frog legs. Using more frog legs and performing the experiment again would create larger data sets and allow for a broader view of this trend amongst a broader data pool. Some of the error in this experiment could be to the lack technique performing a detailed and original biological experiment prior to this experiment. The experience of performing this procedure again would also probably yield better viable data. Although, this experiment did open the opportunity for interest in the nature of calcium influx. If a calcium channel activator did not cause a longer contraction then what would be needed to cause a longer contraction? This would be an interesting area to research, because it would draw attention to an ion or compound that would cause longer contraction and the complications that could cause for humans or other organisms.
