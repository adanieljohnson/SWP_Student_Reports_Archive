Title: Sodium channel-blocker in the form of lidocaine, increases the amount of voltage needed for the Rana Pipiens to reach tetany

Abstract:
In this experiment, we worked with the Rana pipiens’s gastrocnemius muscle. Our main objectives throughout this experiment was to find the point at which each frog from the control and experimental group reached tetany and also the twitch threshold of each by using a neuromuscular control system. We used the sodium channel- blocker, in the form of 25mM lidocaine to see how the lidocaine would affect the point at which the frog’s reached tetany. We believe that lidocaine does affect tetany of the R. pipiens muscle. We first conducted a test to find the point at which each frog in the control group reached tetany. Then conducted a test to find the twitch threshold. Once these tests were completed, we injected each frog with about 0.2mL of lidocaine in the gastrocnemius muscle and ran the same tests with the now experimental group. We found that the experimental group had a very high number when it came to the amount of frequency they were able to handle than the control group due to the fact that the experimental group was injected with lidocaine. Our results support our hypothesis because we did find that lidocaine affected the tetany of the frogs.  


Introduction:
In this experiment, we will be using the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens. We isolated the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from each of the R. pipiens’s leg to show the basic properties of neuromuscular control [Johnson: 2017]. The R. piniens was helpful to work with because these frogs are especially good at jumping which means they have a large gastrocnemius muscle. It was also a very easy process for when it came time to separate the sciatic never from the muscle. The legs were prepared before lab which gave us ample time to complete our experiment.  We used the computer program, iWorx, which will show the twitch threshold and the stimulus frequencies that are determined by direct stimulation. We also using a sodium channel blocker, in the form of lidocaine, to see how lidocaine affects the tetany of the gastrocnemius muscle. Lidocaine will block the sodium channels by binding to the sodium channels itself [Cummings: 2007]. We are using lidocaine because we want to know how it will affect tetany of the Rana p’s muscle. We believe that lidocaine does affect tetany of the R. pipiens muscle. So the tetany will be changed by the injection of lidocaine where the independent variable is lidocaine and the dependent variable is the tetany of the muscle itself.


Materials and Methods:
First, we prepared the frog’s leg by using forceps to peel the skin off of the frog leg and separate the inner thigh muscles to reveal sciatic nerve. While doing this, make sure the sciatic nerve doesn’t come in contact with any metal. Once you have removed the skin, place the skin in a corner of the dissecting tray and place each leg in a different corner so you can distinguish which leg is which. You want to keep the leg moist by squirting each leg with the frog Ringer’s solution without drowning the leg in the solution. Next, separate the inner thigh muscles from the leg using a dissecting probe. Free the sciatic nerve from the connective tissue by using a dissecting needle and forceps. Again, you want to keep the frog moist by using the Ringer’s solution. Once you have the inner thigh muscles separated, attach a string to the gastrocnemius muscle from the hook making a 90degree angle between the string that is tied around the muscle and the other parts of the frog leg that are on the tray. You want to be sure to secure the frog’s leg to the tray with pins so when conducting the experiment, the leg doesn’t move. Then take the sciatic nerve that is separated from the connective tissue and lay the nerve on the end of the stimulator and place a clear sleeve over it to secure the nerve in place. From here you will want to hook up the iWorx machine to the frog’s sciatic nerve to determine the twitch threshold. To determine the twitch threshold, you want to start by recording at 0.1V then increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1V increments until you find the twitch threshold. Once you have found the twitch threshold, you need to determine the point at which the frog’s muscle reaches tetany by increasing the stimulus frequency in Hertz. First, you will start off with a stimulus frequency of 2Hz and if the frog does not reach tetany then, change the number of Hertz to 4. If the frog still hasn’t reached tetany after 4Hz, continue to record the stimulus frequencies of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 Hz. Repeat this whole process for all three of the frog’s legs. Once you have determined the twitch threshold and tetany for each frog, prepare the lidocaine solution. You want to use 25mM of lidocaine and dissolve 0.6g of lidocaine into 100mL of Ringer’s solution. Then, inject the frog with about 2 mL of the lidocaine solution into the gastrocnemius muscle and wait at least 5 minutes before continuing the experiment to give the frog rest. Once you have waited the 5 minutes, repeat the exercises to determine the twitch threshold and the point at which the frog’s muscle reaches tetany. Repeat this same exercise for all 3 of the frog’s legs. Once all the data is gathered, we use a paired t-test with two degrees of freedom to show the results.


Results:
In the first part of the experiment, we found the frequency in Hertz at which each frog reached tetany. From Figure 1, in the control group, control 1, 2 and 3 all reached tetany at 10 Hz. However, our data for our experimental group, they all did not reach tetany where only experimental 1 found tetany at 2.5 Hz. The next test we conducted was on finding the twitch threshold of each frog. In the control group, control 1 reached 0.5 Hz., control 2 reached 0.2 Hz. and control 3 reached 0.2 Hz. before they reached the twitch threshold. The standard deviation between the control group is 0.173. In the experimental group, experimental 1 reached 2.5 Hz., experimental 2 reached 3.0 Hz. and experimental 3 reached 3.0 Hz. The standard deviation between the experimental group is 0.289. From Table 1, you can tell how the control groups are all close in the amount of voltage they received in order to find the twitch threshold. This is the same way for the experimental group where the twitch threshold was close in the amount of voltage they received. There is a big difference in the amount of voltage that the control group and the experimental group received during the testing of twitch threshold. From Figure 2, we were able to find the mean, degrees of freedom, t-value and the p-value. The mean of the control group was 0.3 and the mean of the experimental group was 2.8. The degrees of freedom were at the value of 2 and the t-value was 9.5. We concluded that are results are significant with a p-value of 0.0109. 


Discussion:
When finding the frequency in Hertz at which each frog reached tetany, all three frogs in the control group were able to reach tetany all at 10Hz. However, when it came time to test the experimental group, not all of the frogs were able to reach tetany. Only frog 1 reached tetany at 2.5 Hz and the other two frogs did not reach tetany. This happened because in the experimental group, we injected each frog with approximately 2mL of lidocaine 25mM. The lidocaine will block the sodium channels by binding to the sodium channels itself which causes the frogs to not have such a strong response to the frequency of Hertz we are giving to them [Cummings: 2007]. With the presence of lidocaine, the frogs became non responsive to the frequency of Hertz. With the experimental group’s lack of data for the point at which they reached tetany, we were not able to conduct a test of any sort with the control group. A possible source of error that occurred on our part is regarding the experimental 1 frog. The frog did reach tetany at a very low number which shows something went wrong. A possibility of this result is that we did not give it the same amount of rest time that was given to the other two experimental frogs. By not having an efficient amount of rest time, the lidocaine may have not had enough time to set in and bind to the sodium channels to block the frequency in Hertz that was being given to it [Cummings: 2007]. When it came time to find the twitch threshold, both experimental and control groups were able to find their own twitch threshold. However, there was big difference in the number of Hertz that it took the control group to reach twitch threshold and the number of Hertz that it took the experimental group to reach twitch threshold. The experimental group had a very high frequency which is to be suspected considering we injected each of the frogs with lidocaine. This gave the frogs the ability to handle a higher amount of frequency than the frogs in the control group. The standard deviation within the experimental group was fairly low at 0.0109, which shows that our results were conclusive. By conducting this experiment, our results show that our hypothesis was supported considering that there was a big difference between the control group’s twitch threshold and the experimental group’s threshold, where the experimental group’s threshold values were a lot larger. 
As stated earlier, the frogs from the control group were all able to reach tetany, but in the experimental group, only one frog was able to reach tetany. There are a few possible errors that could have arose with this experiment one of them being that instead of only having three frogs, we could have used a bigger group of frogs with our experiment. I feel like the more frogs we would have had, the more accurate our data would have been. Therefore, we were not able to conduct a test on the point at which the control group and the experimental group reached tetany due to the fact that we did not have data for the whole experimental group. Secondly, the frogs rest time in between the injection of lidocaine and the start of the tetany test could have differed from the first frog that actually reached tetany and frog two and three that didn’t reach tetany. The lidocaine that was injected into the first frog of the experimental group may have not had the appropriate amount of rest time of 10 minutes, and we conducted the tetany test too quickly before the lidocaine had time to settle in.
