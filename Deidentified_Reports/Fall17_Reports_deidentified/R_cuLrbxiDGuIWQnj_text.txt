Title: Dominant Aggression Decreases Specific Metabolic Rate of Crayfish (Orconectes Sp.)

Abstract:
Metabolic rate is significant in the sense that the metabolism consists of the physical and chemical processes that occur within living cells and organisms for the necessity of maintaining life. In this study, specific metabolic rate and oxygen consumption were the focus of study through the use of crayfish (orconectes sp.). This experiment strove to determine, whether or not the metabolic rate of a subordinate crayfish would increase after having been exposed to a large, dominate crayfish that would have created social stress for the smaller crayfish. After exposing three subordinate crayfish to a designated dominate crayfish, there was a decrease in oxygen consumption and therefore, the metabolic rate of the subordinate crayfish. This does not support the idea that aggression/social stress lead to an increase in metabolic rate.  


Introduction:
An organism’s metabolism is fundamental in the way that it is the sum of the chemical reactions that take place within each cell of a living organism that provide energy for vital processes and for synthesizing new organic material. The amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific period of time is referred to as its metabolic rate. Metabolic rate can be measured as the rate of heat energy released from an animal’s body (this procedure is known as calorimetry). However, measuring heat released from an animal body with accurate precision requires special equipment, which is often expensive. As a result, physiologists often use a process to measure metabolic rate that is correlated directly with heat production: rate of oxygen consumption. In an article published in 2000, K.A. Sloman set out to explore environmental factors, which lead to changes in specific metabolic rate. The researcher carried out a study where he observed the effects of aggression on metabolism through the use of the brown trout (salmo trutta). Sloman placed a pair of the species in small, confined aquarium where he allowed one of the trout to establish a social hierarchy by becoming the dominant fish. He found that, the other fish (the subordinate) experienced high levels of social stress as a result of the aggression exhibited by the dominant trout. This led the smaller fish to have an increase in specific metabolic rate, which was measured through oxygen consumption [Sloman:2000]. This experiment is similar to our own as we wish to test the effects of aggression on the specific metabolic rate. In order to do this, we will use crayfish (orconectes sp.). We will be measuring the specific metabolic rate of this species through oxygen consumption both before and after exposing the subject to an aggressor (dominate crayfish). This will allow us to study the effects of aggression/social stress on the metabolism of crayfish. We will carry out this experiment with the following hypothesis in mind: if a crayfish is exposed to aggression/social stress, then it will have a significant increase in specific metabolic rate.


Materials and Methods:
The materials required for this experiment include four crayfish (three which are about the same size and one, which is significantly bigger in order to serve as the dominant crayfish), a screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air, a plastic dishpan, a dissolved oxygen probe, a funnel, and a graduated cylinder. Begin the experiment by weighing each of the four crayfish in order to ensure that 3 are small enough to serve as subordinates to the one larger dominant crayfish. Next, fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air and set the test chamber into the plastic dishpan. Fill the dishpan with water that has been saturated with air. Place the first subordinate crayfish into the test chamber, and screw on the top. When the top is secure, gently refill the container with water so the top overflows slightly. Next, insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber. Make sure that the chamber is completely filled with water. Turn on the instrument and allow reading to stabilize. Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Read The oxygen concentration again at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Next, remove the probe. Carefully pour the water from the test chamber through a funnel into the graduated cylinder and record the volume of the water (volume will be used to determine specific metabolic rate). Refill the chamber with oxygen-saturated water and place the subordinate crayfish into the testing chamber. Place the dominant crayfish into the surrounding dishpan, where it is close to the subordinate crayfish. Once again, take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen and then write down the oxygen concentration at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. When finished, unseal the chamber and measure the amount of water used in order to determine the specific metabolic rate. Return both the subordinate crayfish and the dominant crayfish to their original holding pens. Repeat this process with the second and third subordinate crayfish. 


Results:
A significant decrease in SMR was observed after having exposed the smaller crayfish to the aggressive and dominant subject. Each of the three subordinate crayfish exhibited similar results as they inhaled less oxygen and experienced a much lower SMR whenever in the presence of the dominant crayfish. In each of the three trials, the subordinate crayfish seemed unafraid of the larger crayfish. There was minimal interaction between the two subjects in each trail as they maintained their distances and exhibited little to no movement. Figure 1: Comparison of the average specific metabolic rates of the crayfish between the control groups and the experimental groups. The control group averaged an SMR of 0.0006572034738 O2xg-1xmin-1 with a standard deviation of ±0.0002593850403. The experimental group averaged an SMR of 0.0002329554077 O2xg-1xmin-1 with a standard deviation of ±0.00006522339851. The data produced a t-value of 2.074224123 and a p-value of 0.1737670659. 


Discussion:
The collected data in this experiment does not support our original hypothesis, which stated that the subordinate crayfish would experience an increase in specific metabolic rate after being exposed to the aggression of a dominant crayfish. As a result, our null hypothesis could not be rejected. After being exposed to the dominant crayfish, the subordinate crayfish consumed less oxygen from the saturated water and experienced significant decreases in metabolic rate, which was unexpected. Considering the parameters of our experiment, there were clearly some limitations, which may have had drastic effects on our results. For example, we were only given four crayfish to carry-out this experiment. Having more crayfish to experiment on could rule out some room for error in the sense that these specific crayfish were simply not affected by the aggression imposed by the dominant crayfish. We also found that the size of the dominant crayfish was a limiting factor to this experiment. This is because the size difference between the dominant and subordinate subjects was not as large as we had hoped. Having used a larger and more dominate crayfish in comparison to the subordinates could have increased aggression and therefore, metabolic rate. The size of the dishpan used in this experiment was also a limiting factor in the sense that it was too large and allowed the crayfish to maintain great distances from one another. A smaller dishpan, which would have forced the crayfish to interact more closely could have also lead to more aggression and therefore, an increase in metabolic rate with regards to the subordinate crayfish. With regards to ideas for future study, we suggest exposing the subordinate crayfish to other sources of stress in order to determine if that stress leads to a higher metabolic rate. For example, an experiment could include placing a subordinate crayfish in the presence of a dominant crayfish, where the two must compete for say, food or a mate. The increase in social stress and aggression between the two subjects could lead to an increase in metabolic rate. Exposing a small crayfish to other types of predators like large fish, otters, or raccoons could also be tested for an increase in metabolic rate. Studies like these can further our knowledge in understanding how natural interactions affect our physiological systems.
