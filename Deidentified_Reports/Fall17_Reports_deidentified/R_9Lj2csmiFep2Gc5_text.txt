Title: Lidocaine’s Effects on Stimulus Response Rate of the Gastrocnemius Muscle (Rania pipiens) when Stimulated through the Sciatic Nerve

Abstract:
We will be working with the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens to demonstrate properties of neuromuscular controlll. We will be viewing the effects of lidocaine has on muscle tension and neuromuscular controlll. Our null hypothesis is that there will be no change or increase in response when stimulating the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts after injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with lidocaine. Our alternative hypothesis is that there will be a decrease in response when the sciatic nerve is stimulated with 1.0 volts after injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with lidocaine. Three frog legs were used in this experiment. They each served as its own controlll. We injected each experimental gastrocnemus muscles with 2 Ml of 25mM lidocaine. There was an overall decrease in the average response rate of our experimental group. However, our P-value was 0.57375 which is not below our alpha level of 0.05. The results are not significent and we failed to reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis was not supported (P= 0.5375, t= 0.666377, d.f.=2).

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles can respond in miliseconds. We will be working with the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens to demonstrate properties of neuromuscular controlll. These frogs were bred to complete experimental designs like this one and to be worked with to understand muscle tension and neuromuscular controlll. We used a myogram to visualize the inner workings. A myogram gives a visual to muscle twitches and has a latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase. Muscle tension is generated by spatial and temporal summation. We will be viewing the effects of lidocaine has on muscle tension and neuromuscular controlll. Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker [Bishtok, Gerner, Oh: 2009]. Sodium channels are necessary to depolarize the cell membrane and generate action potentials. Blocking sodium channels disrupts action potential generation and prevents information transmission to the central nervous system [Bisktok, Gerner, Oh: 2009]. ACh crosses the neuromuscular junction and binds to the specific ligand-gated channels. The influx of sodium depolarizes the cell and causes sodium voltage-gated channels to open to propagate the action potential. Our null hypothesis is that there will be no change or increase in response when stimulating the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts after injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with lidocaine. Our alternative hypothesis is that there will be a decrease in response when the sciatic nerve is stimulated with 1.0 volts after injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with lidocaine. The dependent variable is stimulus response measured in volts. The independent variable is the injection of lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle. 

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were used in this experiment. They each served as its own controlll. To prepare the leg, we pulled the skin down towards the foot, moistened with ringer’s solution, separated inner thigh muscles, and freed the sciatic nerve. Then we placed an electrode on the sciatic nerve and suspended the gastrocnemus muscle as shown in Diagram 1. 

After the preparation, we stimulated the gastrocnemus muscle through the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts and record the response with Labscribe. Repeat for all 3 controllls. 
We injected each of the 3 gastrocnemus muscles with 2 Ml of 25mM lidocaine. We evenly injected the lidocaine throughout the muscle. Then we stimulated the gastrocnemus muscle through the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts and recorded the response. This was repeated for all 3 treatments. 
To evaluate the data we used a 1-tailed paired t_test to determine if the null hypothesis could be rejected or if we failed to reject the null hypothesis. An alpha level of α=0.05 was used. The controlll and treatment groups were compared. 


Results:

The controlll group (n=3) response was an average of 0.417 volts. The experimental group (n=3) response was an average of 0.308 volts. The response rate for experimental 1 increased while experimental 2 and 3 decreased. 
The results are not significent and we failed to reject our null hypothesis.


Discussion:
There was an overall decrease in the average response rate of our experimental group. This could have been caused by the incomplete propagation down the neuron. Blocking sodium channels disrupts action potential generation [Bisktok, Gerner, Oh: 2009] and this in turn could explain why experimental 2 and 3 had decreased firing rate. Since threshold was reached, the lidocaine did not result in a complete block of all sodium channels. Our P-value was 0.57375 which is not below our alpha level of 0.05. The results are not significent and we failed to reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis was not supported (P= 0.5375, t= 0.666377, d.f.=2). Our limitation was our sample size. A larger sample size gives a smaller standard deviations of the sample mean and is more representative. An increase in sample size could make our data significent. Our next step would be to expand this research to test its effectiveness in anesthesia.
