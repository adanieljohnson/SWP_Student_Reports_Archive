Title: The Effect of Tank Size on Total Betta Fish Aggression Time

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior can be tricky since the researcher has to create new method of quantifying movements into numerical values that can be analyzed. When studying behavior, Betta fish, betta splendins, is often used at it has characteristic aggressive movements. In this study, we wanted to know if tank size has an effect on the total aggression time, using gill flaring as a marker. The test fish were put into three different sized tanks and the total aggressive time was measured in seconds. Statistical tests (ANOVA) showed no significance between any of the tank sizes used in terms of total aggressive behavior exhibited by two betta fish. Data like this is important when we want to know why animals react the way they do and how it translates to human behavior. Similar method like those used in this study could be utilized for other species to advance conservation efforts. 

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior using observational data that is quantified in some way. Animal aggression is a behavior that is often studied by scientists in an attempt to understand the drives behind such behaviors. To study aggression, a common animal subject is the Siamese Fighting Fish, or Betta spendens, which has been documented to exhibit characteristic agnostic behavior. Agonistic, or aggressive behaviors, are movements that are exhibited by an animal that is threatened in some way [Johnson 2017]. A characteristic agnostic behavior of the betta fish is called gill flaring in which the fish inflates its operculum which results in the gills extending outward [Forsatkar, 2016]. For these behaviors to take place and be effective, the two organisms involved must be in close proximity. With this in mind, our group was interested in how tank size would affect gill flare time of two male betta fish since increased water volume would mean varying space allotted for escaping close proximity acts of aggression. We hypothesized that the largest tank would have the least amount of aggressive gill flaring in seconds and that there would be a significent difference between the largest tank and the smallest tank.  

Materials and Method:
The group obtained two betta fish that are to be used in all 9 trials. We completed the first trial on the medium tank (2400cm3 water). For each trial, a stopwatch is assigned to both fish and the total time (in seconds) of gill flaring is recorded for each fish in each trial. After a five-minute exposure period was completed, the fish were removed and put into separate resting containers for five minutes. Two more trials were completed for the medium tank. Afterwards three trials were completed for both the small tank (1080 cm3 water) and the large tank (14,175 cm3 water) with five-minute exposure times followed by five minute periods of rest. 
	The data collected was the time (in seconds) that each fish exhibited gill flaring behavior. These two numbers were then added together to create a total time of aggression. This data was then analyzed using an ANOVA test as the group was interested in any significance between any of the three tank sizes. This data would help to discern any differences in aggression times and if tank size, or amount water that a fish can evade aggressive behavior, had an effect on total aggression time among two male betta fish. 


Results:
As seen in Figure 1. the average gill flare behavior time for the small tank was 9.33  11.18 seconds. The average gill behavior time for the medium tank was 22.8  36.11 seconds. The average gill behavior time for the large tank was 3.84  4.02 seconds. 
	An ANOVA test was used to analyze the data. The test revealed that there was no significance (P = 0.331) between any of the tank sizes in terms of total average aggression time in seconds. The shortest aggressive time was exhibited in the largest tank and the longest aggressive time was exhibited in the medium tank. 


Discussion:
After performing the ANOVA test was performed, it was shown that there was no significent difference between any two of the three groups.  Saying this, our hypothesis that the largest tank would elicit a shorter total gill flare time than the medium or small tank could not be supported and the null hypothesis that no effect on aggression time would be caused by changing tank size could not be rejected. 
	One likely reason that the data did not prove to be significent is the idea of habituation, which is the decrease of a behavior due to being desensitized to a continual stimulus. In a study concerning a bettas’ response to a continual stimulus of a mirror, it was found that the fish start to diminish behavior as the stimulus continues [Clayton and Hinde 1967]. In our experiment, the fish stopped any sign of gill flaring and agnostic behavior after seeing the other fish for about a minute of exposure in each trial performed for every tank size. The large tank was seen to have the smallest total aggressive behavior time and even though it was not found to be significently different and could not be attributed to water volumes’ effect on evading measures of the fish, it could be attributed to habituation. Additionally, it is interesting to note that since we completed the trials for the medium tank first, habituation could also be supported since the larger average aggressive time could have been because there were no prior stimuli. The total average gill glare time seemed to decrease after that point. Another study links the quick habituation time to a stimulus as having a chemical basis that works specifically on agnostic behavior [Meliska 1975]. Beyond habituation, chemical changes work to explain what may have caused the minimal aggressive displays. The tank size may not have mattered with regards to total gill flare time if both of the fish were going to habituate so quickly.   
	In future trials it would be advantageous to run many more trials to solidify how tank size effects the total gill flare time and agnostic behavior in general. Also, tanks with more specific measurements may be of importance in future trials because the volume of water in two containers may be the same but the containers can look very different. To avoid this, the shape of the different tanks should be scaled so that the next size increase is a multiplicative change. For example, if the smallest tank was 64 cm3 , the next size could be 512 cm3 . 
	Research like this is important when understanding how and why animals react to stimuli and how that connects to human behavior. With a better understanding on why animals act the way that they do, conservation efforts can be improved. If this type of experiment had been performed on an endangered species, it could have valuable insight on the area of space needed to increase the numbers, while also decreasing aggressive interspecific acts that could lead to the death of individuals in the already decreasing population.
