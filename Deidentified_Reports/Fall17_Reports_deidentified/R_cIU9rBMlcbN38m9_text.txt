Title: Resource allocation in Vigna Radiata due to green light in comparison to natural light where there was no significent difference

Abstract:
In order to perform photosynthesis, plants must have light, but how does the color of light affect the way a plant will allocate its resources? Plants reflect the wavelengths of green light which is why they are green to the human eye. If mung beans (Vigna Radiata) reflect green light will they allocate their resources to their shoots in order to have more access to light for photosynthesis? It was hypothesized that if exposed to only green light, the mung beans will allocate their resources to their shoots in order to make up for the lack of light they did not receive for photosynthesis. However, after growing two groups of mung beans under either green or natural light, the results of the root-to-shoot ratios showed that green light did not affect the way mung beans allocate their resources. 


Introduction:
The absorption of light by plants can be affected by a multitude of variables, however, light is one of the most important. The spectrum of visible light contains every color human eyes can process, and there are colors that plants are more successful with than others. Green light is expected to be the least efficient light for plants considering chlorophyll reflects it. However, according to Sharakshane, a plant contains “auxiliary pigments that capture energy” from other spectrum bands [Sharakshane: 2017]; and according to Materova, green light can penetrate through the plant canopy [Materova: 2017]. Therefore, plants can absorb green light and transfer it to the chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Red and blue light are considered to be the most efficient colors of light for plant growth because according to Kuan-Hung Lin, exposure to red light alone can cause plant elongation and reduced biomass and exposure to blue light helps with “leaf expansion and enhances the biomass production.”[Lin: 2013] If green light is reflected by the plants more than it is absorbed it is expected that the mung beans will allocate their resources to their shoots in order to make up for the lack of light for photosynthesis. The purpose of this experiment is to see if green light affects the way that mung beans allocate their resources. After learning about the effects of different colors of light, there was a desire to further investigate what green light would do to the root-to-shoot ratios of the mung beans. Mung beans were chosen because they were easy to separate and measure after growing for two weeks. It was hypothesized that the mung beans exposed to only green light would have a lower root-to-shoot ratio than the natural light because they would allocate their resources to their shoots. The null hypothesis will be that the average of the root-to-shoot ratios will be the same for the natural and green light. The alternative hypothesis will be that the average green light root-to-shoot ratio will be lower than the natural light root-to-shoot ratio. 


Materials and Method:
Mung beans (Vigna Radiata) were planted in six different pots with the same vermiculate. The pots were filled to the brim with the vermiculate and around forty mung beans were planted in each. They were watered until the pots were saturated, and they would be watered until they were saturated every day for two weeks. To expose the mung beans to green light, green plastic wrap would be placed around the area above the plants. In order to ensure the experiment group was not affected by temperature as well as the color of the light, the controlll group would also be wrapped in clear plastic wrap. Using tape, sticks, and the transparent plastic, the plants were surrounded with the plastic wrap. The two groups of mung beans would be placed in a greenhouse for two weeks. After two weeks, the plants were removed from the greenhouse in order to be measured for root/shoot lengths and masses. Ten replicates were picked from each of the six pots and were measured for root mass, shoot mass, shoot length, and root length. Once the measurements were taken they were compared using a two-sample t_test. The two-sample t_test would allow the comparison of the averages of the root-to-shoot ratios of green light and natural light, and display whether or not the data were due to chance. 


Results:
After collecting the mass and length data from the mung beans, it was noticed that the average mass root-to-shoot ratio of the green light plants were a little lower than the average of the natural light mass root-to-shoot ratio. However, this was not by much, it was also noticed that the trends for the length root-to-shoot ratios were the opposite of the mass ratios. Green light plants had a higher length root-to-shoot ratio than the natural light plants. The green light roots were longer in relation to their shoots than natural light, and natural light roots were heavier in relation to their shoots than green light. The statistical test used in this lab was the two-sample t_test to analyze the averages of the green light and natural light ratios. The results from the two t_tests (one for mass and one for length) were a p_value of 0.646 for length ratios and a p_value of 0.901 for mass ratios. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported by the results of the experiment. It was expected that the green light to change the root-to-shoot ratio to favor the shoots more than natural light, but it seems the green light did not change the outcome of the root-to-shoot ratios. The p_values for both the natural light and the green light plants showed that the averages have no difference and the difference is not statistically significent. The averages were very similar and the small differences between the average root-to-shoot ratios were most likely due to chance. The fact that the independent variable did not affect the R:S ratio may lead to further investigation of the auxiliary pigments plants contain to see if they process green and other colors of light [Sharakshane: 2017]. Those pigments in the mung beans possibly utilized the green light, so there was no difference between the two groups. A future experiment to perform may be to use multiple colors of light to see if the pigments in the plants use light from different spectral bands [Sharakshane: 2017]. The procedure previously stated would be repeated, but plastic wrap of different colors would be used in multiple groups. This could display the plants use lights of different spectral bands or if the results show the different colors affected the plants, what else might be going on would have to be explored.

Figure Legends: 
Table 1: This graph displays the average root-to-shoot length ratios between green light and natural light. The error bars overlap because the averages of the two are very similar to one another, but despite the similarity, the natural light’s R:S length ratio is smaller than green light’s.
Table 2: This graph displays the average root-to-shoot mass ratios between green light and natural light. The error bars overlap in this graph as well because the averages are so similar. However, the green light’s average R:S mass ratio is slightly smaller than the natural light’s.
