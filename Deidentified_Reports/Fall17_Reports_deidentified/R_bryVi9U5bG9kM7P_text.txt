Title: The effect 2% sevin has on the tetany of a Rana pipien’s muscular system

Abstract:
To discover the effect of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on tetany, 2% sevin was injected into the
gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens. Our hypothesis was that the addition of the inhibitor would
lower the value of hertz necessary for the muscle to reach tetany. Our hypothesis proved to be correct as the results showed a consistent lowering in the Hz tetany was reached before and after 2% sevin was added to the
gastrocnemius muscle. Through the comparison of the data, we see that before the chemical was added, the muscle required a higher level of hertz to reach tetany. Once the 2% sevin was injected, the muscle reached tetany sooner, at a lower hertz level.


Introduction:
In our experiment, we injected 2 % sevin into the Rana pipien; or more commonly known as the northern leopard frog. The organism was chosen for the level of tolerance its muscle fibers held for both handling and temperature change. In comparison to mammalian muscle fibers, the higher tolerance of the frog muscle fibers makes the northern leopard frog a better choice for this experiment. Our chemical, sevin, is referred to as carbaryl. When used practically, it is applied as a pesticide (NIPC, 2016) . It functions by blocking acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is responsible for ceasing the signal between the pre-synaptic cleft and the post-synaptic cleft through the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) into acetic acid and choline. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter released from a neuron’s presynaptic membrane that binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic cleft. The binding of ACh depolarizes the myofibril and in response, an action potential is fired. Once the signal is passed, AChE is released to break down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. This ceases muscular contraction. We will be using the gastrocnemius muscle in the northern leopard frog to inject the 2% sevin, which will inhibit the actions of AChE. Through the inhibition of AChE, ACh will remain bound and lead to the constant contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle (PDP101, 2004). The continual contraction of the muscle with no relaxation is called tetany. It can be physically characterized by spasms of the muscle. To initiate the muscle contractions, the northern leopard frog will be attached to a force transducer that will expose the frog’s sciatic nerve to increasing values of hertz. We hypothesize that the injection of 2% sevin into the gastrocnemius muscle will lower the value of hertz that will be necessary for tetany to occur at. Our dependent variable is the hertz tetany will occur at while our independent variables are whether sevin is used or not and the amount of time the nerve is stimulated for.


Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, we skinned the three freshly obtained legs from the top of the leg, where is was cleaved from the body, past its feet. Next, the sciatic nerve was isolated from the leg. To find the nerve, we separated the leg muscles between the dorsal and ventral side. In the next step, we detached the gastrocnemius muscle at the achilles tendon. The muscle was detached by cutting on the achilles tendon, leaving a remainder of it attached to the gastrocnemius muscle. The remaining portion of the achilles tendon was tied to the hook by thread and tightened until the muscle formed a 90 degree angle with the remaining portion of the leg. This portion of the leg was pinned to the dissection pad. Once securely pinned, we placed the sciatic nerve along the clasp of the force transducer. We initially began by using 4 Hz, and proceeded by increasing the hertz value to 8 Hz, 12 Hz, and finally 15 Hz. We recorded the visual results and the data on the computer for each Hz setting. Next, we continued by injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with .2 mL of 2% sevin and ran each Hz. setting again. We repeated this with each leg until all three had experienced the same level of Hz with and without the 2% sevin. Throughout the experiment, after the skinning of the frog legs, we would rinse the exposed muscles with ringer solution to prevent them from drying out. 


Results:
As it was shown in the two graphs, after the 2% sevin was injected into the leg, tetany was reached at a lower
hertz value. It is also seen that the larger the size of the frog leg, the higher value of hertz it required to reach
tetany.

Discussion:
The results supported our hypothesis, showing that tetany could be reached at a lower hertz value if
acetylcholinesterase was inhibited, producing constant contraction. Inhibiting this molecule allowed
acetylcholine to remain bound to the post-synaptic membrane. Due to it remaining there, there was a
constant depolarization. The action potential persisted, producing the muscle contractions we saw. The
constant muscle contractions, with no reprieve, led to tetany at a faster and lower frequency, and
therefore lower rate. There have been no other research experiments documented using 2% sevin on
a nervous system to compare our results with, only the destructive results of its pesticide attributes and experimentations on the chemical’s radioactivity. To improve the accuracy of our results, obtaining legs similar in size would prove to be beneficial. This is known because there was obvious deviation between the Hz tetany was reached and the size of the northern leopard frog leg. If we intended to solely find the variance in the Hz level tetany is reached, the absence of other variables would prove to be helpful. In addition to this, we could improve our results by increasing the Hz level through smaller increments. By increasing anywhere between 3-4 Hz we could easily miss the correct level tetany occurred at. This could provide an incorrect variance in our results.
