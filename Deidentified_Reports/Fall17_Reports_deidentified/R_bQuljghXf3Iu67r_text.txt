Title: The effect of temperature on the amount of photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea chloroplast samples.

Abstract:
The experiment set out to demonstrate the effects of high and low temperature conditions on photosynthetic function of Brassica oleracea, kale, chloroplasts samples. Photosynthesis is the process where light energy drives the breakdown of CO₂ and H₂O into chemical energy stored in glucose. Our hypothesis was that the room and cold temperature conditions would have higher levels of photosynthetic activity than the hot conditions.  Kale is able to grow in fall or winter seasons, so we did not expect the cold condition to inhibit photosynthesis. Since the Calvin cycle is dependent on enzyme function we expected the high temperatures to lower photosynthesis. Photosynthetic activity was measured between the 3 temperature conditions through absorbance of DCPIP. The results of the study supported our hypothesis because the lowest absorbance change was in the high temperature chloroplasts samples and the highest was seen in the samples kept at room temperature. The experiment demonstrated that photosynthesis in kale is inhibited by high temperatures. It is important to understand the optimum temperatures for photosynthesis and plant growth for farming. Also, further studies on the effects of temperature on photosynthetic function can help predict the effects of global climate change.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which photosynthetic organisms use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic compounds. This process occurs through light reactions and dark reactions. The light reactions take place in the chloroplasts and begins with light being captured by pigment molecules. That light energy is used to move electrons from water, which generates a proton concentration gradient to create ATP and NADPH (Lambers, H., 1998). The light-independent reactions take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts and involve the carbon fixation from CO2 to three-carbon sugars. This process is also known as the Calvin Cycle and is catalyzed by the enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO). The light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration. Six carbon dioxide molecules are imported into the Calvin Cycle to produce one six-carbon glucose molecule (Raines, C.A., 2003). During photosynthesis, oxygen is used as the final electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chains. However, an alternative electron acceptor which can be used is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP). DCPIP is useful in laboratories because when the molecule is reduced during photosynthesis it loses it dark blue color and becomes clear. In this experiment, the amount of photosynthesis will be determined by measuring the amount of absorbance of DCPIP at 600nm. The ideal conditions for photosynthesis include an appropriate amount of water and nutrients to the plant, as well as optimal temperature and light conditions. Since different plant species grow in different regions and during different seasons, there is a wide range of ideal temperature and light conditions. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect that high and low temperatures has on the Brassica oleracea plant species’ photosynthesis rate. It is important to demonstrate how temperature can increase or decrease the rate of photosynthesis in plants to determine the optimum environment for plants to grow at the highest yield. In addition, global climate change affects a number of variables that determine how much plants can grow and how much photosynthesis can occur. One aspect of global climate change is an increase in the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere (Norby, R. J., et al, 2004). The Brassica oleracea plant, which is more commonly known as Kale, can be grown during the fall and winter months because it is frost resistant and can survive in temperatures as cold as -15 °C (Vaughan, J.G., et al., 2009). We predict that in the high temperature condition, less photosynthesis will occur because high temperatures disrupt and denature the enzymes that catalyze the Calvin cycle reactions. In addition, we predict the cold temperature condition and the room temperature condition will have similar, high rates of photosynthesis because Kale is a cold-resistant plant. 


Materials and Methods:
To prepare the kale leaf chloroplast sample, 4 leaves were collected and washed before being grinded up with 20mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) with a mortar & pestle. The mixture was strained and centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube was isolated and suspended with 20mL grinding buffer. Once the sample was completed, 13 test tubes and 13 spectrophotometer cuvettes were labeled. The test tube, which would be act as the blank was filled with 8mL of distilled water, 2mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 100μl of the chloroplast sample. The remaining 12 test tubes were prepared with 6mL of distilled water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 100μl of the chloroplast sample. The spectrophotometer was used at 600nm to measure absorbance every 10 minutes for 30 minutes, starting at 0 minutes. After the first data collection at time 0, 3 test tubes were place in a hot bath at 30°C. 3 other test tubes were placed into an ice bath at -1°C. Finally, the remaining 3 test tubes were kept at room temperature (~23°C). All the test tubes were kept under lamps to provide consistent amounts of light. The absorbance’s of each tube was used to determine the percent change over the 30 minutes. After the experiment, the statistical significance of the data between the three conditions was determined using an ANOVA f-test. 

Results:
The results demonstrate that the greatest percent decrease in absorbance over the 30 minutes were the 3 test tubes kept at room temperature. The 3 chloroplasts samples kept in the cold conditions had a percent decrease in absorbance that was slightly lower than the room temperature conditions. The smallest change in absorbance was seen in the chloroplast samples that were kept in the hot condition (see Figure 1). The ANOVA f-test of significance did not demonstrate a significant difference between the three different condition means, F(2, 6) = 1.864, p = 0.235.


Discussion:
The results of the experiment demonstrate a general trend that room temperature conditions achieve the highest rate of photosynthesis. This is because the enzyme RuBisCO was at or near its optimum temperature. RuBisCO works in the Calvin Cycle to catalyze either the carboxylation or the oxygenation of ribose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) with CO2 or oxygen (Cen, Y-P, et al., 2005). The the heat bath reduced photosynthetic activity because it has been demonstrated that RuBisCO activity begins to decline at temperatures around 30°C, which is just above its thermal optimum. This decrease in activation can be attributed to activase complexes disassociating and forming inactive aggregates (Salvucci, M.E., et al., 2004). The cold temperature condition did not inhibit photosynthesis as much as the hot temperature condition. This is because the kale plant is a hardy, cool season plant that is tolerant to frost and can survive temperature as low as -15°C (Thomashow, M.F., 1999). Our results were not statistically significant. Potential causes could be that there should have been more than three samples per treatment group. In addition, the experiment could have been conducted over an hour instead of 30 minutes. In further studies, I would test how more extreme temperatures are affected by heat or I would conduct the same experiment on a plant that grows in higher temperature climates. It is important to understand how increasing or decreasing temperatures affect photosynthesis because global warming and increased CO₂ levels in our atmosphere are contributing to a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth’s atmosphere. Continued studies about the effect of temperature on plant function can help predict the ways in which global warming will influence photosynthesis and plant life, and potentially help identify ways to solve these potential problems.
