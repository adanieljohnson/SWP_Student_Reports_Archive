Title: Resource Allocation in Plants with Varied Substrates

Abstract:
	Resources, such as sunlight, nutrients, and water available in an environment affect how plants choose to allocate their energy. Understanding how different substrates effect plant growth is important to maintaining crop yields in agriculture. We tested importance of substrates by using three different types-- sand, 50:50 mix, sand and soil, and pure soil. We then measured the R:S length ratio after two weeks, predicting those in sandy substrates would have a larger R:S ratio than those in soil. The difference in ratios between sand and mixed substrate and sand and soil was found to be significant. Sandy substrates do not hold water as well as pure soil, causing those plants to use their energy to grow their roots longer, resulting in a larger R:S ratio than plants in pure or mixed soil.  How plants adapt to their environment and choose to allocate their resources is affected by the limited resources available to them.

Introduction:
       Limited natural resources in the environment effect how plants choose to allocate their resources. Resource allocation refers to the model plants choose to grow or reproduce to best distribute the resources available to them (Johnson: 2017). Understanding how plants grow in different substrates can be applied to crop growth in agriculture and discovering the best combination of substrate to produce the largest crop yield. Many plants can grow in a variety of soils; however some are more productive than others. 
       Sunlight, nutrients in soil, competition, and water are all examples of resources that can change how plants choose to allocate their resources based on their availability or prevalence. Substrates are also very important to how plants choose to distribute their resources and where they grow. In Oregon, a study states 98% of tree seedlings predominantly germinate on coarse woody debris, such as logs that cover less than 10% of the forest floor (Christy: 1984, Spies: 1988). One possible reason for this is moisture in the mineral ground soil can become scarce during growing season while decayed wood might hold the important resource of water better (Harmon: 1986) Another example of limited resources effecting plant growth is limited sunlight but plentiful nutrients in the soil; plants will allocate their resources to shoot growth to achieve more sunlight energy rather than root growth. However, if the plant grows its shoots but soil nutrients become scarce the plants cannot take the resources it just spent on shoots and redirect them to growing roots. It must accumulate the adequate amount of resources to now grow its roots to reach more nutrients.
       In our experiment we looked at how different substrates (sand, 50:50 mix of sand and soil, and soil) affect the root to shoot length ratio in oats. We predict oats that grow in sandy substrates will, on average, have a large R:S length ratio than those growing in soil conditions. Sandy soil, we think, will not hold water causing the plants to allocate resources to growth of their roots to reach more water. In contrast, the pure soil pots should hold water, causing a smaller R:S length ratio as the plants do not have to reach as far to find water. 


Materials and Methods:
       Planting our seeds, we started with three pots per substrate, totaling to nine pots of three different conditions. We then soaked enough seeds in water plant at least fifteen in each our pots. In three separate pots we filled each with sand and labeled each, doing the same with a 50:50 mix of sand and soil, and just soil. On top of each pot we added 50 mL of MiracleGro, adding a light layer of top soil to the sand pots to hold in the MiracleGro. From there we planted at least fifteen seeds in each pot, sorted the pots and labeled them before bringing them to the greenhouse. We allowed the plants to grow for two weeks, watering them once a day.
       To begin the measuring process, we first harvested three plants from our first condition. We tried to randomly select three plants, however, the plants selected ended up being the ones that were easiest to untangle. After washing off the dirt, we measured the roots from the bottom of the oat seed to the tip of the longest root and the shoots from the top of the oat seed to the top of the tallest shoot. In measurements we were accurate to the hundredths place in millimeters. We then recorded the R:S ratio for each of the replicates of each condition and repeated the process for every pot of each substrate type. The mean and standard deviation of the measurements of each condition were then found and recorded.

Data Analysis:
       We used a one-way ANOVA to analyze our results. Because we had to compare three means and include their standard deviations an analysis of variance was necessary. We calculated the mean of the root lengths and shoot lengths of each condition and, subsequently, the mean of their R:S length ratios. We also included the standard deviations of the root lengths, shoot lengths, and R:S length ratios. To test whether the difference in means was significant we used an ANOVA and a Tukey-Kramer test of the means of each condition to illustrate if significance was present. 


Results:
	The mean R:S length ratios were 0.66 ± 0.21, 0.77 ± 0.25, and 1.15 ± 0.43 for soil, mix, and sand respectively. Our analysis with an ANOVA (p= 0.008) and subsequently a Tukey-Kramer test indicate significance in the difference of sand and mixed soil as well as between sand and normal soil. However, the tests did not illustrate significance in the difference of soil and mixed soil.

Discussion:
	The results of our study support our original prediction of a larger R:S length ratio in oats planted in sandy substrates rather than simply soil substrates. We found oats grown in sand had significantly longer roots than those grown in mixed or pure soil. Further, as plants allocated more resources to growing roots in the sandy soil, their shoots were, on average, shorter than those in the other substrates, as supported by our calculated means of shoot length. The difference in root length can be attributed almost exclusively to the ability of each substrate to hold water. Sands inability to hold water in comparison to the mixed or pure soils’ capacities was a significant consideration in our original prediction. To adapt to their environment, plants in the sand substrate allocated their resources to the growth of roots to effectively absorb more water
	In arid, dry, or sandy soil, knowing plants must distribute more of their resources into growing roots instead of shoots, leaves, or fruits is valuable knowledge in the agricultural industry. Planting crops in too dry of fields, or a drought not replenishing normally moist soil is proven in our experiment to decrease the upward growth of plants. This important trade off in ratio can help farmers better care for their crops to continue steady yields of their fields.
       Our findings of a trade off in growth is consistent with a study done comparing size to reproductive capacity of agricultural plants in a crop. The trade off, or choosing growth of one area while sacrificing growth in another, illustrated by this study was between plant size versus reproduction. It found larger plants need a greater amount of nutrients to reproduce than smaller plants. However, if this resource is limited then the larger plant must choose how much it should reproduce over how it should grow itself. If the limited nutrient resource is used up during reproduction that plant is at risk of not having the means to sustain itself (Falster: 2008). Whether it is reproduction or growth of roots, resource allocation manifests itself in different ways in plants based on the environment around them.
       Our results supported our prediction, however, a more accurate reading is definitely possible. To see if the difference is actually significant, more than nine data points per condition would need to be used. Moreover, we measured the plants we could free from the soil with minimum tearing of roots, meaning plants with shorter roots were unconsciously biased towards. Only nine plants per condition is not enough data points to offset this discrepancy and make a solid prediction. Nevertheless, what conclusions we could draw were supported by our experiment and statistical tests. Plants in sandy soil will have a larger R:S length ratio than plants in pure soil.
