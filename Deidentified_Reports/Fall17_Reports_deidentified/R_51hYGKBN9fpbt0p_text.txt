Title: Effect of Aggression on Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp.

Abstract:
The objective of the following experiment was to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in specific metabolic rates in Procambarus sp. when alone versus introduction to another crayfish.  Dissolved oxygen levels in the Procambarus sp. environment were tracked over twenty minutes to calculate the specific metabolic rates, and each Procambarus sp. will be tested against itself: alone versus new crayfish introduced.  It is established that an increased levels of oxygen consumption was a direct sign of a higher metabolic rate. We hypothesize that there will be statistical significance in specific metabolic rate between crayfish introduction and not; such that Procambarus sp. introduction will lead to a higher specific metabolic rate than not.  However, we found there to be no noticeable trend in the expected manner.  Across all trials, specific metabolic rate was actually higher amongst the isolated Procambrus sp. than those introduced to another.  To determine significance, a two-tailed, paired t-test was implemented to evaluate the difference in specific metabolic rate.  Our two-tailed, paired t-test yielded a p-value of 0.174 such that the opposite result to our hypothesis was almost supported; not supporting our alternate hypothesis.


Introduction:
Heterotrophs, such as the Procambarus sp. must convert consumed, raw materials and high-energy molecules into low energy molecules in order to create ATP - a staple of biological processes.  Metabolism is that conversion, and a specific metabolic rate is a measurement of that conversion at a given mass of an organism.  Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to specific metabolic rate, so it can be tracked in order to determine the specific metabolic rate of an organism over a given time. Specific metabolic rate can be influenced by different environmental or internal factors such as external temperature, solute levels, or crayfish food supply.
 	 A 2000 case study led by K.A Sloman found there to be a statistically significant increase of the metabolic rate of brown trout, Salmo trutta, when introduced to social stress induced by the introduction of another Salmo trutta [Sloman et al: 2000].  On a similar note to Sloman’s experiment, we would like to compare specific metabolic rates of crayfish, Procambarus sp., when they are alone versus when introduced to the presence of another, larger crayfish.  Metabolic rate changes when introduced to another organism because the tested organism may be preparing to escape or fight the new organism.
Procambarus sp. were chosen because of their small size and their ability to be sustained in a lab.  Dissolved oxygen levels will be tracked in an environment of constant volume of water in order to determine the specific metabolic rates.  We hypothesize that the introduction of another Procambarus sp will create a statistically significant difference in specific metabolic rate to the isolated Procambarus sp.


Materials and Methods:
To begin, we determined the mass of the crayfish.  We then placed that crayfish into a closed environment filled with water.  Over a twenty minute interval, we tracked the oxygen levels.  After the twenty minute period, we found the volume of water in the environment, and used all of the collected data to determine specific metabolic rate by multiplying change in Oxygen levels and the volume of water and dividing by time and mass.  The same crayfish was then placed into the same environment with fresh water, and another, larger crayfish was introduced into the surrounding environment.  Oxygen levels were again tested over a twenty minute period, and the volume of water was determined to calculate the specific metabolic rate.  This procedure was repeated with two more Procambarus sp.  In terms of statistical testing, use a two-tailed paired t-test to determine the statistical significance of the introduction of another Procambarus sp. on metabolic rates.  The paired t-test will evaluate the difference in the two groups.

Results:
The observable trend of the data shows that there was actually  a higher specific metabolic rate in crayfish that were alone versus those introduced to another crayfish. When the crayfish were introduced, they seemed to not mind each other, and would hide from each other in the corners of their environment. For the isolated, control group, we got an average specific metabolic rate of 0.000657 with a standard deviation of 0.000259, and for the aggressed, experimental group, we got an average specific metabolic rate of 0.000233 with a standard deviation of 0.0000652.Our two-tailed, paired t-test yielded a p-value of 0.174.


Discussion:
Our p-value of 0.174 was not statistically significant enough to support our alternate hypothesis, and it supports the null hypothesis that the introduction of another crayfish will have no statistical difference in specific metabolic rate.  Although the results of the test were not statistically significant, the results showed the introduction of another crayfish actually reduced the specific metabolic rate, the opposite of what was hypothesized.  As observed, the crayfish actually minded their own business and stayed in their respective corners of their environment .  Because the crayfish tended to stay in their corners and ignore each other, the tested crayfish was not aggravated or inclined to flee which would have raised metabolic rate.  Error may have occurred only in the determination of the volume of water in the environment.  Our results directly contrast those of Sloman’s research.  Sloman observed in brown trout that social stress/aggression increased metabolic rate while we found that social stress/aggression actually decreased metabolic rate.   
For future study, multiple crayfish may be introduced to see if there needs to be more competitors to induce statistically significant stress.  Also, it is possible that the crayfish are actually calmed down by more crayfish, so different social behaviors could be studied in order to learn more about social situations with organisms.  As noted, our crayfish tended to mind their own business and stay in the corners of the environment, so possibly stimulating the crayfish to interact or be more aware of each other may give a more accurate reading on the effects of specific metabolic rates. Although we did not find statistical significance, some of our observable trends noted just prior may be evaluated and tested in order to further knowledge of effects of social situations on physiological processes in different organisms.

Figure 1.  .  Average specific metabolic rates in the control group and aggressed group.  Each group had three Procambarus sp. that were tested for oxygen consumption over twenty minute spans.  For the isolated, control group, we got an average specific metabolic rate of 0.000657 g H20*L H20/(g crayfish*min) with a standard deviation of 0.000259 g H20*L H20/(g crayfish*min), and for the aggressed, experimental group, we got an average specific metabolic rate of 0.000233 g H20*L H20/(g crayfish*min) with a standard deviation of 0.0000652 g H20*L H20/(g crayfish*min).  From running a two-tailed, paired t-test, we got a p-value of 0.174.
