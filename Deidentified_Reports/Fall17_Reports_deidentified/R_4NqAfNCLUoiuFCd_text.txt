Title: The Effect of Light on Root to Shoot Ratios of Pisum sativun and Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied the impact of light waves on plant growth and resource allocation in plants, particularly the species Pisum sativun (field peas) and Raphanus raphanistrum (radishes). Light is a key component in the photosynthesis process and growth of plants. Due to the pigment chlorophyll, plants are green in nature and therefore reflect green light waves and absorb primarily blue and red light waves. Regular, natural light was exposed to a set of each plant species and simulated green light was exposed to the other set of plants. We believed that exposing the radishes and field peas to green light would cause a greater decrease in the root to shoot ratio of the radishes than the field peas. The results were quantified in the form of ratios and the percentage difference of the ratios between the plants in differing light groups. The resulting calculations show that field peas experienced the greater decrease in ratio quantity, concluding that the field peas reacted more to the light waves in terms of resource allocation.

Introduction:
Just like other organisms in the world, plants adapt to and compete for resources. The shoots (stem and leaves) are responsible for sunlight and carbon dioxide intake while the roots are responsible for nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and sodium intake from soil. Depending upon environments and resource availability, plants may partake in resource allocation; an evolutionary trait in which organisms utilize more mass and energy to extract certain resources, while sacrificing others [Johnson: 2017]. An example of this natural phenomenon occurs when disease-infected plants reallocate proteins away from the site but carbohydrates towards it in order to fight off the pathogen [Schultz: 2013]. In the case of our experiment, When it comes to plants utilizing sunlight for photosynthesis in order to create energy, the majority absorb red and blue light waves, but reflect green light waves. In environments that possess a large, overwhelming canopy (such as a rainforest), the plants that inhabit the understory primarily receive green light waves since the canopy above absorbs the red and blue waves. In this experiment, we studied resource allocation and alterations in root to shoot ratios (R:S) of Pisum sativun (field peas) and Raphanus raphanistrum (radishes) in response to the natural tendency to adapt in order to better access a resource; light. We believed that exposing the radishes and field peas to green light would cause a greater decrease in the root to shoot ratio of the radishes than the field peas. This is due to that fact that radishes are naturally an understory plant and used to obstructed light while field peas are naturally unobstructed and receive direct light, therefore the radishes receive green light waves that are reflected off and pass through the canopy above.

Materials and Method:
In order to perform this study, we filled twelve growing trays with soil. We then planted fifty seeds of radishes in each of six trays and replicated this by planting fifty seeds of field peas in each of the other six trays. We then placed three trays of each species in a larger, controlll container and the remaining three of each species in a larger, experimental container. We then constructed a teepee-style fixture composed of four wooden rods and clear cellophane wrap (to simulate an unobstructed environment for light waves to freely access; controlll) that encompassed the outside of the structure and stabilized it with tape. We built another identical structure, but with green cellophane wrap (to simulate an obstructed, lower-level understory receiving primarily green light waves; experimental) instead of clear wrap. In both of these structures, we allowed two flaps of the cellophane “tent” to overlap in order to easily access the trays for watering purposes. Once, the posts of the fixtures were situated in the basin of the large containers and encompassed the plants, we transported the containers to the greenhouse and watered each of the individual trays until water (with 50Ml of Miracle-Gro 1x; saturated 38g/10L) began to seep out of the bottom. We repeated watering the plants with normal, tap water daily for fourteen days. On the fourteenth day, we collected all twelve trays and randoMly selected five germinated plants from each tray. Each plant selected was broken in two at the vermiculite and the root and shoot lengths were measured (in centimeters). Given the conditions of this experiment, we utilized a statistical two-tailed t_test along with the averages and percentage to depict the differences of our root to shoot ratios across our populations of plants.

Results:
The following table and graph depict the data collected from our experiment. We calculated the average of all of the root to shoot ratios and the percentage difference of ratios for each plant in each group (controlll and experimental). We also calculated the standard deviation of the averages of the root to shoot ratios. Lastly, we calculated a p_value of 0.29 using a two-tailed t_test.

Discussion:
Following the end of our experiment, we could conclude that our hypothesis was not supported by our data collected. The percentage difference in the field pea ratio from the controlll groups to the experimental group is greater than those ratios of the radishes. This shows that field peas experienced the greater decrease in ratio quantity, concluding that the field peas reacted more in terms of resource allocation. Our p_value of 0.29 also proves that our data is not statistically significent. Other studies have been conducted to further analyze resource allocation within plants. One study analyzed nitrogen and its effect on root to shoot ratios and nitrogen productivity as opposed to sunlight [Ågren: 2003]. In relation to our experiment utilizing light as a variable, a similar study with tobacco seedlings found that an increase in light intensity led to increases in the root to shoot ratios and were experienced strongly and rapidly [Walter: 2006]. Other studies involving water, carbon dioxide, phosphorous, potassium, and sodium levels (all controllllable quantities) could be carried out to analyze the effects of those elements on resource allocation.
