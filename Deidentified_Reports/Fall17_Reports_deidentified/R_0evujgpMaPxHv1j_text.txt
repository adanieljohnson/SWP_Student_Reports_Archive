Title: Green Light May be Just as Effective as Red and Blue Light at Increasing the Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinach (Spinacia oleraca).

Abstract:
	Plants have a unique system for creating glucose as a source of energy for cellular function called photosynthesis, which occurs in the chloroplast of the cell.  Many factors affect photosynthesis, the objective of this report was to determine how different light wavelengths play a role.  Chloroplasts were obtained from spinach leaves (Spinacia oleraca) and were used to measure the change in absorbance of 3 samples in a controlll group (white light), and experimental groups (red, green, blue, and uv light).  Based on other studies, such as Muneer et al’s claim that biomass production decreases under green light, we hypothesized that green light would show a decrease in photosynthetic rate, while red and blue might show an increase; we did not know what would happen in uv light.  However, contrary to our hypothesis and our previous research, our data demonstrated that green light along with red and blue light was more effective than white light, and uv light was less effective.  While this was unusual, there are certain factors that could explain it, such as exposure to other wavelengths of light and unequal light intensity.

Introduction:
	Energy powers every cell in an organism and drive the organism’s daily functions. Heterotrophs, such as animals, receive energy in the form of glucose when they consume other organisms.  Autotrophs like plants, on the other hand, create their own glucose using carbon dioxide, water, and light from the sun in a process known as photosynthesis.  In plants, photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast of the cell, an organelle that animal cells lack.  It uses a series of chemical reactions called the light independent reaction and the light dependent reaction to harness the suns energy and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.  The glucose is then used in cellular respiration to create energy to power the cell and for plant growth [Johnson: 2017].
	Many factors affect the rate of photosynthesis in plants, including but not limited to temperature, soil pH and salinity, amount of light, and carbon dioxide availability.  The purpose of this lab was to examine the effect of different light wavelengths on photosynthesis in spinach leaves (Spinacia oleraca) over a period of 30 minutes.  Spinach was an ideal organism to use because it has a high concentration of chloroplasts in its leaves, which is favorable for photosynthesis.  In addition, spinach is useful to use from an agricultural standpoint because it is easy to grow and very plentiful.  It is also not too expensive to buy for the research because only 4-5 leaves are needed for this experiment.  Previous research by Muneer et al in 2014 found that rate of photosynthesis and biomass production in lettuce leaves was increased under blue lights, but decreased under green lights [Muneer: 2014].  A different study by Folta et al claimed that when it comes to plant processes, green light generally has the opposite effect of red and blue light, so while red and blue light may increase the rate of photosynthesis, green light decreases it [Folta: 2007].  By determining which wavelength best promotes photosynthesis, we also determine which wavelength best promotes plant growth.  This information would be ground-breaking in the world of agriculture; farmers could use certain types of light on the plants in their greenhouses to encourage faster plant growth and flowering, thereby producing larger crop yields faster.  We could even use this information at home to promote healthy and rapid plant growth in our vegetable gardens by placing them under certain favorable wavelengths of light.
	In this experiment, we measured the rate of photosynthesis indirectly using the Hill Reaction and DCPIP.  The Hill Reaction demonstrates the transfer of electrons from water to an electron acceptor, such as NADP+.  The faster electrons are transferred, the faster the assumed rate of photosynthesis.  DCPIP is a type of electron acceptor that is very easy to observe and measure.  Its oxidized form (before it accepts electrons) is dark blue, while its reduced form (after it accepts electrons) is colorless, so observation of its color change alone can help one determine how quickly electrons are being transferred during the assay.  Its oxidized form also has a maximum light absorbance at 600nm.  Therefore, a sample with less color and lower absorbance will have less of the oxidized DCPIP and more of the reduced DCPIP, meaning that more electrons were transferred, and photosynthesis occurred faster.  
	The absorbance of 130mM DCPIP in photosynthesis reactions was measured after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes.  Three samples of chloroplasts were placed under white light (the controlll), red, green, blue and uv light (the experimentals), and the rate of photosynthesis was approximated based on percent change of absorption.  Due to previous research we read, our null hypothesis was that the difference in color of light would not cause a change in rate of photosynthesis or absorbance levels.  Our alternate hypothesis was that green light would be less effective (and have a slower rate of photosynthesis) than the white light, and red and blue light would be as effective or more effective (same or greater rate of photosynthesis) than the white light; we did not know what would happen under uv light.

Materials and Method:
	To begin, four spinach leaves without their central veins were ground in 20Ml of cold grinding solution (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8.0) with a mortar and pestle.  After the spinach was completely ground up and filtered into a 150Ml beaker, we centrifuged it in a 50Ml centrifuge tube at 200 G for 3 minutes at 4°C.  When spinning was finished, we transferred the supernatant into a different 50Ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged it again, this time at 1000 G for 10 minutes at 4°C.  When centrifuging was complete, we removed the supernatant from the tube and disposed of it.  We then added 20Ml of the cold grinding buffer to the remaining pellet from the second spin, and stirred it with a micropipette to attain our sample of chloroplasts for the experiment.
	Once we had our chloroplasts, we created a set of reaction mixtures in test tubes for each of the samples.  We had one blank, three controlll (white light) samples, and three samples per experimental (red, green, blue, and uv light).  We added 8Ml of water, 2Ml of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate at pH 6.5) to the blank test tube.  The rest of the test tube samples for the controlll and experimentals had 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP, and 2Ml of reaction buffer.  To start our assay, we added 100uL of the chloroplasts we harvested earlier to each test tube and mixed each one immediately.  Using a spectrophotometer set to 600nm, we measured the absorbance of every sample before any time had passed, then after 3 ten-minute periods to reach a total of 30 minutes.  During each 10-minute interval we placed the samples of the controlll and experimentals under their respective light colors.  
	After completing the assay, we calculated average absorbances, percent change in absorbance for each sample over time, average percent changes, and ran two-tailed t_tests assuming unequal variance between the controlll and each experimental to calculate the p value and t stat of our data.  We used two-tailed t_tests because we did not know which direction the data would go in, and we assumed unequal variance because we assumed that the p value of our results would be less than 0.05, so our variances would be significently different.  Additionally, we created a line graph to show change in absorbance over time and a bar graph to compare the percent change in absorption of each group after the full 30 minutes.

Results:
	Over time, the average percent change in absorbance for the controlll and all four experimentals increased.  Blue had the highest rate of change after 30 minutes (86.57%), followed by green (85.97%), red (84.57%), white (74.04%), then uv (68.73%).  Similarly, the longer the samples were under the lights, the clearer and less blue they became, indicating that photosynthesis was occurring.  This trend applied to all the samples of all the groups except for two.  Two of our samples were outliers and did not match the rest of the data in their groups.  One of the red samples and one of the green samples demonstrated very little change in photosynthesis over time, and did not show a change in color over the 30-minute period.  These two outliers were removed from the data to make more accurate calculations.
	When red light was compared to white light, the p value was 0.34 and the t Stat was -1.13.  Green light vs. white light showed a p value of 0.16 and a t Stat of -1.19.  Meanwhile, blue light compared to white light had a p value of 0.22 and a t Stat of -1.44, and uv light vs. white light yielded a p value of 0.55 and a t Stat of 0.67.  These p values indicate that the results of our experiment were statistically insignificent.  Percent change in DCPIP absorbance over time for all samples is shown in Figure 1, and average rate of photosynthesis after 30 minutes for all samples is shown in Figure 2 at the end of the report.

Discussion:
	Our results were very different from what we expected them to be.  While we thought that green light would prove to be somewhat ineffective, our results demonstrated that red (p value of 0.34), blue (p value of 0.22), and green (p value of 0.16) light were more effective and had a higher rate of photosynthesis than white light, our controlll, while uv light (p value of 0.55) had a lower rate of photosynthesis than the controlll.  The main reason why we expected these results is due to the biology of the leaf, as well as previous studies of the effect of light wavelength on photosynthesis.  All plant cells have organelles called chloroplasts, where photosynthesis takes place.  These chloroplasts are home to the pigment chlorophyll, a green pigment, which absorbs most visible light wavelengths, but reflects green light [Terashima: 2009].  It was our belief that because plant leaves reflect green light rather than absorb it, subjecting spinach leaves to only green light would cause photosynthesis to slow down or stop.  This is because photosynthesis in plants requires light absorption to excite electrons and begin the process of the electron transport chain [Johnson: 2017].  If the spinach leaves reflected the green light, then it would not be absorbing an energy to excite electrons and begin the photosynthetic process.
	This idea was supported by many other studies in the biological field.  A study by Terashima et al explained that plants absorb about 90% of red and blue light, while they only absorb about 70% of green light [Terashima: 2009].  We believed it possible that the less light that is absorbed, the slower the rate of photosynthesis will be.  In another study, Muneer et al claimed that biomass production in lettuce leaves decreased under green light, which indicated that putting lettuce under green light slowed down photosynthesis rate, and therefore slowed down plant growth and biomass production [Muneer: 2014].  Similarly, Folta et al explained that green light generally has the opposite effect on plant leaves as red and blue light does, meaning that while red and blue light could be beneficial for photosynthesis, green light is not [Folta: 2007].  This idea is further supported by research from Kim et al in 2004 that suggests that light which includes red, green, and blue wavelengths is effective for inducing photosynthesis, but as the proportion of green light compared to red and blue light increases, the rate of photosynthesis slows down [Kim: 2004].
	One reason why our results did not support our hypothesis and did not match with some of the primary literature could be due to the intensity of the lights used, such as if the green light bulb was more intense than any of the other light bulbs.  Johkan et al showed that red and blue light were more effective at increasing the rate of photosynthesis than green light, however they also showed that coupling green light with intense white light actually proved to be more effective for increasing the rate of photosynthesis than using only red light [Johkan et al: 2012].  Maybe our samples under green light had a high rate of photosynthesis because our green light bulb was so much more intense than the rest of the lightbulbs.  Furthermore, the high rate of photosynthesis in the green light could also be from the samples exposure to white light while we were measuring their absorbances between ten-minute intervals.  It is possible that the green light samples were exposed to lights from the classroom or from the lamp of white light that was next to the lamp of green light, and this white light paired with the green light promoted photosynthesis in the green light sample.
	Although our data did not support our hypothesis and our p values made our results statistically insignificent, we can still use this experiment to design better, more conclusive experiments in the future.  By having more examples in each group, isolating the samples so that they are only exposed to their specific wavelength of light, and ensuring that the intensities of the lights used for each group are the same, we can perfect this experiment, so that we can obtain conclusive results.  Experiments such as these are becoming increasingly more important today. As population sizes increase across the world, poverty and hunger are becoming more and more of a problem.  Food is scarce and many areas, and farmers are not able to grow crops fast enough to provide food for everyone who needs it.  If we can use this research to find a faster, more efficient way to grow crops and have bigger crop yields each year, we could help provide fruits and vegetables to the hundreds of thousands of people in the world who are going hungry because they do not have access to food.  This would be a groundbreaking feat in the world of agriculture because not only would we be helping to feed people who do not have food at all, but we would be providing more healthy food for everyone.
