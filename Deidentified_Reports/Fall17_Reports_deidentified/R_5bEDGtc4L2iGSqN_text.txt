Title: The Effect of Physical Exercise on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus Sp.

Abstract:
In this experiment, we used Procambarus sp. to observe the effect of exercise on specific metabolic rate. We hypothesized that there would be a significant increase in specific metabolic rate after the Procambarus sp. was exercised for five minutes. We used an oxygen probe attached to a digital reader to record the oxygen consumed by the organism, which we know is directly proportional to the metabolic rate. After testing three Procambarus sp. we found that we even though there was a general increasing trend in average specific metabolic rate after exercise, we could not support our hypothesis due to the extremely high p-value of 0.521404 deeming our results not statistically significant. However, we believe that if the Procambarus sp. was exercised for a longer period of time or was given time to get acclimated to the area before we began recording oxygen consumption, the difference between control and treatment would be much greater.

Introduction:
Metabolic rate is the amount of energy being released by all of the physiological processes of an organism at any point in time. Therefore, scientists can use ATP synthesis as a means of determining metabolic rate. However, this can become very difficult because so many steps occur in the reactions that produce ATP. A much easier way to measure metabolic rate is to measure the oxygen consumption of an organism. In the complicated metabolic process, oxygen is consumed by the organism. Then, glucose breaks down into oxygen and carbon molecules that bind to form carbon dioxide as well as energy. By this complicated process we can say that oxygen consumption is directly proportional to ATP synthesis, and therefore a much easier way to measure metabolic rate. We also know that metabolic rate is very subject to fluctuation. Anything from temperature to exercise can have some effect on the organism’s metabolic rate. This makes us question exactly what effect exercise would have on the specific metabolic rate of an organism. By answering this question, scientists can have a better understanding of exactly how exercise influences metabolic rate and how they can apply that information to anything from small, wild animals to athletes training for an important event. For this lab, we will utilize Procambarus sp. to measure the amount of oxygen consumed and therefore the metabolic rate of this organism. Procambarus sp. is a good model system for this experiment because they can be handled with ease in the lab and they can easily fit in small containers like jars for easy measuring of oxygen consumption. They are also beneficial in the lab because they require minimal care to keep for prolonged periods of time. An experiment conducted in 1994 by Adamczewska and Morris using Gecarcoidea natalis (Christmas Island red crab) found that oxygen consumption was maximized after five minutes of exercise. [Adamczewska:1994] This in turn would mean that the specific metabolic rate was also maximized after five minutes of exercise because oxygen consumption and metabolic rate are directly proportional. Though our experiment and the experiment conducted by Adamczewska and Morris used different species, we expect similar results because both animals are crustaceans and should embody similar metabolic processes. Based on this and our knowledge of the metabolic system, we hypothesize that there will be a significant increase in metabolic rate after the Procambarus sp. is exercised for five minutes, compared to the metabolic rate before physical exercise.

Materials and Methods:
To begin our experiment, we selected three Procambarus sp. of similar size. We took the first Procambarus sp. and used a small plastic container to weigh the organism and record the weight. Then, we filled a large, clear jar to the brim with room temperature water and placed the Procambarus sp. inside the jar. We immediately inserted an oxygen probe with a lid and closed the jar. The oxygen probe was connected to a reader that allowed us to determine the oxygen content in the water at any given time. Once the Procambarus sp. was in the jar and we recorded the initial level of oxygen in the water, we started a timer for twenty minutes. At five, ten, fifteen, and twenty minutes, we recorded the amount of oxygen remaining in the water. The change in oxygen levels was recorded as the oxygen consumed by the Procambarus sp. After the twenty minutes had elapsed, we removed the Procambarus sp. from the jar and poured the water into a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of water that was in the jar with the organism. With these data, we were able to use the equation Specific Metabolic Rate= [ΔO₂ (mg/L) × volume H₂O (L) ] ÷ [time (min) × weight (g)] to determine the metabolic rate of the organism. These data and calculations served as our control data for this particular organism. In order to obtain treatment data, we placed the Procambarus sp. in a large, open container filled with room temperature water and used a Sharpie to gently tap the organism’s tail to keep it moving for five minutes. Once the five minutes had elapsed, the Procambarus sp. was placed in the same jar that had been emptied and refilled with room temperature water. The probe and lid were again placed and closed and the initial oxygen level was recorded. We set the timer for twenty minutes and recorded the oxygen level at five, ten, fifteen, and twenty minutes again. At the end of the time, the change in oxygen was recorded and used in the same equation as before to determine the specific metabolic rate of our first treatment group organism. We repeated all of these steps two more times with the Procambarus sp. of similar size that we collected. In order to test the statistical significance of the difference in specific metabolic rate of the control and treatment groups, we used a one-tailed paired t-test.

Results:
For our three control organisms, the average specific metabolic rate was 0.000649133 mg O2 / g*min ± 0.000113042. For our three treatment organisms, the average specific metabolic rate was 0.000684 mg O2 / g*min ± 0.000147034. Overall, we see an increase in the average specific metabolic rate from the control group to the treatment group that was exercised for five minutes.  However, in our third Procambarus sp. we saw a decrease in specific metabolic rate from the control data to the treatment data, after the organism was exercised for five minutes. This trial differs from the general trend in the data. When we ran a one-tailed paired t-test, we got a p-value of 0.521404. 

Discussion:
Based on our results and the statistical tests run, we cannot support our initial hypothesis that physical exercise would result in a significant increase in metabolic rate. With a very large p-value of 0.521404, we cannot say for certain that the general increase in average metabolic rate that we saw in our graph was significant and not due to random variation in the metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. Logically, our knowledge of the directly proportional relationship between oxygen consumption and metabolic rate would lead us to believe that there would be an increase in metabolic rate, which was seen. However, our hypothesis that exercise would cause this significant change cannot be supported because of the high p-value. This could be explained by the stress placed on the organism during the experiment. When the Procambarus sp. was placed in the jar to record the control data, it was likely very stressed as it was being handled by humans and was put in a new environment. This panic would result in much more respiration that likely made the control data a lot higher than it would have been if this stress had not been a factor. Once we exercised the organism the respiration rate (oxygen consumption) didn’t change a significant amount because it was already stressed out and breathing hard to begin with. We observed this in our experiment. The third Procambarus sp.  that experienced a decrease in specific metabolic rate, was frantically moving about in the jar at first, but eventually calmed down. After exercise, the organism knew the jar wasn’t a harmful trap and was therefore calmer. In the experiment conducted by Adamczewska and Morris, there was a clear difference that could have resulted in our different results. Though they found that maximum oxygen consumption was reached in five minutes of exercise, they exercised their model organism, Gecarcoidea natalis, for forty-five minutes. With the prolonged exercise, the metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. would likely have stabilized at a much higher rate rather than being elevated for a minute or so then decreasing again. [Adamczewska:1994] In a future experiment, researchers might benefit from exercising the Procambarus sp. for longer than five minutes. Also in a future study, the researcher may find it beneficial to give a period of rest once the organism is placed in the jar at first to allow it to become acclimated with the area and calm down a little. These two factors would likely result in a significant change in specific metabolic rate. If a significant increase were observed in a future study, it would help scientists apply that knowledge to anything from athletes to wild animals and their activity levels.
