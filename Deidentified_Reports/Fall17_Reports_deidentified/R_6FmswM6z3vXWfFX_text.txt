Title: Effects of cold temperatures on crawfish metabolic rate

Abstract:
Crayfish, or Procambarus spp., were used to determine the effects of lower temperatures on the specific metabolic rate of aquatic life. It was hypothesized that specific metabolic rates would be significantly lower in 12 ˚C water than 22 ˚C water. The dissolved oxygen content of water was used to calculate specific metabolic rate, and was calculated for 22 ˚C water and 12 ˚C water. Though there was a slight increase in specific metabolic rate when exposed to cold water, there was no significant difference in metabolic rate of crayfish in 22 ˚C and 12 ˚C water (p value 0.864781). This brings into question the effects of stress on metabolic rate, as the crayfish may not have been given adequate time to acclimate to the 12 ˚C water. The effects of thermal pollution may also be of interest, as the gradual increase in temperature would likely yield more dramatic results than those of this experiment, and previous studies have shown that cold water acclimated crayfish die when exposed to high temperatures.

Introduction:
In this experiment crayfish, or Procambarus spp., were used to determine the effects of low temperatures on the metabolic rate of aquatic life. Crayfish prefer a temperature range of 18-25 C, but are able to survive in more extreme temperatures. They are known to be very sensitive to their environment: one study demonstrated that Procambarus spp. reacts to hypoxia with a decrease in heart rate [Reiber: 1992] This, along with their size and ability to survive out of the water for short periods for experimental procedures, makes them excellent subjects for experimentation. The metabolic rate of crayfish was determined by their oxygen consumption, as glycolysis, the process by which ATP is produced by breaking down glucose into pyruvate, binds consumes oxygen and produces water as a waste product. Thus, the metabolic rate of crayfish is in part determined by the dissolved oxygen available in its environment. Because water contains less dissolved oxygen as temperature increases it was hypothesized that decreased temperatures would result in decreased specific metabolic rates in crayfish.


Materials and Methods:
Three large, lab-raised crayfish of similar sizes were acquired and weighed. They were each placed individually in glass testing chambers overflowing with room temperature distilled water (22 ˚C), and sealed with a dissolved oxygen probe protruding from an airtight opening on the lid of the chamber. The chamber was then placed in a plastic water dishpan also filled with room temperature water, and the dissolved oxygen content of the water in the testing chamber was measured at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after submersion. The chamber was then unsealed, the crayfish returned to its holding tank with a net, and the volume of the water in the testing chamber recorded by pouring it through a funnel into a 1 L graduated cylinder. The experiment was repeated for all subjects, but 12 ˚C water was used in the testing chamber, and the chamber was placed into ice-cooled water (12 ˚C). At 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after submersion the dissolved oxygen content of the testing chamber was measured, and the volume of the water in the testing chamber was determined with a funnel and graduated cylinder. The crayfish were returned to their tanks. The specific metabolic rates of each crayfish was calculated for both room temperature water and 12 ˚C water, and a paired t-test was used to evaluate the data.

Results:
The crayfish appeared to have slightly lower specific metabolic rates in 12 ˚C water when compared to 22 ˚C water. Figure 1 displays this trend. The results of the paired t-test reported a p value of 0.864781, a t value of 0.193001, and 2 degrees of freedom. 


Discussion:
There was no significant difference between the 12 ˚C and 22˚C specific metabolic rates., and the null hypothesis is supported. This may be due to increased stress while acclimating to significantly colder water, maintaining a higher metabolic rate than the crayfish would display after acclimating further. Crayfish are known to acclimate to water temperature and available oxygen. Perhaps gradually decreasing the temperature of the testing chamber until 12 ˚C is a less stressful approach. It is likely that the temperature the crayfish was acclimated to previously in their tanks influenced the degree to which the crayfishes’ specific metabolic rates reacted to temperature change, as previous studies have shown [Powell: 2006]. These studies also show that crayfish acclimated to lower temperatures as opposed to warmer temperatures can die when exposed to warmer temperatures. This raises concerns about the effects of thermal pollution in colder regions on crayfish and other aquatic life, and it is likely that comparing the specific metabolic rates of crayfish in such situations before and after the change in temperature would yield more dramatic results than those in this experiment, as the temperature would be more gradual and have a much greater sample group.
