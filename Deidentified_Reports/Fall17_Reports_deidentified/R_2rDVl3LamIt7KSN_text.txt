Title: The Decrease in Root-to-Shoot Ratio due to the Effect of Wave Length on the Resource Allocation of Pisum sativun and Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
In this particular lab the species of Pisum sativun and Raphanus raphanistrum were used to study how limited light access to only green wave lengths would affect their resource allocation distribution and therefore their root:shoot ratio. It was hypothesized that exposing field peas and radishes to only green wave lengths of light would cause a greater decrease in the root:shoot ratio of the radishes than that of the field peas due to the environment and amount of light they are accustomed to. Each species had 150 seeds planted in both normal light exposed to all wavelengths and then another 150 seeds planted where they were only exposed to green wavelengths of light. After fourteen days, the controlll and experimental plants for each species were measured and the root:shoot ratio was calculated. It was found that the radishes ratio decreased 8.57% due to exposure to the green light whereas the field pea’s ratio decreased 26.40%. 


Introduction:
The environment in which a plant inhabits largely affects its phenotype through abiotic and biotic factors.  To best suit itself for its ecological community, a plant must allocate its energy due to limited resources in the environment. Allocation is the way which a species determines how to spend its resources to increase their fitness in their environment. The pattern of allocation allows for plants to respond to their environments and modify their previously set pattern of distribution to better aid itself in survival. The root-to-shoot ratio examines where a plant distributes its biomass and energy thus indicating which resources are limited. Whichever resource is the most limited will cause the plant to expend more energy to obtain that resource therefore either favoring the roots or the shoots in the cases of plants [Johnson: 15-19]. One particular resource that can be limited to a plant is light. Due to the environment a plant may either have great exposure to sunlight or barely any as seen in the case of plants in the understory of a rainforest. Plants absorb red and blue wavelengths since those are the wavelengths that allow for optimal photosynthesis. Meanwhile, plants reflect green wavelengths of light which give them the appearance of being green. Therefore, plants that are exposed to true, unblocked sunlight are able to absorb the red and blue wavelengths. Plants that grow in the understory of other plants are therefore exposed to reflected green light which is not ideal since the resource of red and blue wavelengths are limited. When light is restricted as a resource, plants allocate their energy and therefore their biomass to their shoots attempting to becoming taller and reaching towards the sunlight. In this particular lab, resource allocation in the root-to-shoot ratio was studied through the species Pisum sativun and Raphanus raphanistrum. The field peas, Pisum sativun, are accustomed to growing in environments where light is a limited resource; therefore, they are more equipped to living exposed to mostly to green wavelengths. However, the radishes, Raphanus raphanistrum, normally live in environments fully exposed to the sun light thereby exposed to abundant amounts of the red and blue light. It was hypothesized that exposing field peas and radishes to only green wave lengths of light would cause a greater decrease in the root:shoot ratio of the radishes than that of the field peas due to the environment and amount of light they are accustomed to.

Materials and Method:
First, twelve trays were filled with vermiculite to the rim. Then in the first six trays fifty seeds of radishes were planted in each. This was repeated in the last six trays with the field pea’s seeds. Each try was then watered till saturated then followed by 50 Ml of Miracle Gro 1x. First the controlll group of three trays of radishes and three tray of field peas were placed in a larger tray under a tent of clear cellophane wrap. The remaining three trays of each species were placed in the experimental tray under a tent of green cellophane wrap. The green cellophane tent was to mimic the green wave lengths of light that plants would be exposed to if they were living in the understory of a rainforest. Clear cellophane was used to allow the plants to be exposed to all wavelengths of light while keeping the presence of cellophane consistent. Each of trays with their respective plants and tents were placed in the Biology Department green house where they grew and were watered for a consecutive fourteen days. The volume of water used each day was not recorded nor specified. The plants were watered until the soil was saturated enough that it was dripping through the holes in the bottom of the tray. On the fourteenth day the plants were removed from the green house. Each individual tray’s contents were loosened in a tub of water to free the roots and vermiculite from each other. Ten individual plants from each were then separated, dried, massed, and measured. Their shoots’ length and their roots’ length were measured in centimeters, recorded, and used to calculate the root:shoot ratio as seen in Table 1. Lastly, a two tailed t_test was used to compare the difference between the controlll and experimental ratios of the radishes and field peas. 

Results:
Our collected data, as seen in Table 1, showed on average an overall decrease in the root to shoot ratio for both the radishes and the field peas when exposed to green light waves. Overall, the radishes experienced an 8.57% decrease in their root to shoot ratio under green wavelengths. The average root:shoot ratio for the radishes in natural light was 1.53 +/- 0.14  and 1.40 +/- 0.10  in the green wavelength of light.  Meanwhile, the field peas experienced a much more drastic decrease in their ratio under the same conditions. Their ratio decreased 20.83%.  The field peas had a ratio on average of 0.72 +/- 0.05  for those growing in natural light and 0.57 +/- 0.08 for those in the green wavelength of light. The averages along with their respective standard deviations are also presented in Graph 1. However, our collected data is not considered statistically significent because the calculated p_value from the two tailed t_test is 0.29. This allows us to conclude that our results were in fact due to chance and not the experiment itself. 

Discussion:
Our data unfortunately did not support our hypothesis that the radishes would experience a greater decrease in their root:shoot ratio due to growing in an environment with green light waves. Despite this, our data did support the predication that both species would experience a decrease in their ratio due to the fact they would allocate their resources to their shoots to better attain light in the experimental setting. These findings are supported Cronin and Lodge’s findings on the influence of the light and nutrient availability on the root:shoot ratio of Nuphar advena and Potamogeton amplifolius. They too found that when the limited resource was light this resulted in a lower root:shoot ratio since the plants were allocating more resources to the growth of the shoots [Cronin: 2003]. Our study was originally done to mimic the different light environments that plants of the understory in a rain forest experience—the lack of red and blue wavelengths which are absorbed by the trees of the canopy. Therefore, the two species of field crops that were picked mimicked the conditions of a plant in the canopy and a plant in the understory. The radishes were picked since they are accustomed to living with no limitation to light similarly to the plants in the canopy; however, the field peas experience limited light in their natural environment and therefore are comparable to the plants of the understory. It was hypothesized that since the field peas are accustomed to living in an environment with light being a limited resource they would not as drastically modify their root:shoot ratio. On the other hand, it was hypothesized the radishes would drastically change their root:shoot ratio since they are used to having high exposure to sunlight; therefore, the change to just the green wavelengths of light, indicating limited light, would be very traumatic. This hypothesis of ours is supported by Durigan, Melo, and Brewer’s study on the root:shoot ratio of trees in the open and closed canopy cerrado in south-eastern Brazil. Their findings state that the root:shoot ratio was higher for the plants that lived in the open thus in the full sun light where they were exposed to the red and blue light waves. The trees in the canopy had a lower root:shoot ratio in the closed cerrado as a response to lower light availability. The lower ratio indicates taller shoots trying to obtain more of the limited resource: red and blue wavelengths of light [Durigan: 2012].  Since our data did not align with our hypothesis of the findings of Durigan’s team’s research, our study could be expanded by studying plants native to the rainforest, specifically an understory and canopy plant rather than field crops. In conclusion, it was found that limiting the light resource so that plants are only exposed to the green wave length will in fact cause them to allocate their resources to their shoots which causes a decrease in the root:shoot ratio.
