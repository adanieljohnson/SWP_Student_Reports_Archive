Title: Comparing the Effects of Lidocaine on Nerve Stimulated Muscle Contraction in the Gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to study the effects of lidocaine on the amplitude of muscle contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens, or the North leopard frog. Lidocaine’s role as a local anesthetic that suppresses the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and blocks sodium channels in the axon. Due to this, it is hypothesized that once the gastrocnemius is exposed to lidocaine there will be decreased muscle contraction, making the average amplitude of muscle contraction much lower than that of the non-treated control group. The legs of the Rana pipiens were stimulated using a program called LabScribe and a force transducer. Three legs were tested, each stimulated via the nerve under normal conditions, and then once again after being injected with 2 mL of solution with 25mM concentration of lidocaine. The results of this experiment supported the hypothesis, as the control group experience a much larger average amplitude of muscle contraction than the experimental group. These results were especially evident after running a t-test, which produced a p-value of 0.0112. This is significant as it proves the effect of lidocaine as a sodium channel blocker that inhibits muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
The Rana pipiens, commonly known as the North leopard frog, is found all over the North American continent. Due to its abundance and the relative ease in which its muscle and nerve tissue can be exposed, it was chosen for this experiment. Lidocaine was chosen as a desirable substance to study due to its extensive use in medical procedures in humans and other animals. In this experiment, the variable being tested is the amplitude of muscle contraction when the muscle is stimulated via the nerve at different voltages. This variable is discrete and dependent, as is the voltage which stimulates the muscle, as we can measure both and are changing both. The independent variable in this experiment is lidocaine, as we have no control over how it takes effect in the muscle. Two groups are being tested in this experiment: a standard control group and a group that has been injected with with 2 mL of solution with 25mM concentration of lidocaine. Lidocaine is what is referred to as a local anesthetic, meaning that its numbing effects only cover the area where it has been directly injected. When lidocaine is present in the muscle, depolarized sodium, or Na¬+¬, channels enter a dormant state. This in turn keeps Na+ from being able to enter the axon and doesn’t allow the action potential travel down axon, stopping the muscle contraction from every occurring. (Chen, Z: 2000) Additionally, the experiments of Kai. et al. (1993) found that lidocaine impedes the “Ach-induced increase of Ca2+” in the contracting muscle, inhibiting further muscle contraction. This is due to the fact that calcium, after being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, binds to troponin, leading to the exposure of myosin binding sites on the actin filaments. Applying these ideas to the experiment at hand, once lidocaine is injected into the muscle, no further contractions should be observed. A large enough electrical stimulus, or one of a high enough voltage, may be able to override the effects of lidocaine; however, this should not occur. The effects of lidocaine will not be overridden due to the fact that the highest voltage used to stimulate the gastrocnemius is 4.3 volts, which is not a high enough voltage. Due to the anesthetic effects of lidocaine, it is hypothesized that the amplitude of muscle contraction of the experiment group will be significantly lower than that of the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, three legs of the Rana pipiens were used. To expose the gastrocnemius and the nerve, forceps were used. In order to deliver the electrical impulse needed to stimulate the nerve and measure the amplitude of muscle contraction, a program called LabScribe and accompanying lab equipment were used. Lastly, Ringer’s solution was used often to keep the muscle moist and supplied with ATP, and 2 a mL solution with 25 mM of lidocaine was injected into each leg after it underwent the initial control tests. 
Once all the materials are collected, the leg of the Rana pipiens needs to be prepared for testing. First, use the forceps to pull back the leg skin and expose the muscle tissue, then separate the inner thigh muscles and expose the nervous tissue. Next, expose the nerve from between the muscle tissue, and wrap it around the electrical stimulator in order to induce muscle contraction. Once the leg of the Rana pipiens is set up, use the LabScribe program in order to stimulate the muscle and record the amplitude of muscle contraction. After determining the threshold stimulus of muscle contraction to be 0.3 volts, stimulate the muscle at increasing 1.0 volt intervals, up until 4.3 volts, measuring the amplitude of muscle contraction each time. Next, inject the muscle directly with 2 mL of lidocaine. After waiting two to three minutes to ensure the effects of lidocaine fully take hold, stimulate the muscle again at 0.3 volts up to 4.3 volts, recording the amplitude of muscle contraction each time. Repeat these steps regarding the control and experiment procedures for the remaining two legs. Once all the results have been recorded, run a paired T-test in order to view the statistical difference of muscle contraction between the normal muscle and the muscle injected with lidocaine.


Results:
The control group on average experience a much large amplitude of muscle contraction than the experimental group, whose average value of amplitude of muscle contraction was very close to zero. These differences are visible in Table 1, which shows that the average amplitude of muscle contraction for the control group was 0.4934 versus 0.0125, a difference of about 40%. Due to the vast differences, a T-test was conducted in order to determine the true statistical differences. The T-test produced a P-value of 0.0112, visible in Table 2, showing that there was in fact a large statistical difference between the control and experimental group. These values can also be seen in Graph 1, which visually demonstrates the large statistical difference in data. The errors bars in Graph 1 represent the highest and lowest recorded values of muscle contraction for the control and experiment group. Even with the error bars, the results still produced a general trend showing that the experimental group treated with lidocaine produced significantly lower values for amplitude of muscle contraction. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment directly support the hypothesis. The original hypothesis stated that the experimental group would experience a much lower value of muscle contraction when compared to the control group, due to the presence of lidocaine in the experimental group. This makes sense as lidocaine suppresses the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and causes sodium channels in the axon to enter an almost dormant state (Kai T). The fact that lidocaine simply suppresses the activity of calcium and sodium is important, as an impulse of a high enough voltage is still able to cause a contraction, making the average amplitude of muscle contraction in the experimental group a non-zero value. The results of this experiment coincide with that of Almers W and Best P M, who tested the effects of tetracaine, another local anesthetic similar to lidocaine, on frog skeletal muscle. In their experiment, they found that frog skeletal muscles injected with tetracaine required an impulse that was anywhere from 15 to 70 times greater than the impulse required to produce a visible contraction in their non-treated control group, and concluded that local anesthetics stifle the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Almers W: 1976). If tetracaine was used in our experiments in lieu of lidocaine, it would have produced similar results, due to the similar chemical structure of the two compounds. 
This experiment was fairly accurate throughout and produced the hypothesized results. However, in order to further prove the effects of lidocaine on muscle contraction, running the same experiment again with a greater sample of frog legs would produce more accurate results. Some random error may have occurred; one such reason is that varying amounts of lidocaine may have actually effected the muscle. Another is that each leg of the Rana pipiens has a different muscular fiber content: some legs may have more fast-twitch muscle, making them more susceptible to quick muscle stimulation, explaining the variation in muscle contraction amplitude between the legs. These types of errors can only be minimized by running more trials. Future experiments on this topic should consider running test with more legs of Rana pipiens. Additionally, it would be useful to test other local anesthetics, such as tetracaine or articaine, to see if they produce similar results. This would allow researchers to determine which local anesthetic is best suited to block muscle contraction, and which should be used in other areas of study.
