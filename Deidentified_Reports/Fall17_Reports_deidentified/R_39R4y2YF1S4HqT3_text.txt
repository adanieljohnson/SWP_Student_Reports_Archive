Title: The effect of darkness on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied the effect that darkness has on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus, a species of crayfish. This experiment was tested by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed by the crayfish in test chambers of water throughout 5 minute intervals. This was examined during both light and dark trials for the three crayfish, as oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the specific metabolic rate. It was hypothesized that the darkening of the environment would cause a decrease in the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish, due to a decrease in stress and internal activity. The study did not support the hypothesis, but rather showed a strong trend displaying that darkness actually caused an increase of specific metabolic rate for the majority of the trials. The p-value obtained from the paired t-test was 0.691177, and therefore indicated the results were not statistically significant. Still, the data displayed a general trend of higher metabolic activity in darkness most likely because the change in environmental brightness caused more stress which most of the crayfish did not properly adapt to. 


Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to examine the effect that a dark environment has on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish. Metabolism describes the process of using mitochondrial enzymes to convert high-energy molecules to low-energy, and capturing energy released during conversion into ATP. During the metabolism reactions, an organism converts glucose to energy and the carbon and oxygen atoms in glucose are converted into CO₂ gas. This releases high-energy electrons that are captured by NAD and FAD that transfer the electrons to the electron transport system. The electrons give up energy which is used to convert ADP to ATP. Therefore, we can measure metabolic rate during with level of oxygen consumption and CO₂ production [Johnson: 2016]. During our experiment, we can determine the specific metabolic rate of crayfish by measuring their oxygen consumption with a dissolved oxygen meter, as the amount of oxygen used is directly proportional to the amount of energy used [Johnson: 2016]. Using Procambarus was vital to this experiment because they are ectotherms, which means that its body temperature is dependent on outside sources of heat, therefore their metabolic rate is more easily affected by environmental factors. Related studies on the effect of darkness on organisms’ metabolic activity indicate that there are generally two types of reactions; which are the adaptation to the stress of darkness by reducing metabolic activity or the lack of ability to adjust [Wu, Song, Li: 2007]. When placed in a dark environment, we expected that the crayfish in our study would experience lower levels of stress, caused by the lessening of activity occurring internally. Therefore, we hypothesized that the dark conditions of the environment would cause the crayfish’s metabolic rate to be lower than in a light environment. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to conduct this experiment, three crayfish were selected and weighed on a balance scale. They were individually placed into test chambers which were filled with 890mL of water, and placed into a full dishpan.  A dissolved oxygen probe was also placed inside the test chamber in order to measure the oxygen consumption of the crayfish. A baseline reading for the dissolved oxygen concentration was taken, as well as readings at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. This was done first for the crayfish in light, during the control trials. After the amount of oxygen consumption of each crayfish in the light was recorded, the test chamber was covered in aluminum foil as the treatment to eliminate light for the dark trials of the experiment. Each crayfish’s oxygen consumption during the 5, 10, 15 and 20 minute readings were measured with the darkness treatment. Three trials occurred for the control group, and three for the treatment group. A paired t-test was used to analyze the data and measure the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish following the experiment. 


Results:
The trend displayed by the data of this experiment showed a general increase of specific metabolic rate in Procambarus when being examined in darkness rather than light, as the amount of oxygen consumed during the experiments went up when in darkness as well.  In the first two trials, the oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate increased with the dark treatment crayfish in comparison to the control crayfish. The third trial was different, however, in that the oxygen concentration and specific metabolic rate decreased with the dark treatment as opposed to the control group. The first crayfish shows a very slight difference between the light and dark conditions, and the second two crayfish show a more server contrast, yet display opposing information (Figure 1.) The paired t-test displayed a t-value of 0.459186, a degree of freedom of 2, and a p-value of 0.691177. 


Discussion:
For this experiment, we hypothesized that a decrease in light would lower the stress of the crayfish, causing a reduction of internal activity and thus lower its specific metabolic rate while it is in a dark environment, however this was not supported by the data. The general trend displayed by the findings show that the hypothesis was largely incorrect, as two out of the three crayfish displayed an increase in specific metabolic rate. The p-value was not significant because it was not less than 0.05 which also confirms the hypothesis was not supported by the experiment.  Some possible reasons for the deviation from our predicted outcome may be due to the fact that sudden environmental change from lightness to darkness may have actually placed more stress on the crayfish. This stress subsequently may have produced fear in the organisms which could lead to increased heart rate and breathing and thus the overall specific metabolic rate. With this being said, the third crayfish studied displayed a specific metabolic rate that was lower in darkness than the normal, control lightness. This was in line with the hypothesis, possibly because it adapted much more quickly to the altered environment and experienced a decrease in stress in the darkness. Overall, however, the hypothesis we predicted was rejected due to the fact that the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish generally increased with the treatment of a dark environment. Some sources of error could possibly have been that the three crayfish were used as their own control group as well as treatment, therefore the continuous testing may have swayed the organisms’ stress levels and blocked the effect the treatment could’ve had. Also, the foil may not have been the best suited treatment to create darkness, and the crayfish may have needed more time to adapt to the darkness before testing in order to get a more accurate representation of the effect it caused. For future studies, I would definitely want to conduct far more trials, since the data was not unanimous or conclusive. Similar studies displayed supporting results to ours actually, as Bouchard and Purdie’s experiment compared the effect of darkness and other environmental factors on metabolic activity in green alga Scenedesmus and cyanobacterium Microcystis. It was found that the Microcystis could actually adjust to stressful conditions of darkness and reduce its metabolic activity, which is how we predicted our crayfish would react to the dark conditions in our experiment. With this being said, there was a small fraction of this species that experienced the impairment of cells and subsequent death of some of its population, due to the increased stress of darkness. The green alga Scenedesmus, however, had a similar reaction to what actually occurred for our crayfish as it could not regulate its metabolic activity like the Microcystis due to the induced stress of darkness [Bouchard, Purdie: 2011]. This is somewhat in line with our results, which displayed a general, minor increase in specific metabolic rate, but the studies done in this specific field seem relatively inconclusive and therefore should be continually tested to find the real effect that darkness has on crayfish and other ectothermic organisms.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This data displays the specific metabolic rates determined for each of the three crayfish during the light and dark trials. The first crayfish displayed a slight increase of specific metabolic rate while in the dark, and the second crayfish showed a more significant increase of specific metabolic rate while in darkness. The third crayfish showed a decrease in specific metabolic rate while in the dark environment. The statistical paired t-test determined a p-value of 0.691177.
