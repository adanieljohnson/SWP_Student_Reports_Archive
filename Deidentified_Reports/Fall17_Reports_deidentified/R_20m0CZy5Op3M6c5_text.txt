Title: Interspecies Competition between Plants of Water Increases R:S Ratio

Abstract:
In this experiment, we compare the root and shoot ratio to evaluate the different behavior of plants under interspecies competition. Basing on the acknowledgment that plants would behave differently under interspecies competition from growing independently, our hypothesis is that plants competing with another species for water would have a higher root: shoot rate than plants competing with the same species. We tested this hypothesis on buckwheat and oat. Our hypothesis is not supported by the result. That might result from a failure in experiment design. Also, it might because the two species we selected won't behave significantly different while competing with each other because of their similarity.


Introduction:
Plants compete for light, nutrients, and water, etc. These resources are limited in nature. And plants’ ability to transfer these resources to energy is limited as well. In order to maximize the opportunity to survive, plants would specialize in certain characteristics in order to behave better in getting and transferring these resources. In the concept of life history, plants would trade off certain ability to make themselves do better in another field. For example, some plants growing in the dessert would trade off leaves with large surface area and long shoots for longer roots in order to access water [Johnson: 2016]. During the growth and development of plants, it is always distributing nutrients and assimilates in different organs and tissues constantly [Bennett: 2012]. Thus, by measuring and compare the ratio of the length and weight of roots and shoots of one species of plants growing under different conditions, we can find out how they are allocating limited resources differently to survive.  Plants might behave differently when they are in competition with another species instead of growing alone. This competition among plants is considered to be a crucial factor of determination of plants distribution. For example, many certain plants species can be found when they are isolated from other species but would not maintain certain characteristic when they are under competition with other species [Craine: 2013]. That means plants under interspecies competition might allocate resources differently from those which are not.  In this experiment, we are going to test how plants would perform differently while competing for water with another species from while competing for water with its own species. We will provide an abundant degree of nutrient and light and lower degree of water supply for plants growing with its own species and plants growing with another species. We suggest that plants would specialize in the resource the environment is lack of. In this case, we suggest plants specialize in root under the competition for water. Our hypothesis is plants competing with another species for water would have a higher root: shoot rate than plants competing with the same species.


Materials and Methods:
We selected buckwheat and oat as subjects of this experiment. In order to compare how these two plants would behave differently while competing for limited water resource, we set up a comparison group. Every group contains one buckwheat set, one oat set, and one mixed set. Buckwheats and oats are separately planted in one set. Buckwheats and oats are planted together in one set. 40 seeds buckwheat and oat seeds are placed in every set, and they are distributed evenly. An abundant nutrient is added to each set to avoid competition over nutrients. We place the subjects in the greenhouse. Thus, they are able to access abundant sunlight to avoid competition over sunlight. We water the subjects every two days to provide them with limited water resource.  The buckwheats and oats grew under this condition for two weeks. After two weeks, we randomly pick 5 individual buckwheat or oat from each independent set and 5 individual plants for each from the mixed set. We measure the root length and shoot length. We measure the root weight and shoot weight. Using this data, we are able to calculate an R: S length rate and R: S shoot rate to evaluate how the plants have evaluated resources during the past two weeks.  The statistic model we are using to analyze the data is one-tailed T-test because this is a two-sample t test. We are going to use T-test to compare the R: S ratio of length and weight of oats under competition with oats and oats under competition with buckwheats. We will repeat this T-test to buckwheat. If the p-value is smaller than 0.05, it means there is a significant difference between the R: S ratio of plants under interspecies competition and plants under same species competition. If p-values are smaller than 0.05, we would go back to the average value of R: S rates and see how they have differed. We use the average of samples from each pot in this statistic test. 


Results:
We use collected the average weight and length value of roots and shoots of oat and buckwheat individuals selected in every group to calculate the R: S ratio. The comparison of average R:S ratio of buckwheat under interspecies and intra-species competition is referred to figure 1. The comparison of average R:S ratio of oat under interspecies and intra-species competition is referred to figure 2.  The resulting p-value of the t-test of independent group oat R: S weight ratio and competition group R: S length ratio is approximately 0.539974. The resulting p-value of the t-test of independent group oat R: S length ratio and competition group R: S length ratio is approximately 0.576042. The resulting p-value of the t-test of independent group buckwheat R: S weight ratio and competition group R: S length ratio is approximately 0.871929. The resulting p-value of the t-test of independent group buckwheat R: S length ratio and competition group R: S length ratio is approximately 0.087227. P-values are always greater than 0.05, which indicates a significant difference in data collected. This data suggests that there is no significant difference in R: S ratio between plants competing for water with the same species and plants competing for water with different species.


Discussion:
Basing on the acknowledgment that plants would behave differently under competition with other species and plants would allocate resources to what they need most, we suggest that plants would specialize in root more while competing with other species for water. We purposed our hypothesis to plant competing with another species for water would have a higher root: shoot rate than plants competing with the same species. However, the result of this experiment shows no significant difference between R: S rate of plants under interspecies competition. Thus, this experiment fails to improve confidence in this hypothesis.  There might be two possibilities for the failure. First, the competition for water is not intense enough for plants to change their allocation pattern. As we water every two days, the water we provided might still be abundant for tested oats and buckwheat. We failed in creating a competition. Second, the competition for the resource would not make oats and buckwheat allocate resource differently. Competing with a plant with similar size and behavior for resource might be the same thing as competing with its own species.  To understand the allocation of resources in interspecies competition, two future experiments should be done. First, this experiment should be re-designed to create a fiercer competition for water. Also, leaf area determines transpiration of lights of plants. The competition of light would have effects on shoot development, leaf growth, and plant and shoot demography [Baldissera: 2014]. Thus, we will compare how one plant would behave differently while competing with a similar plant and with a significantly different plant for light in leaf area and R:S ratio.
