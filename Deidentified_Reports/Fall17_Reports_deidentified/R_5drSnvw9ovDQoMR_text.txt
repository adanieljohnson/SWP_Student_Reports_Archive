Title: Effects of high Saline Concentration on Spinacia Oleracea Chloroplast Activity.

Abstract:
When chloroplasts derived from Spinach leaves (Spinacia Oleracea) are isolated in saline, the chloroplast activity was expected to decrease. The response of isolated spinach leaf chloroplasts to water and saline (35mg/Ml NaCl), both in light and dark over a short term was investigated. There was no significent difference in chloroplast activity, as checked every 10 minutes for half an hour between saline and water conditions. This was true both in light and dark. The possible explanations for this reaction are discussed, as well as the potential mechanisms and relations to other studies. It may be possible to harvest chloroplasts in areas of higher salinity, but not complete plants.

Introduction:
Plant cells use glucose in much the same process as animal cells, but they differ greatly in how they power glucose synthesis, and the by-products they produce doing so. Plants depend on photosynthesis, which uses chloroplasts – unique to plant cells – to harness solar radiation to produce ATP for glucose synthesis. Another key component is the Hill reaction This experiment investigates the effect of a saline solution on chloroplasts. The majority of the area of the earth is saline (seawater), at 3.5 mg/Ml, and there are plants with the ability to grow in that high saline environment. Spinacia oleraca was chosen due to its wide availability and its applicability to real world solutions as a common crop. Glucose, light and water are not the only requirements to complete photosynthesis. There is an intake of six Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and twelve water (H2O), and the output is glucose (C6H12O6), six water (H2O), and Molecular Oxygen (O2). The process begins with the absorption of solar radiation in chloroplasts, exciting electrons that cleave water, pushing protons across a membrane to create a gradient as well as replacing the electrons that just left the chlorophyll [Johnson: 2017]. We hypothesize saline interferes with chloroplasts, roots, or other components of plant. In chloroplasts, the uptake of too much NaCl, an ionic compound may split within the plant into its components Na and Cl. Cl may be toxic to plants on its own and lead to cell death, or the uptake of too much Na may upset the balance of the TCA cycle and prevent NADPH gradient. In leaves and roots, “there is a rapid and temporary drop in growth rate followed by a gradual recovery to a new reduced rate of growth.” Indicating changes “must be solely due to changes in cell water relations” [Munns: 2002]. This also applied to roots. The variables we plan to test for are: Salinity of water, in which one single concentration will be used across tests (35mg/Ml). Another metric we plan to test is the difference between light and dark conditions. In order to measure the difference between light and dark conditions we need to take advantage of the Hill reaction, which is the process that transfers electrons via electron carriers using the energy released from chloroplasts exposed to light. If DCPIP is used as an alternative electron carrier to NADP+. DCPIP changes from blue to colorless when it is reduced, so its change in absorbance can be measured as a quick and accurate method to assess.

Materials and Method:
Using a chilled mortar and pestle, grind 4 medium sized spinach (Spinacia Oleracea) leaves after removing their veins. Add 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to turn the ground remains into paste. Add an additional 10Ml after you have a paste and stir into a slush or slurry. Strain it through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. We believe there will be significent statistical difference, although we are unsure of the directionality, so we will use a two-tailed T-test.
Every sample contains 2 Ml of reaction buffer, 6Ml of either saline solution or water, and 2Ml of DCPIP. The only exception to this is the blank, which contains 8Ml of water and no DCPIP. When you are ready to begin the assay, add 100 μl of the spinach chloroplasts you prepared to the blank (controlll) tube, and to 6 tubes with 6 Ml of saline, and 6 with 6Ml of water. Mix each tube well immediately after adding chloroplasts. Transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Quickly blank the spectrophotometer using the blank sample (controlll). Then immediately measure the absorbance of all the samples (these are your Time Zero data points). Place half the samples (including the blank) in a rack on a sunny windowsill, or under the grow light. Place the other half in a dark drawer. After 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer with the controlll again. Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. After recording absorbance, return the 6 dark samples back in a drawer after each measurement. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) in light or dark, blank the spectrophotometer. Then measure the absorbances a second time for each sample. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) blank the spectrophotometer and measure absorbances one more time for all samples.


Results:
Comparing the percent change in absorbance over time in the four different samples: Saline-water Chloroplasts in dark, Saline-water Chloroplasts in light, Water Chloroplasts in dark, and Water Chloroplasts in light. Four T-tests were conducted to compare the four variables. The T-tests used were two-tailed, as we did not know what directionality was associated with chloroplast exposure to saline and if they would be more or less active. Saline-water Chloroplasts in light (SCIL) was compared to Saline-water Chloroplasts in dark (SCID) and Water Chloroplasts in dark (CID) was compared to Water Chloroplasts in light (CIL). Then the samples with light were compared (SCIL and CIL) and the samples in dark. (SCID and CID). The experimental groups were the Saline based chloroplasts. When comparing SCIL vs SCID and CIL vs CID, the P values were .038 and .046 respectively, indicating both were significent.

Discussion:
Our data did not reflect our hypothesis. When Spinacia Oleracea was exposed to high salinity, there was little observable difference between the percent change chloroplasts in saline or in water. This was observed both in light and in dark, with saline and without saline. The samples exposed to light experienced a far greater increase in the percent change in absorbance, as expected. With more chloroplast exposure to light the Hill reaction runs more frequently, and subsequently more DCPIP changes color as it is reduced. This change in color drives a change in absorbance. We predicted some change in the absorbance due to chloroplast damage from saline. Our data seems to suggest that is not the case, but that saline will have an effect on other parts of the plants. Other research indicates that saline indeed has an effect on plants growth, and when comparing plants on healthy environments to those under salt stress, the stressed plants are stunted and suffer from “inhibited growth.” [Zhu: 2007]. This is understood as a common symptom of salt stress, and seems to suggest that saline inhibits growth of leaves and roots because it reduces the plant as a whole’s ability to uptake water. (“Salt stress inhibits photosynthesis by reducing water potential”) [Parida: 2005]. If this is the case it means singular chloroplasts can make use of salt-heavy environments or saline to function mostly normally with enough direct access to water. Some of the potential applications include off-shore creation of oxygen via photosynthesis using separated chloroplasts, although there are quite a few logistical issues involved with this. Light continues to be the primary metric needed for chloroplast activity. Further experimentation can investigate different levels of salinity and the effect on chloroplasts. If off-shore oxygen producing capabilities are to be further explored, long term exposure to high levels of saline would also be a critical experiment, as well as long term direct exposure and self-sustainability in off-shore conditions. The experiment has the potential to produce oxygen to help sustain loss of oxygen due to rapid deforestation and death of current ocean-based organisms such as algae.
