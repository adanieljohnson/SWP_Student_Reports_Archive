Title: The positive effect of caffeine injection in the gastrocnemus on the amplitude of muscle contraction in Rania pipiens 

Abstract:
Caffeine promotes the release of Ca2+ ions in muscle of animals. By injecting Rania pipiens gastrocnemus with 0.1 Ml of caffeine, and stimulating the muscle with an electric current from 0 to 5V, we intended to discover whether or not the amplitude of contraction would be greater or less than without caffeine treatment. Given background knowledge, we believed that the amplitude of contraction would be higher for the gastrocnemus once treated with caffeine because the greater amount of Ca2+ ions would allow for the utilization of more muscle fibers, in turn generating a stronger contraction. Upon conclusion of the experiment, it was found that on average, the amplitude of muscle contraction was greater for the treatment group (with caffeine) than for the controlll group (without caffeine). This supported our hypothesis.


Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is very similar to hormone-based systems, in that it allows organisms to sense and respond to internal and external stimuli. However, the neuromuscular system is different because it elicits a much faster response, within milliseconds. Hormone-based systems take seconds, and even days to elicit a response. Unique to animals, this system consists of hundreds or thousands of myofibers bound together by connective tissue. There are innervated, or stimulated, by motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions. This process utilizes action potentials and the release of ACh, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and Ca2+ channels. The action potential stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which releases many Ca2+ ions, generating a muscle contraction. This happens when thick myosin filaments, with globular heads, use ADP-Pi and ATP to “walk” along thin actin filaments. The myosin heads bind to sites located on the actin filament, which are covered by tropomyosin until Ca2+ ions bind to troponin. This invokes a response from the tropomyosin,which moves away from the binding sites, and the myosin heads can thus attach. Relaxation occurs when the Ca2+ ions are taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 
	In this week’s lab, we will be testing the effects of caffeine, which is known to promote the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, on the amplitude of muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus of a Rania pipiens frog leg. We will be injecting the caffeine straight into the gastrocnemus. For our controlll, we will perform an electrical stimulus on the gastrocnemus prior to adding caffeine, and compare the values. A case study, named “The Relationship Between Caffeine Contracture of Intact Muscle and the Effect of Caffeine on the Reticulum” (Weber: 1968), found that by injecting caffeine into a rabbit and frog muscle, a greater contraction was found than without the addition of caffeine. This was due to a greater quantity of Ca2+ ions being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. With this in mind, we believe that if we inject caffeine into the gastrocnemus of a Rania pipiens leg, we will see greater contraction via an amplitude reading from our iWorx equipment. The iWorx electrophysiology recording equipment allows us to quantify the amplitude of contraction through voltage (mV), by stimulating the muscle with an electrical current that stimulates muscle contraction, acting as an action potential. When the contraction occurs, the muscle will pull on the EP device and data will be recorded through the iWorx software downloaded on a computer. We will be able to controlll the applied pulse amplitude via the software. 


Materials and Method:
Materials: 

iWorx electrophysiology recording equipment
One laptop for recording data and running iWorx software
3 Rania pipiens frog legs
1 dissecting tray
Frog Ringer’s solution
Gloves
Chem wipes
0.3 Ml Caffeine (1.9g caf/ 100 Ml Ringer’s solution)
Various metal pins to anchor the leg
Spool of thread
Scissors

Method:

Deglove Rania pipiens frog leg, careful not to damage the underlying muscle. Place in dissecting tray.
Separate the gastrocnemus from connective tissue connecting to the posterior tibia.
Cut the achilles tendon where it attaches to the foot of the frog. Create a small loop with thread, and tighten around the achilles tendon. Make another loop at the opposite end of the thread, enough to attach to the hook on the iWorx equipment. 
Gently separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper end and ending towards the knee. Free the sciatic nerve (white) from its attaching connective tissue until near the knee. Be gentle handling the nerve, do not let it come in contact with metal. Keep exposed tissue moist with Ringer’s solution
Pin the frog leg down to the dissecting tray with four pins, so the leg will be immobilized. Attach the thread to the hook on the force equipment, bringing the gastrocnemus vertical to about 90°. Keep some slack in the thread, but still pretty tight.
Attach nerve (sheath) probe to the sciatic nerve, so that the nerve comes into contact with the two electrodes. Clip the sheath over top of the nerve and probe to immobilize the nerve. 
Set stimulus parameter to 0 volts. Click record to stimulate the muscle. There should be no contraction. 
Set stimulus parameter to 1V. Click record to stimulate the muscle. Once the twitch has been performed, stop the recording. You should have a lab partner watching for the twitch. 
Repeat stimulus parameter steps through 5V, increasing by 1V every time. Record the amplitude of contractions for “without caffeine” (mV).
 This will be the controlll group. Periodically add Ringer’s solution to the leg to keep it moist.
Using a needle and syringe, add 0.1 Ml of caffeine to the middle of the gastrocnemus muscle. Repeat stimulus parameter readings from 0 to 5V again. Record this data under the “with caffeine” group. 
Once 5V has been reached following the addition of the caffeine, repeat procedure with a new leg. This should be repeated for three trials. It is important that the controlll be run before the treatment for each trial. If the treatment is added prior to running a controlll test, then the results will lead to skewed data because caffeine is already present in the muscle. 

A paired t_test will be used to determine if the data is statistically significent or not.





Results:
The average amplitude of contraction for the controlll group was 1.321mV±0.213 and 1.713mV±0.271 for the experimental group. Both treatment and controlll were tested on the same Rania pipiens gastrocnemus, controlll first. Both groups were subjected over a range of 0V to 5V of electric current for data collection, repeated three times, and then averaged for the chart. Figure 1 shows that overall, the average amplitude of contraction for the three trials was greater for the treatment group than for the controlll group. Each trial supported this data. The mean amplitude of contraction of the treatment group was significently greater than the mean of the controlll (t_stat= 4.66, d.f.= 2, P= 0.043).


Discussion:
The data from our experiment upholds our hypothesis, that the gastrocnemus treated with caffeine had greater amplitude of contraction than the gastrocnemus without treatment. This can be seen in figure 1 from the results section. This can be explained by the way that caffeine stimulates greater release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which allows more interaction with muscle fibers, leading to stronger contraction overall. Amplitude of contraction has been seen to be affected by the treatment of caffeine in other experiments as well, such as in Weber, 1968. The paired t_test that we ran proved that our results were significent, with a p_value of 0.043. This means that we can reject our null hypothesis that caffeine does not affect the amplitude of contraction of the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus. However, the p_value is not greatly below 0.05, which means our results are “barely” significent.
	Although not presented here, our raw data showed that in the third trial, our “with caffeine” values decreased from the 1V stimulus to the 5V stimulus. We can explain this phenomenon as the ATP was likely all used up in the gastrocnemus, and thus the muscle was fatiguing. This did not happen in our other two trials. In a perfect world, we would want to test on a muscle that would not fatigue before the end of our experimentation. 
	For future experimentation, it would be interesting to test other chemicals that stimulate release of Ca2+ ions and compare the results to caffeine’s effect on the amplitude of muscle contraction. This would allow us to see which chemical provides the greatest advantage in contraction amplitude, which could then be used in supplements to help provide athletes with an edge in their sports. To follow up on this experiment, we could also determine which method of treatment (direct injection, topical rub, etc.) provides the greatest amplitude of contraction, which could also be expanded to human testing for use as a supplement as mentioned above.
