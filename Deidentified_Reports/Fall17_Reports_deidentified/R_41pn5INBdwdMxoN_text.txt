Title: Effects of 200 mM Caffeine on the Leg Muslces of the Rania Pipiens Leads to Stonger Muscles Contractions 

Abstract:
Calcium is known to be an important component of muscle contraction as it plays a fundamental role within the filament sliding theory. In this experiment, contraction and calcium were at the center of study through the use of the Rania Piepien’s gastrocnemus. This experiment strived to determine whether or not caffeine would increase the amount of Ca2+ in the muscle and therefore, lead to greater contraction. After stimulating the experimental leg (without caffeine) with one volt of current and then stimulating the same legs after having had injected them with caffeine via syringe (experimental group), they produced significently greater contractions. This supports the idea that caffeine and, therefore Ca2+ leads to greater muscle contractions. 


Introduction:

Muscle contraction is fundamental to living creatures as many physiological and behavior actions rely on this function. There are three major types of vertebrate muscle (skeletal, cardiac, and smooth). Skeletal muscle is responsible for voluntary movement, cardiac muscle is responsible for the beating of the heart, and smooth muscle is known for creating movement within hollow organs. Focusing on skeletal muscle, biologists have discovered that the contraction of this type of muscle can be explained through the sliding filament theory. The theory can be broken down into four steps. Step 1: The motor nerve stimulates an action potential (impulse/ change in membrane potential) to travel down the axon of a neuron to the neuromuscular junction. The action potential then stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca+2 into the muscle cell. Step 2: Ca+2 floods inside of the muscle cell while binding with troponin and allowing actin to bind with myosin. The actin and myosin cross bridges then bind and contract using ATP (energy compound used to fuel cells). Step 3: ATP is re-synthesized, which allows the actin and myosin to maintain their strong binding conditions. Step 4: Relaxation occurs as stimulation of the nerve stops. At this point, calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum-- breaking the bond between the actin and the myosin. 
Evidently, calcium plays a fundamental role in the contraction of muscles. In a report titled, “The Relationship Between Caffeine Contracture of Intact Muscles and the Effect of Caffeine on Reticulum”, two researchers (A.Weber and R. Herz) explore the effects of caffeine on muscle contraction. For their experiment, the researchers focused their attention on the gastrocnemus leg muscles of the Rania Pipiens and the generic bunny rabbit. After isolating the legs of the specimens, the researchers applied caffeine to the gastrocnemus of muscle of each specimen and observed for changes with regards to strength of contraction [Weber: 1968]. Concluding their experiment, the researched observed that those muscles, which had been treated with caffeine, also released more ionized calcium. The release of more Ca2+ was determined to be responsible for an increase in contraction regarding the gastrocnemus muscle for both the Rania Pipiens and the rabbit. 
This experiment is similar to our own as we wish to test the effects of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens. We will obtain three frog legs in which each will serve as the controlll and experimental group. To begin the experiment, each leg will be stimulated with 1 volt of current (controlll group). The degree of contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle will then be measured in millivolts. After each leg has been stimulated, each will be injected with one milliliter of 200 mM caffeine and then stimulated once again with one volt of current (experimental group). With wish to carry-out this experiment with the following hypothesis in mind: (which is supported by A.Weber and R. Herz) If we inject caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle group of the Rania Pipiens, then the amplitude of muscle contraction will increase. 


Materials and Method:
The first materials required are the three frog legs, which have been completely severed from the body. Such were collected and skinned through the use of hands, scissors and tissues. The leg muscles were completely visible and the gastrocnemus muscle was separated from the bone by sliding scissors up and down the bone and detaching it at the Achilles tendon (this was also done through the use of the hands). Once this was finished, the sciatic nerve needed to be exposed. Next, the inner thigh muscles which begin at the upper end and extend down to the knee were separated. Doing this the sciatic nerve was visible. The legs were kept moist with frog ringer. Next, the gastrocnemus muscle was tied with a string and suspended to the electrophysiology recording equipment. The leg was flat and pinned on the exam table with a string tied to the gastrocnemus muscle at 90 degrees relative to the table. The string connecting the gastrocnemus muscle was taut and kept sturdy. With the sciatic nerve exposed it was draped over the sleeve electrode of the electrophysiology (EP) recording equipment. Once the leg was properly set up, the electrophysiology (EP) recording equipment program was set to deliver 3 waves of 1.0 Hz of current to each leg. After this was done, each leg was injected with one milliliter of 200 mM of caffeine through the use of a syringe and then delivered with 3 more pulses of 1.0 Hz of current. The results were recorded


Results:
Results- A significent increase in contraction (measured in millivolts) was generated from the gastrocnemus muscles after the 200 mM Caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens (Figure 1.1).

The blue bar represents the controlll group or group with no caffeine while the orange bar represents the experimental group or group that had been injected with caffeine.

The controlll group averaged 1.3 (mV) with a standard deviation of ±0.26. The experimental group averaged 1.7 (mV) with a standard deviation of ±0.33. The data produced a t-value of 4.66 and a p_value of 0.043. 


Discussion:
The collected data in this experiment supports our original hypothesis which stated that the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens would contract to a greater degree after having been injected with caffeine. This is represented by the figure above as the controlll group averaged a contraction of 1.3 (mV) with a standard deviation of ±0.26 while the experimental group averaged in a greater contraction average at averaged 1.7 (mV) with a standard deviation of ±0.33. The p_value calculated was below 0.05 (0.043) and so, our null hypothesis could not be supported. This supports the idea that caffeine lead to greater influx of Ca2+ within the gastrocnemus and therefore, lead the muscle to contract to a greater degree. 
These ideas correspond with those found in the experiment conducted by A.Weber and R. Herz. These researches conducted a similar experiment and found similar results. Therefore, the work of these researchers supports the findings of this experiment. 
Although our data, and this primary literature support our hypothesis, it is clear that there were some limitations within our experiment. These limitations fall within the realm of our specimen. We were only given three legs to work with, which produces plenty of room for error. For example, the third leg did not produce as great as a contraction as we had predicted even after being injected with caffeine. This may have been a result of early fatigue. However, we are unsure. Also, within the parameters of this experiment, we only had room to stimulate each leg with one measured volt of current (stimulus). We were also only able to test the effects of a very specific concentration of coffee (200 mM). Testing a variation of concentrations would better help us understand how caffeine floods muscle groups with Ca2+. 
These limitations lead us to propose ideas for future study. Such ideas include using more legs in the future as they can lead to a lower chance for error since some specimen tend to be defective. Using different level of current (stimuli) would also lead us to more findings regarding how the stimulus leads to contraction and how the level of stimuli along with the caffeine effects the leg muscles of the gastrocnemus. We would also like to test different concentrations of caffeine in future experiments.
