Title: Effect of salinized water on metabolic rate of Orconectes

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to judge whether the specific metabolic rates of Orconectes are altered by a change in salt concentration in their surroundings. We hypothesized that with greater salinity, metabolic rate would be increased. To test our hypothesis we used three crayfish and made each one its own control by first measuring metabolic rate without the treatment, then adding the salt afterwards. We determined from our data that there is no significant data showing that salt concentration and specific metabolic rate are directly proportional (p= .2363). Therefore, we could not make a conclusion regarding the relationship between salinity and metabolic rate. In future studies we will continue working with salt to answer this scientific question more clearly.

Introduction:
In this experiment we wanted to test the effects of salinity on the metabolism of the crustacean Orconectes. This species of crayfish is highly invasive and mainly resides in North American freshwater lakes and rivers. They are a suitable subject for this experiment because of their abundance and their highly adaptive nature [Ahern: 2017]. This species is capable of altering their metabolic rates based on what the environment they are in demands of them. Metabolism is essentially the processes that encompass changing food into energy, forming the building blocks of proteins, lipids, etc. and expelling unnecessary nitrogenous substances [Gäde: 1984]. We measured the subjects’ metabolism by recording the amount of oxygen being used in a closed system over the span of fifteen minutes. We found this to be an effective method of collecting data because the main characteristic of metabolism is that it requires oxygen to produce the energy necessary for carrying out all of the functions mentioned earlier. Therefore, if the change in oxygen level in greater that means the organism’s metabolic rate was higher and vice versa. Throughout our experiment we altered the salinity of the system and watched how the change in oxygen was affected. In order to determine the answer to this scientific question we must find the change in oxygen in a closed system with and without the salt additive. We will be able to make a conclusion based on if the metabolic rate for the experimental groups are greater than or less than the initial control group metabolic rate. We predicted that if we added salt to the system, the organism’s metabolic rate would increase.

Materials and Methods:
To properly test our hypothesis, we had a total of six trials- three control and three experimental. Although, we only had three subjects, so our method consisted of measuring the metabolic rates for each crayfish in a normal freshwater environment, then introducing a .05 M salt solution to each one and recording the metabolic rate with the same organisms. The system the subjects were placed in and where the testing took place was a sealed mason jar holding around 900 mL of liquid. We left the crayfish in both systems for fifteen minutes and recorded the amount of oxygen every five minutes. We used a paired t-test to determine significance of the data.

Results:
After collecting the data we observed that, in general, there was an increase in the specific metabolic rate when the organism was submerged in the salt solution (avg. in water= .0005, avg. in salt= .00086). However, with the second subject there was a discrepancy where the metabolic rate was higher during the control phase of testing (see table 1), which seemed to have skewed our data. Therefore, we found that there was no significant difference between specific metabolic rates in water and in the salt solution (p= .2363). 

Discussion:
In past studies the surprisingly adaptive nature of Procambarus clarkii, a closely-related species of crayfish was studied in a highly salinic environment [Bissattini et al.: 2015]. The results showed that drastic changes in their surroundings are of little consequence to this type of animal due to their surprising resiliency and ability to quickly shift metabolic rates. In Bissattini’s study they used a much higher concentration of salt at 35% which could be explain the significance of their data. In our particular experiment, we were unable to prove significance, so our data did not support our hypothesis. Possible error could have resulted from the fact that we initially planned to calculate change in oxygen over the span of fifteen minutes, but in the fifth trial the lid was removed one segment early releasing the oxygen, so we decided to use our fifteen-minute values throughout. This could have altered our results due to the fact that the metabolic rate could have continued to rise after that time stamp. The next logical step for this study is to continue testing metabolic rate with salinity, but include different levels of salt concentration and see if metabolism slowly increase as that value does. In conclusion, we were unable to produce significant evidence that metabolic rate increases with higher salt concentration.
