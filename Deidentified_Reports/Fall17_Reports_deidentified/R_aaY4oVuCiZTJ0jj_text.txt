Title: Lidocaine testing on Rania pipiens

Abstract:
We did a study on the Northern Leopard Frog (Rania pipiens) to test the frequency at which the gastrocnemus muscle would twitch with and without lidocaine. We hypothesized that with lidocaine in the gastrocnemus muscle, the muscle would not twitch due to the blockage of the action potential coming from lidocaine. This blockage would block sodium channels causing the frog leg to need a higher voltage in order to twitch. To achieve this, we had to find a controlll amplitude threshold for the three frog legs and then tested how they reacted when adding lidocaine to the gastrocnemus muscle. From injecting lidocaine to the gastrocnemus muscle, we found that the lidocaine would block the muscle from twitching. From this we discovered that when lidocaine is injected into the muscle of the Rania pipiens, it had a direct affect to the gastrocnemus muscle and it was muscle sodium channel blocker. 

Introduction:
	The organism we did a study on was called the Northern Leopard Frog (Rania pipiens). The gastrocnemus muscle of this frog leg is good to work with because this muscle on the frog is strong, large and gave easy strong pulses to read [Sadava:2017]. The neuromuscular system is different from hormone based system. Skeletal muscles proper is formed by multiple myofibers that are bound together by connective tissue. Sodium channels are only in the axon of the sciatic nerve and create an action potential. Voltage gated sodium anion channels open when there is depolarization between the fluid inside the axon and the extracellular fluid. When the channels open, sodium flows into the negatively charged axon and creates action potential. This is the pathway that nerve cells send chemical signals from cell to cell. Sodium channel blocker lidocaine, helps block sodium channels by binding to the said channel [Sadava:2017]. Lidocaine is used to block pain pathways for certain inflammatory diseases [Wood:2004].  In the case for the frog leg we use lidocaine to block sodium channels in the frog leg causing it not to get an action potential in order to twitch. By doing this study we wanted to know how lidocaine would affect the twitch threshold of the frog muscle, when an electrical signal is put into the gastrocnemus muscle we expected the leg to twitch. By adding the lidocaine, we expected the gastrocnemus muscle to take more voltage in order to twitch.


Materials and Method:
Our group was given three frog legs, that were prepared for us before we conducted our experiment. We began working with our frog leg by first separating the inner thigh muscles to reveal the sciatic nerve. Gently free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue, by gently using your fingers to separate the flesh from the sciatic nerve. Keep exposed tissues moist (not drowning) in Ringer’s solution. Separate the inner thigh muscles, then attach a string to the gastrocnemus muscle and then hook it and have the frog leg sit at a 90-degree angle and secure the frog leg using pins. To get the controlll of the three frog legs, we had to determine the amplitude threshold of the muscle twitch by from the simulation of the nerve. We then extracted the sciatic nerve from the muscle of the frog leg. We connected the sciatic nerve to a sleeve electrode and connected that to the adaptor that would send the pulses to the frog leg. We did tests to determine the twitch threshold by direct stimulation. Threshold voltage was determined when we would increase the increments of stimulus voltage by 0.1V. Find the controlll for all three frog legs one by one. Then inject the frog legs with 0.2Ml of lidocaine. We then let the frog leg rest for five minutes. Repeat the same process for the two other frog legs. Test the legs after the lidocaine was injected repeating the same steps as you did to test the controlll and record the data as you go.


Results:
When we had to test the twitch threshold for the controlll of the frog legs, one frog leg had the amplitude threshold of 0.5V before we saw a twitch. Frog leg two had an amplitude threshold of 0.5V. Frog leg three had an amplitude threshold of 0.2V. Standard deviation for the controlll group was 0.173. For the experimental group frog leg one a reached amplitude threshold 2.5V. Experimental frog leg two reached an amplitude threshold at 3.0V.  Finally, experimental frog leg three reached an amplitude threshold 3.0V. The standard deviation for the experimental group was 0.289.
Statistical values for tetany were unable to be calculated because our results were inconclusive and did not give us numerical values. We did statistical tests on the amplitude threshold and these are the results we calculated from the amplitude as followed: T-test is -9.5, P-value is 0.0109, and the degrees of freedom were 2. Lastly, the mean of the controlll group was 0.3 and the mean of the experimental group was 2.8.



Discussion:
	When testing the controlll for all the frog legs, the frog legs reached a twitch threshold at low voltages. When we injected the frog legs with lidocaine we noticed that none of the three frog legs muscles fully stopped showing a twitch in the feet, but the muscle where the actual lidocaine was injected it did not twitch or move. We noticed when testing the controlll for the frog legs that two of the three frog legs were usually consistent. By this I mean that the numbers were the same for frequency and tetany for at least two of the frog legs. When injecting the lidocaine to the gastrocnemus muscle, our hypothesis was that the lidocaine would increase the voltage that it would take for the muscle to twitch. This was supported because the difference in the experimental and the controlll group. For an example, frog leg one went from 0.5V to reach twitch threshold and then with added lidocaine it went to 2.5V. The experimental group as shown in the data needed a higher voltage for the twitch threshold. Our data was significent; we know this because our standard deviation was below 0.5. The only physical error we faced was with the first frog leg we tested was taking a lot of voltage to twitch. After a while of trying we gave it time to rest while we worked on the next two frog legs. When coming back to frog leg one it started to twitch correctly. That was the only physical problem we faced. The only other problem we had was with the technology but we eventually figure that all out. To improve our experiment, I suggest that we take more frog legs to test. Three was not enough because in our group two of our legs reacted the same way. To be more accurate we would need more legs to see if lidocaine really influenced the legs. Another improvement would be the amount of time we let the lidocaine settle in the muscle and the amount of lidocaine we injected. With a longer waiting time, I feel as if the lidocaine would have spread throughout the whole frog leg rather than just the gastrocnemus muscle we would not have seen a twitch at all in the feet as we did. With more lidocaine being added it would be able to spread throughout the frog leg more properly with the right waiting time. Lidocaine in the real world is used to block pain pathways in an inflammatory disease called erythromelagia which is a rare pain disorder in which blood vessels are episodically blocked then become inflamed. With a low dose injection of lidocaine, it inhibits the pain associated with primary erythromelagia [Wood:2004]. This relates to our frog leg because when it was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle it inhibited the muscle from contacting. Which comes from the sodium blocking of lidocaine.
