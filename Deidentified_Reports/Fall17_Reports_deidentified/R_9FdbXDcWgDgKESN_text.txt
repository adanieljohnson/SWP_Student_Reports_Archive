Title: Effect of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor on Muscle Contraction on Gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens Leads to No Conclusion 

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to see the effects of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor on the average of 5 pulse maximum contractions on the gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens. This will be accomplished through the proper dissection of the leg of Rana pipiens, and an injection of 0.2mL of a 2% solution of sevin in the gastrocnemius. We also used a computer program, LabScribe, to measure out the contractions for control and after the contraction with the injection. We used the paired-T test to compare the control and the experimental legs. The experiments hypothesis states that if ACh esterase (AChE) inhibitor is injected into the gastrocnemius the maximum muscle contraction, the contractile amplitude will be higher than that of the muscle that was not injected with the AChE inhibitor. The p-value of the first one frog leg was 0.006, the second leg p-value was 0.06, and the 3rd leg’s p-value was 0.0001. Through these results and the p-value, that was calculated there was no significant conclusion that we could arrive at therefore we were neither able to accept or refute our hypothesis. 


Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to see and measure the effect of acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, specifically a 2% solution of Sevin, on the contractile amplitude of the gastrocnemius. The organism that we tested this experiment on was Rana pipens, produced within a lab. Rana pipens are vertebrates so their functions would be similar to ours. Acetylcholinesterases function within neural communication is that it breaks down acetylcholine in the synapse which then closes the chemically gated channels [Sadava, Hillis, Heller, Hacker: 2016]. If there was an inhibitor of that enzyme then it would prevent acetylcholine (ACh) from breaking down, producing the contractions on and on. Specifically, within muscle contractions vesicles of acetylcholine are released because of the action potential that arrives at the axon terminal [Sadava, Hillis, Heller, Hacker: 2016]. This is the beginning of muscle contractions so acetylcholinesterase inhibitor would fall after the function of the vesicles. The independent variable is the amount of Sevin, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is put into the gastrocnemius. The dependent variable is the contractile amplitude that is recorded through a computer program called LabScribe which shows a myogram. The hypothesis is that if AChE inhibitor is injected into the gastrocnemius the maximum muscle contraction, contractile amplitude, will be greater after AChE is injected than without.  

Materials and Methods:
1. Deglove the three frog legs. Dissect the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve of the frog leg. Have the sciatic nerve exposed.
2. Cut the end of the gastrocnemius of each leg, all three legs. Leave the medial end.
3. Make a loop with the thread given and tie it to the tendon, achilles tendon. Use the other end of the string to tie it to the flat spring of the transducer arm.
4. Mount the transducer above the frog leg so the gastrocnemius muscle is suspended at 90°
5. Pin leg down at muscle and nerve but making sure not to go through the sciatic nerve, making sure the whole leg stays in place. 
6. Stimulate the muscle and nerve by placing the sleeve transducer across the sciatic nerve and placing a white cap over it. 
7. Find the threshold of control for each leg. In each leg keep it the same with 1 pulse, setting hertz to .5, pulse width (stimulus duration) to 5ms. Do gradations of .5 to find the threshold
8. Wait for a minute, then 5 pulses at max contraction
9. Inject with a syringe the ACh esterase inhibitor (2% sevin solution) into the gastrocnemius. Give 0.2 mL of the solution. 
10. Find the threshold and max contraction amplitude through the use of LabScribe. 
11. Perform stimulation with same results as threshold to the rest of the legs. Performing the control on the same and then the experiment as method number 9 to each leg. 
12. Compare results from the control to the experiment frog leg using a paired T-test. 



Results:
The average contraction for the first leg before the treatment of AChE inhibitor was 1.25V and after it was 1.1V. The 2nd leg’s control average contractile amplitude was 1.7128V while the experimental value was 1.7098. The last leg, the control average contractile amplitude was 1.438V and the average contractile value was 1.467V. The first two legs showed a decrease in the average of 5 pulse maximum contractions after the injection of AChE inhibitor. The last leg had an increase in the average of 5 pulse maximum contraction which can be conclusive to our hypothesis but since it is not consistent, there cannot be a definitive conclusion. The p-value of the first leg is 0.006 which is significant because it is below 0.05. The second leg was 0.06, not significant because the value is greater than 0.05.  The p-value of the last leg was 0.0001, showing significance. But the two legs who had a p-value less than 0.05 are in opposite direction, leg 1 decreased in maximum contractions while leg 3 increased in maximum contractions. The first leg’s control error bars show small variability and the AChE inhibitor shows a larger variability within the AChE inhibitor. The error bars for the second leg show a large variation within the 5 pulses taken for both control and AChE inhibitor injection. The control has a smaller variation than the AChE inhibitor. The error bars for the third leg show small variability. Control has a smaller variability than AChE inhibitor.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported based off of the results presented. This experiment came out to show no statistical significance within all the legs tested, even though 2 out of the 3 legs turned out to be statistically significant. The p-values were not in the same direction. One of the p-values was showed an increase in maximum contraction while the other showed a decrease in maximum contraction meaning that we cannot conclude anything from our hypothesis. The decrease in maximum contraction shows a decrease in maximum contractile amplitude and is different from the background information in the introduction. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, in this experiment decreased the amount of contractions and then the last leg it increased. 

Some limitations that were shown throughout this experiment was that the injection of 0.2 mL of 2% solution of Sevin was shown to be too much as it spilled out of the gastrocnemius of the Rana pipiens. Another limitation is that the frog leg could have already been fatigued at the start of the experiment and therefore could have given us the results that was observed, a decrease in maximum contractions.  

Within another lab that was already published titled “Differential effects of TAK-802, a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and carbamate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on contraction of the detrusor smooth muscle of the guinea pig” the results were conclusive to our results in reference to our first two frog legs. This article concluded that while some of the AChE inhibitors enhanced the contractions of the muscle, the other AChE inhibitors did [Nagabukuro, Doi:2005]. They used a wide range of different AChE inhibitors, giving different conclusions within each inhibitor. Each AChE inhibitor, within the experiment had a different effect on muscle contractions, but they used it on the basal tone of the muscle contraction. Since they used different AChE inhibitors they had varied results but concluded that the carbamate AChE inhibitor “caused an increase in the amplitude of the twitch-life contractions and basal tone”[Nagabukuro, Doi:2005]. Within a web article published by Cornell University and other Universities on cholinesterase inhibition, sevin was listed as a carbamate [Cholinesterase Inhibitor; 1993].  This could be compared to our experiment in the fact that the Sevin is a carbamate, which was the reason for why the contractions we observed increased for the first 2 legs. But, that still leaves us with the 3rd leg being inconclusive. A possible reason for why that 3rd leg acted the opposite of the first two could be because it had already started to fatigue before with stimulated it and injected it.  For future experiments, we could potentially decrease the amount of AChE inhibitor that we inject into the gastrocnemius. Another thing we can change about this experiment for the future is use a bigger sample size to be able to see some definitive results of what occurs.

Figure 1. Test leg 1, shows a decrease in max amplitude after the injection of AChE inhibitor.  The error bars show the standard deviation which is the variability in the 5 pulse contracts. The error bars in this graph show small variability within the 5 pulse contractions within the control and shows a larger variability within the AChE inhibitor. The p-value of the AChE inhibitor is 0.006 which is significant because it is below 0.05.
