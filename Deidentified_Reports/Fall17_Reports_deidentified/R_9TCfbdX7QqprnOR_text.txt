Title: The Effect of Glucose and Fructose on Chemotaxis of Physarum 

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether physarum had a different chemotactic attraction to glucose and fructose. This was tested through chemotaxis using Physarum polycephalum. We had three petri dishes for both the fructose and glucose, and one for the controlll. Each dish had a blank cube of water-agar, one cube of the physarum sample, and one cube of its assigned sample, either glucose or fructose. For the controlll, an extra cube of the blank was added. The petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm, covered in aluminum foil and placed in a dark cabinet. After twenty-four hours, the distance and direction in which the physarum growth was measured and recorded. A statistical t_test did not produce a significent difference, meaning the null hypothesis was not rejected. It was determined that both fructose and glucose have a positive chemotactic effect on physarum.

Introduction:
A slime mold, known as Physarum polycephalum, was be used to study cells processes due to its characteristics and behaviors similar to that of a large, single cell. It has multiple nuclei contained in a single plasma membrane, which undergo mitosis at the same time. The mold responds to its environment in many ways. For this experiment, we analyzed chemotaxis which refers to the response, of the physarum, to chemical by moving either toward (positive) or away (negative).  Sugars are more effective chemotactic agents than amino acids. Glucose and galactose have been shown to have a positive chemotactic effect, while fructose is a much weaker attractant. [Randal & Tag]. We hypothesized that the glucose will have a positive chemotactic effect and the fructose will have a negative effect on physarum growth.

Materials and Method:
We gathered one petri dish with a physarum sample, 9 blank water-agar petri dishes, metal scalpel, and ethanol. One blank petri dish was set aside to use for the blank samples. One plate was soaked in 5Ml of glucose, and another in 5Ml fructose, and set aside for fifteen minutes so the water-agar would absorb the solution. Next, we labeled the bottom of each of the seven-remaining water-agar plates. Each was divided in half and three 1cm x 1cm squares were drawn. One of the plates was labeled ‘blank, physarum, blank’ which was the controlll. Three were labeled ‘blank, physarum, glucose’ and the remaining three were labeled ‘blank, physarum, fructose’. The scalpel was cleaned with ethanol and then used to cut 1cm x 1cm squares and placed on the appropriately labeled squares on each petri dish. The scalpel was cleaned with ethanol and then used to cut 1cm x 1cm squares of the physarum sample; then, each was placed on the appropriately labeled squares. Lastly, the scalpel was used to cut three squares from the glucose sample and three from the fructose and place on the appropriately labeled squares. Then, each dish was sealed with Parafilm and wrapped in aluminum foil. They were then placed in a dark cabinet and the physarum grew for 24 hours until we returned to gather data. 


Results:
The results show that there was no significent difference between the growth of physarum toward fructose, glucose and the controlll, as the p_values were greater than 0.05. [fructose p= 0.710; glucose p=0.882]. Once again, we hypothesized that the physarum would have a positive chemotactic effect toward glucose and a negative chemotactic attraction to fructose. 

Discussion:
 The results showed that the physarum sample had a positive chemotactic attraction to both carbohydrate samples, glucose and fructose. Glucose and fructose have the same chemical formula; however, their chemical structure and bonding differ. [Ibrahim et. al]. Additionally, the body breaks down various types of sugars in different way, glucose and fructose are not an exception. For this reason, we believe that the chemotactic effect was so similar because the sugars are isomers of each other.
	To improve this experiment, it would be interesting to text the chemotaxis of various sugars that are not isomers of one another. This could lead to better results and explanation of how cell signaling works with different sugar structures. Results could then be used to determine the different ways in which sugars are broken down in the body.
	Physarum has been used to study various cellular processes and will likely continue to be used in the future. Past studies have focused on the biological effect nutrient type molecules such as carbohydrates, and chemicals like cyclic nucleotides have on cells. [de Lacy Costello & Admatzky]. Recent research has found that chemotactic assays can be used to study the effect of silver nanoparticles and ions on cells. [de Lacy Costello & Admatzky]. In the future, physarum, having characteristics of a single cell, could also be used to study the ways in which cells react to cancerous cells. This could lead to a greater understanding of the multiplication of cancerous cells and help find a cure. Or other diseases that are effected by the attraction between cell and substance.
