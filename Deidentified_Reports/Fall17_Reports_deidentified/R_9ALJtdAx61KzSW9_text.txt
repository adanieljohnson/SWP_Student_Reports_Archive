Title: Lanthanum chloride blocking calcium channels negatively impacted tetanus and caused muscle fatigue in the Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens.

Abstract:
We used the Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens to study the effects of Lanthanum chloride on the gastrocnemus muscle. This drug is a calcium channel blocker [Glusa: 1987]. We predicted that administering this drug would have a negative effect on tetany in the muscle. This was tested using three separate Ranna pipiens with each being tested before and after injection. Each gastrocnemus muscle was connected to a force transducer and shocked with pin electrodes. The frequency was increased until tetany was reached and the force recorded. Our results showed that Lanthanum Chloride lowered the frequency tetany was reached significently and it also lowered the force output of the muscle contractions for when tetany was reached. Overall, this study demonstrated how this drug, by blocking the Ca2+ channels, negatively impacts tetany. The muscle contractions reached tetany at much lower frequency of shocks than normal and the force output, much lower. Ultimately, this data supports our hypothesis.

Introduction:
Muscle tissue is made of myofibrils which in conjunction with connective tissue function as the skeletal muscle network in both vertebrates and invertebrates [Johnson: 2016]. Motor neurons controlll the behavior of muscle tissue with their ell bodies making up the spinal cord grey matter and their axons reading the tissue [Johnson: 2016]. ACH is released in the neuro muscular junction causing Na+ channels to open which in turn releases Ca2+ [Johnson: 2016]. Thus, myosin and actin interact to contract [Johnson: 2016]. We will be using the gastrocnemus leg muscle of the Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens, which is triggered by the sciatic nerve which resides in the upper thigh [Johnson: 2016]. We will see what effect 1 mM of Lanthanum Chloride has on twitch amplitude. It is clear that this drug has strong effects on neurological behaviors from many studies [Yang 2013]. Lanthanum Chloride is a Ca2+ channel blocker [Glusa: 1987]. We predict that this drug will have a negative effect on tetany in the gastrocnemus muscle. A paired t test will be used in the analysis of our data. [Johnson: 2016] This test will show if our data supports our alternate hypothesis or not based on a comparison of our two treatment types.

Materials and Method:
1)	Obtain three Northern Leopard Frog Rania pipiens legs.
2)	Whenever the legs are not moist, wet them with Ringer’s solution.
3)	With one of the legs:
a.	Peel the skin off gently starting at the upper thigh and moving down. Use bio wipes when needed.
b.	Use the scissors to separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the rest of the leg at the Achilles tendon so that the other end is the only part that remains attached.
c.	Tie a string to the Achilles tendon creating a loop about 4 cm long.
d.	Hang the leg from the force transducer so that the leg rests on the ground and there is a small amount of tension on the string. 
e.	Use two pins per bone to pin the leg in place.
f.	Insert the pin electrodes into the gastrocnemus muscle and attach them to input one.
4)	Set the amplitude to the lowest possible value that still gives strong contractions.
5)	Set the frequency to 2 Hz, pule to 0, and width to 5 ms.
6)	Record for five seconds.
7)	Measure the voltage of the largest peak.
8)	Repeat steps 5 – 7 with frequencies of 4 Hz, 5Hz, 25Hz, 50Hz, and 100Hz until tetany is achieved.
9)	Record the voltage output at tetany.
10)	Inject the leg with 2Ml lanthanum chloride using a syringe.
a.	Prepare lanthanum chloride by dissolving 12 mg in 100 Ml Ringer’s solution.
11)	Repeat steps 5 - 9 with the injected leg.
12)	Dispose of leg properly.
13)	Repeat steps 3 - 12 for the remaining two frog legs.
14)	A paired t test will be used to analyze the results.


Results:
From figure one, we can compare frequency tetany was reached at. The controlll groups all reached tetany around 10 Hz. Once injected with Lanthanum Chloride, the force output dropped. Tetany was very close to being reached at 2 Hz and was achieved by 4Hz except for frog three which achieved tetany at 5 Hz. The error bars show that the data across the three frogs are in accordance. It shows that there is a significent difference between treatment groups. The Lanthanum Chloride groups reached tetany at a much lower frequency than the controlll groups. 
Figure two compares the force of the contraction when tetany was reached. The error bars show that the difference in force is significent. The controlll group clearly had stronger contractions when tetany was reached.
	From our observations when performing the experiment, the performance of the gastrocnemus muscle after injection dropped significently. The response to stimulus was very clearly different.


Discussion:
From our results and observations, our alternate hypothesis that lanthanum chloride would negatively impact tetany in the gastrocnemus muscle was supported. Looking at the first graph, we can easily see the difference of when tetany was reached in each treatment group. The fact that after injection, tetany was reached at a much lower frequency shows that calcium is much more present outside of the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2016]. The second figure shows that the force of the contractions when tetany was reached was much lower. This data is very significent because there is a large difference in force of the contraction. This data shows that Lanthanum chloride blocked the calcium channels causing the calcium flow in and out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to decrease significently [Glusa: 1987]. Thus, Ca2+ remained bound to troponin [Johnson:: 2016]. Furthermore, when the muscles were shocked, the strength was much smaller due to the blocked channels. These two things explain why tetany was reached so early and why the force of contraction was much weaker. The remaining Ca2+ caused tetany to be reached earlier and the blocked channels caused the shock to be much less effective. One way this could be continued to be studied would be using a similar setup but by testing the strength of muscle contractions directly. Varying the strength of input shock and measuring the force output would determine the effect of Lanthanum Chloride specifically on muscle contraction strength rather than focusing on tetany. This would provide further insight into the effects of this drug.
