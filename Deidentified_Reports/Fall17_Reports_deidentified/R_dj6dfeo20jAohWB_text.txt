Title: Lower temperatures negatively affect photosynthetic activity compared to increased temperatures in Fragaria x ananassa 

Abstract:
	The process of photosynthesis is vital to plant function and many environmental factors can alter this process. One factor of increasing importance is environmental temperatures. This experiment attempted to determine how varying temperatures of chloroplasts in solution affects the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplast. It was hypothesized that since metabolic activity increases with greater temperatures providing greater energy, the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts would increase with an increase in temperature. To test this, solutions of chloroplasts and color changing electron acceptors were placed in varying temperatures, on ice, in room temperature, and in a heated water bath and the respective absorbance overtime was measured of each. This data was then compared and the results found supported the proposed hypothesis and the sample in the increased temperature had greater photosynthetic temperature compared to the sample in the lower temperature. This comparison was found to be statistically significant. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a vital process in the chloroplasts of plants that allows plants to take in and store energy for the plant to use to live [Johnson: 2016]. Because photosynthesis is such an important part of plant life and plants are such a vital part of human life, it is a high priority to study photosynthesis and how different environmental factors affect photosynthesis. Specifically, with global climate expected to rise in the coming years, it is of utmost importance to determine the effects of such a vital part of plant life as photosynthesis in varying temperatures [Yamaguchi: 2016]. 
There are several different techniques in determining photosynthetic activity. One technique is to extract chloroplasts from leaves of a plant, and look at the amount of electron transport that occurs in the Hill reaction component of photosynthesis. To do this, an electron acceptor that exhibits color prior to accepting an electron and exhibits the absence of color after an electron has been accepted such as DCPIP which is blue before accepting and clear after accepting an electron can be used. Then the absorbance of the solution with the photosynthetic activity can be found and with a greater absorbance (more color in the solution is absorbing the light) less photosynthetic activity has occurred [Johnson:2016]. 
To use this mechanism to determine the effects of varying temperatures on photosynthesis, three experimental groups of three Fragaria x ananassa (chandler strawberry) leaves each had their chloroplasts, the major component of photosynthesis in the plant, extracted and put into solution and kept at varying temperatures. The photosynthetic activity was then determined in each sample by the resulting level of absorbance overtime of the solution. It was hypothesized that since metabolic activity increased with greater temperatures and thus more energy, photosynthetic rates will increase with an increase in temperature. Furthermore, other experimentation has shown that photosynthetic activity increases with an increase in temperature until an optimal temperature is reached and then photosynthetic activity decreases due to stomatal closures [Slot: 2017}. However, since this experiment removes the stomata from the process, photosynthetic activity will continue to increase with increasing temperatures without reaching a decrease. 



Materials and Methods:
A mortar and pestle, 150 mL size beaker, and three 50 mL centrifuge tubes were put into crushed ice to cool. The central veins from four strawberry leaves were removed and discarded and the remaining leaves were rinsed with tap water and blotted with a paper towel. The strawberry leaves and 10 mL of the cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) were added to the cold mortar and pestle and grinded into a paste without any chunks of leaf. Another 10 mL of the grinding buffer was added to the paste and the paste was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the cold beaker. 200 μl from the beaker into the microtube “A” and put on ice. The rest of the liquid in the beaker was put into the 50 mL centrifuge tube “A” and spun at 200 x G for three minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was poured out into the 50 mL centrifuge tube “B” without the solid. 200 μl from the 50 ml tube “B” was placed into the microtube “B” and put on ice. The 50 mL tube “B” was then centrifuged at 1,000x G for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was poured into a 50 mL tube “C” without the pellet and tube “B” was put on ice. Then 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and was stirred with a pipet. 200 microliters of this solution was examined under a microscope to ensure chloroplasts were present with little debris. 
Eight large test tubes and eight spectrophotometer tubes were labeled respective to Table 1 (0-15). The test tubes were added with solutions according to Table 1. 100 μl of the chloroplasts from the centrifuge tube “B” was added to every tube, and they were mixed immediately. The absorbances were measured of each tube at 600 nm in the respectively labeled cuvettes. Tubes 1-3 were then placed in a water bath set at 35 degrees C, tubes 4-6 were but in ice (0 degrees C), and the remaining tubes were kept at room temperature (22 degress C.) The absorbances were measured again in the same conditions after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes with the tubes staying in their respective temperature environments. The absprbances were then compared using an ANOVA statistical test comparing each set of absorbances of the different experimental groups of varying temperatures.



Results:
	The results from the ANOVA test show that only one comparison of importance showed to be statistically significant. This significant comparison was the absorbances of the samples in ice compared to the absorbances of the samples in the heated water bath (Figure 1). 


Discussion:
The resulting data somewhat supports the proposed hypothesis that an increase in temperature increases the photosynthetic activity. The statistically significant results from the ANOVA test shows that there was a significant difference in the absorbances from the colder sample and the heated sample. In Figure 1, it is slightly noticeable that the absorbance in both the room temperature sample and the heated sample was similar in that they both decreased overtime. The cooled sample showed to be inconsistent but over the absorbance did not change significantly which is comparable to the absorbance of the solution with the absence of chloroplast. This shows that with the increase in temperature the photosynthetic rate was greater than with a decrease in temperatures. However, there was not a statistically significant difference in the comparisons between any sample of chloroplasts (on ice, room temperature, or in a heated bath) and the absorbances of the sample with no chloroplasts present, the negative control of the experiment. This seems to show that none of the sample groups had significant photosynthesis activity. Therefore, although there showed to be a significant difference between the cold sample and the warmed sample and the warmed sample showed lower absorbances and more photosynthesis activity, the results seems to be misleading. 
	The result of the cold chloroplasts not showing photosynthetic activity can likely be attributed to the lower temperatures causing photoinhibition to limit photosynthesis [Mayoral: 2015]. However, the inconclusive results of not showing a significant difference in any sample and the sample with no chloroplast can likely be accredited to the rate of photosynthesis changing in varying temperatures is due to changes in chloroplasts opening and closing [Yamaguchi: 2016] Plants respond to changing environments including varying temperatures by opening and closing their stomata to allow more or less chemicals for photosynthesis in or out [Mittler: 2016]. This is why the varying temperatures in this experiment did not show to affect the photosynthesis activity because the stomatas were removed from the experiment and not able to affect the photosynthesis. Therefore, to accurately determine how temperature affects energy production in plants, it would be beneficial to measure it in the whole plant not just the chloroplasts.
