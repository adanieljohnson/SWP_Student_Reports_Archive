Title: Temperature decreases rate of photosynthesis in Brassica oleraca 

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to understand the effects of varying temperature on the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts from Brassica oleraca, commonly known as kale.  Plants exposed to various temperatures other than their optimal operating level have shown decreased photosynthetic activity.  In order to test temperature effects on kale, chloroplasts were isolated and then exposed to room temperature, cold temperature, and hot temperature for 30 minutes.  2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) was used as an electron acceptor to help monitor photosynthetic rates.  It was hypothesized that the chloroplasts exposed to extreme temperatures would exhibit lower rates of photosynthesis when compared to the chloroplasts left at room temperature. The results of the experiment do follow expected results because the chloroplasts left at room temperature showed the steadiest decrease of absorbance which indicated more of the DCPIP was readily reduced over 30 minutes.  This shows that photosynthesis was highest in the room temperature chloroplasts.  However, an ANOVA test was run that found a p_value of 0.483 and Fs of 0.773 which leaves the hypothesis unsupported.  The biological results of this experiment further understanding of global climate change on plants.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is understood to be an essential process that relies on external cofactors and is needed for plants, protists, and bacteria because it is the process by which these organisms store sun energy. This energy that is captured can then be used in other critical processes like glycolysis and respiration.  Both respiration and photosynthesis rely on reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions which ultimately lead to the transfer of electrons to an electron acceptor, thereby reducing the acceptor. An important electron acceptor in photosynthesis is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD+), but measuring the reduction of NAD+ is difficult, so there are other electron acceptors used to observe photosynthesis. The Hill reaction is used to explain the general transfer of electrons to a chosen electron acceptor with the presence of active chloroplasts and light. The chemical 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) is a known electron acceptor and has been utilized in various experiments that evaluate the system of photosynthesis (Noorudeen, 1982). When DCPIP receives an electron, and is reduced, it changes from a dark blue color to colorless. Reduction of DCPIP can be evaluated by a decreased absorbance at 600 nm, because oxidized DCPIP is known to absorb light maximally at 600 nm.  DCPIP was chosen to act as an electron acceptor in this lab so that photosynthetic rates could be evaluated for kale using the Hill reaction. Measuring absorbance over time intervals at different temperatures gives an idea of the reduction that occurred, which then communicates the amount of photosynthetic activity. Evaluating the effects of different temperatures on photosynthesis in kale chloroplasts is an important idea to explore due to the varying temperatures that are experienced as a result of global climate change.  Performing this experiment widen the knowledge of effects of volatile temperature on plants.  Previous experiments involving other plants, like tomatoes, showed that unusually hot and cold temperatures decreased the level of photosynthetic activity (Camejo, 2005). It was expected that if kale chloroplasts were exposed to temperatures higher or lower than room temperature then the rate of photosynthesis would be lower than in the chloroplasts left at room temperature because the optimal working levels were not met.

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, the chloroplasts from the kale leaves were isolated.  This was started by grinding 4 clean kale leaves with a cold mortar and pestle and 10 Ml of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine, which was denoted the grinding buffer.  Once the kale leaves were ground and there were no large chunks, an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was mixed into the kale that was ground.  This mixture was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker.    
The strained green liquid was spun at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm) in a centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4℃.  The supernatant from this tube was poured into a different chilled tube carefully so that no debris was transferred.  This new tube was centrifuged at 1,000 x G (1,000 times the force of gravity; 2800 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4℃, and the liquid from the second tube was then used throughout the experiment.    To induce both the cold and hot temperatures, five tubes were placed on an ice bath that was about 0℃ and five tubes were placed in a hot water bath that was about 50℃.  The controlll tubes and blank were kept out on the lab bench and exposed to room temperature.  
The blank was prepared so that it contained 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate, which was denoted as the Hill reaction buffer, and 100 Ml of chloroplasts. The remaining 15 tubes were prepared so that they contained 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 uM DCPIP solution, 2 Ml of the same Hill reaction buffer, and 100 Ml of chloroplasts. The absorbance of each tube at 600 nm was found at the beginning using a spectrophotometer. The blank and controlll tubes were placed in a rack on the lab bench, the cold temperature tubes were placed on an ice bath and the warm temperature tubes were placed in a rack in a hot water bath.  The absorbance for all tubes was found and recorded after 10 minute intervals for the next 30 minutes.  
A one-way ANOVA test was used to analyze if there was statistical significance between our groups exposed to differing temperatures.  A Tukey-Kramer test was also used to determine significance of results between the groups at different temperatures.


Results:
The data from this experiment shows that there was a decrease in absorbance for the controlll and cold tubes. (Figure 1) The percent change of absorbance over 30 minutes was high and positive for the controlll tubes, while the cold and hot tubes showed negative percent changes. (Table 1) Once an ANOVA test was run, the p_value of the results was found to be 0.483 with an Fs of 0.773. (Table 2) Additional results from a Tukey-Kramer test showed that the results between experimental groups were not significent. (Table 3)


Discussion:
The results from this experiment follow the expected pattern of a lower rate of photosynthesis for kale chloroplasts exposed to extreme temperatures than those left at room temperature, but the insignificent p_value of 0.483 indicates the results may be due to chance, and the hypothesis cannot be supported. The biological results that correlate with predicted photosynthetic activity could be explained by the fact that the chloroplasts were not operating in their typical environment and photosynthesis was hindered by the new and stressful temperature.  Though photosynthesis needs cofactors like sunlight, it could also be hurt by random conditions and factors around it. Similar experiments that examine other plant species have had almost identical results, which might suggest this is a common phenomenon across various plants. For instance, tomato plants introduced to heat stress of 45℃ have shown a significent decrease in photosynthetic activity when compared to plants left at 25℃.These results were also explained as the result of electron transport and redox reaction hindrance (Camejo, 2005).  Other studies have additionally shown that varying temperatures of plant chloroplasts can effect other components of the plant, such as phenology (Visser, 2005). 
This performed experiment showed that during the 30 minutes of experimentation, there was an overall high, positive average rate of change of absorbance for the chloroplasts kept at room temperature. (Figure 1) Since the rate of change was determined by subtracting the new absorbance from the previous absorbance measured and dividing this value by the previous absorbance, these results show that the absorbance was generally decreasing a consistent amount between time intervals. (Table 1) Experiments that have monitored photosynthetic activity in other plants have also used positive percent change of absorbance as an indication of increased photosynthesis (Kromkamp, 1998). This aligns with the predicted outcome that more DCPIP would be reduced at room temperature and the absorbance would consistently decrease when compared to the absorbance at cold and hot temperatures.  There was one test tube placed in the ice bath that showed relatively high absorbance, so this tube was not considered in later calculations. When measuring absorbance in the spectrophotometer, this particular tube showed fluctuating readings which not be totally reliable. Also, using tube’s absorbance to calculate the mean value for cold tubes raised the average about 10%, which makes it an outlier for our data. 
The ANOVA test evaluated the data as being not statistically significent because of the high p_value of 0.483.  (Table 2) A p_value higher than 0.05 was defined as being insignificent. Also, a Tukey-Kramer test showed that when the 3 temperature groups were compared, they were not significent.   (Table 3) 
Modification of this procedure could lead to more accurate results.  For instance, testing with the same hypothesis but increasing the number of replicates could yield extremely reliable data.  Additionally, testing with a greater array of temperatures would allow stronger conclusions to be made from the results. A future experiment might test the same hypothesis, but include 10 replicates per temperature and include 7 different temperatures instead of 3.  This is a useful experiment to perform because it can help farmers understand the optimal growing conditions for crops, and it also serves as a model for the effects of global climate change on the environment. Global climate change is an important issue that requires further studying in order to fully understand its effects (Davison, 1991). Experiments such as this one contribute to a better conceptualization of the harm of global climate change on photosynthetic rate of plants.
