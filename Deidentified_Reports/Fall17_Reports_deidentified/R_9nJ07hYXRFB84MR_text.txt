Title: The Effects of Caffeine on the Gastrocnemius Muscle Contractions of the Rana pipens

Abstract:
The point where motor neurons connect to myofibers is called the neuromuscular junction. When nerves send an impulse, the neuromuscular junction activates to release acetylcholine (Ach). Ach binds with its receptor allowing sodium to flood into the nerve, generating an action potential causing the calcium to be released and the muscle fiber to contract. [Johnson: 2017]. This experiment will directly stimulate three frogs’ gastrocnemius muscle through a computer stimulate then inject 200mM of caffeine into the severed frogs’ legs to compare the results. Caffeine has shown to cause a release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by acting on the sarcolemma [Thorpe, Seeman: 1971]. Therefore, if 200 mM of caffeine is presented into a frog leg, then the normal release of calcium will increase causing stronger contractions. The null hypothesis is if 200 mM of caffeine is presented into the frog leg, then it will not influence the intensity of the muscle contractions. The results expressed a significant increase in voltage contraction when caffeine was introduced into the gastrocnemius muscle, therefore, expressing higher calcium contents released, supporting the alternative hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Myofibers are clusters of cylindrical and multi-nuclear cells which are held together by connective tissue to form the skeletal muscles. The skeletal muscle has motor neurons whose cell body begins in the gray matter in the spinal cord. These motor neuron axons extend into a muscle and connect to myofibers. The point where the myofibers connect is called the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junctions are activated to release acetylcholine (Ach) when nerves send an impulse. Ach binds with its receptor allowing sodium to flood into the nerve. This generates an action potential. Once the action potential is sent down the axon, calcium is released, triggering the muscle fiber to contract [Johnson: 2017].
	In “The Site of Action of Caffeine and Procaine in Skeletal Muscle,” Caffeine has been shown to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by acting upon the sarcolemma to release calcium [Thorpe, Seeman: 1971]. By inputting caffeine into the muscle, it will stimulate the release of calcium. Therefore, it will trigger the muscle fibers to contract. 
In this experiment I will directly stimulate three Rana pipens’ gastrocnemius muscle (calf muscle) through a computer simulator then injecting 200mM of caffeine into the severed frogs’ legs to compare the results. This species was selected due to their strength in there hindlimbs normally used for jumping. Because the muscle is typically used, it would facilitate viewing and recording more dynamic muscle contractions. The independent variable would be the presence and lack of caffeine while the dependent variable would be the amplitudes from the muscle contractions. If 200 mM of caffeine is presented into a frog leg, then the normal release of calcium will increase causing stronger contractions. The null hypothesis is if 200 mM of caffeine is presented into the frog leg, then it will not influence the intensity of the muscle contractions.

Materials and Methods:
1.	 Place 3 severed frog leg on a dissecting pan.
2.	Peal the skin down towards the food with gloved hands or forceps.
3.	Moisten the leg with frog Ringer’s Solution.
4.	With a pair of scissors gently slide them into a hole found in the back of the heel under the gastrocnemius muscle. Gently slide the scissors forward and back towards the knee to partially separate the gastrocnemius muscle from the bone. Make sure that the muscle is still connected to the back of the knee. Cut the tendon that connected the gastrocnemius muscle to the back of the heel.
5.	Cut around 20cm of string. Fold the string in half and make a tight double knot with string around the tip of the tendon that was connected to the back of the heel. Tie the loop of the string onto the hooks of the force transducer on the ring stand.  
6.	Place the red and black wire, one above the other, with some space in between, onto the hanging gastrocnemius muscle. 
7.	Stimulate the gastrocnemius with 5 pulses at 1 Hz, pulse width to 1, the voltage 1
8.	Inject the gastrocnemius with 200mM of caffeine
9.	Repeat with two other frog legs


Results:
Fig. 1. Average voltage value for 5 pulses on three frog legs without (control) and with caffeine. The error bars represent the standard deviation for the average voltage values of the control and with caffeine. 

The injected caffeine into the muscle created a significantly higher contraction voltage than the control's results. The paired t-test gave a P value of 4.72 X 10^-7, expressing the significant change. 

Discussion:
The trend from the results expresses that there was a significant increase in voltage when caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemius of the Rana pipens. The calculated paired t-test value gave a P value of 4.72 X 10-7, therefore, there was an extremely low possibility that the results collected were simply by chance, highlighting their significance. The increase in voltage contraction occurred because it released significantly more calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as expressed though Thorpe and Seeman’s work, in comparison to the normal release of calcium. Hence, because there was a significant increase in contraction voltage with the introduction to caffeine, the alternative hypothesis was supported. However, for further study, because each leg did have a slight variation in contraction voltage to the 200mM of caffeine, one should increase the number of frog legs tested and use different concentrations of caffeine to compare results.
