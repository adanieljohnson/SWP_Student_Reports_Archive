Title: The negative effect of social stress on the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp.

Abstract:
By introducing a large Procambris sp. crayfish to a small Procambris sp. crayfish in a close proximity environment, the crayfish will experience social stress. The small crayfish will be placed in a dO2 chamber, and the chamber placed in a pan containing the larger aggressor crayfish. Specific metabolic rate, which can be indirectly measured by dO2 concentration, would be influenced because the small crayfish would want to try to fight or escape from the large crayfish, and expend energy. With this in mind, we hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate of the small crayfish would be higher when exposed to an aggressor than when it was not. However, upon conclusion of the experiment, it was found that on average, the specific metabolic rate was lower for the treatment group (with aggressor) than the controlll group (without aggressor). This did not support our hypothesis, and a paired t_test showed that our data was not significent, p=0.1738.


Introduction:
Autotrophs and heterotrophs alike both utilize similar enzymes to convert high energy ATP molecules into lower energy ones, while capturing the released energy with ATP molecules. Metabolism is the word used to describe this process of capturing, converting, and transferring of energy within cells or an organism. Metabolic rate is the numerical value of the energy being expended by physiological processes at any given time. It would be a difficult task to measure ATP synthesis or consumption directly
to measure the metabolic rate of an organism, but the rate can be indirectly measured via O2 consumption. This can help calculate the energy production and use by organisms. This works because metabolic processes are aerobic, requiring oxygen. Therefore, the amount of oxygen consumed by an organism is directly proportional to the amount of energy produced by the same organism. The specific metabolic rate will be calculated using the following equation, which relates the change in O2 concentration in the water inside the chamber with the volume of that water, the time which the crayfish was in the chamber, and the weight of the crayfish.
Specific Metabolic Rate = [ΔO2(mg/L) * volume H2O (L)] / Time (min.) * weight (g)       

	This week, we will be testing the specific metabolic rate of a small Procambris sp. crayfish using a dissolved oxygen probe (dO2), and how the addition of an antagonist Procambris sp. affects the rate of the smaller crayfish. The specific metabolic rate should be influenced, as the small crayfish will attempt to fight or flee from the aggressor, which will expend energy. We are using the Procambris sp. because they are easy to keep alive in our lab environment, are low maintenance and will eat whatever they are given. An experiment, “The effect of social stress on the Standard Metabolic Rate (SMR) of brown trout, Salmo trutta” (Sloman: 2000), found that the metabolic rate of an antagonized, submissive brown trout was increased when introduced to a more dominant brown trout in its own environment. With this in mind, we hypothesize that if a small crayfish is aggravated by a larger, antagnostic crayfish, then the specific metabolic rate of the smaller crayfish will increase due to social stress.


Materials and Method:
Fill a screw top testing chamber to the point of overflow with room temperature water (~25℃) that has been saturated with air. Weigh crayfish #1, place chamber full of water into a plastic pan half full of room temperature water. Place crayfish #1 into chamber. Screw dO2 probe to the top of chamber. Stabilize the dO2 reading of the equipment. Record initial dO2, then take dO2 readings at 5 minute intervals for 20 minutes: 5, 10, 15, 20. After 20 minutes, record final dO2 reading, and add the antagonizing crayfish into the plastic pan of water, outside of the chamber. Take a new initial dO2 reading. Record reading at 5 minute intervals again for 20 minutes with the antagonizing crayfish in the pan. Take final dO2 reading after 20 minutes. Take out both crayfish, and measure the volume of water from the chamber with a graduated cylinder. Repeat with crayfish #2 and #3.

A paired t_test will be used to determine if the data is statistically significent or not.


Results:
 The average metabolic rate for the treatment group (aggressed) was 0.000233 ± 0.0000652, and for the controlll group 0.000657± 0.000259. Both treatment and controlll were tested on the same three Procambris sp., controlll first. Both groups were subjected to 20 minutes of exposure within the dO2 chamber, metabolic rates calculated, and averaged for the three trials. During testing, we found that the “aggressor crayfish” was more interested in hiding in the corner of the pan that it was placed in, rather than interacting with the small crayfish in the dO2 chamber. Figure 1 shows that overall, the average metabolic rate for the three trials was greater for the controlll group than the treatment group. Each trial supported this data. 


Discussion:
The data from our experiment refutes our hypothesis, that the aggressed crayfish would have a higher specific metabolic rate than the non-aggressed crayfish, and the statistical test showed that our data was not significent. This is seen in the p_value from a paired t_test: 0.1738. The results showed that the unstressed crayfish (controlll), had a higher average specific metabolic rate than the aggressed (treatment) crayfish. Our results likely stem from the lack of aggression displayed by the “aggressor” crayfish. When placed in the pan, the aggressor crayfish was scared and backed into a corner, staying far away from the small crayfish in the dO2 chamber in the middle of the pan. Because the paired t_test that we ran proved that our results were not significent, with a p_value of  0.1738, we cannot reject our null hypothesis that the specific metabolic rate is not affected by the introduction of an aggressor crayfish.
The aggressor crayfish that we used was only slightly larger than the small crayfish that were placed in the dO2 chamber, and that may have led to skewed results. If we had a greater population of crayfish to choose from, it may have been helpful to have a significently larger crayfish as the aggressor, as it would assume the role of the dominant organism in the pan. Also, if the pan had been smaller, it would have forced the two crayfish to interact more than in our experiment, as the aggressor crayfish was able to distance itself from the chamber. An increase in the sample size of our experiment would help to better establish trends in our data, as well.
For future experimentation, it would be interesting to test other organisms that are more aggressive towards each other such as tigers, dogs, etc. This would allow us to see how varied levels of aggression affect specific metabolic rate. Another possible test would be to investigate the amount of calories that are burned by an organism when experiencing social stress. This can be useful to humans in determining how many calories they need to consume to replace lost energy after a stressful event.
