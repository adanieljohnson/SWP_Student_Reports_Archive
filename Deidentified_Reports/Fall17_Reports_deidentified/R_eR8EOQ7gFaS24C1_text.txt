Title: The Effect of Herbicides on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinach Plants 

Abstract:
Our group originally hypothesized that plants receiving herbicide that acts on photosystem II, rather than photosystem I would exhibit the most photoinhibition because photosystems II is the first reaction to occur in photosynthesis. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment on spinach due to their broad leaves that allow for easy chloroplast extraction. We used three different herbicides, paraquat and diquat which act on photosystem I and atrazine which acts on photosystem II. We measured the absorbance of chloroplasts with the herbicides in order to measure levels of photosynthetic activity, as the absorbance is inversely related to photosynthetic activity. Paraquat had the most photosynthetic activity, then atrazine, and diquat had the least amount of photosynthetic activity, meaning it was the most successful herbicide. However, our t_test comparing the absorbance of atrazine and paraquat were deemed statistically insignificent so we cannot confirm nor deny the hypothesis. Future experiments might include different plant species or last for a longer duration.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is able to create energy for plants by using light to drive reactions that create a proton gradient-powered ATP synthesis. These reactions are divided into two systems, photosystem I and photosystem II. First, in photosystems II light energy causes electrons to move from chlorophyll to plastiquinone, creating oxidized chlorophyll. This oxidized chlorophyll cleaves water to produce oxygen gas, while creating a proton gradient that drives the electron current. The second reaction, photosystem I excites the electrons again, which then leave the chlorophyll as NADPH. Photosystem II is the vital reaction in photosynthesis, as it is the first part of the reaction sequence, and without it photosystems I cannot occur. 
	If photosystem II is the more vital part of photosynthesis, then herbicides that affect photosystem II in plants will inhibit photosynthesis more than herbicides that affect photosystems I. A broad-leafed plant, such as Spinacia Oleracea, contains lots of chloroplasts, making it easier for extraction of the chloroplasts. The chloroplasts are necessary in order to indicate photosynthetic activity. We expect to see the more photoinhibition on spinach plants that receive Atrazine, an herbicide that acts on photosystem II, than spinach plants that receive diquat or paraquat, herbicides that act on photosystem I. 


Materials and Method:
We began the procedure by removing the large central veins from four medium-sized spinach leaves. We then grinded the spinach with the grinding buffer, in order to make a spinach slurry until no spinach chunks were present. We strained this liquid over cheesecloth into a centrifuge tube, setting aside a small amount of the filtered liquid. The centrifuge tube was then centrifuged for three minutes at 4ºC. After it was centrifuged once, a small amount was removed and the sample was centrifuged two more times for 10 minutes each time. After the final centrifuge was done, the supernatant was poured out carefully in order to keep the pellet undisturbed. The grinding buffer was then added to the pellet and stirred to re-suspend the pellet. We then labeled 12 test tubes: one blank, one positive controlll, one negative controlll, three replicates for the diquat herbicide, three replicates for the paraquat herbicide, and three replicates for the atrazine herbicide. All of the tubes received 5 Ml of water. Then all of the tubes, excluding the blank received 100 µl of chloroplast. The 9 herbicide tubes received 2 Ml of diquat, paraquat, and atrazine for the respective experimental group. Then all of the tubes, excluding the blank and positive controlll received 2 Ml DCPIP. All of the tubes then received 2 Ml of Hill’s Reaction buffer and the absorbance was measured immediately at time zero. The absorbance was then measured again at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. All of the samples were kept under light throughout the experiment, except for the negative controlll which was kept in a dark cabinet in between absorbance measurements. We then ran an unpaired t_test to determine statistical significance because nothing was manipulated over the time when the absorbance was measured. However, it was necessary to run multiple t_tests because there were three kinds of herbicides, and t_tests are designed for 2 variable groups.


Results:
Atrazine had an average absorbance of 0.564, 0.555, 0.551, and 0.547 at time zero, at 10 minutes, at 20 minutes, and at 30 minutes respectively. Diquat had an average absorbance of 0.640, 0.574, 0.591, and 0.582 at time zero, at 10 minutes, at 20 minutes, and at 30 minutes respectively. Paraquat had an average absorbance of 0.572, 0.541, 0.525, and 0.526 at time zero, at 10 minutes, at 20 minutes, and at 30 minutes respectively. When comparing atrazine and diquat, there was a statistically significent difference in average absorbance (p = 0.0031, α = 0.05). When comparing atrazine and paraquat, there was no statistically significent difference in average absorbance (p = 0.2950, α= 0.05).


Discussion:
Figure 1 shows that diquat has the highest average absorbance over time out of the experimental groups. This indicates that it has the lowest photosynthetic activity, because if there is a higher absorbance, then DCPIP was reduced by less electrons. This would indicate that diquat was the most effective herbicide and had the most photoinhibition. However, given that the unpaired t_test shows a statistically significent difference between the average absorbance of atrazine and diquat but no statistically significent difference between the average absorbance of atrazine and paraquat, it is hard to confirm or deny the hypothesis. The lack of statistically significance in the paraquat group could indicate an error in the Paraquat replicates but this is unsure. 

According to the Pesticide Information Offices at Cornell University, diquat is a very fast-acting herbicide. This could perhaps indicate that Diquat had simply had the faster photoinhibiting effects than the other two herbicides. Additionally, a 1993 study by Amsellum found that many plant species have developed a resistance to paraquat due to its widespread commercial use. This could perhaps explain why paraquat had the least amount of photoinhibition among the herbicide experimental groups. Future studies could observe herbicide effects over a longer amount of time in order to determine if the results were due to the fast-acting nature of diquat. Other future studies could use different species of plants, to see if the results were specific to spinach.
