Title: The Effect of Salinity on Photosynthetic Rate of Spinach Leaves

Abstract:
Condensed chlorophyll from spinach leaves was used in this lab to determine how salinity affects the rate of photosynthesis. NaCl is an ionic compound, and its dissociation in water both causes water molecules to cluster around the charged ions and affects the ionic concentrations in solutions. It was hypothesized that the rate of photosynthesis would be slowed in the presence of high salinity due to these properties. Three solutions were tested: one with only the condensed chlorophyll, one with 0.25M NaCl, and a third with 0.5M NaCl. The solutions were allowed to sit and react for three increments of 10 minutes, after each of which the absorbance was measured in a spectrometer. The data was compiled after each measurement, and a total percentage of change of absorbance was calculated for each solution. The controlll solution showed a change percentage of 20.23%, the 0.25M NaCl solution had a change of 27.32, and the 0.5M NaCl solution had a change of 28.58%. These values were run through an ANOVA t_test to determine if the results were statistically significent, with a p_value of 0.922. This result indicated that no amount of added salinity to the solutions of condensed chloroplast and grinding solution had any significent effect on their photosynthetic rates. 


Introduction:
This lab was used to determine the effect of various levels of salinity on the rate of photosynthetic reduction of prepared enriched chloroplast solution from spinach leaves. The Hill reaction will be used to measure this effect, and is written as follows:  2 H2O + 2A (+light)  2AH2 + O2 where A represents the electron acceptor, in this case DCPIP [Johnson, AD.,2017]. Plants use photosynthesis to capture energy from light and convert it into chemical energy that can be used to do work within the systems of the organism. Photons of light hit the chlorophyll pigments in photosystem 2, exciting their electrons. The electron excitation is passed from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until they reach the reaction center, where an electron on a special pair of chlorophyll pigments is excited. This electron is passed to a neighboring atom, NADH, and it enters the electron transport chain. It travels down the chain through the three complexes, its movement providing energy used to export protons out of the cell membrane. This generates a proton gradient, which is harnessed by ATP synthase to synthesize ATP. [Alberts, B. 2004] The Hill reaction will measure the rate of this electron transfer, representative of the efficiency of the reaction. During photosynthesis, NADP+  is reduced in the electron transport chain. DCPIP is another electron acceptor, which will also be reduced as photosynthesis is carried out and is easier to measure through absorbances than NADP+. When DCPIP is oxidized, it has a dark blue hue that absorbs at 600 nm. When it is reduced, it is colorless; this property allows for the measurement of the decrease in absorbance as it is reduced in a spectrometer. DCPIP is added to the solution of chlorophyll, and by using this substance, the rate of photosynthesis of the chlorophyll solutions can be monitored. An experiment was done by Waldon and Terry similarly studied the effects of salinity on plant leaf growth, and how plants evolve to be salt resistant. In their experiment, it was determined that increasing levels of salinity impede and even halt plant growth. [Terry & Waldron, 1984] Photosynthesis is a delicate process completely dependent on charge gradients and water cleavage. The presence of salt in this system would disrupt the ability of the chloroplast to maintain the desired proton gradient across its membrane, and would also lower the amount of water available. This effect was demonstrated in a study done by Pinheiro, Flexus, and Chaves in 2009. The experiment put O. Sativa and Arabidopsis plants under stress of high soil salinity, and observed that the plants exhibited immediate signs of stress reflected in their protein channel activity. It was also observed that the turgor pressure in the stomata cells was lost due to reduced water availability, resulting in closed stomata and inability to take in CO2. [Chaves, M., Flexus, J., & Pinheiro, C. 2009] It is hypothesized for the experiment to be conducted that the rate of photosynthesis will be less efficient (slower), or be comparatively similar with a sudden drop in rate, in the presence of high salinity.


Materials and Method:
Three centrifuge vials, and a mortar and pestle are placed on ice to cool. The veins from 4-5 large spinach leaves are removed and discarded, and the rinsed leaves are placed in the mortar to be ground into a paste with basic 10 Ml grinding solution, consisting of 400 mM sucrose in a Tricine buffer. Using a cheesecloth and 10 additional Ml of grinding solution, the chlorophyll solution is strained into a large, beaker (previously placed on ice) to be transferred to a 50 Ml vial and centrifuged at 200x6: 1200 RPM for 3 minutes. After it is centrifuged, the solution is put into another 50 Ml vial, and the pellet of debris left at the bottom is discarded. The liquid solution in the new vial is centrifuged again at 1000x6: 2800 RPM for 10 minutes. [Johnson, AD.,2017] The liquid portion of this twice-centrifuged solution is removed and placed on ice, and 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP is added to each of three solutions created to complete the rest of the experiment. The three solutions of the centrifuged chlorophyll/grinding solution/DCPIP mix are then prepared to test in the spectrometer: one with 100 microliters of condensed chloroplast solution, 6 Ml distilled water, 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate reaction buffer, and 2 Ml of 0.5 M aqueous NaCl, a second with 100 microliters of condensed chloroplast solution, 6 Ml distilled water, 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate reaction buffer, and 2 Ml of 0.25 M aqueous NaCl, and a third with only 100 microliters of condensed chloroplast solution, 6 Ml distilled water, and 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate reaction buffer. The solutions are allowed to sit for 10 minutes before a small amount from each is transferred to a cubette and measured in the spectrometer. This process is repeated twice, letting the solutions sit for another 10 minutes each time. The date from the measurements is recorded in a table, and an ANOVA test is performed to determine statistical significance. 


Results:
The p value for the data when tested with an ANOVA test was 0.922. The final percent change of absorbances for the controlll group was 11.39%, for the solution with 0.25M NaCl was 21.24%, and for the solution with 0.5M NaCl was 28.58%.These results do indicate a trend of a decrease in photosynthetic activity based on the change in absorbance of the DCPIP, observed for all three solutions tested. The 0.5M NaCl solution showed the greatest decrease in activity over the 30 minutes observed. 


Discussion:
When an ANOVA test was performed on the data collected from the spectrometer, the results were found to be not statistically significent. The results seem to support the first proposition of the alternate hypothesis, that the highest concentration of NaCl in the solution would slow the rate of photosynthesis in the chlorophyll pigments the most. However, these values do not vary enough to report a conclusive result. To improve this experiment, a higher concentration of NaCl solution may be used, and possibly in a greater amount. A study of cotton plant growth when stressed with salinity was done to determine its capacity for survival in varied conditions. The experimenters used solutions of 0%, 26%, and 55% salinity to conduct their test on the cotton plant growth, showing drastic decrease in growth of the plants by 83% in 55% salinity. [Brugnoli, E., & Björkman, O., 1992] The results of this lab were conclusive, showing that a greater percentage of salinity in solution produces viable and significent results. It may be beneficial in future experiments to also span a greater length of time when measuring absorbances, to acquire more data to be compared.

Figure Legends: 
1. This graph is a representation of the data collected from the spectrometer. The data indicates that the absorbance decreased the most for the solution with the highest concentration of NaCl, the 0.5M NaCl solution. This trend indicates that the highest amount of salinity had the greatest inhibitory effect on photosynthesis of the chlorophylls of this solution. 
2.This is the ANOVA test performed on the data collected. The p value came out to be 0.922, which is not considered to be significently significent.
