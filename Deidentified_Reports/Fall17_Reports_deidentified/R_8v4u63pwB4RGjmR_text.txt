Title: Effects of Lidocaine Injection on Neuromuscular Control on the Sciatic Nerve and Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog’s Leg

Abstract:
Muscle Response to an electric stimulus was assessed following injections of lidocaine to the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle of a frog’s leg. Three frog legs were analyzed, and each leg was used as its own controlll group. The controlll group was the stimulation of the leg without lidocaine, and the treatment group was using the same frog leg and stimulating the leg with .1 Ml of lidocaine. Each leg was stimulated 5 times without lidocaine (pre-injection) and then five times with lidocaine injection (post-injection). When .1 Ml of lidocaine was infused into the leg surrounding the sciatic nerve, the amplitude of the response voltage, which is shown through a myogram, decreased which shows that the muscle response decreased. The pre-injected frog muscle showed a stronger muscle contraction than the post-injected frog muscle under the same conditions and stimulus. In addition, the minimum amount of voltage required to cause the muscle to twitch was greater for the post-injected leg than the pre-injected leg. Therefore, lidocaine injected into the frog’s sciatic nerve blocked important sodium channels that decreased the action potential fired which then decreased the release of Calcium that activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle.

Introduction:
In this lab, we will look at the effects of lidocaine injection on neuromuscular controlll by using a nerve and muscle preparation from a frog leg. Thousands of myofibers form skeletal muscles which are innervated by motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses arrive at neuromuscular junctions and release Acetylcholine (Ach) which then causes sodium channels to open and generate action potentials. This spread of action potential causes the release of Calcium, which contracts the muscle fiber. We will look at how lidocaine in the muscle cell of a frog leg disrupts the activity of the ion channels resulting in a disruption of the stimulus response. A similar study by Cedric R. Bainton (1994) showed the effects of lidocaine injection in a frog’s sciatic nerve leading to long-lasting ion block. After injecting the nerve with lidocaine in various concentrations, the study recorded the compound action potential in response to a maximal contraction stimulus. The study’s results showed that lidocaine causes a nonreversible block by disrupting sodium channels which then decreases action potentials traveling through the muscle fiber. Lidocaine caused a nonreversible degradation in compound action potential in the stimulated frog sciatic nerve. The study done by Jeffrey S. Kroin (1986) focused on the effects of repeated lidocaine injections in a rat tibia nerve over a three-day span with various concentrations of lidocaine. This study showed that the lidocaine caused the biggest effect when injected with higher concentrations surrounding the sciatic nerve. In our experiment, we will dissect the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle of the frog’s leg to compare how the muscle twitches without lidocaine injection and with lidocaine injection. A myogram will record the amount of force generated in the muscle over a given time. We will have three frog legs, and each leg will act as its own controlll group. We will first record the threshold voltage, which is the minimum value the membrane potential must reach in order to create an action potential, of a single pulse. Then we will record the response amplitude to five pulses of stimulus of the pre-injected frog leg. Then, we will inject the nerve with .1 Ml of lidocaine, wait five minutes, and repeat the same process. The same stimulus amplitude will be used on each treatment in order to compare the muscle responses. The null hypothesis is that the injection of .1 Ml lidocaine into the frog nerve will cause no change in the response amplitude as compared to the pre-injected amplitude. Our alternative hypothesis states that the injection of .1 Ml lidocaine into the frog nerve will cause a decrease in the response amplitude as compared to the pre-injected amplitude. The dependent variable is the muscle responses to the stimulus, and the independent variable is the pre-injected frog leg and the post-injected frog leg containing .1 Ml of lidocaine.

Materials and Method:
First, we will be given three frog legs that will each be their own controlll group. We will dissect the Gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of the three frog legs by using Ringer’s solution, a dissecting probe, and a needle. We will remove the skin from the hip down to expose the sciatic nerve that runs deep beneath the muscle in the thigh and supplies the gastrocnemus muscle. We will need to isolate the Sciatic nerve by separating the muscles of the thigh and then separating the tendinous white nerve from the blood vessel. We will attach the sciatic nerve to the transducer prongs underneath the nerve. To isolate the Gastrocnemius muscle, we need to free it from the surrounding fascia and cut the gastrocnemus muscle at the distal end to it can be attached and elect a response. To attach the muscle to the transducer, we will pin the knee in place on both anterior sides. We will then lay the string from the muscle over the transducer hook and pull the string so there is little tension. We will position the muscle so the thread is vertical, and then knot the string to ensure firm hold when stimulating the muscle. Finally, we will moisten the frog with Ringers solution, adjust the ring stand height so the connection between the muscle and transducer is pretty taut, and then insert the electrode probes into the muscle. All of the responses will be recorded from the LabScribe app on the computer that is connected to the IWORX box. We will repeat these preparation steps with all three legs. For stimulation, we will first determine the threshold voltage of the pre-injected leg by increasing the voltage in small increments until we see a response. Then we will find the maximal contraction voltage, which will be the leg stimulus with the largest peak/amplitude. After finding the pre-injected leg’s maximal contraction voltage, we will stimulate the leg five times at that voltage and then record each myogram’s amplitude. Next, we will inject the same leg with .1 Ml of Lidocaine and wait five minutes before stimulation. We will repeat the same process as the pre-injected leg to find the post-injection threshold and 5-stimulus myogram amplitude. We will repeat this pre-injection and post-injection stimulation on the other two legs. The statistical tests used to compare each leg’s pre-injection 5 stimulus amplitudes to the post-injection 5-stimulus amplitude will be a paired t_test. 

Results:
All three frog legs responded to the 5 repeated stimuli and contracted without lidocaine injection and with lidocaine injection. The minimum amount of voltage required to cause the muscle to twitch was greater for the post-injected leg than the pre-injected leg in all three frog legs. When .1 Ml of lidocaine was infused into the leg surrounding the sciatic nerve, the amplitude of the response voltage, which is shown through a myogram, decreased; therefore, the muscle showed a decreased contraction response. The pre-injected frog muscle showed a stronger muscle contraction than the post-injected frog muscle under the same conditions and stimulus. 
Figure 1. Effect of lidocaine injection on the muscle stimulus. No Injection (blue bar) show normal muscle response to stimulus. Lidocaine injected muscle (grey bar) cause a decrease in the firing rate of action potential which in then decreases the muscle stimulus. Three frog legs were used and used as their own controlll group, and stimulated under the same conditions five times in a row causing muscle contractions. The stimulus response was recorded by a myogram in the IWorx TA Box connected to a computer. Each bar is mean stimulus amplitude of three frog legs from each treatment or controlll group; error bars are ± .1228 s.d. for the pre-injection leg and ± .095 s.d. for the post-injection leg.Overall, the pre-injected leg showed a greater average responsive stimulus amplitude than the average post-injected leg responsive stimulus amplitude.

Discussion:
This data confirms the observation that injecting lidocaine into the frog’s sciatic nerve destroys the compound action potential and therefore decreases the muscle response to stimulation. In all three legs, the threshold voltage for the lidocaine injected leg was larger than the pre-injection threshold voltage. It must take a stronger stimulus with the lidocaine injection because the lidocaine must have altered the density of ion channels in the nerve fibers. This degradation of action potential arriving at the neuromuscular junction decreases the spread of action potential through the muscle fiber’s T-tubule system to cause a twitch, which is a minimum unit of contraction. Therefore, a higher stimulus is required for the same muscle injected with lidocaine to display a twitch. An experimental limitation includes each leg muscle responding differently to the stimulus due to how fast the leg fatigued out. Another limitation could be from potential nerve and muscle damage of the leg from the dissection. In the second exercise, the data and the myograms shows how the post-injection response stimulus decreases from the pre-injection response stimulus. The paired t_test for comparing the amplitude response of the pre-injection and .1 Ml lidocaine injection leg displays significent difference amongst the means. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis because the observed differences between the means (.4168-.3608) shows that pre-injection response had a greater average than the post-injection response (t_stat= 5.26, d.f.=14, P= 6.02E-5). This supports our alternative hypothesis that the lidocaine injected leg produces a lower muscle contraction and response than the pre-injected leg of the same stimulus. There is a decreases strength in contraction of the post-injected leg because the firing rate of the motor neuron to the muscle fiber decreases. This is because Lidocaine is known to block ion channels in the motor end plate by binding to the voltage-gated sodium channels; therefore, when an action potential arrives at the neuromuscular junction, not as many ion channels open because they are blocked. This then causes less ions, such as sodium, to flow into the membrane of the muscle fiber and down the T-tubule. This then decreases the amount of calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm surrounding the actin and myosin filaments that trigger muscle contraction. The study done by Jeffrey S. Kroin (1986) focused on the effects of repeated lidocaine injections over a three-day span. This study showed that when a high lidocaine concentration (4%) is injected into the nerve multiple times, the nerve lost its motor functions and about 25% of its own axons were destroyed. This shows that lidocaine is proven to be toxic while disrupting motor neurons and the contractile mechanism of the muscle. Another study by S. Kai (1993) in the Effects of Lidocaine on intracellular Calcium demonstrates the relationship between blocked sodium channels and the concentration-dependent decrease in Calcium. In this study, 1mM lidocaine treatment in the smooth muscle strip inhibited the release of stored Calcium and relaxed the airway smooth muscle. This supports our hypothesis that the Lidocaine inhibits the contractile mechanism of the muscle by decreasing the amount of stored calcium ions in the muscle fiber. Therefore, lidocaine injected into the frog’s sciatic nerve blocked important sodium channels that decreased the action potential fired which then decreased the release of Calcium that activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle. If we were to expand this study, it would be important to look at different concentrations of Lidocaine injection in order to see how various concentrations can affect the muscle contracting.
