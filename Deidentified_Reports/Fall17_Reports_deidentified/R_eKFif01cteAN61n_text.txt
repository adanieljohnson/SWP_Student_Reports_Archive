Title: Agricultural Waste Does Not Cause an Increase in Specific Metabolic Rate in Procambarus Sp.

Abstract:
In this experiment, we exposed Procambarus sp. to agricultural waste in order to determine the effect on specific metabolic rate.  By adding agricultural waste to the environment, we believed that it would make it more difficult for the crayfish to maintain its baseline bodily functions.  Our hypothesis was that by adding agricultural waste to the environment, the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish would increase.  To test this, we measured the oxygen consumption of the crayfish with and without the presence of agricultural waste.  We used a paired t test to find the statistical significance of our study.  Our null hypothesis was that the presence of agricultural waste would cause no change in specific metabolic.  Our results failed to reject our null hypothesis, meaning we failed to support the claim of our alternate hypothesis that agricultural waste increased the metabolic rate of crayfish.


Introduction:
Organisms obtain energy by one of two methods: autotrophy or heterotrophy [Johnson; 2016].  Autotrophs obtain energy via sunlight and chemical energy, meaning that autotrophs produce their own energy.  By consuming autotrophs and other heterotrophs, heterotrophs obtain high-energy molecules.  Crayfish are heterotrophs, and thus, obtain mitochondrial enzymes in order to produce ATP.  ATP is used by organisms as energy, which is used for basic bodily functions, movement, and other energy-consuming processes.  When ATP is produced, carbon dioxide and water are released as byproducts.  Measuring oxygen consumption is a valuable way to measure specific metabolic rate, which is a measure of energy expended to maintain bodily function [Johnson; 2016].  The units for specific metabolic rate are mg O2 * g-1* min-1. 

Environmental and physical conditions affect the specific metabolic rate of an organism.  It has been determined that the smaller an organism is, the higher its metabolic rate.  It has also been determined that the higher the temperature of the environment is, the higher the metabolic rate of the organism is.  This is because these conditions cause the organism to have to work harder and expend more energy to maintain its baseline level of functioning.  In this experiment, we want to determine the effect of agricultural waste on the specific metabolic rate of smaller-sized Procambarus sp., or marbled crayfish.  We are using this organism because it is a model organism, which means that there has been a lot of research done on this organism, making it ideal to study due to a large amount of background knowledge on its bodily function and behavior.  Scientists understand its bodily systems and can predict how different stress factors will affect the organism.  Based off of previous experiments, it is indicated that exposure to agricultural waste led to a higher specific metabolic rate in crayfish [Rowe; 2001].  It is important to study the effect of agricultural waste on various organisms, because pollution is a prevalent issue in our society.  Agricultural waste can be found in many waterways, which are habitats for many populations of species.  Determining the specific metabolic rate of organisms in the presence of agricultural waste can be used to determine how physiologically stressed an organism is in the presence of the pollutant.  If we can determine how agricultural waste harms various plant and animal species, then we can begin to determine how to best solve the issue of pollution.  This can influence further environmental research and environmental policy in order to protect organisms in the most effective way possible.     

We believe that in the presence of agricultural waste, the crayfish will have to expend more energy for bodily function [Rowe; 2001].  Our null hypothesis is that exposure to agricultural waste will cause the specific metabolic rate (mg O2 * g-1* min-1) of the crayfish to either remain the same or decrease, and we will use a one-tailed, paired t-test in order to test the validity of our data and hypothesis.  We will test our hypothesis by measuring the oxygen consumption of crayfish with or without the presence of agricultural waste.  Our hypothesis is that exposure to agricultural waste will increase the specific metabolic rate in smaller-sized Procambarus sp.     

Materials and Methods:
We set the temperature of the water to be 32 degrees Celsius and filled a screw-top jar with water that had been saturated with air and was 32 degrees Celsius.  The jar was filled so that it was slightly overflowing.  Next, we weighed a small crayfish and then placed it into the jar.  We placed the jar up to its neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature water.  We inserted the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the jar and filled the jar with water.  We turned on the instrument and allowed the readings to stabilized.  We took a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen reading, and we read the concentration of oxygen again after 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, we removed the probe from the jar and measured the volume of water that the crayfish was in via a funnel.  We repeated all of these steps with a second crayfish, and then again with a third crayfish.  We then added agricultural waste to the water in the jar and repeated the steps with three crayfish.  The agricultural waste was a 1:10 solution made of 100 mL waste with 900 mL of distilled water.  We had to swirl the solution in order to properly mix the agricultural waste.

To measure specific metabolic rate, we used the equation: SMR = (change in oxygen (mg) multiplied by volume of water (mL)) divided by (time (minutes) multiplied by weight of crayfish (grams)) .  The units for specific metabolic rate are mg O2 * g-1* min-1.  We used a one-tailed, paired t test in order to test statistical significance.  In this t test, we used an alpha-value of 0.05.  

In this experiment, the control group also acted as the experiment group.  The control group was testing the oxygen consumption without the presence of agricultural waste.  The independent variable was the presence of agricultural waste, which is a categorical and discrete variable.  The dependent variable was the oxygen consumed (and thus, the specific metabolic rate), which is a quantitative and continuous variable.  


Results:
The average specific metabolic rate for the control group was 1.6110-3 ± 3.8710-4 mg O2 * g-1* min-1 and the average specific metabolic rate for the experimental group was 1.1410-3 ± 2.110-4 mg O2 * g-1* min-1.  The values following ± indicate standard deviation. In all three crayfish, the specific metabolic rate decreased once exposed to agricultural waste.  The p-value of the t-test was 0.152.  The t-statistic of the t-test was 1.77.  The alpha-value of the t-test was 0.05.  The degrees of freedom were equal to 2.

Without the Presence of Agricultural Waste and With Agricultural Waste.  Error bars represent the standard deviation while the data bars represent the average observed response in mg O2 * g-1* min-1 for each group.  The standard deviation for the group without waste was 3.8710-4 and the standard deviation for the group with waste was 2.110-4.  Difference between the Experimental and Control group was insignificant with a p-value of 0.152 and an alpha-value of 0.05; the control group (n=3) had an average specific metabolic rate of 1.6110-3 mg O2 * g-1* min-1 with the experimental group (n=3) having an average response of 1.1410-3 mg O2 * g-1* min-1. 


Discussion:
Because the p-value from the paired t-test was 0.152 and our alpha value was 0.05, we failed to reject our null hypothesis, and thus, cannot not support the claim of our alternate hypothesis, which was that the agricultural waste would cause the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. to increase.  Our null hypothesis was that the presence of agricultural waste would cause the specific metabolic rate (mg O2 * g-1* min-1) of Procambarus sp.   to remain the same.  Our statistical test results indicate that our data is statistically insignificant, thus, we fail to reject our null hypothesis.  Because we failed to reject our null hypothesis, we cannot support the claim of our alternate hypothesis that agricultural waste leads to an increase in specific metabolic rate in crayfish.    

Once the crayfish were exposed to agricultural waste, their specific metabolic rate decreased in all three cases.  This is because the agricultural waste allowed it to be easier for the crayfish to maintain baseline bodily function, and thus, decreased the specific metabolic rates of all three organisms.  Our results do not align with results of previous experiments.  This mismatch of results could have been because the exposure to agricultural waste in this experiment was short-term while the exposure to agricultural waste in previous experiments was chronic [Rowe; 2001].  There also could have been differences in concentration of agricultural waste in previous experiments compared to our experiment that led to a difference in results.  

Future experiments could test the effects on specific metabolic rate of other pollutants besides agricultural waste, such as soil and manure being compared to acid rain. It would be interesting to determine the effects of different kinds of pollutants on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp.  It is important to conduct these studies, so that we can best determine how organisms are endangered by pollution and environmental detriments caused by humans.  Since agricultural waste is a form of pollution, determining the specific metabolic rate can also determine if the organism is physiologically stressed in the presence of waste.   If we can determine the negative effects on organisms that come from human sources, then we can determine the best approach for solving these environmental issues (i.e. determining what further research and policies should include) and which issues (i.e. water pollution, atmospheric pollution) should take priority in solving.
