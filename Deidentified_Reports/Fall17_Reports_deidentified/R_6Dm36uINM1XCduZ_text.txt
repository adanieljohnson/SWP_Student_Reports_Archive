Title: The effect of a Calcium channel activator A23187 on muscle contractions of a Rania pipiens leg

Abstract:
Calcium ions are responsible for the contraction of muscle when they are released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and bind to the troponin complex on actin. The gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens provides a good model system to analyze the effect of using a calcium channel activator A23187 on muscle contractions. We used an IMX 214 Stimulator to stimulate the sciatic nerve of the Rania pipiens to generate a contraction of the gastrocnemus. Each frog leg served as its own controlll and experimental group, because each leg was stimulated to find the threshold value for contraction, then injected with 1 Ml of 100mM calcium channel activator A23187. The experimental stimulation exhibited a shorter contractile period than that of the controlll group. The controlll group had an average contractile period of 112.4 ms and an average total contractile period of 579.7 ms. The experimental group had an average contractile period of 101.5 ms and an average total contractile period of 607.2 ms. The difference between the mean is not statistically significent (P = 0.443, P = 0.820). From our data and observations, it is statistically supported that calcium channel activator A23187 does not cause longer contractile periods.

Introduction:
Calcium is the primary ion that causes muscles to contract. When an action potential is received by the target muscle of a motor unit, calcium (Ca2+) gated ion channels open in the presynaptic neuron which releases acetylcholine (ACh) into the muscular junction and onto the motor end plate. ACh triggers sodium channels to open, which allows the action potential to continue and travel down the T-tubules of the muscle. When the action potential reaches the voltage sensitive DHP and ryanodine receptors, they change shape. This allows the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+ ions, which attach to the protein troponin allowing for the myosin and actin filaments to bond eliciting contraction from the muscle. In an experiment performed by Daher, et al, they sought to analyze a new Ca2+ ion pathway by using caffeine. Their study concluded that caffeine could activate TRPV1 proteins and allow for Ca2+ influx through a new pathway (Daher: 2009). The discovery of a new pathway would provide proof for more efficient contraction through more than one pathway (Daher: 2009). From this it lead us to the question of what would happen if more Ca2+ ions were present in the muscle? The hypothesis that will be tested is that more Ca2+ ions will still cause the same number of contractions, but the length of the contractile period will be longer. To analyze the effect of excess Ca2+ions. Rania pipiens will be the model system due to its prominent gastrocnemus muscle and the ease of separating the sciatic nerve to stimulate. To measure the change in time, myographs will be used as the primary tool to determine the time of the contractile period. In the experiment performed it is expected to see the time of the contractile period be greater when the gastrocnemus muscle is given the calcium channel activator A23187. 

Materials and Method:
The Rania pipiens were kept by the Biology Department at Wake Forest University under proper institutional guidelines. Shortly before the experiment was performed the legs were removed from the frogs following proper institutional guidelines to allow for optimal contraction. The frog legs were placed inside a dissecting tray where the skin was removed leaving the soft tissue and bones of the leg exposed. The thigh muscle of the frog was separated gently to expose the sciatic nerve of the frog. Once the nerve was separated from the thigh muscle, the gastrocnemus muscle was removed from the lower knee joint. A knot was tied around the upper part of the gastrocnemus near the left-over tendon, leaving a loop to hang to the gastrocnemus from the force transducer, and the leg was pinned down to add stability. The sciatic nerve was laid on to a sleeve electrode, already connected to the stimulator, and secured with a plastic cover. A IMX 214 Stimulator would stimulate the leg. This process was repeated each time a frog was used. To avoid having multiple legs for the controlll group, each leg was its own controlll and experimental group. Each leg would be stimulated to find its threshold stimulus by stimulating at 0.0 V, increasing by 0.1 V until a significent response was seen and measured. Each frog leg had a different threshold value, but each of their values fell between 0.2-0.7 V. Once the threshold value of the frog leg had been determined, the frog leg was stimulated at its threshold voltage by five pulses, the amplitude (in mV) and contractile period (in seconds) was recorded, and the average of the amplitude and contractile periods was calculated. After the controlll data was collected, the same leg was injected with 100mM calcium channel activator A23187. The calcium channel activator A23187 was delivered via syringe into the gastrocnemus muscle. In each frog leg, after the controlll data was collected, 0.1 Ml of calcium channel activator A23187 was injected into the gastrocnemus with 0.05 Ml being injected into the higher part of the muscle closer to the knot and 0.05 Ml being injected closer to the knee joint. To allow the activator to diffuse throughout the muscle, the frog leg rested for thirty seconds before being stimulated again. The same process was used to stimulate the frog leg when collecting the controlll data. For our experiment, we repeated this process three times. A one tailed paired t_test was used to analyze the statistical data.

Results:
A one tailed paired t_test was used to examine the data. For both the contractile and total contractile periods, the experimental stimulation contracted for a shorter length than the controlll stimulation. The experimental stimulation exhibited a shorter contractile period than that of the controlll group. The controlll group had an average contractile period of 112.4 ms and an average total contractile period of 579.7 ms. The experimental group had an average contractile period of 101.5 ms and an average total contractile period of 607.2 ms. The difference between the mean of the controlll and experimental contractile period (t_stat = 0.948, P = 0.443, d.f. = 2) was not statistically significent. The difference between the mean of the controlll and experimental total contractile period (t_stat = 0.259, P = 0.820, d.f. = 2) was not statistically significent. 

Discussion:
An influx of calcium causes the contraction of a muscle due to their release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and binding to troponin. According to our hypothesis, the increase in calcium channel activator A23187 should have been statistically relevant and caused longer contractions. Statistically, our null hypothesis could not be rejected: the increase in calcium channel activator A23187 did not cause significent longer contractile periods. This could be due to the muscle already contracting and calcium being used or a calcium channel activator A23187 causes a more robust contraction, but not necessarily a prolonged contraction since extra calcium ions are not being added to the organism. Daher et alâ€™s experiment proved the likelihood of TRVP1 proteins being a new pathway for calcium, which could cause for more robust contractions. Having another pathway would allow for more calcium ions to be present and able to bind to the troponin complex (Daher: 2009). It would be interesting to measure the force of the contractile period rather than the length of the period. While there is data to support that the experimental group did contract for a shorter period of time, the data is not statistically viable to enough to dictate a significent finding; the first frog leg is an outlier when determining the mean of the total contractile period, due to the low number of frog legs used.
	
Logically, the next step for this experiment would be to perform it again to validate the results, using more frog legs. Using more frog legs and performing the experiment again would create larger data sets and allow for a broader view of this trend amongst a broader data pool. Some of the error in this experiment could be to the lack of technique performing a detailed and original biological experiment prior to this experiment. The experience of performing this procedure again would also probably yield better viable data. Although, this experiment did open the opportunity for interest in the nature of calcium influx. If a calcium channel activator A23187 did not cause a longer contraction, then what would be needed to cause a longer contraction? This would be an interesting area to research, because it would draw attention to an ion or compound that would cause longer contraction and the complications that could cause for humans or other organisms.
