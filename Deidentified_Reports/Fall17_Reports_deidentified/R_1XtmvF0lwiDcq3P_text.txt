Title: The Effects of Aggression on the Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp. Crayfish

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to measure the metabolic rate of crayfish underwater while in the presence of another crayfish. We wanted to see if there was a difference in specific metabolic rates in the Procambarus sp. crayfish when alone versus when in the presence of another crayfish. Over a span of twenty minutes, dissolved oxygen levels in the crayfish environment were tracked in order to calculate the specific metabolic rates. In a study similar to the one that was conducted, it was concluded that higher metabolic rates were directly related to an increased level of consumption of oxygen. Based off of these conclusions, we hypothesized that the smaller and less dominant or aggressive crayfish will experience a higher metabolic rate when the larger crayfish is present. To determine this, we used a paired t-test to calculate the difference in specific metabolic rate. From this paired t-test, the p-value was calculated to be about 0.174, not supporting our hypothesis, but supporting our null hypothesis instead. 

Introduction:
The Procambarus sp. is a heterotroph that must convert consumed materials into molecules to create energy or ATP.  Metabolism is this conversion, and the specific metabolic rate is defined as a measurement of this conversion for a mass of an organism. Metabolism is defined as the process by which the body breaks down and converts food into energy. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to specific metabolic rate and can be used to determine the specific metabolic rate of an organism over a period of time.  Different internal or external environments or conditions such as temperature or solute levels can influence specific metabolic rate. The goal of this week’s lab was to measure the metabolic rate of crayfish underwater while in the presence of another crayfish. The scientific name of the crayfish is Procambrus sp. These crustaceans live in freshwater environments and are native to the eastern United States and Canada. In a study, similar to the one we will be conducting, K.A. Sloman found that the metabolic rate of brown trout, Salmo trutta, increased as a result of being in the presence of another Salmo trutta fish [Sloman et al: 2000]. We will conduct a similar experiment, but with the use of a different organism, a Procambarus sp. crayfish. We will compare the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish when they are alone versus when they are in the presence of another, larger crayfish. These crayfish were selected for this experiment because of their small size and ease of use in a lab environment. In order to calculate the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish, the dissolved oxygen levels will be tracked and recorded. These crayfish were used for this experiment because their size and activity does not pose to be difficult to handle. Based off of K.A. Sloman’s conclusions and findings, we hypothesize that the introduction of another crayfish will ultimately increase the specific metabolic rate compared to when the crayfish will be kept alone. 

Materials and Methods:
Today, we will be measuring oxygen consumption using different sized crayfish, a small and a large crayfish. The experiment will be conducted in relatively room temperature water (22℃). First, we will obtain a mass of each crayfish by weighing them separately on a scale and then place them into the test chamber which has been filled with the room temperature water and saturated with air. Over a twenty-minute interval, the oxygen levels will be recorded. After the twenty minutes, we will find the volume of water in the environment and will use this data to determine the specific metabolic rate by multiplying the volume of water and the change in oxygen levels and dividing by mass and time. The same small crayfish will be placed in the same chamber with fresh water within a large bucket that holds the larger crayfish as well. The smaller chamber will be clear so the two crayfish are visible to each other, but will prevent physical contact between them. We will ensure that the top of the test chamber is tightly screwed on so no air can escape. Next, oxygen meters will be used to measure dissolved oxygen in mg/L. The oxygen concentrations will be observed every five minutes, for twenty minutes. The change in volume of the water which the crayfish will be tested in will be accounted for. This volume of water will also be measured and recorded. Once the twenty minutes have elapsed with the presence of the other or larger crayfish, the large crayfish will be removed from the chamber. This procedure will be repeated with two more crayfish. A paired t-test will be used to determine the statistical significance of the introduction of another crayfish on overall metabolic rates. 

Results:
Over twenty-minute time periods, three crayfish were tested per each group. The average specific metabolic rate of the control group (isolated) was approximately 0.000657g H20*L H20/(g crayfish*min) that had a calculated standard deviation of about 0.000259g H20*L H20/(g crayfish*min). The average specific metabolic rate of the experimental group (aggressed) was calculated to be about 0.000233g H20*L H20/(g crayfish*min) with a standard deviation of about 0.0000652g H20*L H20/(g crayfish*min). It was actually observed that there was a higher specific metabolic rate in the crayfish that were kept separately or alone. One thing we found rather interesting and peculiar was that when the crayfish were introduced to each other, they seemed to not care at all. The larger crayfish was often observed to move into a corner away from the other crayfish. 

Discussion:
In the end, our calculated p-value of 0.174 was not significant enough to support our original hypothesis. However, the null hypothesis that the introduction of another crayfish will have little to no difference in specific metabolic rate was supported. The data we collected contradicts the findings and conclusions of Sloman’s study. The introduction of another crayfish was found to actually decrease or reduce the specific metabolic rates. We believe this could have been due to the fact that when the crayfish were introduced to each other, there was no interaction between them, as the larger crayfish always found itself in a corner facing the opposite direction of the other crayfish. The fact that the tested crayfish was not aggravated could possibly explain why the metabolic rate did not increase. One other possibility that we considered was maybe there was error in the measurement of the volume of water in the environment. 

For future study, one possibility we could consider is to stimulate the crayfish to interact. The use or implementation of more crayfish into the chamber would increase the chance of interaction, thus allowing us to obtain possibly better data. However, maybe the introduction of other crayfish actually calms them down. We could also study or research different social behaviors among the crayfish to obtain a better idea of how they interact with other crayfish or organisms in general. This should ultimately lead to better conclusions and data.
