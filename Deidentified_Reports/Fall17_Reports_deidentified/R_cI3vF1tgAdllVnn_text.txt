Title: Effects of Pollution on Specific Metabolic Rate in Crayfish, Procambarus sp.

Abstract:
In light of rising temperatures involved in global climate change, it is important to look at environmental stressors on marine animals and they will shape ecosystems in the future. One of the stressors scientists look at when measuring global warming is pollution and its effects the environment. In this report, we investigated how pollution, in the form of agricultural waste, affects specific metabolic rate in ectotherms, specifically freshwater crayfish (Procambarus sp.). We used an oxygen meter we to measure oxygen consumption in room temperature freshwater. Based on previous knowledge, we know that as temperatures rise, metabolic rates in ectotherms also rise. Given that pollution is an environmental stressor, we predicted that its exposure would increase metabolic rate in crayfish. We used the specific metabolic equation to calculate the change in oxygen uptake rate over time and then conducted a one tailed t-test to test the validity of our results. At an alpha level of 0.05, our p-value of 0.152 was statistically insignificant and therefore, we fail to reject our null hypothesis that there was no change. Despite these results, looking at environmental stressors such as pollution remains critical to understanding the physiological mechanisms that limit species distribution.

Introduction:
Biological activity is based on metabolic reactions that are influenced by temperature. In this lab, we will measure the metabolic rate of crayfish (Procambarus sp), common freshwater crustaceans. Since they are ectotherms, they depend on their surroundings to maintain body temperature. Changes in temperature can affect their ability to obtain oxygen from the environment, thereby making it crucial for them to respond by altering their behavior and/or internal physiology (Johnson AD).  Rising temperatures driven by global warming directly correlate with the pollution released into our environment[MR3] . Like temperature, pollution acts as an environmental stressor that we will use to test its effects on the rate of metabolism in ectotherms, in this case, crayfish.  Trace metals are important persistent pollutants is in aquatic systems worldwide, especially in freshwater ecosystems near urban areas. In a previous experiment, researchers tested the effects of chronic exposure to a mixture of trace elements in a contaminated habitat. Individuals exposed to contaminated sediment and food in the lab experienced elevations in SMR compared to controls after 27 days of exposure, but after 50 days of exposure, metabolic rate no longer differed between treatments. Their results supported their predictions that increases in energy expenditure in the contaminated habitat negatively influence production processes such as growth (Rowe et. al).      	
The goal of this lab was to test the effect of agricultural waste on the metabolic rate of crayfish. Since oxygen is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended, we chose to measure oxygen consumption with an oxygen meter. The units for specific metabolic rate is 02 *g-1*min-1. Based on previous experiments,  we hypothesize that exposure to agricultural waste will increase metabolic rate in crayfish. To test validity of our hypothesis with conducted used the specific metabolic equation and then carried out a one-tailed paired t-test.


Materials and Methods:
We set the temperature of the water to 32 degrees celsius and filled an empty mason jar (test chamber) with this room temperature[MR4]  water.  Then, we set the test chamber into an empty plastic dishpan. After taking the initial weight of the crayfish we then gently placed it into the test chamber filled with room temperature water, allowing some water to overflow slightly. Then we inserted the dissolved oxygen probe onto the the top of the chamber and made sure the top was screwed on tightly.  Then we turned on the instrument and let out reading stabilize. We took a the baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, read the oxygen concentration again. Then we removed the probe and measured the volume of the water by pouring the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder.  For the measurements with agriculture waste, we used the same three crayfish, however instead of pure water, we added 100 mL of waste and 900 mL of water. Once again, we took the baseline reading for each trial and recorded the oxygen concentration at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. After recording these results, we conducted a one-tailed paired t-test to test the significance of this data.


Results:
The average specific metabolic rate for the control group was 1.6110-3 ± 3.8710-4 mg O2 * g-1* min-1 and the average specific metabolic rate for the experimental group was 1.1410-3 ± 2.110-4 mg O2 * g-1* min-1.  The values following ± indicate standard deviation. In all three crayfish, the specific metabolic rate decreased once exposed to agricultural waste.  The p-value of the t-test was 0.152.  The t-statistic of the t-test was 1.77.  The alpha-value of the t-test was 0.05.  The degrees of freedom were equal to 2.

Discussion:
Given our p-value of 0.152 at an alpha level of 0.05, we fail to reject our null hypothesis that there was no change on specific metabolic rate because there was so statistical significance between the two groups.  Even though we hypothesized that metabolic rate would increase with exposure to agricultural waste, our average oxygen consumption rates between our control (1.6110-3 ± 3.8710-4 mg O2 * g-1* min-1) and treatment (1.1410-3 ± 2.110-4 mg O2 * g-1* min-1) groups actually decreased.  This led us to wonder whether our exposure time to agricultural waste lasted long enough to indicate any significant effect on oxygen consumption. Whereas as researchers in previous studies evaluated pollution exposure in crayfish over the course of 50 days, the 20-minute duration of pollution in our experiment was significantly shorter (Rowe et. al).  This might explain why our results did not reflect our predictions and as to why metabolic rates might differ between short-term and chronic exposures. For future studies, I would use a larger sample population of crayfish and conduct my experiment with longer exposure times. Also, I would like the complete biological information on the type of waste we administered. In the future, it would be interesting to compare the effects of different types of pollution and at different concentrations. It is important to realize the effects pollution has on our environment and the limitations pollutions poses to existing species. As humans, we remain a top of the food chain, so it is crucial that we realize consequences our daily actions. Understanding this relationship, helps us develop a better consciousness for environment and ensure the survival our ecosystems.
