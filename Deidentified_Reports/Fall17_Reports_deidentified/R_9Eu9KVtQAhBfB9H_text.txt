Title: The Effect of Water Salinity on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Orconectes sp.

Abstract:
Metabolic rate of an organism can be measured by oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Cells of organisms have specific concentrations of ions that must be regulated. Salt water increases the amount of ions in the cells, so more energy must be produced through metabolism to maintain ionic levels. We studied the effect of salt water on the specific metabolic rate of Orconectes sp., the Coosa River spiny crayfish, by measuring the oxygen consumption over time in regular water and salt water. We hypothesized that the crayfish would have higher specific metabolic rates in the salt water than the regular water. The specific metabolic rates in salt water were 0.00105 O2/gmin, 0.0009336 O2/gmin, and 0.001419 O2/gmin, and the specific metabolic rates in regular water were 0.0009614 O2/gmin, 0.0007251 O2/gmin, and 0.001202 O2/gmin. Our results showed that a saltwater environment increased the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish, most likely due to more energy being required for osmoregulation.

Introduction:
Metabolism is the process of balancing energy capture, energy conversion, and energy transfer within the cells of an organism. Measuring the metabolic rate for a single biological process is very difficult, but there is an easy way to measure overall energy production and energy consumption by an organism: oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. In the cytoplasm of cells, glucose molecules are converted into carbon dioxide gas molecules that can then be released from the organism. This reaction releases high energy electrons that are transferred to the electron transport chain, at which point they give off energy, causing ADP to be changed into ATP, which is a universal energy molecule used by all organisms. This process occurs within the mitochondria of cells and is only allowed to occur because oxygen gas molecules remove the electrons at the end of the electron transport chain, forming water molecules, which allows the process of ATP production to continue and not get blocked. The very basic net equation for this entire process is glucose plus six oxygen yields six carbon dioxide, six water molecules, and thirty eight ATP molecules. Crayfish are organisms that use metabolic processes to produce energy in the form of ATP in order to carry out all functions of life. The crayfish used in this experiment were the Orconectes sp., also known as the Coosa River Spiny Crayfish. The Orconectes sp. was a good organisms to use for this lab because it was a small enough aquatic organism to test within the lab setting and fit inside of the glass jar used. Metabolism can be affected by water salinity, as evidenced by a prior study that found that metabolic rates of rainbow trout, steelhead trout, and fall chinook salmon were higher in water with a higher salinity, which can be attributed to more energy being required for osmoregulation [Morgan: 1991]. The experiment will find the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in waters with different salinities by measuring the oxygen consumption of the crayfish and an equation for specific metabolic rate. The hypothesis is that the crayfish will have higher specific metabolic rates in the water with higher salinity than the regular water.

Materials and Methods:
Three crayfish of roughly equal mass are obtained and stored in their living chambers. The first crayfish is taken out of the living chamber and massed. Next, the crayfish is carefully put inside of the screw top glass jar container. The container is then sat in the plastic dishpan full of room temperature water. Gently, the container is filled with room temperature water that has been saturated by air, which is the control for the experiment. The dissolved oxygen probe is inserted into the chamber and the lid is screwed shut. Using the reading instrument, the oxygen reading is allowed to stabilize and an initial baseline reading is taken. The oxygen concentration is then read again at five, ten, fifteen, and twenty minutes. The difference between the oxygen concentration at 0 and 20 minutes is the change in oxygen concentration. After the readings have been taken, the volume of water in the jar is determined. This procedure is then repeated for the other two crayfish. Once all three crayfish have done been tested in the control water, the test is done again, except this time the glass jar is filled with water that has a higher salinity, .65% salt in the solution. All three crayfish are then tested again in the salt water solution. To find the specific metabolic rate, all numbers are plugged into the equation of specific metabolic rate equals change in O2 concentration times volume H2O all over time times mass (specific metabolic rate=[âˆ†O2 (mg/L) x volume H2O (L)][Time (min) x mass (g)]). A one tailed paired t-test is used to compare the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish in the control water versus the treatment water with a higher salinity.

Results:
For all three crayfish, the specific metabolic rate was higher in the salt water than in the regular water. This supported our hypothesis as all three exhibited this. The specific metabolic rate for crayfish one was 0.0009614 O2/gmin in regular water and 0.00105 O2/gmin in salt water. The specific metabolic rate for crayfish two was 0.0007251 O2/gmin in regular water and 0.0009336 O2/gmin in salt water. The specific metabolic rate for crayfish three was 0.001202 O2/gmin in regular water and 0.001419 O2/gmin in salt water. Using the one tailed paired t-test for specific metabolic rate, the p-value was 0.05384, which is greater than 0.05, so the results were not statistically significant and there was not a significant difference between specific metabolic rate in regular water than in salt water. The null hypothesis cannot be refuted, which was that there was no difference in specific metabolic rate in the crayfish in regular water than in salt water. The t-stat value was 4.1337 with 3 degrees of freedom.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment supported the hypothesis as the specific metabolic rate of all three crayfish increased in the salt water when compared to the regular water. A higher specific metabolic rate can be attributed to the crayfish being required to create more energy to be used in osmoregulation. The salt water has more Na+ and Cl- ions in solution, so these ions will enter the cell more frequently and in greater numbers than in the regular water. In order to maintain the regular ion levels inside of the cells, the excess ions must be pumped out of the cell, which requires energy. Energy is required because there is an increased concentration gradient, meaning that there are more ions outside of the cells than inside of the cells, so the ions want to diffuse into and enter the cell and move down the concentration gradient. Because there is this increased concentration gradient in the salt water, more energy is required to activate ion transporters that then pump the extra ions out of the cell into the surroundings, which allows the cell to maintain its regular ion levels. Since more energy is required in order to activate these transporters, specific metabolic rate will increase in order to produce more energy. The data found in this experiment was also supported by the prior study, as the study found that increased water salinity resulted in higher metabolic rate, which was the same outcome discovered in this experiment [Morgan: 1991]. The data found in this experiment shows that when in water at a higher salinity, crayfish exhibit higher specific metabolic rates in order to produce more energy which helps to maintain regular ionic levels within cells, thus maintaining regular cellular function. A future study, other than repeating the same experiment with more subjects, could be using much higher concentrations of salt to see whether that causes an even greater increase in specific metabolic rate than this experiment showed, or to see if there is a salt concentration level at which the metabolic processes of the crayfish can not keep up with.
