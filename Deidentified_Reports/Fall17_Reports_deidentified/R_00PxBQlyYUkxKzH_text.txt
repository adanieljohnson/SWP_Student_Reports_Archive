Title: Competition Amongst Plants

Abstract:
	In this experiment, we are testing the way Vigna radiata (mung beans) and Avena sativa (oats) have allocate their resources by testing competition [Johnson: 2017].  We believe that there will be a significant difference between the weight and length root:shoot ratios of both the plants growing in interspecific versus intraspecific competition. We will use one tailed two sample t- tests to see if there is a difference between the length and weight of mean root:shoot ratios of V. radiata growing in solitude vs. together (with A. Sativa) and A. sativa growing in solitude vs. together (with V. radiata) [Johnson: 2017]. After experimentation, we found that the hypothesis was only partially correct. The results of the experiment showed that the p-values showing and not showing significance in the root:shoot ratios were oat weights alone vs. together (with mung beans) where p= .406, oat lengths alone vs. together (with mung beans) where p=.004, mung beans weights alone vs. together (with oats)where p=.017, and mung beans lengths alone vs. together (with oats) where p= .643.  The competition for resources heavily varies and only sometimes plants show a significant difference between only one species or multiple species root:shoot ratios in  both height and weight.


Introduction:
The allocation of resources in an environment is vital to the survival of all organisms. Plants, like all organisms, compete for resources that allow them to thrive in certain environments. Because resources such as sunlight, water, and growth space are limited there is often competition amongst species for survival [Johnson: 2017]. We chose to work with plant competition because it is extremely important to the survival and the success reproduction of plants. If they can out compete other plants then they can best allocate the resources of their given environment. In this experiment, the plants being tested in competition are mung beans and oats together and both oats and mung beans in solitude. We will be testing to see how the growth of these plants in the competition effects their natural selection and their ability to adapt to the environment [Craine: 2013], by comparing the root:shoot ratios of each plant grown in solitude to the same plant type growing with the other plant type [Johnson: 2017]. We believe that the mean root:shoot ratio for both the weight and the length of the two plants growing by themselves in solitude will show a significant difference  to the plants growing together’s root:shoot ratio.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we will plant three pots of mung beans growing in solitude with 50 seeds in each pot, three pots of oats in solitude with 50 seeds in each pot, and three pots of both mung beans and oats together, with 25 seeds of each seed type in each pot. We will water and care for the plants until they are mature, for two weeks, allowing for there to become complexities of resource allocation leading to limitations in resources [Craine: 2013]. In which time, we will harvest them to see how the plants allocated resources in the 2 settings (alone or together) [Johnson: 2017].  We will harvest six plants from each environment (i.e.- mung beans alone, oats alone, mung beans together, oats together). For each plant harvested, we will cut the plant at the same point at the root-shoot junction, then individually weigh and measure respectively the weight and height [Johnson: 2017].  We will then find the root:shoot ratio by dividing the root weight or length by the shoot weight or length [Johnson:2017]. We will then use separate one-tailed two-sample t-tests to compare the means of the weight and length root:shoot ratio of the mung beans growing in solitude to the mung beans growing with the oats and the oats growing in solitude with the oats growing with the mung beans and gain a p-value to show a possible significant difference.
	


Results:
By utilizing the means and the standard deviations of the root:shoot ratios taken from the graphs and tables one is able to complete four separate one-tailed two-sample t-tests to find  the p-values for comparing [ Johnson: 2017] oat weights (refer to Figure 2) alone vs. together (with mung beans) where p= .406, oat lengths (refer to Figure 1) alone vs. together (with mung beans) where p=.004, mung beans weights (refer to Figure 2) alone vs. together (with oats)where p=.017, and mung beans lengths ( Refer to Figure 1) alone vs. together (with oats) where p= .643. It seems that the means vary for all types of environments the plants were in for both length and weight.


Discussion:
According to the experiment’s result the hypothesis was correct half of the time.. This demonstrates that there is no set-in-stone way that plants allocate their resources various environments, even when different species of plants are grown together [ Craine: 2013]. However, this is just one test of the allocation in plants. In order to gain a more thorough account, one should do the same experiment; but, test plants other than mung beans and oats to see if the data completely supports the hypothesis, only does some of the time (as in the case of this experiment), or does not support the experiment at all. At Tennessee State University, a Bio 412 lab about the intraspecific and interspecific competition in plants experiment. In their results, many of the experimentations showed their was a lot of variance between the plants weight and height, despite the differences of interspecific and intraspecific competition, and similar growth environments. Due to the similar parallels between our experiment and the other lab, it is plausible that there is often variance in the root:shoot ratios of both weight and height during both interspecific and intraspecific plant competition [Ganter: 2003].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This figure includes the mean root:shoot ratio in lengths for oats grown alone, oats grown together with mung beans, mung beans grown alone, and mung beans grown together with oats. One can compare the means of these ratios in order to gain an understanding as to what plants succeeded the most in allocation and therefore, the allocation of resources necessary for survival and reproduction.
