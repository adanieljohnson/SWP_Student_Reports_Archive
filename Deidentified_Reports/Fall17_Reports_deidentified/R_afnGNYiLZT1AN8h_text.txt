Title: The effect of increase in salinity on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish

Abstract:
Both autotrophs and heterotrophs use a similar set of enzymes to convert high-energy molecules in to low energy ones, and capture the energy released during conversion in a common “energy currency”: ATP. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended. Salinity challenge adds stress on aquatic animals, and therefore more energy is needed to maintain homeostasis. The aim of this study is to find out the effect of the increase in salinity on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish. The animal model is Procambris sp. We first determined the change in oxygen concentration in fresh water to calculate the specific metabolic rate of 3 crayfish respectively. Then, 100Ml of 6.5% NaCl solution was added to the water. The specific metabolic rate would be calculated again using the same method. The hypothesis is that the increase in salinity would increase the specific metabolic rate of crayfish. The result indicated that the percentage change of specific metabolic rate was 30.62% on average, but the increase in salinity did not significently increase the specific metabolic rate of crayfish.

Introduction:
Organisms need energy to respond and adapt to environmental changes. Both autotrophs and heterotrophs use a similar set of mitochondrial enzymes to convert high-energy molecules into low energy ones, and capture the energy released during conversion in a common “energy currency”: ATP. Metabolic rate is used to describe the entire process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells or an organism. We could measure the ATP synthesis or consumption to estimate a metabolic process, but it is hard to measure ATP directly. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended [Johnson:2017]. Salinity challenge adds stress on aquatic animals, and therefore more energy is needed to maintain homeostasis [Xu: 2015]. One type of homeostasis is osmoregulation (solute and water regulation). Intracellular and intercellular solute and water balance can greatly affect biochemical process and physiological functions in aquatic animals [Komoroske: 2015]. Aquatic animals need to maintain relatively constant ionic composition and osmoregulatory process, which are energy demanding [Lisboa:2015]. If the salinity changes, the aquatic animals need to expand extra energy for active ion transport to maintain homeostasis. The animal model used for experiment is Procambris sp. (crayfish). Crayfish is a freshwater crustacean [Marzano: 2009]. Studies on Procambris sp. so far have focused on morphological and molecular analysis [Schiewek: 2007], life stage [Seitz: 2005], reproductive components [Vogt: 2004], and development of the central nervous system [Vilpoux: 2006]. This makes crayfish a suitable species for experiment. The hypothesis is that the increase in salinity would increase the specific metabolic rate of crayfish.

Materials and Method:
The screw-top glass testing chamber should be filled with fresh water that has been saturated with air under room temperature. Weigh the 3 crayfish and place it into the test chamber respectively. Then, fill the container with enough fresh water so that the top can overflow slightly. Set the whole test chamber into a plastic dishpan filled with room-temperature water. The dissolved oxygen probe should be inserted into the top of the chamber and completely filled with water. The reading should be read until it completely stabilized and recorded at every 5, 10,15, and 20 minutes. After removing the probe, the water should be poured from test chamber through a funnel into a graduated cylinder and the volume should be recorded. Repeat the entire process with the same crayfish, but with the chamber filled with oxygen-saturated water with 100Ml 6.5% NaCl solution. After finishing, the concentration of NaCl should be calculated according to the concentration of NaCl solution and the volume of water. The change of the concentration of oxygen in 20 minutes, weight of the crayfish, and volume of water should be used to calculated the specific metabolic rate.

Statistical analysis
The results were analyzed with paired t_test at a 95% confidence level. The specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in salty water was compared with the specific metabolic rate measured in fresh water.


Results:
In trial 1, the percentage change of specific metabolic rate is about -2.90%. In trial 2 and 3, the percentage change of specific metabolic rate is about 26.62% and 68.14% respectively (See figure 1). The average percentage change is 30.62%. After running the paired t_test, the p_value is about 0.238.

Discussion:
The result of trial 1 did not support the hypothesis; the results of trial 2 and 3 supported the hypothesis. Even the average percentage change of the specific metabolic rate of crayfish is 30.62% (see Table 1)，the p_value, 0.238, is greater than 0.05, which indicated that the increase in salinity did not significently increase the specific metabolic rate of crayfish. Aquatic animals, crayfish in this experiment, needed to spend extra energy to maintain relatively constant ionic composition if the salinity was increased. So, crayfish would consume more oxygen, which led to the increasing specific metabolic rate. However, after running the paired t_test, the difference between the specific metabolic rate is not significent. A probable reason could be the small sample size. One of the confounding factors could be the body size of crayfish, because crayfish with larger body size tend to have greater metabolic rate. For further study, we should do experiment with a larger sample size and crayfish in similar body size. In previous studies about salinity and its effects on aquatic animals, salinity can enhance the abundance of proteins involved in several pathways involved in innate immune defense in striped catfish [Schmitz: 2017]; teleost fish reared at salinity 24‰ grew better than those maintained in freshwater (salinity 0‰) [Lisboa: 2015]. Salinity has influence on many physiological aspects of aquatic animals, such as metabolic rate, growth rate, and immune defense system. So, change in salinity may lead to many biological changes in crayfish in wild. More detailed analysis is needed to determine the effect of salinity on crayfish.
