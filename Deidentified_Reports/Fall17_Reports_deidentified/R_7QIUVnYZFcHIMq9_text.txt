Title: How salinity affect the metabolic rate of Orconectes sp.

Abstract:
In this experiment, we study about how salinity affect the metabolic rate of Orconectes sp. Multiple studies indicate that with an increase in salinity, crawfish would raise its metabolic rate to maintain its original homeostasis. Therefore, our hypothesis is that increase of salinity would cause an increase of metabolic rate of Orconectes sp. This experiment generates 3 trials, each have one control group with distilled water and one experimental group with 0.73% salinity water. Result shows that two out of three trials experience an increase in metabolic rate of experimental group than control group. However, paired-t test (t-stat = 1.664, df = 2, P = 0.24) result suggests that there is no significant difference between control group and experimental group, thus could not support our hypothesis. In future, more trials should be done to generalize experiment result. 


Introduction:
Salinity adaptation is a complex process involving a suite of physiological and behavioral response to environments with differing osmoregulation requirement. [Swanson: 1998]Within different salinity concentration, the metabolic rate of organism will change in order to maintain homeostasis.

Metabolism is a term that is used to describe all chemical reactions involved in maintaining the living state of the cells and the organism. Metabolism can be conveniently divided into two categories: catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism refers to the breakdown of molecules to obtain energy, and anabolism refers to the synthesis of all compounds needed by the cells. [Mandal: 2017. Therefore, metabolic rate is an important factor to determine the living status of the organism. In this experiment, we mainly focus on how salinity would affect the metabolic rate of Orconectes sp. 

The way to measure metabolic rate of one organism is to measure the amount of energy produced and used, which can be indirectly indicated by the amount of oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption is crucial to the whole metabolism of the organism. It can indirectly indicate the amount of energy transferred inside organism body. By consuming oxygen and form aerobic respiration, glucose undergoes glycolysis and form acetate and carbon dioxide. Acetate further active to produce large amount of ATM, which are removed by transferring them to oxygen. Therefore, the amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose during routine physiological activities is directly proportional to the amount of energy consumed. [Johnson: 2017]

Orconectes sp. is a genus of freshwater crayfish, native to the eastern United States and Canada. Since it is wildly allocated within different salinity of sea water, it is very suitable for this experiment.  Salinity is the amount of salt that is dissolved in a body of water. Compare to pure water, water with salinity have extra amount of sodium and chloride ion. Salinity is a limiting factor in the distribution of aquatic organism, and it can affect the physiological processes of estuarine organisms, such as survival, hemolymph osmolarity, tissue water content and have other sublethal effects. [Robots: 1988] With increasing salinity, more ions are entering into crayfish’s body, which influence the homeostasis state of crayfish. In order to maintain original homeostasis, crayfish require higher metabolic rate to repel extra ion out of its body, therefore our hypothesis is increasing water salinity may leads to increase in metabolic rate of crayfish. 

Materials and Methods:
Start the control group measurement for trial 1. Weight a crayfish for trial 1, and place it into the test chamber. Fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air in room temperature (22 ℃), and set the test chamber into an empty plastic dishpan. Screw on the top, and gently fill the container with water so that the top overflows slightly. Place the tank to the neck in a dishpan filled with water saturated with air, and insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber. Some overflow of water is acceptable, and make sure that the chamber is completely filled with water. Turn on the oxygen probe instrument to measure the data until reading is stabilize. Take the base line reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration, and at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes, read the oxygen concentration again, and record the data. Remove the probe from the chamber. Pour the water out into a column and record the volume of water. 

Then, start the experimental group measurement for trial 1. Using the same crayfish as control group and place it into the test chamber. Fill the screw-top glass with water added sodium chloride to form salinity water. Repeat the experiment of control group, and calculate the concentration of the sodium chloride in the solution. If the water volume is larger or equal to 900 ml, the concentration of the prepared sodium chloride solution is 10%. If the water volume is smaller than 900 ml, certain calculation will be needed to calculate the concentration. Record the concentration of trial 1. 

Repeat the procedure above for trial 2 and trial 3, and record data. 

At last, calculate the specific metabolic rate by this equation: 



After all data is collected, suing paired t test to calculate the significance among control group and experimental group. 


Results:
For all three trials, salinity concentration is 0.73% through calculation. 
According to figure 1, we find out for trial 1, control group has slightly greater metabolic rate than that of experimental group. For trail 2, experimental group has greater metabolic rate than that of control group. For trial 3, experimental group has greater metabolic rate than that of control group. All three trials undergo different patterns, so there is no clear general trend, but data from both trial 2 and trial 3 indicate that two out of three trial show the increase of metabolic rate of crayfish in the salinity environment than in Distilled water. Paired t-test show the result of t-stat = 1.664, df = 2, P = 0.24.


Discussion:
With reference to the result of paired-t test, there is no significant difference between metabolic rate of crayfish in distilled water and metabolic rate of cray fish in salty water since p value is greater than 0.05. Therefore the result does not support our hypothesis.  However, since there are only three experimental trials, and two out of three trials suggest that metabolic rate of crayfish will increase in salinity environment. As early experiment conducted by John D. Morgan and George K. Iwama mentioned, metabolic rates of Oncorhynchus mykiss, increased with salinity. [Morgan: 2011] Also, another study concluded that patterns of variation in metabolic rate and growth were largely parallel to variations in routine activity although, comparing 15% and 55% salinity, elevated maintenance costs for osmoregulation at higher salinity were detectable. [Swanson: 1998]. Both studies show that increasing in salinity will result an extra activity for organism to maintain osmoregulation, therefore could leads to increase in metabolic rate. The reason why paired-t test cannot support our hypothesis is that we have too little experimental trials. In future study, more trials should be done to increase accuracy and reduce large random fluctuation. Also, in real life, salinity varies from region to region. in order to test whether increasing salinity could affect metabolic rate of crayfish in different regions of sea, different salinity experimental trials should be tested. Another factor that could influence crayfish metabolism is temperature, which is tightly connected to salinity, therefore in future experiment, we can examine two factors together to generate a more thorough conclusion. In reality, serious pollution with high salinity input to ocean has always been a problem. By studying how salinity could affect metabolism rate of marine animals, it could reveal the harmful impact of pollution to marine animals’ growth, therefore can revoke people’s attention on dealing with pollution seriously.
