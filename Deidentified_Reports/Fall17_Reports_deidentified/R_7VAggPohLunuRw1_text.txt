Title: Decrease in photosynthetic activity in the sun plant Ocimum basilicum when compared to the shade plant Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
	Different kinds of plants have optimum amounts of light that they can be grown in. We analyzed the difference in photosynthetic activity between sun plants and shade plants, using Ocimum basilicum and Spinacia oleracea as model organisms. The electron transport mechanism must differ between sun and shade plants due to the difference in photosynthetic activity generally observed. In order to measure the reducing capacity of each plant, a Hill reaction was performed after preparing the chloroplasts in each plant. However, in this study, there was a significant decrease in photosynthetic activity in the sun plant (rather than the expected shade plant). This difference in photosynthetic activity is due to the dying sun plant used (basil) and the drastic difference in number of chloroplasts between the basil and spinach. 


Introduction:
Plants use solar energy, carbon dioxide and water to make glucose and therefore obtain energy. This is known as photosynthesis. As pigments in the chloroplasts of plants absorb solar energy, electrons move down an electron transport chain using high energy electron carriers in a process known as Photosystem II [Johnson: 2017]. The complexes involved in the reduction/oxidation reactions that occur along the electron transport chain move protons across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton gradient while they pass the electrons down the chain. This proton gradient allows the cell to hydrolyze adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the plant can then use electrons from both NADPH and ATP to create sugars [Johnson:2017]. 
Photosynthetic activity differs in plants that grow in different light levels. The capacity for electron transport, for example, is higher in the chloroplasts of sun plants than in the chloroplasts of shade plants, due to an increased number of electron carriers, specifically the cytochromes in sun plants. This leads to a higher amount of activity in photosystem II [Boardman: 1977]. Sun plants also generally have more of a key enzyme in photosynthesis known as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, also known as rubisco The higher amount of rubisco in sun plants could lead to a higher amount of photosynthetic activity, because the higher levels of rubisco means there are higher levels of the metabolites from the electron transport chain (more metabolites/reactants, more product) [Seemann, et. al: 1987].
We will test how environment affects the amount of photosynthetic activity, more specifically photosystem II and the electron transport chain, in sun (Ocimum basilicum) versus shade (Spinacia oleracea) plants. When comparing the photosynthetic activity, the O. basilicum plant should have a higher amount of activity than the S. oleracea plant.


Materials and Methods:
Both the S. oleracea leaves and O. basilicum plant were acquired from a grocery store. The spinach was stored in the refrigerator, while the basil was left at room temperature until the time of the experiment. To prepare the chloroplasts for the Hill reaction, the leaves were crushed (after deveining) using a mortar and pestle and a grinding buffer of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8. This mixture was then filtered through cheesecloth, then centrifuged (at 200 x G for 3 minutes). After removing the supernatant, more grinding buffer was added; this mixture was then centrifuged again at the same speed. The resulting pellet contained the desired chloroplasts; more grinding buffer was added to this pellet and set aside on ice. After preparing the chloroplasts, the relative number of chloroplasts was observed under a microscope using a 
hemacytometer. (The S. oleracea leaf had a higher density of chloroplasts than the O. basilicum leaf. See figures 1 and 2.)
Seven test tubes were obtained for the Hill reaction (one blank, three replicates for both spinach and basil). To all of the reactions, water and reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) were added. All of the reactions except the blank also included 130 mM dichlorophenolindophenol, also known as DCPIP, and the chloroplasts (three spinach, three basil). (Because the chloroplasts were much less dense in the basil plant, 400 µL of basil chloroplasts and 100 µL of spinach chloroplasts were added to their respective test tubes. The goal was to account for the difference in chloroplasts by adding a higher volume of the basil chloroplasts.) The Hill reaction was then run for forty minutes, and absorbance was measured at ten minute intervals; after thirty minutes, additional light was added to catalyze the reaction, as no signs of reaction were visible at thirty minutes. Absorbance was taken on the spectrophotometer at 600 nm. The percentage change of absorbance was then calculated, using the equation [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%. Upon completion of the reaction, a two-sample t-test assuming equal variances was run with a critical value at 0.05.  Photosynthetic activity is used to denote percent change in absorbance.


Results:
There was a significant decrease in photosynthetic activity from the shade plant, Spinacia oleracea, to the sun plant, Ocimum basilicum, (t(4)=8.263, p=0.00117). 


Discussion:
There was a significant decrease in photosynthetic activity from the shade plant and sun plant. Based on these findings, our hypothesis is rejected. We predicted that sun plants would have increased electron transport (and therefore increased photosynthetic activity) over shade plants, because it is generally accepted than sun plants have increased amounts of electron carriers, and therefore would have higher rates of electron transport [Boardman: 1977]. 
The decreased activity in sun plants versus shade plants found in this experiment is not consistent with current literature. An explanation for this inconsistency could be the number of chloroplasts found in the O. basilicum plant. Upon examination under the microscope, the density of chloroplasts was significantly higher in the spinach leaf than the basil (refer to figures 2 and 3). To account for the difference in chloroplast number, a higher amount (four times) of basil chloroplasts was added to the basil Hill reaction test tubes than the spinach Hill reaction test tubes. Even with the added chloroplasts, the spinach still had a much higher photosynthetic rate. This could be due to the fact that the solution volume did not match in the spinach and basil test tubes. When gathering the basil for the reaction, its leaves also looked withered and dying. This could have also led to the results we found: a smaller number of working photosynthetic units due to “old age” would lead to lower photosynthetic activity than expected. If there were less photosynthetic units, then the capacity for electron transport would also be reduced, and photosystem II would occur less rapidly [Hikosaka, 1996]. Also, the method that was used to homogenize the basil leaf could have led to a less pure sample of the chloroplasts. The density of chloroplasts is less in the basil plant, and hand homogenization led to a greater loss of the already few chloroplasts, possibly because of the waxy cuticle surrounding the basil leaf. This cuticle is thick, to protect the plant from high levels of sun. The spinach plant, on the other hand, appeared healthy and had a high density of chloroplasts; there is no reason to suspect that photosynthetic activity was different than what was suspected. There is also a possibility that photooxidative bleaching occurred in the basil plant; plants exposed to light for a high amount of time could lead to damaging of the thylakoid membranes, and therefore inhibition/decrease of photosynthetic activity [Powles: 1984]. 
Going forward, more experiments should be completed comparing sun and shade plants. The experiments, however, should focus on healthy plants. Future studies could concentrate on how photosynthetic activity and electron transport differ in a variety of sun plants and a variety of shade plants or how different amounts of light affect photosynthetic activity in sun versus shade plants. Analyzing how different amounts of light affect the plants’ photosynthetic activity would allow for determining an optimum amount of light for the different types of plants to be grown in.
