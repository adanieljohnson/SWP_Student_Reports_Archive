Title: The Effect of Exercise on the Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp. 

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to see how the metabolic rate of Procambarus sp., commonly known as crayfish, is affected by exercise. We hypothesized that if we exercised the crayfish right before plaing them in the testing chamber, then their metabolic rates would be higher compared to their metabolic rates when they were at rest directly before being placed in the chamber. Metabolic reactions occur in the mitochondria where ATP is produced, supplying energy to the rest of the cell. Metabolic rate refers to the amount of energy expended by all physiologic processes. Oxygen consumption was measured because it is directly proportional to metabolic rate. Three crayfish of similar weights were placed in a testing chamber one at a time and their initial oxygen consumption was measured. Then, lab partners took turns swirling a straw around inside the crayfish tanks, causing them to move. The crayfish were placed back into the testing chamber after exercise and oxygen consumption was measured. A paired t-test was run and the p-value was 0.501. Our hypothesis was that an increase in exercise would lead to an increase in metabolic rate and we fail to reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is 0.501. 

Introduction:
Animal studies have generally shown that single exercise events and longer-term training produce increases in metabolic rate [Speakman, J.R.: 200]. In this experiment, Cambarus sp., or commonly known as crayfish, was the organism studied in order to understand how metabolic rate can be influenced. Crayfish are found in freshwater and their bodies have three distinct segments. They also have powerful claws for defense and for obtaining food. Crayfish were helpful in studying metabolic rate because they are small and easily fit into chambers that we could use to measure oxygen consumption. Metabolic reactions occur in the mitochondria which is where nutrients are broken down and converted into energy that can be used by the organism. First, glucose is broken into two pyruvates which is converted into acetate and carbon dioxide. During this process, electrons are released which travel between molecules in an electron transport chain. The electron transport chain uses energy released from electrons to generate ATP. ATP is the main source of energy for metabolic functions [Johnson: 2017]. There are a few ways to measure metabolic rate, but for the purpose of this experiment, oxygen consumption was measured. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose. The dependent variable is metabolic rate and the independent variable is rest or exercise. We used crayfish because they can be put into water chambers to measure oxygen consumption. We hypothesized that if we exercised the crayfish right before placing them in the testing chamber, then their metabolic rates would be higher compared to their metabolic rates when they were at rest directly before being placed in the chamber. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, Cambarus sp. was used to determine the effect of exercise on metabolic rate. First, three crayfish of similar weight were collected and placed in tanks. Next, a crayfish that had been resting was placed in the screw-top glass testing chamber and the chamber was placed in a room-temperature tub. The oxygen consumption was recorded every five minutes. After twenty minutes, the crayfish was gently placed back into the tank and the volume of the water in the chamber was recorded. Next, the crayfish was exercised. We exercised the crayfish by taking a straw and swirling it around the tank and prodding the crayfish to move for ten minutes. Then, we placed the crayfish in the chamber and measured oxygen consumption and volume again. These steps were repeated for the second two crayfish. The statistical test used was a paired t-test with one tail comparing the same crayfish while at rest and directly after exercise.

Results:
Figure 1. Cambarus sp. was used to measure metabolic rate. The p-value for this experiment was 0.501, n=3, the t-value was 0.814, and the degrees of freedom was 2. The standard deviation for the control crayfish was 0.00925 and the standard deviation for the experimental crayfish was 0.00414. For the first trial, the metabolic rate of the exercised crayfish was much higher than the metabolic rate while the crayfish was at rest. For the second trial, the metabolic rate for the resting crayfish was higher than the metabolic rate of the exercised crayfish. For the third trial, the exercise metabolic rate for the crayfish was slightly higher than the resting metabolic rate. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was that an increase in exercise would lead to an increase in metabolic rate and we fail to reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is 0.501. This contrasts with the literature which states that animal studies have generally shown that single exercise events and longer-term training produce increases in metabolic rate [Speakman, J.R.: 200]. It is odd that the metabolic rate for the second crayfish was higher when resting than after exercise. Exercise should stimulate the rate at which the mitochondria produces ATP, therefore increasing metabolic rate. There are some errors that could have occurred in this experiment. For example, it is possible that each of the experimental crayfish were not exercised equal amounts. Some crayfish were more reluctant to move than others. In addition, while the crayfish were supposed to be resting they  may have moved around a bit on their own, without the straw acting as a stimulus. This may be why the second trial shows that the metabolic rate when the crayfish was resting was higher than its metabolic rate directly after exercise. The literature also states that studies in animals that measure the effect of voluntary exercise regimens on metabolic rate are less commonly performed and do not show the same response as that to forced exercise [Speakman, J.R.: 200]. The next logical step in this study would be to modify the experiment by measuring involuntary exercise. As stated in the article, voluntary exercise may yield different results than involuntary exercise. Studying metabolic rate is important in regards to exercise because many people determine their caloric needs and whether they want to gain or lose weight based on their BMR, which stands for basal metabolic rate. Knowledge of metabolic rate can help athletes improve their exercise performance or obtain the fat-to-lean-mass ratio optimal for their personal situations.
