Title: The Duration of Time Betta splendins Spend in an Aggressive State While in the Presence of Various Colored B. splendins Does Not Affect Aggression

Abstract:
This experiment examines the effect color has on the aggression of Betta splendins. Male bettas often exhibit aggressive behaviors such as “red mane” and tail flashing towards other male betta fish [ Johnson: 2017]. We wanted to test and see if the color red on a betta provoked a longer duration of “red mane” or tail flashing of a focal fish during a time span of five minutes as opposed to a transparent betta fish. We believed that the red betta would cause a longer duration of aggression in a focal fish than the transparent fish would. However, after experimentation, we got the mean time that focal fish spent showing “red mane” or tail flashing towards a transparent betta fish as 51 seconds and the mean time of those same traits towards a red betta fish as 46 seconds. After performing a one tailed paired t_test, we got the p_value of .405, showing little statistical significance that our hypothesis was supported. Therefore, after experimentation, we believe that the color of a betta fish does not necessarily provoke more or less aggression.


Introduction:
In this experiment, we are testing to see how male Betta splendins (betta fish) respond to the color of another betta fish. Male betta fish are known for their aggressive behaviors towards other bettas and other species of fish [Johnson: 2017].  Betta fish are native to Thailand, they were originally bred in the 1850s. Eventually, the idea of having an aggressive fighting fish spread to the United States at the beginning of the 1900s [Johnson:2017]. The Bettas have two main aggressive behaviors, broadside and facing movements [Johnson: 2017]. These movements have different levels of aggression and we are testing to see the duration of time a male betta fish spends in the highest level of aggression in broadside and facing movements respectively, tail flashing and “red mane” [Johnson:2017]. We believe that the focal fish will produce “red mane” or tail flashing for a significent amount of the duration of five minutes in the presence of a fish of the color red and not much “red mane” or tail flashing in the presence of a transparent fish. The reason we believe this is so is due to the fact that dark blue and red are considered to be “fighting colors” [Johnson:2017]. Due to this, we believe that it is more likely for the focal fish to show a large amount of aggression towards the fish with the “fighting color”, red, than a transparent color [Johnson:2017].


Materials and Method:
In the experimentation, we will have two live male betta fish that are red and transparent, all separated into separate tanks, with no interaction with one another. In the center tank, we will have a focal fish, who we will test the aggression of.  There will be three replicates of the focal fish. Each focal betta will be in the presence of each the red and the transparent fish for a duration of five minutes and significent rest in between [Johnson: 2017]. During each trial, we will observe the focal betta and the duration of time the focal betta uses either tail flashing (broadside) or “red mane” (facing) throughout the entirety of the trial [Johnson: 2017]. We will then record the time in the trial that the betta spent in these two aggressive behaviors on the table. We will apply a one tailed paired t_test to this experiment in order to compare the mean time of the focal fish showing aggression to either the transparent fish or the red fish [Johnson:2017].



Results:
After using a one tailed paired t_test, we were able to acquire the p_value of p= .405. The focal fish had a higher mean time in the aggressive states of red mane and tail flashing while in the presence of the transparent betta fish as compared to the focal fish in the presence of the red betta fish (refer to figure one, above, for reference).


Discussion:
After completing the experiment, the results show that our hypothesis cannot be supported. Our p_value was .405, which is well above the value of .05, showing that we have no statistical significance to prove our hypothesis. Therefore, there is no certainty that a betta fish of the color red is more likely to create aggressive behaviors such as “red mane” and tail flashing in a focal fish, as opposed to a transparent fish in the presence of the same focal fish. Though red is one of the two colors of aggression, (the other being blue) [Johnson: 2017]it is likely not a main factor that contributes to the overall level of aggression that is portrayed by a fish. We think that it is likely that habituation of the bettas, after constantly being subjects of experimentation, became a reason the bettas no longer react in the same aggressive manner towards each other. In addition, we believe that rather than color, there are genetic factors that lead some fish to demonstrate more aggressive patterns than others. For further study, it would be interesting to test other genetic components, such as size, to see if that is reasoning for is true. In 2015, an experiment was designed to test how betta fish can be classically conditioned to be aggressive in the presence of various colored light. The experiment found that the bettas showed unconditioned aggressive colors despite, being in the presence of different color lights [Thompson:2015]. This shows a great similarity to our experimentation, because we too had unconditioned aggression of the focal fish to both the red and the transparent betta fish.
