Title: Effect of temperature on photosynthetic rate trends 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a reaction where carbon dioxide and solar radiation are converted into glucose by chemical reactions. In an experiment photosynthetic rates are determined using the Hill Reaction with the use of DCPIP which acts in place of NADP as an electron carrier [Neumann: 1967]. It was hypothesized that the further the temperature was from room temperature the lower the rates of photosynthesis would be.  The cold environment resulted in a significent difference between the room temperature controlll with a large difference in average absorbance after 30 minutes, while the hot environment was not significently different from the controlll. Issues with lighting and duration of the incubation were valid explanations for the insignificance of the hot environment. It was concluded that cold temperatures had a greater effect on photosynthesis with a large decrease in rates, while heat did not have as great as an effect but should have based on primary research which lead to the conclusion that another test would need to be done to reach conclusions about heat’s effect on photosynthetic rate. This research has a broader reach, in changing climates, understanding temperatures effect on photosynthesis will support  development of solutions to help preserve plants in a changing climate.

Introduction:
In an attempt to understand a plants reaction to changing temperature, studying photosynthetic rates would help gain a deeper understanding. With changing climates and differing temperatures it is now an important question as to how plants will handle the extremes, so by monitoring photosynthetic rates, one can begin to understand the process and how temperature will affect the ability of a plant to survive. Photosynthesis, the process which converts light energy and carbon dioxide into glucose, is a process that relies on many different factors. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts use the green pigment chlorophyll in order to absorb solar energy, and excited electrons from the solar energy are then trapped by carrier molecules such as NADPH. These electrons are then transported to the electron transport chain which generates a proton gradient and regenerates electron carriers. ATP synthesis is powered by the proton gradient and the electrons from NADPH and ATP is used in chemical reactions that make glucose from carbon dioxide [Johnson: 2016]. In an experimental environment the chemical DCPIP can be used in place of NADPH in order to determine photosynthetic rate increase or decrease [Neumann: 1967]. This reaction is used because DCPIP is originally blue when added to solution but as it gets reduced the color fades, so when measuring absorbance, a decrease in absorbance signals an increase in photosynthesis because higher photosynthetic rates will result in more reduction 
of DCPIP [Johnson: 2016]. Because photosynthesis relies on many different chemical pathways as well as enzymatic reactions, it is logical to conclude that changing temperature would have an effect on photosynthetic rates. Enzymes only function at their individual idea temperatures, so at a high temperature an enzyme could become denatured or just not function properly, while at lower temperatures enzymes would function slower do to a lack of energy from heat. Previous research shows that photosystem II is the most heat sensitive part of photosynthesis, so it is reasonable to test what the exact effects of varying temperatures are [Song: 2014]. To study the effect of temperature on photosynthetic rates, cold, hot and room temperature will be used, with a hypothesis that the further from room temperature, the more photosynthesis will decrease. The hot water bath will be at or above 43⁰C because previous research indicates this temperature will affect photosynthesis [Song: 2014]. Spinach leaves will be used because chloroplasts are easily extracted from them. The independent variable is temperature with the absorbance of the DCPIP solution as the dependent variable.


Materials and Method:
Initially in this experiment the central veins of four spinach leaves were removed, and then a chilled mortar and pestle was used in addition to 20 Ml of grinding buffer in order to create a thick paste of the spinach. The spinach was strained over cheese cloth and the resulting liquid was centrifuged once at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C, and the resulting supernatant was again centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. The pellet from the second centrifuge was re-suspended in grinding buffer. Ten test tubes were then labeled and in each tube 6 Ml of water was added, 2 Ml of 10 mM DCPIP (with exception of the blank tube), 2Ml of reaction buffer and 100 microliters of chloroplast solution (with exception of the negative controlll). The absorbance at 600 nm was recorded for each tube. The blank, negative controlll, and tubes 4-6 remain in room temperature (23 degrees Celsius), tubes 1-3 are put on ice (zero degrees Celsius), tubes 7-9 were put in a hot water bath (43 degrees Celsius). Every ten minutes for 30 minute the absorbance was recorded and the percent change was calculated between each time increment. Averages of each absorbance per temperature tube as well as the average of the percent change between times and their standard deviations were calculated as well as a two sample one tailed T-test. 


Results:
The results showed a large percent difference between time zero and time 30 at 35.09% difference, while both hot and room remained relatively constant as demonstrated in Figure 2. The average difference and standard deviations between the hot, cold, and room temperature absorbance’s is shown in Figure 1. The two sample one tailed t_test showed that the p_value between hot and room temperature was 0.09 which is not significent. The two sample one tailed t_test between the room and cold temperature resulted in a p value of 0.04 )which is significent. 


Discussion:
The data partially supported the original hypothesis, with the p value for cold environment compared to room temperature being .04 which is statistically significent, while the comparison between room temperature and hot environment was not statistically significent with a p value of .09. There are a few sources of error and potential changes that could result in statistically different data. The first being the lack of light on the hot tubes for the first ten minutes due to a lack of lamp, which could result in lower rates of photosynthesis which is demonstrated by the slight increase in absorbance. Also the samples were only chilled or heated for 30 minutes while in previous studies with statistical differences the samples were incubated for two 12 hour periods [Song: 2014]. The greatest decrease in photosynthetic was rates was evident in the cold environment which was predicted in the hypothesis and supported by other research. It had been found that chilling has a great effect on many aspects of photosynthesis including the electron transport chain, the carbon reduction cycle and controlll of stomatal conductance [Allen, 2001]. However, other studies also found significent difference in photosynthetic rates in extreme heat due to the heat’s effect on metabolic reactions within the pathway, which was not evident in this study but this lack of significance can be attributed to previously described errors [Ruelland: 2010]. In the future repeating this experiment with a longer incubation time with standard lighting conditions would produce more significent results backed by other studies. This study can be amplified to study the potential effects of climate change on plants across the globe. With temperatures rising and more bizarre extreme weather, temperature changes are now a matter of life and the more extreme they become, a large effect on photosynthesis could be seen as demonstrated in this experiment as well in the primary literature. If this experiment was taken further and the exact manner in which temperature change effected photosynthesis was studied, research as to genetic modifications that could create more temperature change resistant plants could also help ensure plant success in a changing climate or allow different plants to be grown in new places in the world.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Absorbance vs Time: the average absorbance’s at each time interval with standard deviation bars. The rate of change in absorbance over time is reflective of the rate of change in photosynthesis, as the absorbance increases, photosynthesis decreases. 
Figure 2. Percent Change vs Time: the average percent differences between the three time intervals of 0-10 minutes, 10-20 minutes and 20-30 minutes. The percent change shows how much the rates change from beginning to end over a time period of 30 minutes.
