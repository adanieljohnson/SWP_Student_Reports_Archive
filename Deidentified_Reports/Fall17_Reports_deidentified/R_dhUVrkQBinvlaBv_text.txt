Title: The Effect of Salinity on the Metabolic Rate of Procambarus

Abstract:
In this lab, the effects of salinity, or the presence of salt ions dissolved in a solution, on Procambarus freshwater crayfish is observed. By measuring the crayfish’s dissolved oxygen consumption, we can calculate specific metabolic rate (SMR) to see how much energy the crayfish uses in order to expel salt ions. As dissolved oxygen decreases, oxygen consumption and SMR increases. In this experiment, each of the three-crayfish acted as its own control. After the control values were recorded, the crayfish was added to a 6.5% solution of NaCl. In two of the three crayfish, SMR increased when placed in the 6.5% NaCl solution chamber. The mean for the control group was calculated at .0012 ± .0010 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1 , and the mean increased to .00126± .00051 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1 when placed in the 6.5% salinity solution. This change yielded a p-value of .4478 and was not considered significant due to it being greater than the alpha value of .05. Salinity increased due to the necessity to expel ions, however due to the fact the solution had a small salt concentration, it cannot be concluded that this change is significant.

Introduction:
Metabolism outlines how quickly an organism is expelling energy in order to maintain life in a homeostatic state. Although processes such as fermentation do not require oxygen intake to proceed, they are very inefficient and yield small amounts of ATP. The cycles in metabolism such as the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain require oxygen in order to produce a maximal amount of ATP, and to be as efficient as possible. Freshwater organisms must expel salt ions from their body in order to make sure cells do not become hypertonic and lose cellular function. To expel ions, active diffusion is used, and this process requires ATP in order to push ions out of the body. This draws a connection between salinity and metabolic rate, along with providing evidence on how oxygen consumption can be used in order to determine metabolic rate.
In this lab, we will be using Procambarus to determine how salinity affects specific metabolic rate (which also takes in to account mass and the volume of water the crayfish was in). This crayfish species is a good candidate for the experiment because it is a freshwater crustacean, meaning salt should throw off their homeostatic balance. Also, the crayfish have a high population and at no risk for extinction, along with the fact they are not going to be harmed in the experiment.  Based on an experiment where milkfish were placed in solutions of different salinities, metabolic rate increased slightly in a 15% salt solution, largely in a 35% salt solution, and slightly in a 55% salt solution due to osmoregulatory costs requiring oxygen for ATP to be produced in order to expel ions out of the milkfish body (Swanson: 1998). Although this milkfish is not a crustacean like the orconectes, similar mechanisms such as active diffusion are being used, and thus similar results should therefor appear. Specific metabolic rate will increase as the crayfish are added to the 6.5% salt solution due to increased need for the release of ATP in order to expel salt ions out of their body and therefore to remain in a homeostatic state.



Materials and Methods:
	First, fill the dishpan with room temperature water (25 degrees Celsius). Then, fill the testing chamber with the same water, and set the testing chamber in the dishpan filled with water. Next, weigh the crayfish, and record the weight. Then, place the crayfish in to the chamber with water, and place the dissolved oxygen probe on top of the testing chamber, making sure the chamber overflows with water. The chamber should be completely filled, and there should be no room for air in the chamber. Next, stabilize the readings on probe to take a baseline reading (t=0). Take dissolved oxygen readings at 5, 10, 15, and 20 mins. Remove dissolved oxygen probe, making sure not to spill any water, then pour water from test chamber in to a graduated cylinder, measuring volume in the chamber. Remove the crayfish from the chamber, and prepare the sodium chloride solution by diluting the salt solution so it is a 1:10 ratio. This is performed by adding 100mL of stock sodium chloride solution, then adding 900mL of distilled water. Then, fill the testing chamber with this solution, and place the crayfish in the solution. Stabilize the readings on dissolved oxygen probe to take a baseline reading, and record dissolved oxygen content at 5,10,15, and 20 min, just as preformed in the control experimentation. After 20 mins, pour the water from the testing chamber to record the volume. All preceding steps need to be repeated exactly for two other crayfish. After all the data is collected for the three crayfish, a statistical mean is calculated for the control and experimental group, and a one tailed paired t-Test is performed in order to compare a calculated p-value to an alpha value of .05 to determine significance.


Results:
The first crayfish had a mass of 28.98 grams, and specific metabolic rate was calculated at .000314 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1. When placed in the 6.5% NaCl solution, the crayfish metabolic rate increased to .00693 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1 .  The second crayfish had a mass of 33.74 grams, specific metabolic rate was calculated at .00101 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1. When placed in the 6.5% NaCl solution, the crayfish’s specific metabolic rate was calculated at .00140 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1.  Lastly, the third crayfish had a mass of 25.12 grams, specific metabolic rate was calculated at .00231 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1. When placed in the 6.5% NaCl solution, the crayfish’s specific metabolic rate was calculated at .00169 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1.  
Overall, the control group showed a mean specific metabolic rate of .0012 ± .0010 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1, and the experimental group’s specific metabolic rate was calculated at .00126± .00051 mg * O2 * g-1 *min-1, resulting in a mean difference of 5.97E-5. The amount of error was calculated by using the standard deviation based on the mean. These averages were used for the one tailed paired t-test in order to determine significance, where n=3, and there were two degrees of freedom. Along with this the standard value of .05 was used for alpha. This t-test produced a t- value of .148, along with a p-value of .4478.
These trends are can be observed in Figure 1, which outlines how the control group’s average specific metabolic rate can be compared to the experimental group’s specific metabolic rate. In this graph, standard deviation error bars were utilized, where in the control group this was calculated at .00101 and in the experimental group this was calculated at .00051.
	The experimental design and process worked well, except the dissolved oxygen probe needed to be stirred every couple of minutes to make sure it is recording correctly. Although we confirmed the lid was screwed on tightly, without moving the probe around a little bit the dissolved oxygen readings showed minimal change. We made sure to keep this process standardized throughout the different testing groups, so any error in our readings should be small and would defiantly be systematic.  

 


Discussion:
Due to the fact that the p-value was .4478, our null hypothesis should be supported, and the alternate hypothesis should be rejected, meaning the addition of salt ions in the solution did not have a significant effect on the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. Although two of the three crayfish showed increased metabolic rates after placed in the salt solution, the last crayfish showed no increase, and actually decreased its metabolic rate after being placed in the salt solution. This can be attributed to how the percent of salt present in the solution has a direct effect on the metabolic rate of the organism. In the case study, the 15% percent and the 55% solutions yielded comparatively similar oxygen consumption rates, and the 35% solution increased oxygen consumption the greatest due to the greatest cost for osmoregulatory needs within the blood of the organism (Swanson 1998). This same concept can be applied to our organism, where because we were only able to obtain a 6.5% salinity solution, the crayfish does experience in increase in specific metabolic rate due to osmoregulatory needs within the organism, however due to the fact that we were limited to a 6.5% NaCl solution as opposed to larger concentrations examined in previous studies, this increase cannot be deemed significant. This idea provides a very crucial limitation we faced in this experiment, where an increased concentration in the NaCl solution could have led the results to show a larger, more significant increase in specific metabolic rate for the three crayfish.  One other limitation we faced was a small sample size, where an increased sample size could have led us to a more precise statistical mean. A future study includes creating an experiment similar to the milkfish experiment, where differing concentrations of a salt solution are used in order to see what concentration provides the highest specific metabolic rate. This can be used to draw a parallel between concentration of salt ions and optimal osmoregulatory costs for the crayfish. This experimental plan could also indicate at which concentration of a salt solution will cause the maximal specific metabolic rate, and if going past this point will cause metabolic rate to increase within the crayfish.
