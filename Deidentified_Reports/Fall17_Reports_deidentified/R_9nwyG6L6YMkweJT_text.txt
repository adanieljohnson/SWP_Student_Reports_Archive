Title: The effect of various temperatures on photosynthesis occurring in the chloroplasts of Brassica oleraca var. sabellica

Abstract:
Whether directly or indirectly, the process of photosynthesis effects every living organism. This process refers to when an organism consumes light energy and converts it to glucose through a number of different steps. Since photosynthesis is such a complex process, there are many external factors that can influence an organisms photosynthetic rate. This experiment focuses on the effect of temperature on photosynthesis, specifically in Brassica oleraca var. sabellica chloroplasts. This experiment was conducted by isolating the chloroplasts of Brassica oleraca var. sabellica and placing them in three different temperatures: -1oC, ~23oC, and 30oC. The change in absorbance for each group was recorded over a time interval of 30 minutes, and used to calculate the change in photosynthetic rate. We hypothesized that the room temperature samples would have the highest rate of photosynthesis, the cold temperature the lowest, and the hot temperature samples somewhere in between. Our results showed that there was no significent difference between the photosynthetic rate of reach temperature, and therefore we accepted our null hypothesis. This insignificent difference could be a result of the fact that Brassica oleraca var. sabellica is a frost resistant plant and can sustain life in many

Introduction:
In this lab, we explored the effect of temperature on the photosynthesis of Brassica oleraca var. sabellica chloroplasts; which are commonly known as kale leaves. Photosynthesis, a process that is key to most life on earth, refers to when organisms use sunlight to synthesize glucose. The glucose created is broken down and used as energy in other biological processes throughout the organism. The chloroplast, which is a specific subunit of the cell, is where all of photosynthetic activity occurs. Since chloroplasts are the hotspots for photosynthesis, we isolated and focused on them during this lab. In the chloroplast, photosynthesis occurs in a three step process. Two of these steps are light-dependent reactions, meaning they use light energy to drive the processes that ultimately set the stage for ATP synthesis. The last step is a light-independent reaction, which ultimately synthesizes 6-carbon glucose molecules without using light energy [Johnson: 2016] Since photosynthesis is a complex process with several mechanisms involved, there are multiple factors that can influence photosynthetic rate. One crucial environmental factor that influences photosynthesis is temperature.   
To get a closer look on how temperature can influence photosynthesis in kale chloroplasts, we measured the effects of three different temperatures. Specifically, we tested the effects of cold temperature (-1oC,) room temperature (~23oC), and hot temperature (30oC) on the absorbance of the chloroplasts. Absorbance is indirectly correlated with photosynthetic activity; meaning as one goes down the other variable increases. 
With this knowledge, we hypothesized that the kale chloroplasts would have the lowest absorbance and the highest photosynthetic activity at room temperature. We predicted this because the optimal temperature for kale to grow at is ~18.3oC [Lefsrud: 2008]. This optimal temperature is closest to the range of room temperature, which is 20-25oC. Since photosynthesis is the process by which plants produce the energy needed to grow, we hypothesized that the optimal growing temperature will also be the environment where the highest photosynthetic activity occurs. 
Furthermore, we predicted that the lowest rate of photosynthesis would occur in cold environment samples. We expected this because the enzyme RUBISCO works optimally in temperatures ranging from 10o-40oC [Bernacchi: 2002]. RUBISCO is the enzyme responsible for converting CO2 into usable sugar during the light independent reaction of photosynthesis. Since the cold conditions were under this range at -1oC, we predicted that RUBISCO would be deactivated in the cold temperature condition and therefore no glucose would be produced. This means that the third step of photosynthesis would not occur and photosynthetic rate would not increase. With this, we expected the absorbance to not decrease overtime. 
This topic is important to study because photosynthesis effects all living organisms. Understanding the effects of temperature on photosynthesis and plant growth could lead to a better understanding of how to handle food growth. This knowledge could potentially be used to improve our agricultural system overtime. 


Materials and Method:
First, all the materials needed were placed into a tub of crushed ice to cool. This included: mortar and pestle, medium sized beaker, and 3 50Ml centrifuge tubes. 4 large kale leaves were isolated and placed into the mortar and pestle. 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer was added to the leaves, and grinded until the kale was a thick paste with no large chunks. After 10 additional Ml were added, the kale slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. 
The B pellet was prepared by putting the kale slurry into the RT-7 centrifuge twice, first for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm, then for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm. The liquid of the slurry was removed, and the remaining pellet was suspended using 20 Ml of grinding buffer. The re-suspended pellet was use for the rest of the experiment as the source of chloroplasts. 13 test tubes were gathered and placed in a tube rack. 13 total substances were made, following the preparation guidelines in Table 1. There were 4 substances for each of the three temperatures, one in each group containing no chloroplasts. One blank solution was prepared. After numbering 13 spectrophotometer cuvettes 0-12, the tubes were transferred to the corresponding cuvettes. The cuvette containing the blank solution was used to zero to spectrophotometer, and following the next 12 cuvettes were placed in the spectrophotometer. This served as the absorbance reading for each substance at 0 minutes. Tubes 1-4 were placed in the ice bath of -1oC, tubes 5-8 in room temperature of ~23oC, and 9-12 in a heat bath of 30oC. After 10 minutes the tubes were put in the corresponding cuvettes again and measured for absorbance. This process was repeated again after 20 and 30 minutes passed. 
With all of the data collected, percent change in absorbance after each time interval was calculated. This data was used to make Figures 1, 2 and 3 comparing change in absorbance overtime. 


Results:
Our results show that the chloroplasts in room temperature had the greatest decrease in absorbance over 30 minutes (see Figure 1). The room temperature samples had an average decrease of 23.65%. This means that the room temperature tubes had the highest rate of photosynthesis. This was over 2/3 greater than the decrease of absorbance in the hot environment, which was a 7.72% decrease (see Figure 2). After room temperature, the samples that had the largest decrease in absorbance over 30 minutes was the cold temperature samples. The samples in the cold environment had a decrease of 14.86%. Overall, our data shows that the room temperature samples had the highest rate of photosynthesis, while the hot condition samples had the lowest, and the cold condition samples fell somewhere in between. 
	Although it seems as if there is a substantial difference in the percent decreases found in the raw data, the ANOVA test preformed shows that there is no significent difference in our data. In Table 2, the ANOVA calculated a p_value of 0.235. If the p_value were less than or equal to 0.05, we would conclude that there was a significent difference. Since the p_value is larger than 0.05, we concluded that there is no scientifically significent difference between the three groups tested.  


Discussion:
Due to our insignificent results, we accept our null hypothesis. We conclude that the difference temperatures did not have a scientifically significent effect on photosynthetic rate. One reason that the photosynthetic rate did not change in response to changes in temperature could be because kale is a frost resistant plant. Kale is usually grown in the fall and can survive temperatures as cold as -15oC. [Zietz: 2010] This means that cold temperature has little negative effect on kale growth, which explains why photosynthesis did not decrease a substantial amount like we expected. 
Another reason that our results may be insignificent is because out temperatures were not extreme enough. Although kale does have an optimal growth temperature of ~18.3oC, it has the ability to sustain life in a wide range of temperatures, from -15o to around 30o C. [Lefsrud: 2008] With this in mind, in a follow up experiment we could test more extreme temperatures. The extreme temperatures could potentially have a greater effect on the rate of photosynthesis taking place, and ultimately lead to significent results. 
Another change that we could make in a follow up experiment is increase the time of the experiment. One reason that the data may be insignificent could be because we did not give each sample enough time to fully experience the new temperature. If we extended our time testing from 30 minutes to 2 hours, the temperature change could have a bigger effect on the reactions occurring. This could potentially lead to the collection of significent data. 
Overall, exploring the effects of environmental factors such as temperature on photosynthesis helps us to better understand the process as a whole. Increasing our knowledge about this process can potentially change the how, when, and where we grow specific plants. Altering the way in which we grow plants based on their response to environmental factors can potentially improve the efficiency of our agricultural system as a whole.
