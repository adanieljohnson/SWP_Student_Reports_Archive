Title: Effect of 3 pH buffer on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus s.p

Abstract:
Metabolic pathways allow an organism to engage with its environment. We used an oxygen probe to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration of a crayfish inside of a testing container to compare the effects of acidic conditions on metabolic pathways. The model organism of our experiment, Procambarus s.p, is a good model system because of their accessibility for laboratory research. Each crayfish served as its own control and experimental group, because each crayfish was tested in the control testing chamber and then placed in the acidic testing chamber. Our hypothesis was that control specific metabolic rates were higher than that of the acidic metabolic rates. The average metabolic rates (in minutes) were calculated to be: average control metabolic rate for 20 minutes = 0.001 ± 0.00151, average control metabolic rate for 10 minutes = 0.00102 ± 0.00204, average experimental metabolic rate for 20 minutes = 0.00026 ± 0.00046, average experimental metabolic rate for 10 minutes = 0.00032 ± 0.00045. Even though our data is not statistically significant (t-stat = 3.730, P = 0.0649, df = 2 and t-stat = 3.175, P = 0.0865, df = 2), there is evidence to show that acidic conditions lower metabolic processes. 

Introduction:
An organism’s response to its environment and how it performs its necessary functions are driven by its metabolic pathways. When an organism uses glucose for energy, the carbon and oxygen atoms from the carbon are converted into carbon dioxide. These same reactions release electrons that are captured by molecules which allow the electrons to be transported in order for ADP to be turned into ATP. Mitochondria in the cell use the ATP as energy, where oxygen is used to keep the reaction moving.  However due to its complexity, metabolism is hard to measure from reaction to reaction. An indirect and efficient way to measure metabolic processes is to measure the oxygen intake and carbon dioxide production of that organism (Johnson: 2017). In an experiment performed on the Australian crayfish species Cherax destructor, the common yabby, it was found that the environmental pH caused the crayfish to have a spike in their oxygen intake, but eventually leveled off (Ellis: 1995). Although when introduced to acidic conditions, the major aerobic and anaerobic processes were depressed (Ellis: 1995). Since Cherax destructor has become a vulnerable species the importance of studying it has become more concerning (Crandall: 1996).  This led us to question are more common species of crayfish less susceptible to acidic conditions? We will be using a species of crayfish in the genus Procambarus s.p. a more common and accessible group of crayfish as our model organism. The hypothesis that will be tested is that acidic pH levels will cause the crayfish to have a lower metabolic rate. To measure the metabolic rate, oxygen levels will be measured and used to calculate the specific metabolic rate.  

Materials and Methods:
Prior to beginning the experiment, the crayfish were kept in pens following institutional standards at Wake Forest University and were taken off the holding apparatus when the experiment was being performed. The testing container was filled with room temperature water at approximately 22 °C and placed inside of a plastic dishpan also filled with room temperature water. This allowed for the temperature of the testing container to remain as constant as possible. A pH probe was placed inside of the testing container to allow for a control pH to be measured between 6-7 pH. A crayfish was taken out of its holding pen, its mass was measured, and it was placed inside of the testing container. Enough water was put into the testing container so when the oxygen probe was placed inside of the container, water over flowed which allowed for complete saturation. When the oxygen probe was inserted into the testing chamber a baseline reading was allowed to be measured, then at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, the dissolved oxygen levels were measured. At the end of twenty minutes the water from the testing chamber was poured into a graduated cylinder and the volume was recorded. The crayfish was then placed inside of another chamber that was prepared with 3 pH buffer solution also at room temperature of approximately 22 °C. A pH probe was used to ensure a pH of approximately 3. The oxygen probe was then placed into the pH testing chamber and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, the dissolved oxygen levels were measured. At the end of twenty minutes the water from the pH testing chamber was poured in to a graduated cylinder and the volume was recorded. After being tested, the crayfish was put back into its holding pen and onto the holding apparatus. This process was repeated for each of the three crayfish since each crayfish served as its own control and experimental group. A two-tailed statistical test was used to analyze the statistical values of the collected data. 

Results:
A two tailed T-test was used to examine the data. The average metabolic rate of the control group was greater than the experimental group for both ten and twenty minutes. The calculated metabolic rates (in minutes) were calculated to be: average control metabolic rate for 20 minutes = 0.001 ± 0.00151, average control metabolic rate for 10 minutes = 0.00102 ± 0.00204, average experimental metabolic rate for 20 minutes = 0.00026 ± 0.00046, average experimental metabolic rate for 10 minutes = 0.00032 ± 0.00045. The statistical data for specific metabolic for twenty minutes was calculated to be t-stat = 3.730, P = 0.0649, df = 2 and the statistical data for specific metabolic for ten minutes was calculated to be t-stat = 3.175, P = 0.0865, df = 2.

Discussion:
he metabolism of an organism allows it to preform its daily functions and adapt to its environment. According to our hypothesis, the pH buffer would cause the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish to be lower than in a neutral setting. Although there is a significant difference in the specific metabolic rate, our null hypothesis could not be rejected. Our hypothesis was not statistically supported (t-stat = 3.730, P = 0.0649, df = 2 and t-stat = 3.175, P = 0.0865, df = 2). However, our experiment still provided viable results. Even though our p-value did not meet the accepted level of significance there was a strong trend that showed the pH buffer lowered the metabolic rate of the crayfish. When the experiment was preformed on the Australian yabby, at least six crayfish were used to perform the experiment and they found that acidic conditions lowered the metabolic rate (Ellis: 1995). Therefore, using more crayfish would have a high likelihood of increasing the finding of statistically significant data. Biologically, this means that having a lower metabolic rate hinders the crayfish from being able to preform its necessary functions.The next step of this experiment would be to confirm the notion of using more crayfish to gain a better variety of data and expanding the scope of the experiment by also testing the effects of basic conditions on metabolic processes. It would also be interesting to see the effects of acidity on keystone species such as trout. Since it is known that acidity plays an equal role on the metabolism of crustaceans, analyzing the effect of acidity on other significance species could allow for a better understanding on the implications of human impacts on animal metabolic pathways.
