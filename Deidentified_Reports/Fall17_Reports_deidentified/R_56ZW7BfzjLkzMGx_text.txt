Title: Intraspecific and Interspecific Competition in Vigna radiata and Avena sativa 

Abstract:
The Introduction introduces the two different plant species, Vigna radiate and Avena sativa, used in the experiment. The introduction also explained the general ideas of plant phenotypic plasticity and why we expected Avena sativa to have a higher root to shoot ratio than Vigna radiate, when grown together. The Method section explains how we carried out the experiment, as well as why we chose the t_test as the statistical test we performed once we completed the experiment and obtained our data. The Results section simply stated our data that we obtained from the experiment. The Discussion section explained why our hypothesis was only partially supported, while also exploring options for further experiments that could further test our hypothesis, and related these to other experiments that have been performed and published. 


Introduction:
Plants interact with the biotic and abiotic factors in their environments. As a result, plants may allocate their resources depending on how they are interacting with these factors at any given time. We will be exploring the patterns in which plants allocate their resources under different conditions, specifically when faced with intraspecific competition and interspecific competition. Competition in plant communities is commonly characterized as the negative effects that plants have on one another in regards to resources. Competition is an important topic to study in biology, as it explains how plants allocate their resources in the presence of different plants, and in different environments. This will be even more important in coming years, as climate change continues to change and shape the way plants allocate their resources. An article from “Science Daily” explores the idea that perhaps phenotypic plasticity will allow plants to change their structure and functions in response to climate change. Studies such as this one can help determine the future of plants as they begin to face changing environments, by looking at both intraspecific and interspecific competition. Avena sativa, commonly known as oat plants, are more phenotypically plastic than Vigna radiata, also known as mung beans. We will observe the different root to shoot ratio of two different species in two different states. We will collect data on the root to shoot ratios of both plant length and plant weight. We will collect data from Avena sativa and Vigna radiata that have been growing by themselves in separate pots with the same kind of soil. We will also collect data on the root to shoot ratios of the Avena sativa and Vigna radiata as they grow in the same pots with the same king of soil. If the Avena sativa and Vigna radiata are growing by themselves in the same kind of soil, then the root to shoot ratio in regards to weight and length will be lower than the root to shoot ratios of the two plants while they are growing in the same pot. If Avena sativa and Vigna radiata are grown together in the same pot with the same soil, then Avena sativa will have a higher root to shoot ratio in both length and weight.


Materials and Method:
We will plant three containers of plant species in each of the conditions. There will be three containers of Vigna radiata alone, three containers of Avena sativa alone, and three containers of Vigna radiata and Avena sativa together. Both plant species will be planted in the same manner, and will be watered on the same schedule. Both plant species, when planted together and apart, will be planted in the same kind of pots with the same kind of soil. The plants, when grown apart, will be grown with 50 seeds in each pot. When the plants are planted together, then there will be 25 seeds in each pot, so the total number of plants in each of the pots will be the same. We will harvest five individual plants from each container of plants. To harvest the plants, break apart the vermiculite to separate the roots of the individual plants. Wash and dry the plants. Weigh the plant as a whole and record the data. Separate the roots from the shoots of the plant. Make sure to cut the plant in the same place so the date is not affected. Calculate the root mass (total mass – shoot mass). Measure maximum shoot length and root length. Record the mean values. Calculate P values. For the t_test, compare the root to shoot ratio of the Vigna radiata planted alone to the root to shoot ratio of the Vigna radiata and Avena sativa planted together. Then compare the root to shoot ratio of the Avena sativa planted alone to the root to shoot ratio of the Vigna radiata and Avena sativa planted together

Results:
The weight root to shoot ratios of Avena sativa grown alone was higher than any of the other plants in any of the other conditions. The average weight root to shoot ratio of Avena sativa grown alone was 1.32. The average weight root to shoot ratio of Avena sativa grown with Vigna radiata was 1.11. The average weight root to shoot ratio of Vigna radiata grown alone was 0.77. The average weight root to shoot ratio of Vigna radiata grown with Avena sativa was 0.58. For the average length root to shoot ratio, Avena sativa grown with Vigna radiata had the largest at 1.30. Avena sativa grown with alone had an average length root to shoot ratio of 0.68. Vigna radiata grown alone had an average length root to shoot ratio of 0.68. Vigna radiata grown with Avena sativa had an average length root to shoot ratio of 0.86.  The p value for the t_test comparing the length root to shoot ratio of Avena sativa grown alone with the length root to shoot ratio of Avena sativa grown with Vigna radiata was 0.0014. The p value for the t_test comparing the weight root to shoot ratio of Vigna radiata grown alone with the weight root to shoot ratio of Vigna radiata grown with Avena sativa was 0.0169.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was partially supported, as we hypothesized that if the Avena sativa and Vigna radiata are growing by themselves in the same kind of soil, then the root to shoot ratio in regards to weight and length will be lower than the root to shoot ratios of the two plants while they are growing in the same pot. This was not completely supported by our data, as the average weight root to shoot ratio was higher when the two plant species were grown separately as opposed to when they were planted together. Our hypothesis was partially correct, however, as the average length root to shoot ratio was higher in the Avena sativa grown with Vigna radiata, but the average length root to shoot ratio of Vigna radiata was higher when it was grown alone which goes against our hypothesis. Avena sativa could have had a higher average length root to shoot ratio when grown with Vigna radiata because it is more phenotypically plastic, and therefor does better in competition because it is able to allocate its resources better, and thus has a higher average length root to shoot ratio. We also hypothesized that if Avena sativa and Vigna radiata are grown together in the same pot with the same soil, then Avena sativa will have a higher root to shoot ratio in both length and weight. This part of our hypothesis was proven to be correct with our data, as Avena sativa had a higher average weight and length root to shoot ratio as compared to the average eight and length root to shoot ratio of Vigna radiata. This could also be attributed to the phenotypic plasticity of Avena sativa, as this allows for the plant to allocate its resources more efficiently, and thus it adapts better when in interspecific competition. While Avena sativa was able to easily adapt in our experiment, that is not always the case, as there are ecological limits to plant phenotypic plasticity. This idea was heavily discussed in a study found online [Valladares, 2007]. In the article, the author explores the limits to phenotypic plasticity. Perhaps if we were to continue to run this experiment, placing Avena sativa under increasingly harsh conditions, then we would see that there is a limit to the plasticity of the plant. This limit in phenotypic plasticity is reached when the cost of adapting to the environment begins to outweigh the benefits of these adaptation. This idea is further supported by two articles [Dai, 2] [Nicotra, 2010]. The article from Nicotra takes this notion of phenotypic plasticity a step further, as it explores the notion that perhaps phenotypic plasticity will allow plants to change their structure and functions in response to climate change. If we were to run our experiment with this in mind, perhaps we could predict how certain kinds of plants will change and adapt as a result of climate change in specific regions of the United States. This phenotypic plasticity allows for plants to adapt and change in the face of their environment, but there is a limit to this. In order to discover this limit for a specific plant species, however, we would need to run many different experiments and change the variables so we could completely understand the plant’s plasticity.
