Title: Increased H2O levels results in Decreased Root to Shoot Ratio in Field Peas (Pisum sativun L.)

Abstract:
Resource allocation of Pisum sativun, or field peas, is investigated, and how the allocation of resources can be observed from the root to shoot ratios. Prior research suggested that field peas are more adapted to dry, arid, drought-like environments supporting the results of this experiment. We hypothesized that with an increase in the amount of water given to field peas, the root to shoot ratio for both mass and length will decrease. Six planting pots with several field pea seeds were planted to observe three controllls and three experimental conditions. The controlll conditions were treated with a normal amount of water, and the experimental conditions were manipulated with an increased amount of water. The results supported the hypothesis, and the increased water prompted a decrease in root-shoot ratios. 

Introduction:
Plants are complex organisms that require balanced function and resource use to survive in a changing environment. The resources obtained from the environment are allocated to various plant parts and emphasizes the importance of communication within the plant. Under changing environmental conditions, shifts in allocation patterns are necessary and have been proven to maximize plant growth. [Bazzaz: 2008]. Pisum sativun, a species of field peas, are cool-season legume plants that are grown all over the world. They are considered “dry peas” because unlike other types of peas, field peas are sold as a dry, shelled product. Field peas are known for having shallow root systems, and high-water efficiency which allows field peas to survive in arid areas where moisture conservation is crucial. [McKay: 2003] In this experiment, resource allocation of field peas is investigated, and how this can be observed from the root to shoot ratios. Root to shoot ratios can be defined as the dry weight of root biomass, divided by the dry weight of shoot biomass. Length is dealt with in the same respect [Rogers: 1995]. We hypothesized that increasing the amount of water given to field peas would decrease the root to shoot ratios for both mass and length. The normal water treatment will act as the controlll variable, and the high-water treatment will act as the experimental variable. Field peas were chosen for this experiment because they are easy to work with and can provide accurate results.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, six plastic planting pots were obtained and filled with nutrient-rich soil (about 50Ml of Miracle Grow); three used for low water level manipulation and three used for high water level manipulation. The normal water treatment (100 Ml) can be considered the controlll variable for the experiment, leaving the increased water manipulation as the experimental variable. Several field pea seeds were planted in each pot. All the pots were placed in direct sunlight and kept at a constant temperature. All the field pea seeds were given roughly 14 days to sufficiently grow, while low water level pots were watered half as much as high water level pots. Each pot was watered every other day, giving 500 Ml to the experimental plants and 100 Ml to the controlll plants. To harvest the data, each pot was dismantled and each replicate per pot was uprooted and rinsed with distilled water to rid of any excess dirt. Each full plant replicate was weighed on the balance and the mass was recorded, along with the length using a ruler. Six replicates were used for both experimental and controlll groups. The root and shoots were separated with scissors and weighed separately to obtain an individual mass. Roots and shoots were also each measured for a length value. These values were recorded and root to shoot ratios were calculated for mass and length, for both low water level and high-water level manipulation. The mass or length of the root was divided by the mass or length of the shoot and mean values were calculated, along with standard deviation values. A two-sample t_test (two-tailed) was performed on both root-shoot ratio data sets (mass and length) for normal water treatment (controlll) and increased water treatment (experimental). 

Results:
The root-shoot mass ratio of the controlll variable (0.81±0.38) is greater than the experimental variable (0.216±0.081) supporting the hypothesis (Figure 1). The root-shoot length ratio of the controlll variable (1.35±0.324) is greater than the experimental variable (0.588±0.087) also supporting the hypothesis (Figure 2). The mean of the controlll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group, for both mass (t_stat=3.740492, d.f.=10, P=0.003843) and length (t_stat=5.527439, d.f.=10, P=0.000252). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis for the experiment predicted there would be a decrease in root-shoot ratios if the field peas were given an increased amount of water. The hypothesis for the experiment was supported, showing a decrease in the root-shoot ratio values for the experimental group for both mass and length. The hypothesis was formed based off research that indicated that field peas are more adapted to dry, arid regions [McKay: 2003]. The results show strong significance, producing p_values that are much less than 0.05. The method of resource allocation in field peas proved to be different than other plants, or those that are adapted to a high moisture environment. In order for plants to survive, integration of incoming stimuli from both above and below ground is necessary to enhance its functions to survive if resources are limited or to flourish if they are not [Rogers: 2008]. Depending on the environment and other abiotic conditions, the genetically determined allocation pattern can be altered [Johnson: 2017]. In the present experiment, the altered environment, or the experimental group of field peas proved that the short root systems of field peas are genetically designed to thrive in dry environments. This explains why the root-shoot length ratios in low water are greater than those in high water. Excess water caused the field peas to allocate necessary resources away from the roots to counteract the surplus of water. In other words, the genetic makeup of field peas is meant for dry environments, and the surplus of water given to the experimental group forced the roots to allocate the resources to the shoots because the surplus of water is not needed. Future experiments could be done with other species of plants to see how the larger water intake impacts the root-shoot ratio. Proper research done on the plant species and its ideal environment is vital in developing strong supporting results. Within a broader sense, in the grand scheme of ecology and evolution, impending climate change could cause precipitation to increase. Overtime, field peas could adapt to the climate change, or conversely, cause a threat to field pea populations.
