Title: The Effect of Carbonation on Specific Metabolic Rate

Abstract:
Procambris sp. specimens were tested in this lab to observe the effects of water carbonation on metabolic rate. Oxygen consumption over the course of 20 minutes was measured and recorded in both oxygenated and carbonated water, and these results were used to calculate specific metabolic rate of each crayfish tested.  It was hypothesized that the SMRs of the crayfish would increase in carbonated water, as they would have to expend more energy (which is directly proportional to oxygen consumption) to obtain oxygen from the polluted water. The SMR values when compared did not show a clear trend: the first test subject did show the expected behavior, but the other two did not. A paired t_test confirmed with a p value of 0.549 that the results of the experiment were not statistically significent.


Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to observe the changes in metabolic rate of crayfish between oxygenated and carbonated water at room temperature. Oxygen consumption is directly proportional to metabolic rate (Johnson, 2008), due to the fact that ATP is utilized for cellular function. To make more ATP, oxygen is needed, which means that the organism must consume oxygen at a rate proportional to their metabolism. Therefore, the conversion of consumption value to specific metabolic rate is possible. Crayfish live in freshwater environments and are extremely susceptible to pollution (Fitzgerald, 2006); it has a drastic negative effect on the growth and bodily functions on the organisms, particularly pollution that causes a decrease in the pH of the surrounding water. CO2 when it is dissolved in water produces carbonic acid, a weak acid that would bring the pH of the environment lower than the normal, tolerable pH that the crayfish thrive in. As tested by Kilian and Ciccotto in their study of freshwater crayfish for farming purposes in 2014, crayfish are expected to be able to perform at full function at a pH range of 7-8.5 (Kilian et al., 2014). The organisms in a lower pH would have to exert more energy in obtaining oxygen to supply their normal functions, thereby increasing the specific metabolic rate. It more strenuous for the crayfish to obtain the same levels of oxygen, and this is represented in a higher oxygen consumption level. By placing the crayfish tested in this experiment in carbonated and therefore more acidic water, it is hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. subjects will be higher than in the normal water.


Materials and Method:
Three medium to large specimen of Procambris sp. are placed in holding chambers of oxygenated water. A testing chamber consisting of a large mason jar and an oxygen probe is filled with filtered, room temperature water to the point where it is slightly overflowing. A crayfish is placed in this chamber, and the top is securely screwed on without allowing air into the jar. The chamber is then placed into a bucket of room temperature water up to the neck. The oxygen probe is connected to a dissolved oxygen instrument, and the oxygen consumption level is recorded every 5 minutes for up to 20 minutes. Once this time has elapsed, the water from the chamber is poured out into a graduated cylinder to obtain its exact volume. If possible, the crayfish is kept inside the chamber using a net.  100 Ml of 22 degrees Celsius carbonated water from a can is poured into the chamber, and the remaining 900 Ml is filled with regular filtered water. The same process is carried out again in the carbonated water, with the oxygen consumption recorded every five minutes up to 20 minutes and the volume of the water in the chamber measured in a graduated cylinder. After the completion of this second step, the crayfish is returned to its holding chamber. This entire process is repeated three times, each with a different crayfish. SMR is calculated by multiplying the difference between the starting oxygen value in the chamber and the remaining after 20 minutes by the volume of the container, then dividing that value by the time measured times the mass of the crayfish. Once these value are acquired, the SMR values are inputted into a paired T-test template to confirm significance of data. 


Results:
The specimen weights, O2 changes in water, volume of water in chamber, and time elapsed in experiment were recorded and utilized to calculate the specific metabolic rates of each crayfish. The average SMR for the oxygenated water was 0.0017 with a standard deviation of 0.00053, and the average for the carbonated water was 0.0012 with a standard deviation of 0.00107. No significent trend of increase or decrease of the SMR values for the specimens tested was observed. A paired t_test was conducted to verify the correlation of the results. The p_value came out to be 0.549, which indicates that the results had no clear significance.


Discussion:
Upon analyzing the results of the experiment, it was found that carbonation in water at the concentration added had no effect on SMR. There was no significent difference between groups tested, and therefore no trend can be drawn from the data. In a test on freshwater prawns, a species similar in structure and function of the crayfish studied, test subjects placed in water adjusted with pH lowered from 7 to 5.8 experienced impaired function in feeding, growth, and activity (Chen, 2003). This experiment found that the metabolic rate of the prawns increased, and it was hypothesized in this study that this result was due to difficulty of absorbing oxygen from the acidic water, causing greater energy expenditure. The SMR for these organisms increased, as their oxygen consumption and energy used increased. This was the result expected from all three specimens tested in the carbonation and oxygenated water. As the pH was lowered in the oxygenated water when the carbonated water was added, the Procambris sp. specimens could be expected to act in a similar manner as to those in this experiment conducted by Chen. The outcome of the experiment conducted in lab may have been the result of multiple errors. The amount of carbonated water poured into the test chamber may have been too high, and this could have caused a shock to the system of the animal or could have driven specimens to exhaustion trying to keep up and increase their SMR. In a future study, the number of crayfish used in the experiment should be significently increased, as there was so much variation in the results of this experiment. More test subjects would have provided more data to view a trend, and would reduce speculation into personal error that could have occurred during the lab. Also, a lab could be conducted where pH is the primary focus, using weak acids to lower pH levels in oxygenated water instead of carbonated water to accurately record the direct effects on one variable change.

Figure Legends: 
This graph is a visual representation of the comparison of the calculated SMRs between the controlll and experimental groups. The bars are representative of the average SMRs of the oxygenated water (controlll) and the carbonated water (experimental). The standard deviations are also included, and can be viewed at the end of the bars on the graph. The SD for the oxygenated water average was 0.00053, and for the carbonated water was 0.00109.
