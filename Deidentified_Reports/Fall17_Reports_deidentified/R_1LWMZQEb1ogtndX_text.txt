Title: Betta splendins Reaction to Red and Blue Artificial Objects

Abstract:
	Betta splendins area a commonly domesticated fish that can be red, blue, green, or yellow and display apparent intraspecific behaviors between males. Using red, blue, and white artificial objects we predicted there would be a difference in reaction to the red and blue stimuli. Our results indicated no significent different between any of the objects, with the mean of the percent of time spent on the artificial object side 33.67 ± 29.87, 42.67 ± 30.02, 66.33 ± 28.68 for blue, red, and white respectively. Because of the stagnation of the objects, the Betta splendins had no reason to produce an agnostic (aggressive) reaction to the stimuli or any interest at all as they posed no threat. If aquatic species reacted to every single object that carried the same color as a rival member of their own species or a predator, they would have no energy to care for themselves and reproduce. In our experiment, distinguishing color and a threat of a stimuli are linked to natural selection.

Introduction:
	Ethology is the study of animal behavior. It looks at the how certain animal behaviors have been shaped by evolution, selection, and the subsequent physiological purposes of these actions. Ethologists focus on seeing the world as the animal sees it, attempting to define the genetic, physiological, and learned actions and factors of animal behavior. Observation is used to collect data on animal behavior as researchers must witness the reactions of the animals to the new stimuli (Johnson: 2017).
	In this lab our test subject was the Betta splendins, also known as the Siamese fighting fish. They are common domesticated fish colored brilliant reds, blues, greens, and yellows. Originating in Thailand, in the wild they are typically dark, dull colors living in overgrown ponds and slow-moving waters like rice patties and streams. So called fighting fish as they express obvious intraspecific agnostic behaviors. Male betta fish display broadside and facing agnostic movements in the presence of another male to assert their dominance and win the better mate. These same behaviors are shown in the presence of a female in courtship to bring her to his nest. In this species it is the males who guard the nest and provide parental care. The Betta splendins typically lives for about 2 years (Sturgeon: 2001).
	In our experiment we tested the Betta splendins reaction to the color of artificial objects. We used artificial male betta fish shapes, resembling a broadside agnostic (aggressive) behavior to examine their reaction to red, blue, and white colors. A study done on betta fish to determine how they navigate the dark, murky waters of their habitat prove they can recognize color and have a highly developed sense of spatial orientation. The experiment demonstrated betta fish can associate a color cue with a stimulus fish, distracting colors or fish having no effect on their ability to recall (Luchiari: 2016). It is unclear exactly how betta fish are able to experience color; however, it is clear they can discern between green, blue, red, and yellow.
        Bright red and blue are commonly found colors of betta fish in captivity, we wanted to determine if one color produced more reaction than the other. A study performed on polychromatic Midas cichlids, using four naturally occurring colors of the species, found gold dummies (color of dominance) were generally attacked more aggressively than white, gray, and black (colors of normal). Gold is a fear inducer in this species and brought about the most aggressive reactions from normal cichlids, however, all dummies were approached in about the same manner (Barlow: 1994). We predict there will be a difference in reaction between the blue and red colors in Betta splendins.


Materials and Method:
Experiment:
       We started with three randoMly selected male beta fish (yellow, red, and blue) and ensured they were visually isolated from each other. Using red, blue, and white foam paper, we cut out a male Betta splendins shape from each color (white serving as a controlll), attaching a wire to the top of each artificial fish to keep it down in the water. Next, we agreed on an imaginary line down the middle of the tank to determine which side of the tank the fish was on. For the first male beta fish, we placed the red artificial fish nearly on a wall on one side of the tank, parallel to our imaginary line. In our experiment we associated the betta’s reaction to the foreign object by their proximity to it, assuming they are more curious or aggressive if they spend time near the object. If the Betta was on the side with the object, it was counted as a reaction, if not, counted as no reaction. For three minutes we recorded how long the fish was on the side of the tank with the artificial object, writing down the amount. For three to five minutes, we let the fish rest. We then repeated this process with the blue and white artificial fish. From there the entire process was performed on two more male Betta splendins.

Data Analysis:
	We calculated the percent of the total time each of our test fish spent on the side of the tank with the artificial object. The average of these percentages was then taken and tested for significance between the three colors using an ANOVA and a Tukey-Kramer test. The standard deviation of the three conditions was also included.


Results:
	The mean of the percent of time spent on the artificial object side was 33.67 ± 29.87, 42.67 ± 30.02, 66.33 ± 28.68 for blue, red, and white respectively (Figure 1). Our analysis using an ANOVA (p=.43) yielded no significent difference in percent of time spent on artificial object side.

Discussion:
	The results of our study did not support our original hypothesis predicting a difference in reaction to blue and red colors in male Betta splendins. We found no significance in the percent of three minutes spent near the artificial object. This result be interpreted in many ways, implying different characteristics of betta fish behavior. Siamese fighting fish are highly studied creatures as they have high intra-specific behaviors between males, displaying apparent agnostic reactions to upsetting stimuli. The absence of any sort of aggressive behaviors probably implies these fish did not find the object intimidating or fear inducing. The lack of difference in reaction to blue and red can mean one color is not more upsetting or superior than the other in this species. An interesting note is the higher average reaction to white than the other two naturally occurring colors. Because white is not a typical color of a domesticated betta fish, the test fish were probably more curious about this artificial object and wanted to inspect it further. An overall absence of significance in the difference of reaction means betta fish most likely react equally to rival red or blue fish.
	The lack of reaction by our test betta fish to the artificial fish is consistent with a study performed on Betta splendins about aggression and avoidance to natural and artificial stimuli. Rhoad and colleagues found the most aggressive response to a challenging male betta, and a less aggressive response to a mirror image after a certain amount of habituation. Continuing to an even less response to a moving model and hardly any to a stationary model. The very unnatural feedback illustrated in a moving and stationary model does not mimic the effect of a threatening rival male enough to illicit much response from the test betta (Rhoad: 1975). According to this study, it is no surprise our flat pieces of stationary foam drew little results. However, artificial stimuli are not completely ineffective. A study done using robotic replicas of betta splendins to illicit an aggressive response was extremely effective. Some models drew more of an aggressive response than an actual rival male betta. Romano and colleagues also proved a stationary model was the least effective in providing any reaction or aggression (Figure 2) (Romano: 2017).
	Our results did not support our prediction, however other research proved no reaction to a stationary object was expected. If one color is more reaction inducing than another is still largely unanswered by our experiment. Red, blue, or white, all objects were flat and stationary posing no threat so the test betta fish causing no threat to produce a reaction. If performed again, real betta fish or a convincing robotic replica would provide the best results about reaction and color.
	A nonreaction to stagnant stimuli could be an adaptive response to the type of environment the Betta splendins, and really all aquatic life, dwell in. Underwater ecosystems contain a plethora of vegetation, species, and abiotic features. If, in the wild, a betta fish responded aggressively to anything blue, it would tire itself out to the point of death. A stagnant blue object is no life-threatening object, simply a part of the vegetation around or as simple as a blue rock. Even if this blue object was moving in a wild environment, it could be simply fellow species that lives peacefully in the same habitat as a Betta splendins, or any fish for that matter. If a fish responded to every blue moving object or red moving object, it would again tire itself out, lowering its survival and reproduction chances. Actions lowering its chances of reproduction and fitness would not be favored by natural selection. Thus, fish with a better ability to discern a threat from simply an object would be favored in natural selection.
