Title: The complex effect of potassium on root:shoot ratios and overall plant growth in Avena sativa

Abstract:
Resource allocation in plants can be affected by many different environmental factors. Resource allocation is the way organisms distribute some resources and use others. In this study, the effect of potassium (K) on resource allocation in oat plants (Avena sativa) was investigated by evaluating the Root:shoot ratios in newly grown plants. The hypothesis predicts that enriched the soil with a diluted amount of K will affect resource allocation such that the R:S ratio will be smaller than the controlll, and a high amount of K will be detrimental to growth. Nine plants were watered and given different amounts of a KCl mixture. After evaluating the data was gathered two weeks later, it was found that the hypothesis was incorrect because the results were statistically significent in the other direction (i.e. the controlll group had a statistically significent R:S ratio than the KCl group). Although only one group was statistically significent and no definitive conclusion was reached at the end of this particular study, when compared with other similar studies, the results continue to support the theory that macronutrients directly affect resource allocation in plants.  

Introduction:
When exposed to various environmental conditions, plants distribute and use their limited resources in various ways. Organisms are only capable of obtaining a finite amount of resources; not only does it cost resources to extract others, but there are also simply not enough resources on the planet to fully satisfy all organism. Due to this shortage, species employ resource allocation, which describes the way organisms distribute some resources and use others, can directly relate to plant growth [Johnson: 2017]. One common way to measure plant growth is through root to shoot (R:S) ratios. A plant’s R:S ratio can be directly impacted by photosynthesis, access to sunlight, soil conditions, etc. [Australian: 2016]. It is an accurate and all-encompassing way to assess the overall health of plants. The purpose of this lab is to discover how potassium affects resource allocation in plants. Potassium is an important nutrient for plants because it regulates the opening and closing of stomata during photosynthesis and triggers the activation of enzymes that help make ATP [Lin: 2017]. Plants clearly need potassium for optimal function and growth, but can too much be harmful? In this particular study, Avena sativa, or oat plants, in different levels of potassium-rich soil were studied. Oats are both domesticated and wild and can be found worldwide [Kew: 2017]. This was an applicable organism because of its accessibility and typical rapid growth. The known information about resource allocation led to the development of the following hypothesis: an excess amount of potassium (K) added to soil will result in reduced overall oat plant growth, whereas enriching soil with a diluted amount of K will affect resource allocation such that the R:S ratio will be smaller than the controlll. To test this hypothesis, a group of controlll plants were compared to plants with differently potassium levels to further investigate the impact of environmental factors on resource allocation. 

Materials and Method:
After a large collection of Avena sativa seeds were obtained, they were soaked in water and then planted. Three pots were labeled as controllls, three pots were labeled as “Low KCl conditions,” and three pots were labeled as “High KCl conditions.” 75 Ml of water was administered to each pot. The plants were then placed in the greenhouse, experiencing the same room temperature, amount of light, and amount of water to controlll for confounding variables. Every other day, the low KCl plants received 5 Ml of a KCl mixture, and the high KCl plants received 25 Ml of the same mixture. All three groups received 75 Ml of water. After two weeks, 3 plants were harvested from each pot in the controlll and low KCl groups. There were no plants to harvest from the high KCl group. The plants were washed, dried, and weighed. They were then cut at the root-shoot junction, and the roots and shoots were weighed (g) and measured (mm) separately. This data was used to calculate the R:S ratios in terms of weight and length, as well as overall plant growth. The ratios of the controlll group were compared to those of the experimental group, and statistical analysis including a one-tailed T-test (p = 0.05) was used to analyze the data. 

Results:
After increasing the concentration of potassium in the soil, the R:S weight ratios for the controlll and experimental groups were statistically significent in the other direction from the null hypothesis (t = 4.04, d.f. = 4, p = 0.008). Figure 1 displays the significently lower R:S weight ratio in the controlll plants. The R:S length ratios for the two groups were not statistically significent (t = 2.05, d.f. = 4, p = 0.055), as well as for the overall growth (t = 0.20, d.f. = 4, p = 0.43). This is displayed in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 3 also displays a particularly large standard deviation range, signifying that there was a large deviance from the mean. 

Discussion:
After analyzing the data, the hypothesis is rejected. The data shows that potassium directly affected R:S ratio in a different way than predicted. The results from the low KCl group established that added potassium increased the R:S ratio instead of decreasing like the hypothesis predicted. Figure 1 displays this statistically significent difference in the R:S weight ratio, and Figure 2 displays the increased R:S length ratio in the low KCl group. Although conclusive evidence that potassium increased the R:S ratio was discovered, some of the specific data points were statistically insignificent. The results of the overall growth (Figure 3) were insignificent. The insignificance of the study at hand was likely due to human error. The high KCl group ultimately had to be discarded due to a complete oversaturation of potassium. Figure 5 displays how the conditions were unconducive to plant growth. The seeds also may have been too crowded in the small pots, and the KCl mixture may have prevented the 75 Ml of water from fully soaking into the soil. If the water didn’t soak all the way in due to the layer of the KCl mixture, the low KCl group plants would have allocated more energy to their roots so they could search for water. This would cause higher R:S ratios than the controlll group. The images displayed in figures 6 and 7 depict the extensive root growth within the pots, potentially signifying this need for water. Moving forward, it may be beneficial to not only be more precise about the number of seeds per pot but also calculate a more appropriate amount of the potassium mixture to add to the soil. That being said, many other studies investigating a similar question have been conducted that support the hypothesis. A study conducted by the Ecology Center at the University of Sunderland discovered that macronutrients such as N, P, K, and Mg directly affect R:S ratio through direct effects on processes such as protein synthesis and growth [Andrews: 1999]. This article also discusses discrepancies between different studies. According to their background research, similar experiments have produced different results. Perhaps a more long-term study would be beneficial to studying the relationship between macronutrients and R:S more in depth. Potassium and other macronutrients clearly affect resource allocation in plants, and this now confirmed basic and somewhat ambiguous knowledge may be fundamental in discovering more about the particular effects of environmental shortages on plants.
