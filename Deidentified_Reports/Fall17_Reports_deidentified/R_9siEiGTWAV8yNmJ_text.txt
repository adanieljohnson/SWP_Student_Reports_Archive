Title: Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors effect on the Amplitude of a Muscle Contraction in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Rania Pipien

Abstract:
We wanted to see if injecting the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania Pipien with a 0.2 Ml solution with 2% Sevin, which is an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, would affect the amplitude of the muscle contraction. We thought by leaving the acetylcholine attached to the ligand gated ion channels, that the continuous creation of action potentials would result in a greater amplitude because of wave summation. We hypothesized that if we injected the gastrocnemus muscle with the AChE inhibitor, than the amplitude of the muscle contraction after the injection would be greater than the amplitude of the muscle contraction before the injection. We observed this by attaching the gastrocnemus muscle to a force transducer and stimulating the muscle fibers at a consistent voltage with the muscle stimulator before and after the AChE inhibitor injection. After recording the amplitudes of 5 contractions at the same voltage for three different frog legs, we observed on the myogram that our data does not give us enough information to make a conclusion. One of the muscles supported our hypothesis, the second one did not have enough statistical significance to take into account, while the last muscle did not support our hypothesis.


Introduction:
When reading about how the honeybees’ motor function dramatically increased in frequency as the honeybees became more active after being exposed to all different kinds of AChE Inhibitors like Coumaphos, aldicarb, donepezil, and chlorpyrifos (Williamson: 2013). We decided to expand on this alteration of the motor function and examine the amplitude of the muscle contractions instead of the frequency. We planned to inject the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipien with an AChE inhibitor and record the difference in the amplitude of the muscle contraction from before and after the injection. For a muscle to contract, the action potential arrives at the axon terminal, opening the voltage gated Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ ion channels. These ion then flow into the the axon terminal and this causes the acetylcholine (ACh) vesicles to fuse with the membrane, releasing ACh into the synaptic cleft. The ACh molecules diffuse across the synapse and bind to the ligand gated ion channels on the muscle end plate. This then allow Na⁺ ions to flow into the muscle end plate and create a post-synaptic action potential within the muscle fibers, which eventually stimulates a muscle contraction. To stop the depolarization of the muscle endplate, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) comes in and breaks down/takes off the ACh from the ligand gated ion channels, which makes the gates close. This closure of the ligand gated ion channels repolarizes the muscle fiber and allows the muscle to relax. We are expecting that the muscle with the AChE inhibitor injection would not be able to break down the ACh and leave them docked to the ligand gated ion channels, which would result in an higher amplitude when the muscle contracts. We hypothesize that if we inject our muscle with the ACh Esterase inhibitor, then the amplitude of the muscle contraction of the injected muscle will be higher than the amplitude of the non injected muscle.  We chose to use the Rania pipiens, which has a common name of the Northern Leopard Frog, in our experiment because they have very strong and defined gastrocnemus muscles and were readily accessible for our lab. They also have an anatomy that allows us to easily access their Sciatic Nerve which is very useful in our lab. This research is relevant because if my hypothesis is correct, then it can have many implication for sports enhancement drugs or any area that could benefit from stronger muscle contractions.

Materials and Method:
First we had to deglove the Rania pipiens leg and expose the Sciatic Nerve, so we peeled the skin of the leg down and pulled it off the end of the leg. Then we separated the ventral side of the thigh, along the cleft to expose the Sciatic Nerve.
	Then we detached the gastrocnemus muscle at the achilles tendon and tied a loop with a thin piece of string to the achilles tendon, and hooked the loop to a force transducer. We suspended the gastrocnemus Muscle at a 90 degree angle to the tray, then pinned the muscle down to the tray to keep the leg motionless. We adjusted the height of the force transducer to give a little tension in the string. 
	Next we inserted the muscle stimulator probes into the gastrocnemus muscle and stimulated the muscle with the muscle probes and increased each stimulus by 1 Volt until we found the maximum amplitude for the gastrocnemus muscle contraction. Then we set the computer program to stimulate the muscle with five pulses, each 5 milliseconds apart, at that specific voltage and recorded the amplitude of each contraction in the computer program, LabScribe.
	Then we injected the gastrocnemus muscle with .2Ml solution with 2% Sevin, a Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and waited 2 minutes for the inhibitor to diffuse throughout the muscle fibers. 
	We then stimulated the gastrocnemus muscle again with five pulses at that same specific voltage that produced the maximum contraction of the non-injected leg and recorded the amplitude of each contraction. 
	We repeated each of these steps for two other legs, recording data for a total of 3 frog legs. We then took that data and used a two tailed T-Test to analyze our data. 


Results:
Our results were not how we hypothesized. We observed the muscle contracting violently everytime we stimulated it with the muscle stimulators. We also observed no visible differences in the appearance of how hard the muscle contracted between each of the different Voltage stimuli.
As seen in Figure 1, we observed a trend where the amplitude of the contraction from the muscle with the injection of the ACh Esterase inhibitor was noticeably higher than the amplitude of the contraction of the muscle that was not injected. We then calculated that the average amplitude of the muscle contraction after the injection was higher by about 0.13 Volts. We finally can conclude that the mean of the noninjected leg was statistically significently different than that of the injected leg because our P value is 0.0012 (t_stat=8.28, d.f.=4).
	When we were observing the second frog leg, seen as Figure 2, we did not notice any trends. The amplitudes of the contractions were very similar but out of the 5 pulses, 3 out of the 5 pulses were slightly higher in the injected leg than the non injected leg. The two that were not higher were, however, very similar in amplitude, just slightly lower. We calculated that the average amplitude of the contraction of the of the injected muscle was 0.0072 Volts higher than the amplitude of the noninjected leg. We can finalize by saying that the mean of the non injected leg was not statistically significently different than that of the injected leg because our P value is 0.3301 (t_stat=1.11, d.f.=4).
	Lastly, while observing the third leg, seen as Figure 3, we noticed a trend where the amplitude of the non injected leg was higher than the injected leg. In fact, all five contraction amplitudes of the non injected leg was significently higher than the amplitude of the muscle contraction in the injected leg. It was observed that as each pulse occurred, the difference between the injected leg and non injected leg decreased. We were able to calculate that the average amplitude of the muscle contraction in the non injected leg was 0.2522 Volts higher than the amplitude of the muscle contraction in the injected leg. We can finalize by saying that the mean of the non injected leg was statistically significently different than that of the injected leg because our P value is 4.9310-5 (t_stat=18.59, d.f.=4).


Discussion:
With our data at this moment, we do not have enough information to be able to conclude if the hypothesis was supported or rejected. One of the three results we received from the legs of the Rania pipiens displayed contraction that showed an average amplitude that was higher in the injected muscle than in the non injected muscle. This supports our hypothesis. However we also obtained the opposite, where the average amplitude of the contraction of the muscle before the injection was higher than the average amplitude of the contraction after the injection. This data rejects our hypothesis. Finally, our last piece of data is not statistically significent enough, so we cannot take that data into account. However, there are other experiments where they described their data by stating that more than half of their muscles that were injected with diisopropylfluorophosphate, an AChE inhibitor, showed results with an abnormally higher amplitude of the injected muscle contractions than their non injected contraction (Mense: 2003). This helps support our hypothesis. Our hypothesis seems correct because when ACh is left on the the ligand gated ion channels, which increases the number of action potentials that are started in the muscle fibers. This increase in action potentials increases the frequency of the muscle twitches and the increase in muscle twitches creates a stronger contraction which is called summation. We experienced a couple flaws during our experiment. One was that when we were touching the muscle with the metal pins and scissors, the electrons from those transferred into the muscle and stimulated the leg. This resulted in the leg being ATP deficient which could have affected our data. Another flaw we experienced was that we sometimes forgot to keep the muscle moist with the frog ringer solution. This would make the frog leg dry out a bit which could have affected the amplitude of the contraction as well. For future research, I would like change two things about our procedure. First i would like to increase the number of muscles I could stimulate. The reason I would want more legs would be to give me more accurate results by not having the data be affected as heavily by the extremes. The second thing that I would be to stimulate the muscle via the Sciatic Nerve and see if there was a more conclusive data that came from that. I feel like it would evenly stimulate every muscle fiber rather than the only ones close enough to the muscle stimulator.
