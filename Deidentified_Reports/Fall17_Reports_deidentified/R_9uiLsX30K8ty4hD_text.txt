Title: The Effect of Nicotine on the Neuromuscular Response in the Gastrocnemius Muscles of a Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to find out the effect of nicotine on the gastrocnemus muscle of three different Rania pipiens, a species of a frog. Nicotine, a common drug found in cigars, cigarettes, and e-cigs, can have an effect on muscle function due to nAchRs receptors. Nicotine acetylcholine receptors or nAchRs, are receptors located in the synaptic cleft that when triggered by nicotine, will open to allow more Na+ to enter the muscle cell, evoking adding a longer contraction. Also, nicotine has been shown to block potassium from leaving out of the cell, resulting in no hyper-polarization. Due to this reason, we concluded that when in the presence of nicotine, the gastrocnemus muscle will have a stronger contraction and have a higher amplitude. To test these results we used LabScribe, developed by iWork, to help produce myograms, which produce graphs that could measure amplitude. The findings were based on three different Rania pipiens legs. The amplitude does rise in the presence of nicotine, which ultimately shows the contraction of the muscle is stronger than muscle without nicotine, with the significent p_value to back up the results.  

Introduction:
Nicotine is a naturally existing alkaloid formed in tobacco plants. It is also an addictive substance that creates a buzz of pleasure and energy. Other than that, it has been shown to have no major harm, but plays a major role in the neuromuscular system. It binds to receptors and blocks receptors to allow for relaxation of the muscles which feels like a constant cramp in the muscle. Nicotine hasn’t been tested completely on the direct effect of the muscle, making them less well-known. The gastrocnemus muscle is a large posterior muscle on the calf of the leg. The sciatic nerve controllls the relaxation and contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle. The gastrocnemus muscle is assembled with many myofibrils which collaborate with motor neurons. Motor neurons send action potential through the axons of the neurons. When the muscle contracts, the action potential is sent down each axon and each axon has a synaptic cleft. The synaptic cleft is a junction between the axon of pre-synaptic cleft and post-synaptic cleft dendrites. Acetylcholine (ACh) is triggered by the neurotransmitters to diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to ACh receptors of another myofibrils, opening Na+ channels. Nicotine acetylcholine receptors or nAchRs are separate receptors in the synaptic cleft that are opened by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and also nicotine. When the channels open, it depolarizes the synaptic cleft and leads to the continuation of another action potential. Specifically, in muscles, the action potential travels down T-tubules and stimulates the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release Ca2+. The Ca2+ reacts with the troponin in the myosin, opening up the myosin binding sites that were once blocked. Acetylcholinesterase breaks down the ACh which closes the Na+ channels to shut, finishing contractions. Nicotine has been tested in frogs before and has indicated that nicotine could adjust the distribution of Ca2+, which has similar effects to that of caffeine in the muscles [Weiss: 1966]. Preceding studies have shown that nicotine effects the nAchRs receptors and they become activated in the presence of the drug, nicotine. When nicotine activates the receptor, nAchRs, it triggers the opening of the Na+ ion gate channel. This allows more Na+ to come in and higher depolarization, and finally a higher contraction amplitude [Hanna: 2006]. Due to these results done by previous study, one would predict that nicotine in a receptor would then enhance the contraction to be stronger. The goal of this experiment was to test the direct effect of nicotine on gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens shown by a myogram graph. We used Rania pipiens because these frogs have very powerful legs for jumping great amounts of distance, making their muscles easy to study. We predict that the contractions will be stronger, making the contracting period longer and the relaxation period shorter, when injecting nicotine due to the presence and opening of nAchRs receptors.

Materials and Method:
Starting this experiment, we used three Rania pipiens leg’s and skinned the frog legs to expose the muscles and skeleton structures. Applying ringer's solution, a solution of many salts mixed in with water, to the frog leg helps create fuel sources for cells. In this case, it helped the frog maintain ATP. We then took the leg and divided the muscle into two parts helping expose the sciatic nerve more clearly. After the sciatic nerve was exposed, we hung the gastrocnemus muscle to a level spring force transducer arm. The gastrocnemus muscle was adhered by a thread and pinned down to stabilize the muscles and reveal the sciatic nerve. The gastrocnemus muscle was attached to pin electrodes to stimulate force throughout the muscle and to help trigger a response. We used the program LabScribe, a program that produces myogram and was developed by iWork. We first found a threshold for each frog leg by setting pulse amplitude to 0 V, number of pulses to 1, frequency to 1 and pulse width to 5 ms. By changing the voltages each run, the threshold is found, which is when the frog’s leg twitches and in the graph, produces a peak. This threshold than was used when showing the difference between pre-and post-injection. Start by putting amplitude to threshold, found in last exercise, number of pulses to 5, frequency to 1 and pulse width to 5 ms. Using a syringe, put .1 Ml of 1 mM tubocurarine and prepare to apply. Start running the LabScribe on the pre-injected leg and wait until 5 pulses are completed than inject the .1 Ml of nicotine to the gastrocnemus muscle. Stop the program and then start the program back up again after 10 seconds have passed after the injection occurred, which will apply 5 pulses to the now injected leg. Find the amplitude of the five peaks before injection and then find the amplitude of the post-injection by adding up the peak where the injection actually took place.  Repeat this process two more times to find out the difference in amplitude with two other frog legs. The data will be displayed in a one tailed paired T-test. 

Results:
The results from the following experiment showed that the pre-injection leg had an insignificent amplitude value compared to that of the post-injection leg. Leg 1 pre-injection amplitude of contraction had a significent difference from the post-injection mean amplitude, p=1.07933E-11. Leg 2 pre-injection amplitude of contraction had a significent difference from the post-injection mean amplitude, p=3.1721E-11. Leg 3 pre-injection amplitude of contraction had a significent difference from the post-injection mean amplitude, p=9.06092E-08. In leg 1, the mean amplitude of the contraction pre-injection was 0.1258 +/- 0.0281 and post injection was 0.7812 +/- 0.0035. In leg 2, the mean amplitude of the contraction pre-injection was 0.401 +/- 0.0256 and post injection was 1.0958 +/- 0.0228. In leg 3, the mean amplitude of the contraction pre-injection was 0.6412 +/- 0.0311 and post injection was 1.2156 +/- 0.0712. The physical observations that were collected were right after the nicotine was injected into each of the three frog legs, the leg twitched once and continued to be contracted. This phenomenon we saw is similar to a cramp/Charley horse in the leg that was never ending. We also noticed that the muscle got denser with every injection of nicotine. 

Discussion:
The data obtained supports our hypothesis due to the fact that all the p_values were significent. The amplitude in the Rania pipiens leg did rise, which means the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle was stronger in the presence of nicotine. This is supported by the fact that our amplitude grew 65% more after post-injection of the .1Ml of 1 mM of tubocurarine. This was because the opening of more nAchRs allowed for more Na+ to flow through and trigger a longer amplitude for the contraction. It has been shown that due to the presence of nicotine, potassium currents were being blocked. This means that without potassium flowing in the cell the contraction would never stop, raising the amplitude of the contraction [Hanna: 2006]. This study is supported by another study which shows that in the presence of tubocurarine the after potential, or the negative effects that follow an action potential, is suppressed or diminished, meaning the contraction never ends results in higher amplitude and length [Standaert: 1963]. The physical observation observed while conducting the experiment were the leg tensing up and twitching but never stopping the twitch. The potassium currents that were being blocked by nicotine showed that muscle was unable to hyper-polarize, or release potassium out of the cell, and stop the contraction. This phenomenon made the muscle appear tenser because it was going through a contraction and never hyper-polarized which usually stops the cell from contraction and brings it back down to the rest state. Due to the action that the nicotine was only injected in one part of the gastrocnemus muscle, the contraction was a bit higher than pre-injection, but not a huge difference. If the injection was all over the muscle, triggering more potassium currents to be closed the contraction would be stronger than the pre-injection. This was a limit of the study because we did not have a lot of nicotine to inject into the muscle. If there was more nicotine added into the muscle, it would lead to a more significently clear and higher amplitude on the myogram, as well as a better physical observation on the gastrocnemus muscle. Future studies that can be conducted to enhance better results would be to inject Chatix, a drug that is to stop smoking but also mimics ACh which has the same effects of nicotine, releasing more sodium and longer contraction. Based on this study, we would predict that the amplitude would be even higher due to the amount of sodium being released and potassium being blocked. Studies showing the effect of nicotine in the muscle is important because nicotine is a very widespread, common used drug yet there has been no clear evidence on the aftermath of nicotine. Proving that nicotine does play a major role in muscle contractions and contributes to a form of cramping, doctors can better understand why this phenomenon occurs and help cure patients who have similar side effects.  This can help the world of science and/or medicine because it can allow for more understandings of the drug which could lead to more advancement in research and help the population became more informed of such a common used drug.
