Title: A Decrease in Photosynthetic Rate Due to High- and Low-Temperature Stress in Spinach (Spinacia oleraca)

Abstract:
By stressing spinach in both cold and hot temperature environments, the effect of temperature on photosynthetic activity in spinach ("Spinacia oleraca") was determined. It was hypothesized that the spinach would be equally active at 0⁰C, 25⁰C, and 35⁰C based on research showing that spinach was both heat and cold resistant. The photosynthetic activity was measured indirectly using DCPIP to optically quantify the level of photosynthesis and a spectrophotometer to give accurate representations of this optical quantity. The hypothesis was not supported by the data that showed significently lower photosynthesis in the cold test and slightly lower in both of the heated tests. Further tests could more specifically identify the range in which spinach can thrive as well as find similar information for other organisms.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, certain protists, and some bacteria harness and store solar energy. Chemically, carbon dioxide and water are consumed to produce glucose, molecular oxygen and water. The two main components of photosynthesis are the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, a flow of electrons creates a proton gradient that produces ATP as one of the final products. Often, the rate of photosynthesis can indicate how certain environmental factors affect the growth of photosynthetic organisms. It is difficult to measure this rate directly, but it is possible to use alternative method of measurement. DCPIP can replace NADP as an electron receptor and it changes from blue to colorless when reduced. Therefore, DCPIP can be used as a visual marker for the rate of photosynthesis. This color can be accurately measured by a spectrophotometer and the resulting data can be used to extrapolate the rate of photosynthesis. One area of interest is the effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis. Certain plants thrive in higher or lower temperatures than others, allowing them to grow in environments with less than ideal conditions. The plant chosen for this experiment was spinach ("Spinacia oleraca") for its reputed chill and heat resistance (Agrawal:2016; Sonoike: 1995). However, it was also stated that the spinach plant failed to photosynthesize above 45 degrees Celsius (Agrawal: 2016). Based on these properties, "Spinacia oleraca" is an ideal model in that it allows for testing of both high and temperature stress in a plant that should resist both. By maintaining constant levels of light and varying the temperature to 0, roughly 23, 35, and 50 degrees Celsius over two 15-minute time intervals, the direct effect of temperature on photosynthesis was quantified. If spinach is both heat and cold resistant, then the rate of photosynthesis should be the same at 0, 23, and 35 degrees Celsius as measured by spectrophotometry using DCPIP as an electron acceptor in the photosynthetic electron transport chain.

Materials and Method:
Before the rate of photosynthesis could be measured, a sample of enriched chloroplasts from spinach ("Spinacia oleraca") was prepared. Four spinach leaves were ground in a chilled mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of grinding buffer made of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8. Once most of the large plant matter was ground, 10 Ml more of grinding buffer was added to the mixture before the mixture was strained into a beaker through cheesecloth. The liquid was then centrifuged in a chilled centrifuge tube at 200G for 3 minutes at 4⁰C. The supernatant of this process was poured into a second tube and centrifuged again at 1000G for 10 minutes at 4⁰C. Once again, the supernatant was poured off, however, this time the pellet that remained in the centrifuge tube was resuspended with 20 Ml of grinding buffer to yield an enriched sample of chloroplasts. 
	Using the enriched chloroplast samples, photosynthetic rate was then measured. Thirteen test tubes were prepared for this portion of the experiment: 1 tube to use as a blank for the spectrophotometer, 3 tubes for the 0⁰C condition, 3 tubes for the room temperature condition, 3 tubes for the 35⁰ condition, and 3 tubes for the 50⁰C condition. The blank tube contained 8 Ml of deionized water and 2 Ml of a reaction buffer of 100mM phosphate and pH 6.5. Each of the remaining 12 tubes was prepared with 6 Ml of deionized water, 2 Ml of 130mM DCPIP, 2 Ml of the same reaction buffer placed in the blank tube, and 100 μL of the enriched chloroplasts were added as a final step. Once the chloroplasts were added, the mixtures were gently swirled to evenly distribute the contents. The spectrophotometer was immediately blanked using the “blank” mixture and the absorbance at 600nm of the mixtures from tube 2-13 was measured and recorded. From the spectrophotometer, the test tubes were moved into water baths of their respective temperatures for 15 minutes, ensuring that the solutions were submerged but none of the water entered the tubes. The absorbance at 600nm was once again recorded before the tubes were replaced in their water baths. After another 15 minutes in the water baths, a final absorbance was recorded.  The average absorbance of each temperature group for each time period (t=0 min, t=15 min, and 5=30 min) was graphed on a time vs. absorbance graph. Photosynthetic activity was not calculated quantitatively but determined qualitatively based on the amount of absorbance at 600nm. DCPIP becomes colorless as it is reduced (which would occur during photosynthesis), and as a result, less light at 600nm would be absorbed with higher rates of photosynthesis. A two-way ANOVA test with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis was used to determine statistical significance between temperature groups and the times.  


Results:
The spinach ("Spinacia oleraca") chloroplasts exhibited much lower rates of photosynthesis at cold temperatures and hot temperature than at room temperature. However, the rate of photosynthesis was higher at 35⁰C than at 50⁰C. The lowest rate of photosynthesis, in contrast, corresponded to the chloroplasts in a cold solution. These trends began at the 15-minute measurement and were reaffirmed in the 30-minute measurement. Figure 3 below offers a visual summary of the data in the form of a time vs absorbance plot. The ANOVA test shown in figure 1 indicated that there was significent difference in some of the temperature groups with a p_value for the temperature variable, V1, of p=0.03. The Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis further refined this to show that there was significent difference between the cold rate of photosynthesis and the room temperature rate of photosynthesis with a p_value of 0.018 as shown in figure 2 below. 

Discussion:
The results of the experiment indicate that our hypothesis was not supported because there was a statistical difference between the cold and room temperature groups according to the Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis. Even though the statistical analyses do not show a statistical difference between the two heated groups and the room temperature, looking at the graphs and numbers indicates that both of the heated groups also did not photosynthesize as well as the room temperature group. With more replicates of the experiment, it is possible that the results would become statistically significent. What the statistical difference indicates is that the spinach was unable to photosynthesize at 0⁰ as well as it did at room temperature. This is logical given that research has previously shown that even with low temperature acclimation, spinach has short-lived freezing tolerance (Guy: 1987). For heat tolerance, the study done in 2016 by Agrawal Et al. indicates that there is a decreased photosynthetic activity at 40⁰ C and above (Agrawal:2016). This is in accordance with our findings and it seems that the decrease extends to 35 degrees Celsius as well. It is possible that the mechanisms for both heat and cold resistance are maintained at a whole-leaf level that was destroyed by our experimental method, but no research was found to support this conjecture. With further testing, it could be determined at what specific temperature the decrease in activity begins. In order to do this and achieve statistically significent results, it would be necessary to have more than three replicates of each temperature. Other possibilities for the future include testing temperature dependence of photosynthesis in other plant species. In 2017, a study found that rice ("Orzya sativa l.") has a similar mechanism of heat stress protection as in Agrawal’s study of spinach (Essemine:2017). This experiment could be repeated with more replicates and replacing spinach with rice to determine the difference between the two plants’ heat resistance. This and related experiments all find use in agriculture where they offer guidelines for conditions in which certain plants can grow as well as possible mechanisms for their heartiness. With further research, these findings could allow more efficient agriculture by controlllling growth conditions or growing crops in more appropriate locations for their needed conditions.
