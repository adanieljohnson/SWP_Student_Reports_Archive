Title: The Effect of Light Exposure on the Metabolic Rate of the Crayfish Procambarus sp. 

Abstract:
The crayfish Procambarus sp. is a nocturnal organism that commonly lives in dark and murky freshwater environments. The experiment will test the effects of light exposure on the metabolic rate of crayfish Procambarus sp. by measuring oxygen consumption of the crayfish with a dissolved oxygen probe and a test chamber. The hypothesis is if the crayfish Procambarus sp.is placed into the dark, then its metabolic rate will decrease because in their natural environment they live in similar conditions. The results of this experiment are the hypothesis was rejected as the metabolic rate of crayfish Procambarus sp. that was given light exposure was lower than the crayfish given not light exposure. 

Introduction:
The organism that will be used in this experiment is the crayfish Procambarus sp. Procambarus sp. Crayfish is a crustacean that lives in freshwater habitats. Most crayfish are known to be “nocturnal animals” and their “activity is regulated accordingly by the presence or absence of light” [Fanjul-Molesa 1998]. Metabolic rate is the quantity of energy being expended/ used by an organism by all physiologic processes in a given period of time [Johnson: 2017]. In the reaction of metabolism, carbon and oxygen are converted to carbon dioxide gas, which releases high-energy electrons that are obtained by NAD+ and FAD molecules [Johnson: 2017]. The electrons then are transferred to the electron transport system, which converts ADP to ATP. The electron transport system generates ATP and stops if electrons are not taken out from the mitochondria. Removal occurs by transferring the electrons to oxygen, which then forms water that takes part in the fluids in the body [Johnson: 2017]. Oxygen consumption will be collected to help measure the metabolic rate of the crayfish as it is an indirect measure of energy production and use. Since crayfish are ectotherms, meaning their body temperature depends on the temperature of the environment, therefore changing the temperature of the environment would affect their metabolic rate. Therefore, in this experiment, we want to see how changing other external factors could affect the crayfish metabolic rate. The purpose of this experiment is to test it see if a change in light exposure, which is the independent variable will affect the specific metabolic rate, which is the dependent variable of the crayfish Procambarus sp. The specific metabolic rate is “the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass per unit of time” [Johnson: 2017]. We hypothesize that if the crayfish Procambarus sp.is placed into the dark, then its specific metabolic rate will decrease because in their natural environment they are adjusted to living in similar conditions. 

Materials and Methods:
1)To begin the room temperature (22°C) measurements, fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air. Then set the test chamber into an empty plastic dishpan. 
2)Weigh a crayfish, gently place it into the test chamber, and screw on the top.
3)When the top is secure, gently fill the container with water so the top overflows slightly.
4)Now place the entire tank set-up to the neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature (22°C). 
5)Insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the test chamber. Be sure that the chamber is completely filled with water.
6)Next, turn on the instrument and let your readings stabilize (this may take 30 seconds to a minute.
7)Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concertation.
8)At 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, read the oxygen concentration again. 
9)Remove the probe from the test chamber.
10)Determine the volume of water the crayfish was in during the experiment by pouring the water from the test chamber through a funnel into a graduated cylinder. 
11)Repeat steps one through ten, but this time wrap the test chamber in aluminum foil. Make sure the chamber is completely covered with no light peeking through. 
12)When you are finished, return the crayfish to its original holding pen.
13)Refill the chamber with fresh room temperature (22°C) water once more. Repeat the entire process using two more crayfish. Also, repeat the procedure one final time covering the test chamber in aluminum foil.  
14)Use the equation below to figure out the specific metabolic rate of each of the crayfish in control and experimental conditions. 
Specific metabolic rate=([ΔO_2 (mg/L)*volume H_2 O(L)])/(Time (min.)*weight(g))
15)Use a single-tailed two-sample t-test. 



Results:
Single-tailed Two-sample t-test 
(t-stat = 1.2873, df =4.00, P= 0.2674)
Based on the results, the single-tailed two-sample t-test concluded that there is no statistically significant difference between the control group and the experimental group, which was placed in the dark as the p-value is above 0.05. Looking at figure 1, the specific metabolic rate of the control group was lower than the experimental in the first two crayfish Procambarus sp., however, in the third trial, the experimental group had a lower specific metabolic rate than the control group. 


Discussion:
The alternate hypothesis is if the crayfish Procambarus sp. is placed into the dark, then its metabolic rate will decrease because in their natural environment they live in similar conditions. The results of the experiment reject the hypothesis as the metabolic rate increased in the experimental group, which was given no light exposure, then in the control group, which was given light exposure. In the results, the p-value was 0.2674 from the single-tailed two-sample t-test, which is greater than 0.05, therefore not a significant difference. 
A possible explanation for these results is that since the crayfish is a nocturnal organism that most of their activity and movement occurs at night. Therefore, oxygen that is used is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended, which then means the specific metabolic rate would be higher when the crayfish are given no light exposure. This was also evident in another experiment by Fanjul-Molesa, which found that in crayfish Prcambarus clarkii had a “decrease in motor activity” once the light was induced and went into a state similar to “estivating anaerobic animals”, where the metabolic rate would decrease [Fanjul-Molesa: 1998]. However, there are other studies, such as Pavel Kozak’s experiment on the “Light preferences of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)”, which results showed it cannot be concluded if crayfish have a preference of light intensity and its effect on metabolic rate [Kozak: 2009].
An error that should be mentioned in this experiment is that in trial three the specific metabolic rate is higher in the control group than the experimental group. The results of that trial could be because the dissolved oxygen probe was accidentally moved during the experiment, therefore causing a disturbance for the crayfish. 
The next step in this experiment is ways to modify it for improvements. One way to improve the experiment would be to add different levels of light exposure to see which level would be the most favorable for increasing metabolic rate. Another improvement would be to add more trials or crayfish to the experiment so that there is less room for errors and a larger data pool. This experiment is in terms of the general matter of the world can help show how certain external factors in the environment can help keep the living conditions constant for the crayfish Procambarus sp. The experiment shows that crayfish generally live environments that are dark, therefore it is significant to not cause environmental damage that would cause them to be less active and not able to perform daily activities that would be important to their survival.
