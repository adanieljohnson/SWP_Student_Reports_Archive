Title: The relation between the visibility of the environmental water and the aggressiveness of male-male Betta fish interactions

Abstract:
For our experiment, our goal is to understand Betta splendins' intraspecific behavior. Our hypothesis is there is a relationship between the visibility of the environmental water and the aggressiveness of male-male Betta fish interactions. In order to study this topic, we had two different environments. The first environment is the clear water, which serves as the controlll group. The second environment is the murky water, which serves as the experimental group. We had three fish as our samples. We paired them into groups and quantified their aggressiveness in different environments by using the bin system. In each environment, the sum of the scores of both fish served as the aggressiveness score for that particular sample group. After the experiment, we used the average scores for the two environments to run the two-sample t_test and had a p_value that is lower than 0.05, which rejected our null-hypothesis. From the experiment, we gained a better understanding of the relationship between environment and animal’s behavior.

Introduction:
The purpose of studying animal behaviors is to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and natural selection. [Johnson AD. Aug:2017] For the goal of gaining a better understanding of the animal behavior, we have designed an experiment for Betta splendins to determine whether there is a connection between the level of aggressiveness of male to male Betta fish and the visibility of their environment. Our target species is Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish. . This species is very aggressive and has very stereotyped social displays. [Oliveira, R. F., McGregor, P. K., & Latruffe, C.: 1998]. They are common aquarium fish that originated in southeast Asia. They are indigenous to Thailand, where they mostly reside in ponds, ditches, drains, rice paddies, and other sluggish or muddy waters. However, the fish has been domesticated for many generationsAs a result of sexual selection, betta fish are shown to have a series of specific behaviors when they are excited by the presence of another male. This type of behavior is called the intraspecific agnostic behavior. The intraspecific behaviors of bettas include two main types of movements: broadside movement and facing movement. [Johnson AD.: 2017] The reason we chose Betta splendins as our target species is because the behaviors of Betta splendins are measurable and obvious. We decided to study this question because we’ve noticed that the wild Betta fish live in muddy water, which must make it more difficult for the fish to identify one another. This observation led us to inquire whether their behavior differs due to their placement in murky water. All domestic betta fish reside in clear and fresh water. However, their original environment in the wild is unclear, muddy water. This difference led us to wonder whether putting the fish back to its primitive environment would trigger more aggressive intraspecific behaviors for male fish. We predicted that the male Betta fish would have a different level of aggressiveness when they are in a different environment with different visibility.

Materials and Method:
We had three Betta fish samples for our experiment and two tanks for the different environmental water. In order to avoid differences caused by the color of the fish, we decided to use three Betta male fish with the same color. The three fish are Fish 1, Fish 2, and Fish 3. We paired them into three groups. First, we tested them in the clear water. Then, we tested the fish in the murky water. For the murky water, we created the environment by mixing 4 liters of water and 40 Ml of potting soil. Because we only had four group members, it was hard for us to differentiate the fish in the murky water. Therefore, we decided to leave the glass that separates them physically in the tank. We used a three bins system to measure the level of aggressiveness. We assigned 1 point for tail flashing, 2 points for showing “red mane,” and 3 points for bumping against the glass. We separated our lab group into two parts. Two of the group members would judge the level of aggressiveness of the fish, and the other two of group members would write down the data. Because each one of our group members has a different standard for the bins, we kept our data consistent by having the same two members from the judging part of the group to always judge the level of aggressiveness. By doing so, the standards for aggressiveness were kept the same. After each experiment, we would assign a score for each fish. After we give each fish their score, we would add both scores together to serve as the final score for aggressiveness for that pair of fish. After each experiment, we will rest the fish for at least 10 minutes. We used the average score for the two environments to run the two-tailed two-sample t_test. If the p_value is smaller than 0.05, then our null-hypothesis will be rejected.

Results:
The average score for the aggressiveness of male Betta fish in the clear water is 114±50. The first pair of the male Betta fish in the clear water experiment had unusually low data, which led to a large standard deviation for the clear water data. The average score for the aggressiveness of male Betta fish in the murky water is 1±1.414213. As we can see in the chart below, the mean of the data for the controlll group was significently different than that of the experimental groups (t_stat=3.192517, d.f.=4,P=0.016568). With the data above, we can see that the fish in murky water has a significently lower level of aggressiveness than the fish in the clear water.

Discussion:
Because our p_value of the data is smaller than 0.05, there is a significent difference between the two groups of data, and the null-hypothesis of the experiment must be rejected. From the experiment conducted, we were able to conclude that the visibility of environmental water affects the aggressiveness between male Betta fish. In a previously published study, the experimenters changed the lightness of the environment for the Betta fish, and they observed the very different behaviors from the Betta fish. Based on their observations, they concluded that the environment of the Betta fish could hugely affect Betta fish's aggressiveness [Oliveira, R. F., McGregor, P. K., & Latruffe, C.: 1998]. It is known that the intraspecific behavior of Betta fish is mating competition related behavior. Also, it is very energy consuming for Betta fish to display any kind of movement. Therefore, Betta fish will only display the agnostic behavior in the presence of other male fish. For the experiment we had in murky water, we noticed that the fish often did not face each other when they were in the same tank, and they barely swam around the tank or displayed any intraspecific behaviors as they would have done if they were aware of the presence of another male Betta fish. Therefore, we believe the differences in the aggressiveness of Betta fish were caused by the fact that the murky water clouded their view of each other. However, the wild original environment for the Betta splendins fish is murky and muddy water. Due to this fact, we realized that after generations of artificial selection, the Betta fish had already lost their ability to identify others in the murky water. For the data for Betta fish in clear water, we noticed a large standard deviation, and the data must be analyzed. We believe that the large standard deviation of the first experimental group was caused by the first pair of fish in the clear water experiment. In that particular experiment, our total score of aggression for the fish was 37. This score is significently lower than the average score of 114 for the fish in clear water. We believe the reason for this discrepancy is due to an issue with the plastic board that was supposed to separate them visually. The plastic board was not large enough to cover the tank effectively, so they may have noticed each other’s presence. This issue might have caused errors in data.  For future goals, we want to design an experiment on how the color of the water affects the aggressiveness of the fish. This is an experiment concerning the animal’s behavior. All of our results are based on our observations and the data we gathered. The intraspecific agnostic behavior of Betta splendins are behaviors shaped by evolution and selection. Through this experiment, we had two main conclusions based on our observation and data. Firstly, the environment of the animals can greatly impact the animal’s behavior. Secondly, the domestic fish and the wild fish would have greatly contrasting behaviors.
