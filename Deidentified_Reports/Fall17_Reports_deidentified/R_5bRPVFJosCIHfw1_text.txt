Title: Effect of Salinity on Specific Metabolic Rate of Crayfish

Abstract:
Water breathing organisms have the difficult task of absorbing oxygen from water for respiration. Most water breathing animals have gills increase the diffusion of oxygen in the water into their blood stream, and keeps any solutes outside. This study looks at crayfish a freshwater species. Human pollution and runoff can contaminate these crayfish’s habitats and could increase the salinity of the water of the habitat. The purpose of the study is to determine whether this salinity increase would have a significant effect on the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. We hypothesized that the increase in salinity would increase the metabolic rate since the crayfish must work harder to keep more solutes out of its system. Three crayfish were tested, each used as its control for the treated solution of about 0.72-0.73% salt concentration. The dissolved oxygen consumption was used as a proxy variable for metabolism. After running a paired t-test, it was found that there was no statistical significance between the control and treated values, but a distinct trend was observed. For all the crayfish the metabolic rate did decrease. Further testing and testing different levels of salt concentrations could determine for sure whether this trend exists or not.

Introduction:
For organisms to live, they must be able to process their own energy. There are two classes of organisms, autotrophs are animals that can photosynthesize and produce energy. The other type, heterotrophs, are animals that must consume other organisms to gain energy. Both autotrophs and heterotrophs perform cellular respiration, which is the process of breaking down carbohydrates and sugars into energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the energy needed in organisms to power numerous cell process that occurs. The first step that occurs for cellular respiration is glycolysis which is the process of breaking a simple sugar molecule (glucose) into two pyruvates. These pyruvates are then converted into acetate and carbon dioxide. During this process, large amounts of electrons are released and captured by NAD+ and FAD, which are electrons transporters. Thanks to the electron transporters, these newly released electrons are transported to the electron transport chain, where electrons move between transport molecules which creates large amounts of ATP, thanks to ATP synthase. Finally, the electrons react with oxygen to produce water, which is the last step of the electron transport chain resulting in a total of thirty-six ATP molecules produced from one molecule of glucose [Johnson: 2016].

For cellular respiration to occur oxygen must be in the body to act as the final electron acceptor. Animals have evolved many ways to capture oxygen from whatever environment they live in. Lungs were developed for land animals to obtain oxygen from the atmosphere, while gills were evolved to capture oxygen from the water. The model organism used for this experiment are crayfish which have gills that can extract the oxygen from the water. This is because gills use a process called countercurrent flow, where the water from the environment flow is the opposite direction as the blood vessels in the gills, which optimizes the diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream. The large surface area of the gills allows the crayfish to absorb the oxygen from the water while keeping solutes out [Voltzow: 2015]. 

Crayfish live in freshwater environments, whose salinity levels can increase due to increasing temperatures from seasonal change and global warming [Phuc: 2017]. This study looks to see if the salinity of an environment affects the specific metabolic rate of crayfish who typically live in freshwater environments [Noble: 2017]. The independent variable of the experiment is the increase in salinity of the crayfish’s habitat, while the dependent variable is the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. We hypothesize that if crayfish were put into an environment with high salt content, that the metabolic rate will go up. This is expected because the crayfish must work harder to take up oxygen from the water, and keep the extra solutes out of the body. Working harder implies more energy is spent, therefore an increase in metabolic rate.


Materials and Methods:
Three crayfish were used for data collection. Each crayfish was weighed before data collection. The crayfish were put into the testing chamber, and then the chamber was filled with oxygenated water. The chamber was placed in a dishpan with room temperature water. Then the dissolved oxygen probe was inserted at the top of the chamber. A baseline reading was taken in addition to a five, ten, fifteen, and twenty-minute readings. After twenty minutes of readings were taken, the volume of water in the testing chamber was calculated by pouring the water into the chamber into a 1000 mL graduated cylinder. For the treated groups, 100 mL of a 6.5% sodium chloride solution was added to the testing chamber before filling the rest of it with oxygenated water giving a 0.72 – 0.73% salt concentration in the testing chamber. The same steps were taken to calculating the dissolved oxygen. With the difference in dissolved oxygen, the weight of the crayfish, the volume of the testing chamber, and time the specific metabolic rate of each crayfish could be calculated and compared. A paired T test was run to determine the statistical significance of the data.

Results:
After calculating the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish in water and water with increased salinity, there was a trend of a decrease in specific metabolic rate in the crayfish. The average specific metabolic rate for the control crayfish was 0.00063 while the average rate of the crayfish in salt water was 0.00021 (Figure 1). A paired t-test was run on the data, and the calculated p-value between the crayfish in normal water and increased salinity was 0.0684.

Discussion:
After the paired t-test was run on the data, it was found that the data was not statistically significant. Even though the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, this does not mean that a trend was apparent. Just glancing at the raw data, that the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish did decrease as the salinity of the water increased. More testing could determine whether this trend was not a random finding, but this trend does contradict the initial alternate hypothesis. It was hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate would increase because the increase of ions in the water would increase the gills work to keep them out of the body. This trend might be true for an environment with a very high salinity, but for this study, the salinity tested was around 0.72-0.73%, which is low. 

Looking at a research study done in 2007, which found that the metabolic rate of Gammarus tigrinus increases as salinity increases [Normant: 2007]. In another study conducted by the same author in 2008, they found that the specific metabolic rate in mud crabs, Rhithropanopeus harrisii, decreased with an increase in salinity [Normant: 2008]. This is the same trend that was found in the crayfish that were tested for this study. Looking at similar studies alludes the effect of salinity is not constant for all water breathing animals but differs for different species. A possible reasoning for this trend is because in the standard freshwater environments that crayfish live in the diffusion gradient for ions to leave their system is more significant than if the salinity increase. The increase in salinity makes it easier for the gills to keep ions out since the diffusion gradient goes down. Therefore, the metabolic rate should go down. A future study that could be done is look at increasing concentrations of salt in the environments to see if the same trend is observed. If the pattern can be proved by additional testing, this may imply it may be more helpful for crayfish to travel to slightly salty waters to conserve energy. It may also be beneficial to investigate whether the increase in salinity might impact crayfish’s physiological heath in other ways.
