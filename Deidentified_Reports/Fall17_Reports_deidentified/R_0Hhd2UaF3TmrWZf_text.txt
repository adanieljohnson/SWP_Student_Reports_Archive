Title: Effects of different temperatures on specific metabolic rate in Procambris spp.

Abstract:
We conducted a study on crayfish (Procambris spp.) to test the specific metabolic rate when put in different temperatures. The first temperature was room temperature and it was used as a controlll. Then we used ice cold water that was used as our experimental temperature. We hypothesized that if water temperature decreases, then the specific metabolic rate would decrease as well. We used oxygen consumption to measure specific metabolic rate because they are directly proportional to one another. We first found the controlll of oxygen consumption of the 3 crayfish so we could see how the specific metabolic rate would increase or decrease from the temperature change. Our statistics showed that from placing the crayfish into ice cold water (12C) we caused our crayfish to be in distress from the quick temperature change. This caused for specific metabolic rate to rise rather than lowering. Based on these results our hypothesis was not supported.


Introduction:
Organisms respond and adapt to environmental changes very well through a source of energy that helps them for these functions. For example, autotrophs, which are plants and other organisms that manufacture food from inorganic precursors, capture sunlight or chemical energy in glucose and similar molecules using photosynthesis or different enzyme catalyzed reactions [Johnson:2017]. While heterotrophs obtain high energy molecules and raw materials by consuming autotrophs or other heterotrophs. Autotrophs and heterotrophs use a similar set of mitochondrial enzymes to convert high energy molecules into low energy molecules, and capture the energy released during conversion using ATP [Johnson:2017].  For this experiment, we are determining the relationship between environmental temperature and rate of metabolism in crayfish (Procambris spp.). Crayfish are ectotherms which means it is much easier for them to alter their body temperature and take on the temperature of the surrounding environment, which affects their metabolism [Pörtner:2001]. Crayfish regularly excrete ions from their systems into water to keep an ion concentration balance with their bodies and water. This process of excretion is directly dependent on metabolic processes. A constant flow of water and dissolved ions into the crayfish system, means the crayfish constantly has to adapt to maintain equilibrium. We will also be looking at the effect of size on the specific metabolic rate which is measured by the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass per unit time. Metabolic rate is defined as the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiologic processes at any given time. To measure metabolic processes one should measure energy transfer directly from a source. Measuring specific metabolic rate can help find and monitor oxygen consumption which is directly proportional to the amount of energy expanded. When the metabolic rate is lower, the ions are being secreted at relatively small quantities. We know that when you lower temperatures of water it can hold more dissolved oxygen than warm water. We want to know how lowering temperatures will impact the specific metabolic rate. If water temperature decreases, then the specific metabolic rate will decrease as well.


Materials and Method:
To begin our experiment, we started off with room temperature (22C) measurements we filled the screw top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air. Next, the chamber was set into an empty plastic dishpan. Weigh each crayfish and place them into the test chamber. When the top is secure fill the dishpan with water so the top is slightly overfilled. Place the entire tank set up to the neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature water. Insert the dissolved oxygen probe into the top of the chamber. Once the instrument stabilizes, take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. At 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes (every 5 minutes) read the oxygen concentration again. Remove the probe and figure out the volume of water the crayfish was during the experiment. Measure the volume by pouring the water into a graduated cylinder then record the volume in the table. For the 12C measurements, use the same crayfish. Place the chamber in the 12C water bath. For the 12C measurements take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen. Record the oxygen concentration at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Measure the amount of water used. Return crayfish to holding pen. Refill chamber with fresh room temperature water. Repeat the entire process for the 2-other crayfish. For our statistical test, we used a two-paired t_test to analyze our data.


Results:
For the controlll of our crayfish they all had specific metabolic rates that varied. The first controlll’s specific metabolic rate was 0.00087. Control 2 had a specific metabolic rate of 0.0021. Finally, controlll 3 had a specific metabolic rate of 0.0011. The standard deviation for the controlll group was 0.00065394. The mean for this group was 0.0014. For our experimental group the first cray fish had a specific metabolic rate of 0.0045. The second experimental crayfish’s specific metabolic rate was 0.0077. Experimental crayfish 3 had a specific metabolic rate of 0. 0061.The experimental group had a standard deviation of 0.0016 and a mean of 0.018. As you can see from Figure 1, the mean of the experimental group was significently higher than the controlll group.  The results of our two-paired t_test are as stated: degrees of freedom 2, T-value is 8.1362 and a P-value of 0.0148. 


Discussion:
Based on our results, our hypothesis was not supported. We believed that this happened from the sudden decrease in temperature in all 3 of our crayfish caused for an increase in stress level which may have caused more oxygen consumption, therefore the specific metabolic rate increased as well. Levels of oxygen in body fluids may decrease due to the high oxygen demand in high temperatures or when aerobic capacity of the mitochondria is at some low temperatures. This means if temperatures are not normal the amount of oxygen being consumed and not consumed may vary if temperatures are not ideal [Pörtner:2001]. This scientist says that due the changes in climate the oxygen being used can be altered because we are trying adapt to the change. A constant and quick change can add stress to how oxygen is being received and exhaled. This can be said to be true for both animals and humans. To improve our experiment, I think we needed to let the crayfish adjust to all of the changes for a longer period of time. Not letting the crayfish adjust could be the reason our hypothesis was not supported. Transference of the crayfish from an aquarium to the respiratory cylinder disturbed them somewhat, tending to cause a temporary increase in metabolic rate. Because of this, the scientist that conducted the experiment saw that it was sufficient to give the crayfish twenty to thirty minutes for the animals to adjust to the new environment before the water sample was taken [Wien: 1961]. In our experimentation as a lab group we did not wait for the crayfish to adjust before we started collecting data. This could have affected our data because little things like this could have increased the metabolic rate of the crayfish. That would mean we did not get a reading of the crayfish’s metabolic rate at a natural state but maybe in a state of distress. Another point of correction that was tested by Wien was putting the crayfish in darkness while getting the oxygen consumption. By doing this the crayfish were less active and had less stress trying to adapt to the environment around it. Having a variety of temperatures rather than just two would give us more accurate reading of the metabolic adjustments of the crayfish. All together our data was found to be significent, we know this because our p_value was lower than 0.5.
