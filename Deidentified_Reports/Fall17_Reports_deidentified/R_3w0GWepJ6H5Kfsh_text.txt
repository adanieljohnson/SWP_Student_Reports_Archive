Title: The Effect of NaCl Solution on the Rate of Photosynthesis

Abstract:
This study involved light dependent reactions in photosynthesis, and the effect and mechanics of the electron transport chain on the rate of the reaction. The study was conducted by calculating the percent of change in absorbance when chloroplasts are put in different treatments every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. Then the effect 1.4M NaCl solution on the rate photosynthesis was compared to the rate of photosynthesis in a normal light environment. This experiment done assuming that NaCl slows, if not stopping, the flow of electrons thus slowing photosynthesis [Sudhir: 2005]. Therefore, is it hypothesized that the presence of sodium chloride will hinder the photosynthetic rate. The importance of this experiment is to show if salt will ultimately affect the growth of plants.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process used by autotrophs to produce chemical energy for later use. This process appears in the chloroplast found in Eukaryotic plant cells. Photosynthesis has a light reaction that is an oxidative-reduction reaction in which electrons are translated via the electron transport chain [Karp: 2008]. DCPIP is a deep blue substance used in the reactions because it is an electron acceptor so when photosynthesis is occurring and electrons are being transferred to the DCPIP the solution becomes colorless [Johnson: 2016]. This means that if photosynthetic activity is being slowed the solution will retain its deep blue color which is what should occur if there is is a photosynthetic inhibitor present. This also correlates to absorbance. The lower the absorbance the more photosynthetic activity meaning the lighter the solution becomes. For this experiment spinach leaves will be used because they are easily accessible, the leaves are big, easily manipulated, and they are cheap. The experiment will involve taking the rate of photosynthesis in spinach leaves chloroplast that have been put in the presence of sodium chloride (I) compared to the rate of photosynthesis (D) in spinach leaves in light. The electron transport in chloroplast is fueled by sunlight by causing electrons and protons to be transferred back and forth causing a proton gradient ultimately causing the synthesis of ATP; NaCl is targeting this chain [Karp: 2008]. The presence of sodium and chlorine ions can disrupt the electron transport chain causing the photosynthetic rate to decrease [Sudhir: 2005]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the spinach leaves treated with NaCl will have significantly lower percent of change of absorbance compared to those put in light when measuring photosynthetic rate.


Materials and Methods:
Five spinach leaves were obtained and their chloroplasts were extracted by crushing the leaves in a mortar using a grinding buffer. Then 200 microliters were transferred into a tube and put in centrifuge for 10 minutes at 200 G’s at 4 degrees Celsius. Another 200 microliters were taken from that sample and put in centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1000 G’s. The pellet was taken out and the previous repeated. Then the 13 test tubes were prepared. The blank contained only 2mL of reaction buffer 100mM phosphate, and 8mL of water. 3 negative control containing chloroplast, 6mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer all put in a dark environment. Another 3 negative controls containing chloroplast, 2mL of water, 2mL of DCPIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 20 microliters of 100mM tritian (emulsifies the cell membrane preventing photosynthesis) [Koley: 2010] detergent in a light environment.  3 positive controls consisting of chloroplast, 6mL of water, 2mL of DCPIP, and 2mL of reaction buffer. 3 samples containing chloroplast, 2mL of DCPIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 6mL of 1.4M NaCl solution in a light environment. After the preparation of the test tubes the initial absorbances were taken at 600 nm in a spectrophotometer.  Then the samples were placed back in their rightful environments for 10 minutes; then the absorbances were recorded again. This process was repeated two more times after 20 and 30 minutes. Then the percent change was calculated at each 10, 20, and 30 minutes compared to the initial absorbance with the percent of change being inversely related to a decrease in absorbance. Lastly 3 two-sampled one-tailed T-test were ran comparing the average percent of change of the positive control and the light and salt treatment at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.

Results:
The mean of the light group percent after 10 minutes is 12.797 ± 3.705. The mean of the light and salt percent of change group is 2.237 ± 0.814. The difference is significantly significant based on the first one-tailed unpaired T-test data (P = 0.0085) (α = .05) (df = 4) (t = 4.822). The mean of the light group after 20 minutes is 18.503 ± 5.412. The mean of the light and salt group was 2.58 ± 0.845. The difference is significantly significant based the second one-tailed unpaired T-test data (P = 0.0073) (α = .05) (df = 4) (t = 5.035 ). The mean of the light group after 30 minutes is 23.83 ± 7.495. The mean of the light and salt group was 2.38 ± 1.008. The difference is significantly significant based the third one-tailed unpaired T-test data (P = 0.0086) (α = .05) (df = 4) (t = 4.81). Assay two of the light + detergent assays was an outlier at 10, 20, and 30 minutes which is shown to be true with 95% confidence by the Q-test which resulted in (Qexp = 1) (Qcri = 0.970) for all three time periods; this can be observed from the large error bars on the salt and detergent negative control  on figure 1.

Discussion:
According to the data the difference between the percent of change of absorbance in the photosynthetic rate of spinach chloroplast in light compared to spinach chloroplast in light and a salt solution of NaCl is statistically significant. Therefore, the hypothesis that NaCl will hinder photosynthesis is accepted. The correlation of the reduced photosynthesis rate in a plant when exposed to NaCl is possibly due to the NaCl changing the conformation of the thylakoid membrane proteins which changes what gets in and what gets out effecting what is being reduced and oxidized ultimately disrupting the electron transport [Misra: 1998]. There are some possible errors that could have occurred in the experiment such as there not being a guaranteed way to see which cubicle of assay got the most light or how efficiently the light was actually getting to the cubicles. A few proposed future experiments could be adding more replicate assays, using a more controlled lighting and darkness environment, or testing of a different type of salt, such as KCl. NaCl has been found to reduce the yield of crops [Mirsa: 1998]. A problem with this is when roads are salted it could be negatively affecting crop yield resulting in a loss for the farming industry [Green: 2008]. Therefore, this process should be furthered studied to see how to possibly combat this effect.

Figure Legends: This figure represents percent of change in absorbance for the four treatments at the 10, 20, and 30 minute mark. This bar graph gives a visual display of the data and the relationship between the control and the treatments. The standard error bars for the light + detergent treatment is skewed because of the second assay being a significant outlier which is shown by the Q-test in the results.
