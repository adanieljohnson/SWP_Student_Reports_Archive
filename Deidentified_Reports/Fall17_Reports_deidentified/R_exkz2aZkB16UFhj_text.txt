Title: The Effects of Colored Light on Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinach Leafs

Abstract:
The purpose was to determine if the color of light has an effect the rate of photosynthesis of plants.  We chose to use three different colors of light: white, blue and red. There was a blank, a sample without chloroplast under each light condition, and three samples with chloroplast under each light condition.  Each sample had an initial absorbance reading, one following ten minutes under its assigned light color, after ten more minutes (20 minutes total), and then again after another ten minutes (30 minutes total). The statistical ANOVA test did not produce a significent difference, meaning the null hypothesis was not rejected [p=0.126]. After calculating the change in absorbance over time, it was determined that white light had the highest rate of photosynthesis while the red light had the lowest rate of photosynthesis in spinach plants.


Introduction:
Energy is stored in three forms: 1) chemical energy within covalent bonds, 2) storage of energy as redox potentials, and 3) gradient across a lipid bilayer.  All organisms directly or indirectly gain energy from external sources. For instance, plants capture energy from sunlight, using photosynthesis. After the energy is stored it can be released into the cytoplasm of the cell via glycolysis and respiration. First, chloroplasts absorb the energy that radiates from the sun through chlorophyll molecules. Next, the electrons leave the carrier molecules and trigger reactions that cleave water to release the remaining electrons on carriers and to create a larger proton gradient. Then the electrons are stored as NADPH. ATP synthesis is powered by the proton gradient produced across the lipid bilayer earlier on in the cycle. Finally, the NADPH and ATP are used to synthesize a 6-carbon glucose from 1-carbon carbon dioxide molecules. In plants, the ATP synthesized is consumed in the process of glucose synthesis.  Three factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis include light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. In addition, the gender of the plant can also affect the rate of photosynthesis in plants [Luning & Dring, 1975]. Light energy is absorbed by photosynthetic organisms in order for them to produce a form of energy they can use. Pigments absorb wavelengths of light differently, some may be reflected while others are absorbed. For example, plants appear green to the human eye because they are reflecting the green light back to us. The intensity of light, or amount of energy present, impacts the rate of photosynthesis due to the pigments in the plant.
There are two types of pigments or chlorophyll: α and β. Chlorophyll-α is the main photosynthetic pigment, absorbs energy wavelengths of blue-violet and red-orange, and energy around 675 nm. However, a smaller amount of energy is absorbed by chlorophyll-β and then sent to chlorophyll-α. In addition, Chlorophyll-β absorbs energy of about 640 nm, green light, and is more absorbent than chlorophyll-α. Red light has the longest wavelength and least energy while blue is on the shorter end of the wavelength spectrum and has much more energy. In fact, red has even been proven to cause dysfunctional photosynthesis processes in plants, specifically cucumber leaves [Hogewoning, et al., 2010]. However, white light is made of various wavelengths found in many different colors of visible light. Our goal for this experiment is to determine whether plants have a higher rate of photosynthesis under blue, red or white light via analysis of absorption. Given the difference between energy absorption and color in chlorophyll- α and chlorophyll- β, we hypothesize that the white light will have the highest rate of photosynthesis while the red light will produce the lowest rate of photosynthesis in spinach plants.

Materials and Method:
The experiment began with a mortar and pestle, 150-Ml beaker and 2 50-Ml centrifuge tubes being placed on ice. While the items were cooling in ice, the large central vein of four medium-sized spinach leaves was removed, the leaves were rinsed with tap water and blotted dry. Then, the mortar and pestle were removed from the ice bath, wiped dry, and used to grind the spinach leaves. Next, 10-Ml of cool grinding buffer was added and ground until a paste formed; then, another 10-Ml of grinding buffer was added and the mixture was ground once more. The green spinach mixture was then strained with cheesecloth and the remaining liquid was  transferred into a cold, 50-Ml centrifuge tube. Then it was spun at 200xG for 3 minutes. Afterwards, the supernatant was poured from the first centrifuge tube into another. Then it was centrifuged at 1000xG for ten minutes. When complete, the liquid was removed so that only the pellet remained, added 20-Ml of grinding buffer and stirred.  For the second part of the experiment, thirteen test tubes and thirteen spectrophotometer cuvettes were labeled, 0-12. The the appropriate mixtures were prepared in the correctly labeled test tubes. 100- μl of enriched chloroplast were added to the test tubes labeled 0 and #4-12, then mixed well. Then each sample was transferred to its matching spectrophotometer cuvette and measure the absorbance (at 600nm). Samples #1, 4-6 were placed under blue light, #2, 7-9 under red light, and #3, 10-12 under white light, each set-in a test tube rack. The blank, or 0, was not placed under a specific light color. After 10 minutes, the samples were transferred to their respective spectrophotometer cuvette and absorbance was measured. Each test tube was placed back under its appropriate light color and let sit for another 10 minutes (totaling 20 minutes). The absorbance was measured in the respective spectrophotometer cuvette and the process was repeated once more after another 10 minutes (totaling 30 minutes). All data was recorded in table. 

Results:
In the samples with chloroplasts, the raw data showed an increasing rate of photosynthesis from red light to blue light, and blue to white light in respective order. Therefore, the raw data failed to reject the hypothesis; meaning that samples under white light will have the highest rate of photosynthesis while the red light will produce the lowest rate of photosynthesis. An ANOVA statistical test was run[p=0.126]. The p_value was greater than 0.05, meaning the statistical results also supported the hypothesis.

Discussion:
The results, that photosynthetic rate from highest to lowest was as follows: white, blue, red. These results were caused by the different wavelengths of light and the plants ability to absorb them. The visible spectrum ranges from 400nm – 700nm and can be seen by the human eye. Chlorophyll have two specific absorption peaks: one around 450 nm, the region of blue light, and one around 660nm, which the location of most red light. The ability of the pigment to absorb the different color light explains the outcome of the experiment. The pigment in the spinach leaves absorbed the blue light more readily than the red light; and the white light, a combination of many wavelengths, had an absorption and rate of photosynthesis higher than the other two colors. Our results were evidence of how chlorophyll- α and chlorophyll- β absorb light energy differently from one another. Chlorophyll- β, being more absorbent than chlorophyll- α, was able to absorb the blue light more readily than the red light energy due its its energy level being closer to that which is most actively absorbs. Another factor that contributed to the ability to truly see the rate of photosynthesis was having samples without chloroplast to compare with our samples. The three samples without chloroplast, one under each color light, served to show if DCIP caused any color change without the presence of chloroplast. In future experiment, increasing the number of samples or even the time period in which the absorbance was observed and recorded would be ways to gather more accurate data. A larger amount of data would allow us to draw more general conclusions about photosynthesis rates in the presence of different colors of light.
