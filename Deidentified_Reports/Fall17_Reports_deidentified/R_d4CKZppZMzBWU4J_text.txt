Title: Effect of low pH (Acidic water) on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambris sp.

Abstract:
This report details the effects on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish, specifically the organism Procambris sp., after submerging them in normal and acidic water. Our experiment was done in one class setting and included three Procambris sp. that were each their own controlll by being placed in normal pH water, and later placed into a more acidic water bath. This report also details the results of our experiment that matched the research done prior by scientists — showing that there is a decrease in the specific metabolic rate after placing the crayfish in water with a lower pH. The specific metabolic rate of our controlll trials was averaged to be 0.0009 Ml O2/gxh; and the average specific metabolic rate of our experimental trials was 0.0004 Ml O2/gxh. A single tailed paired t_test was run on our results which gave our p_value of 0.0006. Due to our p_value being below our set alpha of 0.05, our results were found to be statistically significent. This showed that the acidic water did cause a change in the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. between our controlll and experimental trials.

Introduction:
Metabolism refers to the complex process of balancing energy capture, the conversion of energy, and the transfer of energy within the cells of an organism. In detail, metabolism is the set of life sustaining chemical processes that enable an organism to transform chemical energy to energy that can be later used for cellular processes. Heterotrophs, such as crayfish, convert the carbon and oxygen from glucose into carbon dioxide gas in order to obtain their necessary energy. This reaction releases high-energy electrons that are captured by molecules of NAD+ and FAD, which then transfer electrons to the electron transport system. The breaking down of glucose releases energy that is captured by the cell in the form of high-energy adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules. As long as the electrons at the end of the chain are removed from the mitochondria by transferring them to oxygen, this system will continue to generate ATP, also known as energy.
	Metabolic rate is the actual amount of energy being expended by an organism in a given period of time. In other words, it is how quickly fuels — such as glucose — are broken down to keep organisms’ cells running. Metabolic rate is also commonly referred to as the amount of oxygen consumed by an organism. This is due to the proportional relation between the amount of energy expended and the amount of oxygen used by a species. Therefore, the more energy the organism is expending, the more oxygen it will consume. In terms of crayfish, oxygen is taken up from water through the gills from their exoskeleton. 
	In an experiment done by Bronwyn A. Ellis and Stephen Morris in 1995, the impact of various pH levels on the amount of oxygen uptake and the metabolic rate of freshwater crayfish, Cherax destructor, was tested. The crayfish were exposed to acidic water with a pH level of 4.5. It was found that the acid-exposed crayfish had a 79% reduction in their oxygen uptake; thus resulting in a decreased metabolic rate [Ellis and Morris: 1995]. Based on their results, Ellis and Morris hypothesized that since the type of water affected the respiration and metabolic pathways in the crayfish Cherax destructor, it was likely that waters with extreme pH levels would probably affect most species of crayfish [Ellis and Morris: 1995]. 
	For our experiment, we used Procambris sp. because they are similar to the freshwater crayfish used in the previous study and consume oxygen from water through their gills; thus making it easier to measure their oxygen consumption to determine their specific metabolic rate. With the knowledge provided from the prior experiment combined with our knowledge in regard to oxygen uptake of crayfish in acidic water, we developed a hypothesis primarily based off the results and hypothesis of Ellis and Morris. We predicted that by placing the crayfish in acidic water, there would be a decrease in the specific metabolic rate due to the difficulty of adjusting to a new environment. So — in theory by being in an unfamiliar environment, the crayfish would reduce its level of activity and therefore the amount of energy used, resulting in less oxygen consumed and a lower metabolic rate. 

Materials and Method:
To start, the normal pH water must be obtained from the tank and poured into the testing chamber. It is important for the testing chamber to be entirely full with water before the organism is placed within it. Once the testing chamber is full, place the chamber into a dishpan already filled with a water bath. The first crayfish, or Procambris sp., is then weighed and placed into the testing chamber. Once the entire set up is constructed, screw the top with the dissolved oxygen probe in the chamber. At this point, there should be an overflow of water spilling out of the chamber. The instrument is then ready to be turned on in order to receive a baseline reading. It takes a few minutes for the instrument to stabilize and give an accurate reading.
	Once the baseline reading is collected, a reading of the oxygen concentration must be taken every five minutes. This continues for twenty minutes, allowing for a total of five readings to be collected. After all the data is gathered, the first crayfish is removed from the testing chamber and placed in a net for the time being. During this time, the water from the testing chamber is poured into a graduated cylinder and the volume of the water is recorded. It is important to keep in mind that each Procambris sp. serves as its own controlll for this experiment — therefore, the same crayfish is later placed in acidic water for the experimental trial and the same process as the controlll is conducted. For the acidic water, 100 Ml of 3.0 pH is diluted in 900 Ml of tank water. This solution is used as the water to fill the testing chamber and place the crayfish within for the experimental trials. This process of setting up the testing chamber and recording the oxygen concentration every five minutes for a total of twenty minutes is repeated four additional times — two being the controlll and the other two being the experimental. All results are then recorded into a chart and the specific metabolic rate is calculated for each trial.
	The acidity of the water serves as our independent variable, and the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. is our dependent variable. Once the experiment was completed in one class setting, a single-tailed paired t_test was conducted in order to determine whether a statistical significance was present among our controlll and experimental results.

Results:
All of our crayfish displayed a decrease in their specific metabolic rate after being placed in the acidic water. The specific metabolic rates of our individual controlll and experimental trials were averaged for convenience. Our average for the metabolic rate of the controlll trails was 0.0009 Ml O2/gxh. Our average for the metabolic rate of the experimental trials was 0.0004 Ml O2/gxh. The standard deviation of our controlll was 0.0006, and 0.0002 for our experimental. Through a single-tailed paired t_test, our p_value was determined to be 0.0006.
	Overall, our data showed a decreasing trend in the metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. after being submerged in water with a lower pH level. Since we calculated six different metabolic rates — three being from the controlll trials and the other three being from the experimental trials — there was an excess of raw data. Therefore, in Figure 1, our results of each trial are averaged so the difference among our crayfish are displayed more clearly. As seen in Figure 1, the experimental trials resulted in a decrease in specific metabolic rate compared to the controlll trials.

Discussion:
	Based on our results being statistically significent, we reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis is supported. Our p_value was calculated to be 0.0006 after running a single-tailed paired t_test. Due to the p_value being less than our set alpha value of 0.05, this means there is a statistical significance between the results of our controlll and experimental groups. Since all of our results showed an expected decrease in the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. in acidic water, our hypothesis was supported by our results. 
	Specific metabolic rate in this experiment is the amount of energy expended by an organism, and thus the amount of oxygen consumed. Our results tell us that the low pH water caused the Procambris sp. to reduce its amount of energy used and the amount of oxygen consumed. One reasoning for this is because acidic water, in general, has less oxygen present due to its greater concentration in hydrogen ions — which was observed in our experiment through the decrease in the amount of oxygen present in our acidic water in comparison to our normal pH water. For instance, our normal pH water had an average oxygen concentration of 8.63 and our acidic water had an average oxygen concentration of 7.51. In normal pH water, the crayfish is able to consume the oxygen in the water through its gills and the dissolved oxygen then diffuses into the bloodstream. However, when placed in water with less oxygen present, the crayfish is in a condition of hypoxia or oxygen deficiency. This is an environmental state where the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water decreases to a level that can no longer support the living aquatic organism [Reiber: 1995]. In a study done by Carl L. Reiber, the physiological response of crayfish in less oxygenated water was tested. It was found that the experimental crayfish exposed to hypoxia, reduced their movement — resulting in bradycardia, or a decreased heart rate — in order to compensate for the oxygen decline and to prolong their limited supply of oxygen [Reiber: 1995].  In terms of our experiment, the less oxygen available in the acidic water similarly caused our experimental organisms to reduce their activity, and thus their specific metabolic rate. Another reasoning for this occurrence is due to the stress of a new environment. For instance, the unfamiliar environment of low pH water caused the crayfish to slow its metabolic pathways to cope with the stress. Ultimately, reduced movement, less oxygen available, and stress are all considered components as to why we saw a decrease in specific metabolic rate for the Procambris sp. in the lower pH water.
	By looking at the research done in 1995 by Bronwyn A. Ellis and Stephen Morris, we expected our experimental trials to display a decrease in specific metabolic rate. In the end, our results did coincide with the findings of Ellis and Morris since all of our experimental Procambris sp. depicted a decrease in their specific metabolic rate versus our controlll. In the future, we would prefer to run an experiment testing the impact of alkaline water on the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. in comparison to normal pH water. It would be interesting to see if the specific metabolic rate of the organism increased in alkaline water due to the higher concentrations of oxygen available. Ultimately, we trust our results from this experiment since there were no obvious discrepancies and all of our calculations were done thoroughly; as well as both our data and statistical test showing there was a significent change in specific metabolic rate among our controlll and experimental trials.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Comparison of Specific Metabolic Rate of Three Procambris sp. in Normal pH water and Acidic Water. In total, we used three crayfish, specifically Procambris sp, with each being its own controlll. Meaning, each crayfish was first placed in normal pH water and then later submerged in water with a lower pH level that served as the experimental trial. There were six total trials — three for the controlll and three for the experimental. The graph shows the average of our controlll trials — 0.0009 Ml O2/gxh; and experimental trials — 0.0004 Ml O2/gxh. The standard deviation for our controlll Procambris sp. was 0.0006. The standard deviation for our experimental Procambris sp. was 0.0002. Our t_stat was 2.38 and the degrees of freedom for this experiment was 2. After conducting a single tailed paired t_test, the p_value was calculated as 0.0006.
