Title: Effect of three different temperatures on the photosynthetic rate of kale (Brassica oleracea)

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effect that three different temperatures of water would have on the photosynthetic rates of kale leaves (Brassica oleracea). We hypothesized that the reaction mixtures that were treated with cold water would have the highest rate of photosynthesis because kale is usually grown during the fall, and although it can withstand heat, it favors colder temperatures. We had one control group with no chloroplasts in each of the different temperatures, and three experimental groups at different temperatures (6°C, 21°C, and 30°C). To obtain the enriched chloroplasts we grinded the kale leaves with grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8), centrifuged it twice, and collected the supernatant. We used the Hill reaction with 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) to test for evidence of photosynthesis. The test tubes were prepared with 6 mL of dH2O, 2 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 100 μL of the enriched chloroplasts, and they were four test tubes in each water temperature (one without chloroplast, three with chloroplast). We immediately measured the absorbance, at 600 nm, of all the samples, and then placed all the samples under light and read the absorbance again after 10, 20, and 30 minutes. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effect of an environmental condition to see how it might affect vascular plants. We chose to test the effect temperature would have on the photosynthetic rate of kale (Brassica oleracea) since temperature is one of the main factors that can affect it. Photosynthesis is crucial for most life earth, and any environmental factors that can affect photosynthetic rates in plants will have drastic effects on plant growth. 

Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes on Earth that occurs in the chloroplast that converts light energy from the Sun to consumable chemical energy to fuel an organism’s activities in the chloroplast [Johnson, Lewis, et al.: 2002]. It is a three-step process, the first two being light-dependent reactions and the last one being a light-independent reaction (Calvin cycle). The light-dependent reactions use absorbed photons of two different wavelengths to generate reducing power, and most of the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. Then, during the Calvin cycle, the enzyme complex RUBISCO uses ATP and reducing power to combine carbon dioxide with a ribulose phosphate to create a glucose molecule (6 carbon). Moreover, we can measure electron transfer reactions by using the Hill reaction, which uses an electron acceptor to create a reduced product and oxygen. The electron acceptor we used was 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), which is a dark blue compound in its oxidized form, that turns colorless when it is reduced by the chloroplasts during photosynthesis. 

Light independent reactions of photosynthesis are dependent on temperature since it is a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme and as the enzyme reaches optimum temperatures the overall rate increases. However, outside the optimum range, the photosynthetic rate will begin to decrease. “Low temperature” and “high temperature” are relative expressions to the plant; because of photosynthetic adaptation, the genetic adjustments by natural selection of genotypes that are adapted to live and photosynthesize efficiently in an environment, some plants thrive in colder or warmer environments [Oquist: 1982]. 

Kale is a hardy, low-growing plant that is adapted to growing in the fall in both the North and South, and it can withstand heat, but it is usually grown as a fall crop [Splittstoesser: 1990]. Due to this we hypothesized that the photosynthetic rate of kale would be the hgihest at the lowest temperature tested. Furthermore, we chose to test the photosynthetic rate of kale in three different temperatures (room temperature, cold, and hot) because the optimum soil temperature for kale is between 7°C-30°C, with it usually favoring colder temperatures. Also, we hypothesized this because it has been proven that an increase in growing air temperatures above optimum levels may result in damage to thylakoid membranes, and a decrease in photosynthetic rates [Taiz & Zeiger: 1998].


Materials and Methods:
To conduct this experiment, we began by obtaining a couple of kale leaves and removing the large central veins and rinsing the leaves out. We placed the kale leaves in a chilled mortar and pestle with 20 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8), and grinded the kale until there were no large chunks of leaves left. Then, we strained the slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker and transferred the green liquid to a chilled centrifuge tube (marked “A”) and spun it at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4°C. When that was finished, we poured the supernatant out of tube “A” into another centrifuge tube (marked “B”) without transferring the debris at the bottom of tube “A”. Tube “B” was centrifuged at 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4°C, and when it was finished the supernatant was poured into a chilled centrifuge tube (marked “C”). Next, 20 mL of the grinding buffer was added to tube “C” and it was suspended by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. This was what was used as the enriched chloroplast in the second part of the experiment. 
	Furthermore, once the first part of the experiment was completed, 13 large test tubes were prepared with different reaction mixes to perform the Hill assay. The first test tube was a blank that contained only 8 mL of deionized water (dH2O) and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Test tubes 1-3 contained 6 mL of dH2O, 2 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. Test tubes 4-12 contained 6 mL of dH2O, 2 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, 2 mL of the reaction buffer, and 100 μL of the enriched chloroplasts. Room temperature dH2O (21°C) was added to test tubes 1, and 4-6. Cold dH2O (6°C) was added to test tubes 2, and 7-9, and test tubes 3, and 10-12 were placed in a hot water bath (30°C). We immediately measured the absorbances, at 600 nm, of all the samples (Time zero), and then placed all the samples under light. We read and recorded the absorbances again after 10, 20, and 30 minutes. We performed an ANOVA test and a Turkey-Kramer test afterwards to see if there is were statistical differences in our results. 


Results:
There was no significant difference (P = 0.239; P = 0.24; P = 0.239) in the photosynthetic rates of kale leaves when treated with different temperatures of water. Further tests indicated that there were no significant differences between the use of cold (6°C) or hot (30°C) water on the rate of photosynthesis over the course of 10, 20, or 30 minutes. No significant differences were indicated between other experimental groups. Furthermore, the trend for the test tubes with no chloroplasts in room temperature (21°C), cold temperature (6°C), and hot temperature (30°C) at 10, 20, and 30 minutes was that there was an increase in absorbance, thus, a negative percent change (Figure 1). Although not as great, there was also a negative percent change with the test tubes that contained hot water (Figure 4). The general trend seen for the absorbance of the tubes in cold and room temperature water is that they lowered, and the percent change was positive (Figure 2; Figure 3). The percent change in absorbance was greatest with the cold water. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment partially support our hypothesis because while there aren’t any significant differences between any of the experimental groups, the percent change of absorbances was greatest with the test tubes that were placed in the cold water (6°C) and contained chloroplasts. This percent change means the absorbances of the reaction mixtures decreased because DCPIP was being reduced by the chloroplasts/light, which causes the color to change from dark blue to colorless. Also, since there was a negative percent change with the test tubes that were placed in the hot water (30°C) and contained chloroplasts, this shows that there was no photosynthesis occurring since the DCPIP was not being reduced to its colorless form. This is most likely due to the fact that kale is usually a fall crop and it is frequently planted to replace vegetables that were harvested in midsummer, thus, it prefers colder temperatures [Splittstoesser: 1990]. Furthermore, frost usually improves the flavor of kale which is why it is usually grown in colder seasons [Splittstoesser: 1990] [Olsen, Aaby, & Borge: 2009]. 
	
Photosynthesis is a crucial biological process for life on Earth, and there are many environmental factors that can affect photosynthetic rates in plants that will have drastic effects on plant growth and development. Temperature is one of the factors that can affect all the biochemical reactions that are involved in photosynthesis. Temperature can affect the photosynthetic rate of plants since each plant has their own optimum temperature to grow in, and when plants are exposed to temperatures that exceed the limits of tolerance of their physiological mechanisms, the plant will undergo an irreversible loss of photosynthetic capacity [Govindjee: 2012]. Significant differences in air temperature have also been found to limit plant growth, at both extremes of very high or low temperatures, and it can impact plant performance and metabolism [Lefsrud, et al.: 2005]. 
	
Another factor that could have affected our results is the age of the kale leaves. It has been found that the rates of photosynthesis are slow for younger leaves, and they increase as the leaves mature, and then decrease again with increasing age [Singh & Lal: 1935]. Due to us not knowing the age of the kale leaves we tested we cannot know how that affected our results. A way to better this experiment in the future would be to know the age of the kale leaves to have less confounding variables and get more accurate results. Additionally, this experiment is important because we can test the effect that global warming will have on plant growth as it worsens. Our global environment is experiencing a great period of significant change in climate at a faster rate than we’ve ever seen before, and this will cause more radiation to damage the plants and alter physiological functions of the plants themselves [Shorta & Necklesb: 1999].
