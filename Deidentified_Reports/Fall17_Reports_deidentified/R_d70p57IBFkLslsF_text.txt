Title: The relationship between exercise and specific metabolic rate in Procambris spp. 

Abstract:
The effects of exercise on the specific metabolic rate was studied using the Procambris spp. as a model organism.  It was hypothesized that after exercise the P. spp.’s specific metabolic rate would increase due to more oxygen consumption after exercise and more energy expended.  First, the specific metabolic rate for P. spp. was calculated at rest and then after two minutes of exercise it was measured again to see if there was a change.  The data went in to opposite direction of what we thought would happen.  We used a paired two sample t_test to determine significance of the results of the lab.  After the paired t_test we reported that our hypothesis was not supported and that there is no significent difference in the specific metabolic rate before and after exercise (p_value>0.05).  We suggested that the reason we did not get data that supports our hypothesis is because we did not take into account the stress the exercise could be causing P. spp.  

Introduction:
The term metabolism describes the process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells or an organism.  The specific metabolic rate refers to the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiologic processes at any given time.  A way to describe the metabolic process is to measure the amount of ATP made or used during biological reactions.  Unfortunately, this is extremely difficult to do for a single reaction.  An easier way to follow the metabolic rate is to use the consumption of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide.  This provides us with an indirect indication of the energy being used since oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended [Johnson:2017].  This means that by tracking the amount of oxygen being used during a biological reaction we can determine the specific metabolic rate of that reaction.
	In this lab, we studied the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. (better known as crayfish, or crawfish).  The crawfish is an ectotherm making it easy to change its body temperature and therefore its specific metabolic rate [Johnson:2017].  We wanted to study the effects of exercise on the specific metabolic rate of the crawfish.  In ectotherms, as the organism exercises the body temperature increases [Glazier:2009].  This is because the reactions happening in the crawfish’s body release high energy electrons that are captured by NAD+ and FAD.  These two then transports the electrons to the electron transport system which causes ADP to become energized ATP [Johnson:2017].  We hypothesized that with measuring the specific metabolic rate before and after exercise for the crawfish would give us a higher specific metabolic rate after exercise.


Materials and Method:
Three crawfish were obtained for a total of three different trials.  One of the crawfish was taken out of its container and weighed before it was placed in the test chamber that was filled with room temperature water.  Next, the screw top with the dissolved oxygen probe was placed on the test chamber and the reader was stabilized.  The stabilized reading was recorded as the baseline reading and four more readings were taking in five minute intervals, so that the readings were taken for 20 total minutes.  The volume of the test chamber was then poured into a graduated cylinder so that the volume could be recorded and used to find the specific metabolic rate before exercise.  The crawfish was then forced to exercise by us poking at it for two minutes so that it would be moving constantly during that period.  The whole process for determining that amount of oxygen depleted was completed again for the same crawfish.  Once the amount of oxygen used after exercise was determined the crawfish was placed back in its holding container and this whole process was done for the other two crawfish as well.  After all the data was collected, a paired two sample t_test was used to test the significance of the lab.

Results:
The trend our data of specific metabolic rate shows is that after getting the crawfish to exercise specific metabolic rate decreases.  For the first two crawfish the rate decreased by about half of the rate before exercise.  The last crawfish’s rate decreased by 0.0002 mg/(min*g) which is not much of a difference but is still not what we expected to happen.  This trend is reflected in Figure 3 as well.  After the paired t_test was run the values we produced were 2 for the degrees of freedom, 2.662409 for the t-value, and 0.116858 for the p_value.

Discussion:
With such a high p_value we cannot say that there is a significent difference between the metabolic rates of crawfish before and after exercise.  Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported with this lab.  After doing some research as to why this lab did not go the way we thought it would, there may be a possible explanation to why this data was produced.  When crawfish are introduced to environmental stress their respirations become anaerobic.  Normally this is because there is not enough oxygen in the surround environment, such as in cold water, for the crawfish to take up [Gamble:2009].  With this in mind, it is possible that the forced exercise of the crawfish caused it to experience the same stress in a hypoxic environment and as an effect started to respire anaerobically.  This would explain why the oxygen consumption of the crawfish lowered instead of increased as previously thought.  Either way, this lab indicates that more research is needed if the relationship between exercise and specific metabolic rate is to be determined in crawfish.  A possible improvement to this lab could be to instead of forcing the crawfish to exercise via poking maybe it would be better to get it to chase something, like food for example.  It cannot be another crawfish because then we would more than likely get results for aggression and metabolic rate, but getting it to move around with reduced stress should be the goal for the next time this lab is run.  Thinking outside of this lab, we are left with the question of what could cause enough stress for the crawfish to start anaerobic respirations and how long does it take for the crawfish to get out of that stage of respirations?  This could be an interesting topic to look into and would help with the improvement of this lab so we know how to avoid the causes of anaerobic respirations.
