Title: Effects of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on tetanic muscle contraction in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
This experiment tests the effects of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on threshold frequency required to attain tetany in the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens, the northern leopard frog. Based on the function of acetylcholinesterase in the neuromuscular junction, we hypothesized that the injection of a 2% Sevin solution, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, would decrease the frequency needed to attain tetany. The gastrocnemius muscle was stimulated through the sciatic nerve at 4, 8, 10, 12, and 15 Hertz before and after injection of the 2% Sevin solution. Other parameters were controlled by setting the unit to an amplitude of 2 volts, a pulse width to 5ms and a pulse number of 0. The data confirmed our hypothesis, stating that the threshold frequency needed to achieve tetany after treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was significantly lower than threshold frequencies before treatment, (t-value= 8, df= 2, p-value= 0.0153). This experiment is consistent with the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disorder.

Introduction:
The nervous systems of vertebrates tend to be complex, innervating the body to control many functions. Neurons, as the functional cell of the nervous system, play a crucial role in sending messages throughout the body to regulate the internal environment and respond to the external environment [Johnson: 2017]. In order to respond to the external environment, an organism must be able to coordinate movement through the voluntary nervous system. Action potentials from the brain travel along the nerve and when they reach the presynaptic neuron at the neuromuscular junction, the goal is to continue the action potential into the postsynaptic effector muscle fiber. This is achieved by using acetylcholine to continue the action potential [Johnson: 2017]. As the action potential reaches the axon terminals of the presynaptic neuron, calcium enters the axon terminal through voltage-gated calcium channels, causing acetylcholine vesicles to migrate to the postsynaptic membrane and release their contents into the synapse. Acetylcholine then travels to ligand-gated nonspecific cation channels and opens them to allow positive ions to depolarize the muscle fiber [Sadava: 2016]. However, acetylcholine cannot continue to depolarize the muscle fiber without negative consequences, so acetylcholinesterase breaks acetylcholine into choline and acetate. The two products are then reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron and acetylcholine is resynthesized for later use [Sadava: 2016].
This prompts the question, what happens when acetylcholinesterase cannot remove acetylcholine from the neuromuscular junction? Several studies have been conducted on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, concluding that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase the length of contraction [Clovic: 2013], but what effect would an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor have on the frequency of stimulation needed to produce tetany in a muscle? We hypothesized that the introduction of a 2% Sevin solution into the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens would decrease the threshold frequency needed to stimulate tetany. 
R. pipiens, the northern leopard frog, and similar amphibians are often used when studying muscles due to their powerful hind legs that are used for jumping. This organism provides researchers with an exemplary system that can be tested and compared with other muscle systems that are used for powerful contraction, like humans [James: 2007]. R. pipiens is also relatively abundant, so testing would not cause undue harm to population sizes of the species. 


Materials and Methods:
We prepared three frogs legs by removing the skin, separating the sciatic nerve and disconnecting the gastrocnemius muscle from its distal joint. We then connected the sciatic nerve to a stimulator that would later be connected to an iWorx unit. Metal pins were placed in the muscle proximal to the gastrocnemius and the connective tissue below to maintain placement of the leg. We then suspended the gastrocnemius muscle to visually observe tetany (see figure 1). Using the iWorx unit and accompanying software, we stimulated the muscle through the sciatic nerve at 4, 8, 10, 12, and 15 hertz for 5 seconds each. Other parameters were controlled by setting the unit to an amplitude of 2 volts, a pulse width to 5ms and a pulse number of 0. The presence of tetany was defined as a contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle without visible pulsation of the muscle and a sustained contraction without pulsating changes in voltage on the myogram (see figure 2). Both conditions had to be present to confirm tetanus. After stimulation at each frequency, we prepared a 2% solution of Sevin, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, in Ringer’s solution and injected 0.2mL of the treatment solution in three portions throughout the gastrocnemius muscle and then repeated the testing conditions.  Throughout the procedure, Ringer’s solution was used to maintain ion concentration in the gastrocnemius muscle. The same procedure was then repeated for the next two frog legs. 
We used a paired two-sample t-test to determine the significance of the data. The lowest frequency that produced tetany in experimental and control testing conditions was compared for each frog leg. A p-value of less than 0.05 was defined as significant. 


Results:
After injection of a 2% Sevin solution, gastrocnemius muscles presented with tetany at lower frequencies than before injection (a control mean of 15 Hz and an experimental mean of 12.33 Hz). Data varied widely within the test groups, as demonstrated by large standard deviations for both groups (see figure 3). Frog leg three was an outlier due to the high frequency that was needed to stimulate tetany in both control and experimental trials; the muscle did not produce tetany until 18 Hz during the control trial. However, there was still a decrease in the frequency needed to stimulate tetany after injection, 15 Hz, so it was not excluded from the data. Despite this, a paired two-sample t-test determined that the threshold frequency needed to produce tetany in muscles injected with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was significantly lower than muscles that were not injected (t-value= 8, df= 2, p-value= 0.0153).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the introduction of a 2% Sevin solution would decrease the threshold frequency needed to stimulate tetany in the gastrocnemius muscle of R. pipiens was supported by the data collected. After injection, each frog leg produced tetany at a lower frequency than before injection. Though there is not a lot of literature studying this particular effect, this conclusion is consistent with other findings regarding acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and their effect on muscle function. Current research focuses on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in versions of acetylcholine that are used in the brain as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. In the neuromuscular junction, however, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been found to act as potentiators, increasing the effect that certain frequencies have on muscle fibers [Bosch: 1992].  
At the level of the neuromuscular junction, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor would stop acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine in order for it to be removed from the synapse, causing ligand-gated nonspecific cation channels to remain open between stimulations. This would cause the muscle to depolarize at lower frequencies than reported under control conditions [Clovic: 2013]. However, this mechanism suggests that ligand-gated cation channels would remain open indefinitely, meaning that we should have seen tetany at all frequencies, possibly continuing after stimulation. There are multiple reasons for why this was not reported. For example, the concentration of Sevin may not have been great enough to inhibit all of the acetylcholinesterase proteins to completely stop the removal of acetylcholine from the synapse. The introduction of Sevin may have only slowed down the process of removal of acetylcholine from the neuromuscular junction rather than stopped it indefinitely.
Moving forward, this experiment poses several additional questions regarding the effect that acetylcholinesterase has on muscle fibers. A small sample size was tested during this experiment, and data for the threshold frequency needed to stimulate tetany varied widely. Though all legs decreased, the threshold frequency for control conditions was different for each leg. An increased sample size could give a better overview of the observed trend. The spread of the data could have been limited by choosing legs that had similarly sized gastrocnemius muscles. Furthermore, experiments that vary the concentration of Sevin injected in the muscle could prove whether or not tetany can be achieved at low frequencies by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase completely or determine what concentration of Sevin is effective for doing so. 
This experiment has implications in the treatment of the autoimmune disease Myasthenia Gravis, which is caused by the blockage of nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction, causing rapid fatigue of muscles. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used as a treatment for Myasthenia Gravis by keeping acetylcholine in the synapse for longer, increasing the strength of muscular contraction [Brennan: 2008]. Our experiment supports the treatment of Myasthenia Gravis using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors based on their ability to decrease the frequency of nerve impulses needed to stimulate sustained muscle contraction. This could cause the muscle to take longer to fatigue, though this final conclusion is not fully supported by our study.
