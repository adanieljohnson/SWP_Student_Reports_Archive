Title: Effects of Acetylcholine Esterase on Frog Leg Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
Frogs are animals that depend on their strong leg muscles to catch prey and escape predators. However, Sevin is a common insecticide and known acetylcholine esterase inhibitor that could affect the muscle activity in frogs if exposed. It was predicted that muscle treated with Sevin would have large muscle contraction amplitudes and a more prolonged relaxation time. This is because due to the lack of acetylcholine esterase, which is responsible for digesting acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine will remain bound to the nicotinic receptors on the motor end plate for a longer time than normal. The gastrocnemus muscle of the leg was isolated from the leg and hooked to a force transducer for data collection. The sciatic nerve was also isolated for stimulation of the muscle, and amplitude and relaxation time was collected five times for pre-treatment and post-treatment. After running a paired T-test on the data, it was found that both the data for amplitude and relaxation time are statistically insignificent. Previous studies indicate that this is not an abnormal finding, but also show that trends do exist. Testing acetylcholine esterase activity and the Sevin concentrations are possible next steps for this project.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular junction is where motor neurons meet the skeletal muscle that they controlll. The message to move comes to the neuromuscular junction in the form of an action potential from the central nervous system. When the action potential reaches the junction, this results in the depolarization of the neuron. This depolarization causes calcium ions to enter the cell and allow acetylcholine to be released into the junction and bind to its nicotinic receptors on the motor end plate. This causes sodium channels in the muscle cell to open leading to the depolarization of the muscle cell since it is an excitatory signal. This depolarization leads to the eventual firing of an action potential down the muscle fiber. This action potential is spread through the T tubules and causes calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This calcium binds to troponin, leading to a conformational change that allows myosin heads to walk along actin filaments, resulting in the contraction of the muscle. When looking at a muscle contraction in a myogram, there are three distinct periods of the contraction: latent, contraction, and relaxation. The latent period is the time between the stimulus and the start of a contraction, while the relaxation period is the time it takes for the muscle to stretch back to its normal position. To avoid constant contraction of the tissue, there exists an enzyme called acetylcholine esterase which degrades acetylcholine that is found in the synapse [Johnson: 2016]. 


This experiment looks at Sevin, otherwise known as carbaryl, which is a white crystal that is normally used as insecticide. Another interesting feature about Sevin is that it is known to be an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor [Firdoz: 2010]. This case would like to investigate what the presence of Sevin in a neuromuscular junction would do the muscle contraction. The animal model used for this experiment will be the legs of Rania Pipiens, or commonly known as the Northern Leopard frog. Frogs will be a great model to use to study muscles; due to their reliance on their legs to catch prey and avoid predators, their muscles will be well defined. More specifically, the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve will be used, both the nerve and muscle are extremely large and easy to locate and separate. It is very possible that frogs could encounter carbaryl in the wild, and this experiment looks to investigate what would happen [Relyea: 2001]. The amplitude and relaxation times of the muscle contractions in both untreated and treated legs will be the dependent variables of the experiment, while the independent variable is the Sevin. Due to background knowledge on how the neuromuscular junction works, we hypothesize that the legs treated with the Sevin will have larger amplitudes and longer relaxation periods. This is because Sevin will deactivate the acetylcholine esterase that is found normally, so the neurotransmitter can bind to its receptors for a longer time, until reuptake can grab the neurotransmitter out of the junction. This will lead to a larger contraction of the muscle (higher amplitude), and a longer time for the muscle to come back to rest (longer relaxation period).


Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were used for experimentation. Each frog leg was used for data collection for both the controlll and for the treatment. Each leg was skinned and the sciatic nerve in the thigh was isolated and connected to a probe for stimulation, while the gastrocnemus muscle was isolated from the leg and connected to the force transducer. After the leg was prepped for experimentation, the twitch threshold values were determined for each leg, and that threshold was the stimulation used for the rest of the experiment. Each leg was stimulated for a total of five times. Each time, the amplitude and relaxation time were collected. During experimentation, the legs were rinsed with Ringer’s solution to keep the muscle moist.  After five trials, the gastrocnemus muscle was injected with 100 microliters of the 2% Sevin solution, the acetylcholine esterase. After treating the leg with Sevin, there was a break of two minutes before further experimentation to give the Sevin some time. After that a threshold value was determined and five more trials were run. Two paired t_tests were run to determine the statistical significance of the amplitude values and the relaxation period of the muscle contraction data collected.

Results:
By looking at the trends of the amplitude between the controlll and treated legs, the amplitude went down (Figure 1). The relaxation time in the treated legs were longer than the controlllled legs, but not by a significent amount (Figure 2). After running a paired T test, it was found that there was no statistical significance for both the average amplitude and relaxation time values between the controlll and treated legs. The amplitude averages had a p_value of 0.62, while the relaxation time had a p_value of 0.88. 

Discussion:
The results from the paired T-test show that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the Sevin has no impact on the muscle contractions of the frog muscle. The p values for both the average amplitude and average relaxation time were well above 0.05 indicating that the difference in data between the controlll legs and the treated legs are nonsignificent. One conjecture that may explain the result of no statistical significance may be due to the high number of trials run for both the controlll and treated legs. This exhausted the muscle and caused for some of the legs to increase the threshold value. This discrepancy in the nerve stimulation threshold may be a reason for why the data did not correlate to the expected trends. Another issue that may have occurred may be that the Sevin did not have enough time to appropriately act on the acetylcholine esterase in the neuromuscular junction before testing was started.
Looking at related primary sources, a study conducted in 2016 looked at another type of acetylcholine esterase inhibitor called vaspin, and its effect on rats. Instead of looking at muscle contraction, this study looked at the contraction of blood vessels (hypertension) [Kameshima: 2015]. While the study proved that vaspin did inhibit the esterase activity, they found that it did not affect hypertension, which does go along with what we found as well. Another article published two years ago looked at organic phosphate, which acts as an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor in sea urchins. This case did look measure the maximum force of muscle contraction and rate of muscle contraction, finding that the force and rate of contraction decreased [Boettger, 2010]. 
Based off these studies, it is safe to assume that our results are not completely wrong, but more steps for this project can be done. In the future, a test can be run after experimentation to determine the activity of acetylcholine esterase. This way it can be determined if the Sevin is impacting the muscle as expected. Different concentrations of Sevin can be tested to determine if the correct amount is being inserted into the muscle, and more legs can be tested to decrease variability and standard error in the data. It could be implied that maybe acetylcholine esterase is not the only player that affects the neuromuscular junction. There could be another enzyme that digests acetylcholine, or the reuptake process could be investigated. Astrocytes could also be investigated to see if the tripartite synapse theory could play a role as well. This study could give a better understanding about how a commonly used insecticide could harm frogs or other organisms in the environment.
