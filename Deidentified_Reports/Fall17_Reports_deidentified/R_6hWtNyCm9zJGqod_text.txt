Title: Betta Fish: Behavioral Ecology 

Abstract:
The study of male betta fish exclusively is important to getting a better understanding of behavioral patterns in fish populations. Two male betta fish were placed in small, medium, and large tanks to measure their level of aggressive behavior. The fish did not show more aggressive behavior when placed in the smaller tank and did not show less aggressive behavior when placed in the larger tank. The lack of behavior from each fish is most likely due to stress from previous experiments. 


Introduction:
Studying the behavior of animals is critical to get better understandings of their environments. 
Betta fish, a popular fish at home and in nature, are known for aggressive behavior if two males are placed in the same environment. By studying their aggressive behavior, we can gain insight about how they react physically and how that impacts their interactions. The operculum is a key part of the betta fish that is used to protect the its fragile gills. Crucially, when the male betta fish feels threatened, they will flare out their operculum as an act of intimidating their competitor (Betta Fish.org 2010).

As mentioned in a lab done by Manhattanville College, little studies have been done exclusively on the aggressive behavior of males without the presence of females; therefore, our lab is a critical step toward better understanding the behavior of males specifically (Todd 2010).

We hypothesized that when two males are placed in a smaller tank together, they will show more aggressive behavior; therefore, when two males are placed in a larger tank together, they will show a less aggressive behavior. 


Materials and Method:
Two male Betta splendins of different colors were collected and placed separately in the controlll size tank, medium sized. A larger and smaller tank size were collected as well. The small tank was 1080 cm3, the controlll tank, of medium size, 2400 cm3, and the large tank 14175 cm3. First, the fish were placed together in the controlll tank for 5 minutes. We gave them 5 minutes of rest to avoid habituation. Next, the fish were placed in the small and larger tanks repeating the same steps for 5 minutes together and 5 minutes separate. 

Quantifying aggressive can be difficult and it is important to get raw data with numerical values rather than recording emotions or feelings the fish seem to be displaying. Critically, throughout the duration of time when the fished were placed together, we focused on the operculum. If the operculum was flared out, we could conclude that suggested aggressive behavior and began a timer recording the amount of time it was out. We had two timers going so each fish’s length of behavior could be calculated.

Two, two sample t_tests were calculated to comparing the means between the controlll tank and small tank size and the means between the controlll tank and the large tank size. 


Results:
A two sample t_test was used to compare the means of the controlll and small tank size  (t-value = 0.875, d.f. = 10, p_value = 0.402). The mean time of aggressive behavior for the controlll tank was 22.833 seconds and the small tank had a mean of 9.333 seconds with a standard deviaton of 27.231. A two sample t_test was used to compare the means of the controlll and large tank as well (t-value = 1.281, d.f. = 10, p_value = 0.229) The mean of aggressive behavior in the the large tank was 3.833 seconds with a standard deviation of 34.289. 

Since the p_value for the controlll tank vs small tank was 0.402 and therefore greater than the level of significance, 0.05, we can reject our first hypothesis that the smaller tank size would result in more aggressive behavior. 

Since the p_value for the controlll tank vs large tank was 0.229 and once again, greater than 0.05, we can also reject the second hypothesis that the larger tank size would result in a less aggressive behavior. 

To calculate if there was significance or not, the data points of two betta fish were combined since they occupied similar space and had equal opportunity to show aggressive behavior. Betta 1 is the blue betta fish and betta 2 is the teal colored fish. When both betta males were placed in the controlll tank size, Betta 1 showed little to no response to Betta 2. They seemed to be hiding and trying to escape by fleeing to opposite ends of the tank. Betta 2, unlike betta 1, showed active responses and aggressive behavior. This held constant for all three trials. 

The small tank revealed similar results but betta 1 seemed to move around more but did not display a lot of aggressive behavior. The large tank suggested that betta 1 was still static and did not react a lot to betta 2. 


Discussion:
Since both of our calculated p_values are less than 0.05, we can reject both hypotheses – that the betta fish will show more aggressive behavior in the small and large tanks. It is important to consider that the betta fished used in this experiment were also used in previous experiments earlier in the week with other labs. This would be the best explanation for why betta 1 in particular was so un-aggressive. Most likely, he had been through so much stress earlier in the week he did not even react to betta 2. This is a huge source of error in our experiment. It would be advantageous, if this lab is performed again, to use fish that were not previously used and in less distress. Furthermore, it would be interesting to do this experiment with more than two betta fish and see how they react.
