Title: The Effects of Aggression on the Metabolism of Crayfish

Abstract:
This experiment sought to observe the change in metabolic rate of crayfish when introduced to a stressful environment. Metabolic rate is directly proportional to the consumption of diatomic oxygen molecules [Johnson: 2017]. The specific metabolic rate of three small crayfish, less than five grams each, was calculated using a methodology of measuring the change in concentration of diatomic oxygen in a sealed container for twenty minutes. Each crayfish was then introduced to an experimental environment identical to the control, except the presence of a much larger crayfish. It was hypothesized that the presence of a larger crayfish would increase the specific metabolic rate of a smaller crayfish. The experimental data did not provide a significant p-value through the designed statistical test to reject the null hypothesis. This means there was not a large enough change in specific metabolic rate to provide sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis specific metabolic rate would change, let alone increase. After completing the experiment there was not enough observed difference in the control and experimental groups; and therefore, we could not provide significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no change.

Introduction:
Organisms respond to the environment around them to maintain a state of homeostasis. Action taken by an organism must be fueled by some process. This fuel-creating process of organisms is called the metabolic process. This study aims to explore how specific environments effect the metabolic rate of crayfish, or the change in overall energy expenditure environmental settings have on a crayfish. The metabolism of an organism is the total sum of all its biochemical reactions, both anabolic and catabolic. This is a difficult value to measure directly, as metabolic pathways are intricate and are made up of many reactions. Carbon Dioxide and diatomic Oxygen are accurate estimates with the metabolic rate of an organism. Both molecules are closely tied to the metabolic process because they are involved in the conversion of low energy ATP into high energy ATP. This means the amount of energy produced during the breakdown of glucose is directly proportional to the oxygen consumed by the host organism. In this lab, we will use oxygen as an estimate of metabolic rate through calculation to observe the change in metabolic rate of Crayfish under duress. Crayfish are aggressive by nature, and if left in the same container with no protective barrier the larger crayfish would kill and eat the smaller crayfish. An organism’s environment impacts the energy it consumes. By introducing a smaller crayfish to an environment containing a much larger crayfish, we will be able to observe any change in metabolic rate while the crayfish is introduced to both a control and experimental setting. The dominance order is directly related to size so the presence of a more dominant crayfish should illicit a reaction from the smaller crayfish [Bobvjerg: 2017]. We predicted that aggression brought about by the introduction of a larger predatory crayfish would increase the metabolic rate of a smaller crayfish. This is because we viewed the larger crayfish as an environmental stressor, and as a stressor it would excite the smaller crayfish thus increasing its metabolic rate.
Hypothesis: The presence of a larger crayfish will increase the metabolic rate of a smaller crayfish.


Materials and Methods:
We decided the best way to test this hypothesis was through the introduction of a larger crayfish into the environment of a smaller crayfish. This was the most direct and effective means of creating the target environment for this experiment.
	First, we measured the weight of the first test subject crayfish. The crayfish was then placed into the screw-top glass cylinder. The cylinder was then filled with oxygen-rich room temperature water. The dishpan was then filled with room temperature water, and the screw top container was placed into the plastic dishpan. We inserted the dissolved oxygen probe into the screw-top container, and an oxygen reading was taken. This could take up to 30 seconds as the probe needed time to stabilize its reading. This value was recoded as the baseline oxygen concentration. A reading of oxygen concentration was taken at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes and recorded. After 20 minutes, the dissolved oxygen probe was removed, and the crayfish was placed back into its original tank. Lastly we recorded the volume of water in the screw-top jar using the 1000mL graduated cylinder. This process was repeated for the remaining two crayfish.
	After recording these values of the control environment, the larger crayfish was placed into the dishpan filled with water. The same procedure was used to obtain the concentration of dissolved oxygen on the same intervals in this experimental environment.
	This procedure was carried out for all three crayfish.
	The independent variable of this experiment was the environment, and the dependent variable was the concentration of dissolved in water at the different intervals of time.
	Oxygen consumption and metabolic rate are directly proportional. We used the equation  to calculate the specific metabolic rate of each crayfish over 20 minutes in both a control and experimental environment to compare the data.
	A statistical test was calculated to test the null hypothesis based on our sample sizes. We chose a paired t-test to compare the control data to the experimental data.


Results:
The general trend of the data is a lower specific metabolic rate when the crayfish were subjected to the experimental procedure. This is true for both crayfish 1 and 3; however, when observing the 20-minute specific metabolic rate for crayfish number 2 there is a slight increase. This increase does create a unique trend in the data; however, it is impossible to call this result an outlier in a sample size of only three crayfish.
	We calculated a specific metabolic rate of 0.00553, 0.00354, and 0.00356 for control crayfish 1, 2, and 3 respectively (see Figure 1). Likewise, the specific metabolic rate of the experimental group in order were 0.00456, 0.00381, and 0.00292 (see Figure 2). The units for this calculation were (mg)/(minutes*g). Crayfish 1 and 3 had lower rates by approximately one thousandth, while crayfish 2 had a higher specific metabolic rate by two ten-thousandths.


T-test:
	For the t-test, we took the difference of the metabolic rate in each crayfish from the control and the experimental setting after 20 minutes. We took the mean of this value to establish a sample mean of 0.0005489. The sample standard deviation was found to be 0.0007731. The degree of freedom is the sample size -1, so the degree of freedom for this experiment was 2.
 
x= 0.0005489, mu= 0, s= 0.0007731, and n=3. From this, we calculate a t-value of 1.23. This corresponds to a p-value between 0.25 and 0.10. The level of significance, or alpha level, was 0.05. 


Discussion:
We were unable to reject the null hypothesis of our experiment because our p-value was not lower than the necessary level of significance at 0.05. What this means is there was not enough variance between our control and experimental group to statistically state the alternative hypothesis was more accurate than the null hypothesis. We cannot state an effect size because we could not statistically prove there was variation in our data. There was not a statistically significant difference; therefore, we cannot say that the result of our experiment is biologically important.
	Experimental error and other scientific studies which relate to our own can help provide explanation as to why did not obtain a significant p-value. There could have been significant experimental error from the equipment we used. The dissolved oxygen probe and scale both were not precise tools. The mean difference in the metabolic rate of the control and experimental group was 0.0005489 mg/(g*min). The probe and scale both only measured to the hundredth place. These two values were instrumental in calculating the specific metabolic rates of this experiment, but would barely register the mean change in metabolic rate at all.
	We must then examine the experimental design. The crayfish had minimal contact, and were separated by the glass bottle used to obtain the dissolved oxygen levels. Both field and laboratory observations have shown both visual and tactile senses play an important role regarding the interactions, and therefore the reactions and specific metabolic rate, of crayfish [Bobverg: 2017]. This barrier could have impaired the vision of the test subjects while also negating their tactile senses. Another factor could be the lack of an object to cause aggression. Extrinsic factors such as food, a mate, or shelter are of immense significance for all animal agonistic behavior because these factors are usually the goal of the conflict [Bergman and Moore: 2005]. Without a reason to fight and impaired senses, our crayfish could have been rendered sensory deprived without a reason to expend excess energy. The experimental design could have impacted our inability to reject the null, as the isolation of each crayfish to record the change in oxygen concentration could have impaired the senses of our test subjects and limited their biological response. This could be true of any behavioral study on a wide scale. An experimental design can interfere with an experiment, and skew the data. We cannot ignore the biological significance of aggression on crayfish, however. All animals have an intrinsic tendency to the fight or flight mechanism of survival. Whether an animal fights or flees, it will regardless expend a greater amount of energy. If crayfish are exposed to an environment that results in aggression, their specific metabolic rate should increase due to the feedforward loop that is the fight or flight response.
