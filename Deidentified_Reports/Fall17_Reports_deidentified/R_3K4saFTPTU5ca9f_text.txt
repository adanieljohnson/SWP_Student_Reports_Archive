Title: Effect of Sodium Channel Blockers on Rania Pipiens Frog Leg Muscle 

Abstract:
In a neuromuscular system, sodium channels play an important role in nerve signaling to the muscles. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker on nerve signaling. We hypothesized that with lidocaine applied, the nerve signaling would be stopped completely. The organism we worked on was Rania pipiens. We stimulated the frog’s sciatic nerve on the leg using electric currents and recorded the movements caused by them on the gastrocnemus muscle. The same process was repeated when lidocaine was injected. However, our results showed that both groups whether injected with lidocaine or not, have responded to the electrical stimulus. But they also showed a general trend that when lidocaine was applied, the twitch threshold of the frog nerve became higher, even though the results comparing those of the controlllled and treated group did not show a statistically significent difference (p_value>0.05). we concluded that in order to reach the effect of our hypothesis, we need to conduct further studies using lidocaine of higher concentrations.


Introduction:
The neuromuscular system plays a vital part in animal world. Nerves and muscles allow organism to feel and respond to stimulation from both internal and external environments in milliseconds. In a somatic neuromuscular system, muscles are innervated by motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions. When nerve impulses arrive at these junctions, neurotransmitters called acetylcholine is released prom presynaptic nerve terminal to bind to its receptor on muscle fiber. The action further causes sodium channel on the muscle to generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential ultimately triggers the release of calcium ions and activates the contraction of the muscle. From the study conducted by Catterall et al., the importance of sodium channels in a neuromuscular system is that they are used by neurons to depolarize the cell membrane, therefore the key to nerve signaling [Catterall:2000]. Our research group want to implore the effect of sodium channel blockers on nerve signaling. Rania pipens were used as the model organism in our experiment. They are chosen for there are excess amounts of them and they have similar nervous systems to humans, which can provide insight for further studies regarding human beings. The sodium channel blocker we used was lidocaine.  Lidocaine binds to the sodium channels in a 1 to 1 ratio and prevents their functions [Cummins:2007]. The independent variable of our test was whether or not the Rania pipiens leg was treated with the sodium channel blocker, lidocaine. We hypothesize that when sodium channel blocker is applied, the depolarization of the nerve membrane will be inhibited and will therefore stop the nerve signaling to muscle, which would be shown as a lack of response when stimulated. 


Materials and Method:

3 Rania pipiens legs were prepared and each of them acted as their own controlllled and treated groups. The frog legs were kept under IACUC standards.
Each individual leg was degloved with forceps on a dissecting pan. A dissecting probe was used to separate its inner thigh muscles in order to reveal the sciatic nerve. Next the sciatic nerve was freed from the attached connective tissues using dissecting needle and forceps. Following this, the gastrocnemus muscle was cut near the Achilles tendon and was then suspended using a piece of thread perpendicular to the sciatic nerve. 
With the preparation of the model organism done, sleeve electrodes were attached to the sciatic nerve. The electrodes were connected with iWorx FT-302 Force Transducer in order to measure the amplitudes of the reactions of the frog leg. All statistics were recorded using Lab Scribe system. At the beginning of the test, 0.05V stimulus amplitude was applied to the sciatic nerve and then the voltage was increased in 0.05V increments until the muscle twitched. The value of the stimulus amplitude at which the gastrocnemus first twitched is recorded as twitch amplitude. Throughout the entire process, the frog leg was moistened with frog Ringer’s solution every five minutes.
Lidocaine of concentration of 25mM was then injected into the gastrocnemus muscle. For each frog leg, 0.1Ml of lidocaine was used. After waiting for 5-6 minutes to let the effect of lidocaine show, the same stimulation process was repeated to obtain a twitch threshold under the influence of lidocaine. To ensure the results of the experiment was not accidental, the test was repeated on 2 more frog legs.
To analyze the outcome of the experiment, paired T-test was performed to compare the threshold distributions of the controlllled and lidocaine-injected results.


Results:
The first two sets of data were collected by our research group. Our original data for the 3rd trial showed that its twitch threshold after treated with lidocaine was actually lower than that of controlllled. This countered the mechanism of the sodium channel blocker and also the majority of research in this field. Since the third set of data was clearly an outlier, it was removed from the analytic tests. Instead, a set of lab pool data was used.
The results showed that in both controlllled and treated groups there were values of twitch thresholds. There’s a general increase in the twitch threshold when 0.1Ml of lidocaine of 25mM concentration was injected to the Rania pipiens leg muscle. However, in the second set of data no change was observed. (Figure 1)
The paired T-test comparing the threshold distributions of the controlllled and treated groups resulted in a p_value of 0.18.


Discussion:
From the p_value obtained, it is shown that there is not a significent difference between the twitch thresholds of controlllled legs and legs injected with lidocaine. As have mentioned in the Results, the data for our 3rd trial was inconsistent with most researches in this filed, which conclude that the injection of the sodium channel blocker lidocaine would cause an increase in the twitch threshold value [Chen:2000], [Kai: 1993]. Under the stimulation of electric current both controlllled and treated groups reacted by twitching. This does not support our hypothesis that sodium channel blockers will stop the nerve signally to muscle. However, our results do show that the twitch threshold value for treated Rania pipiens legs are lower than that of controlllled. A similar study was done on the frog sciatic nerve using lidocaine by Bainton et al [Bainton: 1994]. Their results showed that starting at 40mM, any higher concentrations of lidocaine would cause an irreversible loss of impulse activity in the frog nerve. 
We think the reason why our results were not able to support our hypothesis is that the concentration we used was relatively low and it produced a minimal increase in the level of twitch threshold but was not able to block the nerve signaling completely. For further study, higher concentrations of lidocaine and larger subject groups would be used to examine the effect of sodium channel blockers on nerve signaling to muscles.
