Title: Measuring agonistic behavior in Betta splendens in real:real interactions versus real:fake interactions

Abstract:
Animal behavior is a subset of ecology that deals with how animals interact with their environment and the organisms in it. The definition of behavior varies based on who is being asked. In this experiment we use the following definition of behavior: events caused by the organism with the environment as its target. The main objective of this experiment was to compare the agonistic behavior between two male Betta splendens versus their agonistic behavior towards different fake fish. We measured the number of red manes in a five-minute period for each experimental group and compared them to each other. We were able to find that, on average, the real: real interactions contained a much higher number of red manes than red manes in real: fake interactions in either real fish and either fake fish.

Introduction:
	In our experiment we will be observing the behavior, in this case the level of aggressiveness, of two, different, male betta fish in response to the sight of another member of its species and comparing it to their behavior at the sight of two different fake, toy fish. Betta fish have typically been observed to show aggressive behaviors in response to the sight of other members of their species. According to one study, aggressive behavior is very common throughout the animal kingdom because it is key in acquiring and defending limited resources, like mates and food (Romano 2017). This study also found that betta splendens observe their fake counterparts, in this case robotic fish, for varying amounts of time depending on how much sensory information was displayed by the robotic fish, i.e light flashing, submissive signaling, aggressive signaling, etc. The more “disruptive” the robotic fish behaved, the more gill flaring was done by the male betta fish (Romano 2017). 

 	These fish are ideal for observing aggressive behaviors because of their easily observable signs of aggression, like the flaring of their red manes. These red manes are a protrusion of their branchiostegal membranes, used as a threatening behavior at the sight of another fish. The results of a 2016 study indicate that betta fish use gill flaring specifically as an acute response to defend their territory. Additionally, the study stresses that aggressive interactions in animals seldom lead to fighting out of captivity and that the limited space of captivity heightens aggressive instincts when two males are put into the same space. It stated that male betta fish when first encountering a competitor engage in costly, high energy displays towards them but these behaviors were gradually replaced with less costly, less frequent aggressive behaviors (Forsatkar 2016).

 
We aimed to answer the following questions: how often do male betta fish flare their red manes at each other when physically separated? How often will male betta fish flare their red manes at different toy fish? Will there be a large difference in the amount they flare their red manes at others of their species versus fake fish? How big will that difference be and what does that say about their evolution as a species? We hypothesize that there will be a significant difference in aggressive behaviors in real:real interactions versus real:fake interactions, with the real:real interactions trending towards being more aggressive. 


Materials and Methods:
First, observe the behavior of two, physically separated males for five minutes, and count the number of times their respective red manes flared. The number of red manes is the way we will measure the level of aggressiveness. Then let the fish rest for five minutes and repeat the procedure for a second trial. This is our control group. 

Observe the behavior of physically separated Real 1: Fake 1 pairing for five minutes. Record the number of red manes. Rest for five minutes. Repeat procedure for trial two of this experimental group. 

Observe the behavior of physically separated Real 1: Fake 2 for five  minutes. Record the number of red manes. Rest for five minutes. Repeat procedure for trial two of this group

Observe the behavior of physically separated Real 2: Fake 1 for five minutes. Record the number of red manes. Rest for five minutes. Repeat procedure for trial two of this group.

Observe the behavior of physically separated Real 2: Fake 1 for five minutes. Record the number of red manes. Rest for five minutes. Repeat procedure for trial two of this group. 

In order to analyze our data, we performed ANOVA statistical tests and a post hoc Tukey Kramer test.


Results:
According to our statistical tests there were significantly more red manes in real: real interactions than there were in real: fake interactions for both real, male betta fish, see Table 1. After doing ANOVA statistical analysis we got a p value of 0.000719 which is much lower than our significance level of 0.05, so there is a very small possibility that we got our results by chance. 

On average, both fish displayed more red manes at each other than they did at either of the fake fish. Real fish 1 on average displayed more red manes at the fake fish than real fish 2. 



Discussion:
Based on our results, we can reject our null hypothesis that there would be no significant difference between real:real interactions and real:fake interactions. The data from this experiment confirms our initial hypothesis that there is a significant difference between aggressive behaviors in real:real and real:fake interactions, with the real: real interactions consistently displaying more red manes on average than in real:fake interactions. 

This result could be due to the fact that our toy fish did not move like a real betta fish did. According to Romano’s 2017 study, their experiment evolved from more rudimentary real:fake interaction experiments. Their robotic fish both replicated the typical resting and aggressive movements of Betta splendens and flashed lights at the real fish in order to trigger aggressive responses, like gill flaring (Romano 2017). We could also attribute the fact that the average number of red mane flares decreased from trial 1 to trial 2 across the board could be due to habituation. One way to combat this in future experiments could be to have a longer rest time in between trials. 

A 2016 study by Arnott and several colleagues looked at whether betta splendens change their aggressive display patterns when facing other betta fish versus facing their mirror image. They found no difference between the two. He suggested that this could be due to their endogenous neurological wiring to display these aggressive behaviors to protect limited resources (Arnott 2016). This could serve as an alternative explanation for why real fish 1 still flared their red mane even after possible habituation. 

The next logical step for this study would be to replicate it with more trials, longer rest times, and more realistic fake fish/different types of fake fish. Another experiment could be performed to see if fake fish with flashing lights or more realistic movements have a larger effect on the number of red manes flared. The study of animal behavior can give researchers insights into the genetic versus environmental components on the evolution of behavior.
