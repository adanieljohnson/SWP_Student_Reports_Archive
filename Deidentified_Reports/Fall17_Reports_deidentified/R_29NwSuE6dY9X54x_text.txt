Title: The Effect of Darkness on Procambarus Sp. Specific Metabolic Rate

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to learn more about metabolism and gas exchange, specifically the effects of darkness on the metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. The experiment was conducted using three Procambarus sp. Each organism was tested with a twenty-minute light period, then a twenty-minute dark period. The oxygen consumption was monitored using a dissolved oxygen meter at five-minute intervals. The specific metabolic rate was calculated. The p-value was 0.167904, so there is no significant difference between the experimental and control groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that darkness does not affect specific metabolic rate in Procambarus sp. This result could be due to the limitations posed by the conditions of the experiment.

Introduction:
The Procambarus sp. also known as the crayfish, is an ectotherm, so the metabolic rate increases with the rise in environmental temperature because the internal body temperature is coupled with the external environment. The body temperature of an ectotherm equates to its environment. Therefore, it can be said that there would be an increase in metabolic rates during the light periods, and alternatively, a decrease in the metabolic rate during the dark periods as a result in relatively colder temperatures in the latter. [Sadava, et. al.: 2016]. It has also been determined that Cancer pagurus, an ectotherm has a decrease in oxygen consumption in the dark due to a decrease in their motor activity as a result of predation [Ansell, et. al.: 1973]. It is hypothesized that the experimental group, the Procrambarus sp. in the dark environment, will result in a low specific metabolic rate compared to the control group, the Procambarus sp. in the light environment.

Materials and Methods:
1. Fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air. 
2. Set test chamber in empty plastic dishpan. 
3. Weigh crayfish and gently place it in the test chamber, screw on the top of the test chamber. 
4. Gently fill the container with oxygenated water so the top overflows slightly. 
5. Place the entire tank set-up to the neck in a dishpan filled with room temperature water.
6. Turn on the instrument and let you reading stabilize. 
7. Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. 
8. At 5,10,15 and 20 minutes read oxygen concentration. 
9. Remove the probe after 20 minutes. 
10. Measure the volume of the Procambarus sp. by pouring the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder. 
11. Take the test chamber and wrap aluminum foil around it so there is no light coming through the test chamber. 
12. Repeat steps 4-11 for each 
13. Calculate the specific metabolic rate using the following equation for each Procambarus sp.: Specific Metabolic Rate=  (ΔO_2×Volume H_2 O(L))÷(Time(min)×weight(g) )
14. Use paired t-test to present statistical data for the specific metabolic rate of the experimental and control group.



Results:
The experimental group resulted in a higher specific metabolic rate across all three Procambarus sp. The control group resulted in an average of specific metabolic rate of 0.000606 O2 g-1 min-1 with a standard deviation of 0.000229, as seen in Figure 1. The experimental group resulted in an average of 0.001489 O2 g-1 hr-1 with a standard deviation of 0.000503, as seen in Figure 1. The p-value was 0.167904, as seen in Figure 1.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported because there was no significant statistical difference between the experimental and control groups because the p-value was 0.167904. It can then be concluded that darkness does not affect specific metabolic rate in Procambarus sp. This result can be explained in a study where seventy Porcellio laevis Latreille, an ectotherm, intermoult tenth instar males were compared under conditions of daylight and complete darkness, over a period of eight hours. The isopods respiring in total darkness had significantly higher oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate than did those tested in light, as a result of the difference in light in their habitat [Husain & Alikhan: 1979]. Potential explanations for the increased oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate observed during the dark period experiments could be a result of the following distinctions. The variation in results among similar studies could be the result of the different metabolic processes between the Porcellio laevis Latreille and Procambarus sp. The Porcellio laevis is a terrestrial ectotherm; whereas the Procambarus sp. are aquatic ectotherms. The aquatic ectotherms utilize osmoregulation which expend more energy to maintain homeostasis compared to terrestrial ectotherms [Sadava, et. al.: 2016]. The method of the light period was created using a fluorescent light when experimenting on the Porcellio laevis Latreille compared to our experiment where the Procambarus sp. was kept in natural light. The temperature was also measured during the experiment involving the Porcellio laevis Latreille by implementing temperatures ranging from 5º C to 35º C during the light and dark periods. In our experiment the temperature was kept at room temperature (22º C) during the light and dark periods. This can explain the differences in specific metabolic rate results for the different studies, since ectotherm specific metabolic rate is dependent on environmental temperature. The oxygen consumption was also recorded using a Griffin microrespirometer; whereas our experiment utilized a dissolved oxygen meter. The conditions of our experiment were limited to the sample size of three Procambarus sp. In addition, an error in the experiment was that the aluminum foil did not cover the jar completely, so the dark period could have had some light. Also, the crayfish were stressed from being captured, moved, and placed into a new environment. For future study there should be a  transitional period, both dark and light, so there would be less stress on the Procambarus sp. and create a more realistic environment. Also, the water temperature inside the jar could have been colder to create a more realistic environment during the dark period, which could potentially lower the specific metabolic rate during the colder period. In addition to procedural improvement the experiment could have been repeated using a different ectotherm other than the Procambarus sp. in order to gather more comprehensive data on the effect of darkness on the specific metabolic rate of ectotherms.

Figure Legends: Figure 1. displays the average specific metabolic rate for the Procambarus sp. The control yielded a specific metabolic rate of 0.000606 O2 g-1 min-1 with a standard deviation of 0.000229. The experimental group yielded an average of 0.001489 O2 g-1 hr-1 with a standard deviation of 0.000503. The p-value was 0.167904. The error bars represent the standard deviation in the specific metabolic rate average between the three Procambarus sp.
