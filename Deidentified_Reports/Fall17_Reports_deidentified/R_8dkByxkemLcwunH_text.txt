Title: Nicotine’s Impact on Muscle Amplitude in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether or not nicotine has an impact on muscle amplitude. Because nicotine functions as an ACh agonist, it was hypothesized that it would have an impact on this value. After the threshold voltage of each leg of the Rana pipiens was determined, three trials with this voltage stimulus were performed to measure the muscle amplitude at control and then three more were performed after nicotine supplementation to determine muscle amplitude with the ACh agonist. After averaging the values recorded and performing t-tests, it was determined that the data was statistically significant and that nicotine leads to an increase in muscle amplitude within the R. pipiens.


Introduction:
Action potentials are electrochemical signals that stimulate responses of muscles. In order for these signals to be spread, a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine’s (ACh) release must be prompted by a change in membrane potential caused by an influx of calcium ions.  A vesicle of ACh then fuses with the presynaptic membrane, causing ACh to diffuse across the synapse. When two ACh molecules bind to a receptor in the postsynaptic membrane, it opens a ligand-gated ion channel that allows sodium ions to enter that neuron. This influx of cations causes the postsynaptic cell to depolarize. In sum, ACh stimulates action potentials and is involved in propagating their signal from neuron to neuron. Additionally, in order for these action potentials to spread, the stimulus must reach a threshold voltage, generating an electrical current called muscle amplitude. Muscle amplitude, or the strength of the action potentials, is largely based on stimulus strength. Some compounds function as agonists, which are molecules that bind to the receptors of certain neurotransmitters and mimic their effects. In other words, agonists act as neurotransmitters and elicit the same effects, but are not neurotransmitters. An example of an agonist is nicotine, which is an ACh agonist. In vertebrate muscles, such as the legs of the Rana pipiens used in this experiment, an increase in ACh or a chemical that binds to its receptors and generates a response would theoretically increase muscle amplitude. R. pipiens was chosen as the test organism due to its size, as it could be skinned and dissected without great difficulty. Its anatomy also made it a useful test subject, as the gastrocnemius muscle had the right dimensions, which was the muscle of the leg that was used during the experiment to determine muscle amplitude. We hypothesize that nicotine will have an effect on muscle amplitude because ACh is the neurotransmitter that stimulates muscles and an agonist mimics a response, so increased levels of a substance with a reaction similar to ACh would increase muscle amplitude. Thus, the independent variable in this experiment is the presence or absence of nicotine, while the dependent variable is the muscle amplitude. Determining whether or not nicotine impacts muscle amplitude in the R. pipiens can encourage further study and contemplation on the impact that nicotine has upon those who smoke cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or metabolizes nicotine from another source. 


Materials and Methods:
	In order to properly perform this experiment, one must first acquire and skin three different frog legs. To do this, one must use one to two Kimwipes per leg in order to hold the it steady while still keeping the leg moist. The leg is kept moist using around a milliliter of Ringer’s solution per leg. Once each leg is skinned, attach the probe to the gastrocnemius muscle of one leg.

In order to determine the threshold of that leg inject stimulus at increments of 0.1 volts. Once the threshold voltage for an action potential is determined for that leg, inject this positive voltage into the leg three times in order to determine the control muscle amplitude. Record these values. Next, inject the gastrocnemius with 2 mL of 1 mg/ml nicotine. Next, inject the positive voltage previously found as the threshold voltage for that leg three times, recording the muscle amplitude values found after each of the three trials. Repeat this process for the other two legs. Find the averages of both the control muscle amplitude and experimental muscle amplitude portions of each leg. Then preform a t-test comparing the muscle amplitude of the control group without nicotine and the experimental group supplemented with nicotine in order to determine if the data found was statistically significant. 


Results:
	The muscle amplitudes of the gastrocnemius muscles when supplemented with nicotine did increase. However, the number of volts that each leg generated as their muscle amplitude was not consistent. There could be a number of reasons for this, but the most likely is that the muscle amplitude generated was dependent on the size of the leg and the gastrocnemius muscle. Because the size of the frog legs was not exactly uniform, the control muscle amplitudes and magnitude of the amplitude increases were variable.

The increase of muscle amplitude in leg 2 is even more drastic than the increase in leg 1.

Discussion:
These results did support the hypothesis that nicotine would change the muscle amplitude when injected with the same voltage stimulus.  The increase in muscle amplitude can be explained by nicotine’s chemical characteristics as an ACh agonist. ACh function as a crucial step within the neuromuscular junction, as it is a key component of the propagation of action potentials. When it binds to ligand-gated sodium ion channels on the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron, it increases the amount of sodium ions that depolarize the cell. With nicotine supplemented, and more molecules performing the same functions as ACh, more ion channels are opened and the neuron is depolarized more quickly. This faster depolarization generates a greater muscular response, as the response of muscles is dependent on the strength of the stimulus. Although the voltage of the initial stimulus in each leg was the same, the stimulus of neuronal depolarization increased in magnitude with the addition of nicotine to the muscles. If this is considered in a system that’s more applicable to humans, smokers and those who metabolize nicotine through different sources could also experience an increase in the speed of neuronal depolarization and in turn muscle amplitude. This would be an interesting topic of future study. Possible sources of error could include human error in the injection of nicotine or in the computer-based recording of muscle amplitude.
