Title: The Effect of Darkness on Specific Metabolic Rate in Procambarus sp.  

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to analyze the effect of darkness on metabolic rate in the Procambarus sp.  We performed experiments using a dissolved oxygen probe place in a screw top container in order to measure the oxygen consumption of the Procambarus sp. Our hypothesis was that when the organism is exposed to darkness it will have a decrease oxygen consumption and therefore a decrease in metabolic rate.  In our results the average metabolic rate for the organism when it was exposed to light was 0.000605667 and the average metabolic rate when the organism was in darkness was higher, at 0.001488667. We could not conclude anything from our data because in our results the P-value was insignificant at 0.167904. 


Introduction:
The organism that is being studied is the Procambarus sp. which is an ectotherm and the focus is on specific metabolic rate.  Procambarus sp. consume oxygen and a helpful way to measure specific metabolic rate of the organism is to measure oxygen consumption.  Oxygen consumption is directly related to specific metabolic rate.  Darkness can play a role in the effect of metabolic rate in comparison to light exposure.  On an experiment done on mice, the metabolic rate of the organism decreased when exposed to darkness in comparison to light [Evans, Dutcher, Dean, Gardner, 2015].  This experiment is evidence for a decrease in the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. in darkness.  We expect that when we put the Procambarus sp. under similar circumstances, such as complete darkness, their specific metabolic rate will also decrease.  We hypothesize that in an experiment when Procambarus sp. are exposed to darkness the organism will have a decreased metabolic rate in comparison to when they are exposed to light, which will result in an increased metabolic rate. 


Materials and Methods:
Weigh Procambarus sp. 1 and place in screw top container and fill with room temperature water (22 ° C) and secure the top.  Set into dishpan filled with room temperature water.  Measure the O2 concentration using the oxygen meter at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes.  Repeat the same steps but this time cover the container with aluminum foil securely so that no light can be exposed on the Procambarus sp. or into the container. The use of the aluminum foil imitates darkness.  At end of 20 minutes remove the Procambarus sp. and record the water volume in liters.  Repeat previous steps for all 3 Procambarus sp.  Then calculate the specific metabolic rate for each Procambarus sp. using the formula (change in O2 (mg/L)) x (volume of H2O (L)) / (Time (min)) x (weight (g)) = specific metabolic rate. We use this calculation because it also adjusts for weight. The organisms being used were collected from a lab.  A paired t-test was used to find significant difference between the average specific metabolic rate of the organism before and after darkness. 


Results:
The P-value for our experiment, when comparing the averages of control and treatment groups, was 0.167904, which is not significant.  Although there is no statistical significance, the general trend for the Procambarus sp. in this experiment was an increase in specific metabolic rate during exposure to darkness for all three organisms in comparison to exposure to light.  The average for specific metabolic rate for the organism increased by 0.000883 O2(mg)/min(g) when the organism was in complete darkness.  Each trial (3) had the same outcome, an increase in specific metabolic rate when exposed to darkness. Also, for each organism, in each trial (both light and dark) the oxygen consumption decreased over the course of the 20 minutes.  The standard deviation for the experimental group (0.000503156) is much larger than the control group (0.000229106) which shows that there was much more variability in the treatment data. 


Discussion:
Our data does not provide evidence to support or refute our hypothesis because our P-value is not significant.  We hypothesized that a decrease in light exposure (darkness) would decrease the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. and that an increase in light exposure would increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp.  But, according to our data, the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. increased with darkness.  In a study done on two amphipod crustaceans, the hypogean Niphargus stygius and the epigean Gammarus fossarum, the organism epigean Gammarus fossarum had increased oxygen consumption, and therefor metabolic rate in the dark and the hypogean Niphargus stygius had a decreased oxygen consumption, and therefor decreased metabolic rate in the dark.  The experiment explained this outcome based on the fact that the epigean Gammarus fossarum lives predominately in a habitat which is normally shady and deeper in the water, with less accessible light, and the hypogean Niphargus stygius lives predominately in a habitat with shallow water with strong exposure to sunlight.  It is understandable that an organism that lives predominately in darkness, the epigean Gammarus fossarum, would have a higher specific metabolic rate in the darkness because that is the habitat they are most used to living in and completes the most activities in.  It is also understandable that an organism who predominately lives in a habitat with lots of sunlight exposure, like the hypogean Niphargus stygius, would react abnormally to darkness, an environment the organism is not used to, and have a decreased specified metabolic rate [Simčič and Brancelj, 2007]. This experiment provides good evidence for why the Procambarus sp. have a decreased metabolic rate in the light not only because the hypogean Niphargus stygius and the epigean Gammarus fossarum are ectotherms like the Procambarus sp., but also because the normal habitat for the Procambarus sp. could be one similar to the Gammarus fossarum, where darkness is a normal aspect of the environment.  Some limitations to our experiment could have been that the Procambarus sp. was stressed during the lab, especially when being transferred into the container, resulting in a higher oxygen consumption for the first few minutes of the experiment.  Also, the aluminum foil could have not covered the container completely from the light exposure during the experimental procedures for darkness.  For future experiments, something to consider would be having a larger sample size, to find data that is significant, and also, to switch the order of the control and experimental (darkness) procedures. For example, if we did the darkness experiment for Procambarus sp. 1 first and then the light exposure experiment, we could see if the oxygen consumption increased at first, in the darkness, because of the stress the organism receives in the beginning when being transferred to the container at the start of the trails.

The average for the control group was 0.000605667 and the standard deviation for the control group was 0.000229106.  The average for treatment group was 0.001488667 and the standard deviation for the treatment group was 0.000503156.  The standard deviations represent the variability of the data and are shown by the error bars. The P-value was 0.167904.
