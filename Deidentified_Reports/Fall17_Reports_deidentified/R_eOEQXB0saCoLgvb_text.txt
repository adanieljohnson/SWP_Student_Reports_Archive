Title: Effects of Caffeine on the Contraction of Rania pipens Muscle

Abstract:
This lab was conducted to determine the effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens.  Through comparison of the force generated by the muscle contraction before and after the injection of caffeine, the caffeine caused an increase in the absolute amplitude of the muscle contraction while decreasing the relative amplitude.


Introduction:
When a muscle contracts, an action potential is sent from a motor neuron to a muscle cell. The motor neuron releases acetyl choline into the neuromuscular junction, creating an action potential across the muscle cell.  This results in calcium ions (Ca2+) being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ultimately resulting in the muscle contracting.  While it can be extremely difficult to measure the changes in acetyl choline or calcium ions, a myogram can be used to measure the force generated over a period of time.  As a result, the muscle contraction shows up as a force generated.  The properties of caffeine allow it to affect many human tissues: central nervous system, cardiovascular system and smooth as well as, skeletal muscle [Cafarelli, Kalmar: 1999].  Additionally, caffeine induces sustained contraction in skeletal and smooth muscle of frogs [Kumar et. all: 2015].  Caffeine also propagate the release of calcium which ultimately causes muscle contractions.  This sustained muscle contraction could lead to an increase in the absolute twitch amplitude of the muscle contraction.  


Materials and Method:
First de-skin the leg of Rania pipiens.  The leg then needs to be suspended perpendicular to the lab table while the leg is stabilized.  Then insert the electrodes into the gastrocnemus muscle.  Then stimulate the muscle for five pulses at one hertz with a width of five and then record the subsequent data.  Inject a solution of .1 Ml of 200mM of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle.  Then repeat the previous two steps for the same frog leg with injected caffeine.  After, repeat all previous step with an additional two frog legs.  The myogram is connected to a computer that uses the program IWorks.  This program allows the experimenter to controlll the number of shocks given while recording the strength of the muscle contraction.  Each individual frog legs acts as its own controlll before injecting caffeine.  This is due to the fact that the comparison is comparing the amplitudes between before and after the injection of the caffeine. After the experiment, conduct a single tailed paired t_test.  The test is single tiered as the hypothesis state that there would be an increase in the amplitude rather than a change in the amplitude. 


Results:

The results show a significent jump in the absolute twitch amplitude from before and after the caffeine injection.  Additionally, a couple of seconds after the caffeine was injected into the muscle, the muscle became extremely tough and hard.  The absolute amplitude increases while the relative amplitude from each individual shock decreased.  The single-tailed pared t_tested yielded a p value of 2.29E-7 showing that there is an extremely small possibility that the difference in the before and after amplitude was due to chance


Discussion:
Since caffeine propagates the release of calcium ions this possibly causes the contraction of the muscle before the shock it even transduced.  The additional stimuli of the shock creates the large difference between the amplitudes of the force of the muscle contractions.  While the absolute amplitude increased dramatically, the relative amplitude decreased.  This means that overall the amplitude with the caffeine was greater than the amplitude without the caffeine injection; on the contrary, the shocking of the leg causes a smaller increase in the amplitude in the caffeinated leg.  This is due to the fact that the leg contracts due to the caffeine injection before the shocking of the leg.  As a result, the leg reaches a level of contraction that plateaus before the leg is shocked.  The shock then still increases the amplitude but increases it less than in the un-caffeinated leg.  Due to our p value being 2.28E-7 this means that our data strongly supports our alternate hypothesis that the caffeine would cause an increase in the absolute amplitude of the muscle contraction.  One way to improve this experiment would be to use a larger sample size since there were only three legs tested.  Additionally, the legs should be timed from injection to shock to make sure that each leg receives the same treatment and amount of time to contract from the injection of the caffeine.  For further study it would be interesting to see how differing amount of caffeine affect the amplitude of the force of contraction of the frog leg.
