Title: Curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP may affect the growth of Physarum polycephalum (no significance shown) 

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum (slime mold) uses protein kinase A through a G-protein coupled receptor pathway to regulate growth. Certain substances, such as dibutryl-cAMP, can activate PKA, while others, like curcumin, inhibit it. We hypothesize that slime mold, when placed on a medium containing dibutryl-cAMP, will grow more than if it were placed on curcumin or in a control. Physarum exhibits positive chemotaxis towards glucose, which can be used to control for direction. 

Results show no significance in growth between curcumin and control (p-value = 0.14), control and dibutryl-cAMP (p-value = 0.56), and curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP (p-value = 0.28). But growth averages (curcumin: 3.33 mm, control: 25.3 mm, dibutryl-cAMP: 16 mm) show that curcumin may have inhibitory effects on Physarum. Dibutryl-cAMP did not appear to strongly promote growth as hypothesized. 

Further investigation into the growth behaviors of slime mold should be done, controlling more for direction of growth by using stronger chemoattractants/repellants. With better results, we can understand how chemical pollution affects Physarum growth in ecosystems. 

Introduction:
Slime mold, or Physarum polycephalum, is a multi-nuclear eukaryotic organism. A single mass of slime mold is referred to as a plasmodium, and can be used in experiments like this one as they are easy to grow, handle and feed. Characteristics of this organism include negative phototaxis, gravitaxis, and a positive chemotaxis towards glucose. Fluctuating thickness of Physarum cells aids in movement, which causes these taxis behaviors (Takamatsu: 2008). In particular, positive chemotaxis towards glucose is a useful trait as we can use glucose to make the growth of the mold more directional, and therefore make it easier to measure the amount of growth. 

Protein kinase A (PKA) is a protein and enzyme involved in Physarum growth. More specifically, PKA is involved in the G-protein coupled-receptor pathway. The GPCR is activated by a ligand, often a growth factor, which binds extracellularly. Upon binding of the growth factor, the heterotrimeric G-protein located inside the cell, bound to the GPCR, is activated, which leads to a signaling cascade inside the cell. PKA, once activated in the signaling cascade, phosphorylates molecules so they can carry out cellular responses and regulate growth (Sakurai: 1998).

In this experiment, we will be testing which chemicals inhibit, and which ones promote, growth of Physarum. It is accepted that dibutryl-cAMP activates PKA (Chen: 1998), and that curcumin inhibits PKA. Thus, we hypothesize that plasmodia cultured on dishes treated with curcumin will grow less than those on dishes with dibutryl-cAMP and water-agar. In addition, we hypothesize that the mold on dibutryl-cAMP will grow the most out of the samples. 

Materials and Methods:
Materials

A total of 9 petri dishes (each containing water-agar solution) were used, out of which 3 were controls. 6 mL of curcumin and 6 mL of dibutryl-cAMP (total) were used. One dish of slime mold culture and one dish of glucose medium were also used. A bottle of ethyl alcohol and a flame were necessary for sterilizing tools after each use.

Methods:

2 mL of curcumin were pipetted onto 3 water-agar dishes, and the same was done with dibutryl-cAMP for another 3 dishes. The media soaked for 10 minutes. Two 1 cm x 1 cm squares (one on each side of the dish) were cut from each medium and removed. In one of the wells, a similarly-sized glucose square was placed, in the other, slime mold. Dishes were taped closed, wrapped completely in foil, and placed in a dark incubator at moderate temperature for 24 hours. The growth of slime mold was then measured for each dish, using the longest strand from each dish for statistical testing.

A two-tailed two-sampled t-test was used to compare each test group individually with the control and with each other.  

Results:
Average growth of the longest strands for the control, curcumin, and dibutryl-cAMP groups were approximately 25.3 mm, 3.33 mm and 16 mm respectively. Standard errors for these averages were approximately 11.35 (control), 3.33 (curcumin) and 9.54 (dibutryl-cAMP) (Figure 1). P-value and t-value for the t-test between control and curcumin were approximately 0.14 and 1.86 respectively. Between control and dibutryl-cAMP, these values were 0.56 and 0.63. For curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP these values were 0.28 and 1.25. Degree of freedom was 4 for each test. 

General trends show that the control experienced the most growth on average. The dibutryl-cAMP group also showed a lot of growth, but not as much as the control group. The mold growing on the curcumin plates had the least amount of growth by a large margin.

Discussion:
Based on our results, there was no significant difference in average growth between any of the sample groups (when comparing the longest strands). Also, while the dibutryl-cAMP dishes did see more growth on average than the curcumin dishes, the control group still had the most overall average growth, suggesting that dibutryl-cAMP did not experience growth in the way we had expected (i.e. more growth than the control). These results do not support our hypothesis that dibutryl-cAMP would promote growth. However, while not significant, there was less growth in the curcumin plates, which partially supports our hypothesis that curcumin would inhibit growth. In addition, our curcumin cultures had the most consistency with growth, as shown by the standard error, further suggesting that curcumin could consistently inhibit Physarum growth. Perhaps we needed to soak the plates in more curcumin to get better results with this particular sample group. 

As for the growth on the dibutryl-cAMP media when compared to the control, perhaps the dibutryl-cAMP mold was slower to grow because it was taking up dibutryl-cAMP as it was crawling, which could slow it down. Meanwhile, the mold in the control group was simply focused on crawling to the nearest food source, and had nothing to take up from the surrounding medium. The mold in dibutryl-cAMP did experience more directional growth towards glucose. So while it did not grow as quickly as the control, perhaps the dibutryl-cAMP helped Physarumâ€™s chemotaxis abilities. 

More studies should be done on this topic, controlling more for direction of growth in order to further normalize the data. Both a Physarum chemoattractant (glucose) and chemorepellant (such as tryptophan) (de Lacy Costello: 2013) should be used. A chemoattractant stronger than glucose could also be used, as studies have suggested that even if Physarum senses a mediocre food source (such as glucose), it may continue looking for better food sources and not grow directly towards the first food source it finds, if that source is not ideal (Beekman: 2015). For this reason, it may also be plausible to set up multiple food sources in a single medium, allowing Physarum more choices and eliminating random crawling. This set-up could also be useful in determining if these substances affect chemotaxis behaviors, if the food sources were of varying chemoattractive strength. By controlling more for direction, we can see if substances like curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP really inhibit / promote slime mold growth, or if they affect chemotaxis behaviors. Also, allowing the Physarum cultures to grow over a longer period of time (more than 24 hours) could create better results, as it would allow more time for the substances to take their effects. 

Experiments such as this one are important for understanding how one can prevent or encourage the growth of slime mold when necessary, which can be beneficial to failing ecosystems. In addition, it can be useful in understanding how chemical pollutants may affect the growth of Physarum, which is helpful in comprehending how we are damaging our planet, and how we can fix it.
