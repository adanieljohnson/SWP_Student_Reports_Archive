Title: Measuring Specific Metabolic Rate under varying light conditions of Procambris sp. through Oxygen Consumption 

Abstract:
	This experiment set out to find the effects of light, specifically when Procambris sp. were left in darkness, on their metabolic rate. Our group hypothesized that when the Procambris sp. were put in the dark their metabolic rate would drop as studies used for comparison suggested this would happen. Using a dissolved oxygen probe, we were able to track the oxygen consumption of Procambris sp. in a contained jar of water. As the dissolved oxygen probe read the decreasing oxygen in the water, we were able to see how quickly the Procambris sp. was consuming it and therefore calculate the metabolic rate. Follow the collection of our data, we were able to conclude that there appears to be no significent correlation between darkness and the specific metabolic rate of our species as the p_value was found to be insignificent at .8505. We believe this can be attributed to panic symptoms in the crayfish upon being submerged in darkness. 

Introduction:
Metabolism can often be described as the entire process of balancing energy capture, conversion and transfer within an organism. Since ATP consumption is difficult to track, oxygen consumption can be excellent indirect indicators of metabolic rate. ATP consumption and generation stops almost immediately without the presence of oxygen to remove electrons from the mitochondria. With this knowledge it can be assumed that oxygen consumption is nearly directly proportional to the amount of energy being extended by an organism, as to expend energy they need oxygen. In this experiment we will be measuring metabolic rate in crayfish and how measurements vary when the crayfish is left in the light against when the crayfish is put in the dark. In a similar 1988 study, Donald Powers found that Hummingbirds had a far lower specific metabolic rate when they were feeding in the dark compared to when they fed in the light [Power: 1988]. Although in this experiment we will be surveying an ectotherm rather than an endotherm, our group hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate will be substantially lower when the Procambris sp. is kept in the dark. The independent variable in this experiment was the presence of light or the absence thereof, while the dependent variable was the oxygen consumption of the crayfish under these various conditions. The Procambris sp. species were decided to be good subjects as they are easily contained and their metabolic rate can be tracked through the oxygen they consume in water. 

Materials and Method:
Materials:
	Shallow water bin of room temperature water
	Mason Jar
	Dissolved Oxygen Probe and Reader
	3 Large Crayfish
	Room Temperature Water (To fill mason jar with)
	Large graduated cylinder 
Method:
A shallow water bin was filled ½ way with 22°C, oxygenated water. A normal, adult sized crayfish was weighed before being placed in a mason jar filled to the brim with water. The dissolved oxygen probe was inserted into the jar and the jar was sealed tightly, water overflowing from the top confirmed that enough water had been put in the jar. Upon sealing the jar the oxygen content in the water was tested and that value was allowed to stabilize. The oxygen content of the water was recorded again at 5, 10,15 and 20 minutes. Following this first trial, the volume of water in the mason jar was measured in a large graduated cylinder. The mason jar was then refilled again with room temperature water, however this time the jar was wrapped in tin foil tightly enough that light could not enter the system. Following the tin foil placement, the oxygen probe was inserted and the oxygen content of the water was allowed to stabilize and recorded. The amount of oxygen in the water was again recorded at five, ten, fifteen and twenty minutes respectively. Following the darkness trial the volume of the water was again recorded. This entire process was repeated with two different crayfish. Metabolic rate was calculated using the formula below.

Metabolic Rate =(∆O2 ×Volume ×H20 (Ml))/(Time x weight (g))


Results:
The metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. species did not vary significently between the dark and light environments. The average metabolic rate of the crayfish in the light was .000438 (mg O2 * g-1 * min-1). while in the dark environment the average was .00047 (mg O2 * g-1 * min-1). The standard deviation of the two values were almost identical with the three crayfish in the light having a deviation of .000365 while in the dark the standard deviation was .000363. The p_value in this experiment was found to be insignificent, with a value of .8508, far above our value of significance of .05. 

Discussion:
Ultimately, the results of this experiment did not support our original hypothesis that the Procambris sp. specimens would have a lower metabolic rate when put in the dark. Rather than lowering their metabolic rate, the darkness raised specific metabolic rate from an average of .000438 to .00047. These results are rather puzzling as several studies we read, including a 2002 study by AK Biswas supported that ectotherms, specifically tilapia, had lower specific metabolic rates in the dark [Biswas: 2002]. There are some discrepancies here, as in Biswas experiment he was examining their metabolic rates during feeding rather than just in the dark period. Additionally, crawfish utilize biologically different gills from those of salmon. However, our group still believed that despite our crayfish, taking part in no particular activity, would have a lower specific metabolic rate as well. Despite, the data going in the opposite direction that predicted, the high p_value of .8508 suggests that it’s possible anomalies were had in the experiment. The results could be due to a variety of factors. To begin, the Procambris sp. samples were rather large for the size of the mason jars they were being kept in, and upon submerging the dissolved oxygen probe they would generally exhibit excitatory symptoms. The crayfish would usually go parallel to the side of the jar and circle while drumming their legs against it, this was the opposite of how they behaved once placed back in their larger holding tank, where they would be rather stationary. Their increased movement would have led to increased energy expenditure, which would increase metabolic rate. Another factor to examine form why crayfish differ from tilapia would be evolutionary factors. Crayfish evolved to live in streams, brooks and ponds, and we know that they are unable to tolerate polluted water. We could hypothesize they are predisposed to clearer water in shallow areas, where light would be more available, the absence of light could have been an indicator of unclean water for them, relating back to the possible panic symptoms. If this study were to be repeated, we would want to repeat it with a larger space to monitor the oxygen in, as this would eliminate any possible panic symptoms if the probe wasn’t crowding them. Additionally, I would like to use a material other than tin foil as if even a little bit of light got through the cracks, it would’ve reflected off the tinfoil. Another substance that wouldn’t reflect light from the interior would be superior, especially since it would be easier to wrap around the mason jar. In a future study I would like to explore oxygen study of ectotherms vs. endotherms and see if there is any noticeable difference in the two organisms, this to see the validity of the studies referenced in this paper.

Figure 1: Here, the average metabolic rate of Procambris sp. in the light was .000438. In the dark environment, this number grew to .00047. Both variables had high standard deviations, with .000365 for the light group and .000363 for the dark group.
