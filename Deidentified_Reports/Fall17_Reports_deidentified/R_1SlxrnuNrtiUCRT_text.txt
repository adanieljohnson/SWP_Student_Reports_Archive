Title: The effect of water salinity on the metabolic rates of Procambris sp.: higher salinity in the environment decreased the metabolic rate

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment is to determine the effects of water salinity on the metabolic rate of crayfish. The metabolism involves the entire process of balancing energy, capturing, conversion, and transferring within in a specimen. This process involves specific metabolic rate and the transfer of electrons through the electron transport system. To find the metabolic rates of crayfish, we looked at oxygen consumption. We were able to do this because oxygen used is directly related to the amount of energy expended. Three crayfish were used and all acting as their own controlll and experimental groups.  The crayfish were exposed to 20 minutes in freshwater, followed by 20 minutes in saltwater with a concentration of 0.72-0.73% salt. While our original hypothesis predicted that the metabolic rates of crayfish would be higher in salt water than the freshwater, our data revealed the opposite. The crayfish placed in the salt water were found to have a lower metabolic rate than those in the freshwater.


Introduction:
Metabolism is considered to be the entire process of balancing energy, capturing, conversion, and transferring within a specimen. Therefore, the metabolic rate is the general amount of energy expended by all the processes at a specific time. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are two elements that indicate the energy production and use by an organism.  Oxygen and Carbon molecules that are available at the beginning of the metabolic process go through a set of reactions to become carbon dioxide gas. As a result of these reactions, high energy electrons captured by NAD+ and FAD are released as part of the transport of electrons in the electron transport system. The energy let off by this is used to convert ADP to ATP. Furthermore, it is important to note that oxygen used is directly related to the amount of energy expended [Johnson 2016].  Based on this knowledge, oxygen consumption can be measured to find the metabolic rate.  Our specimen of choice for this experiment is the Procambris sp., also known as a freshwater crayfish. Since crayfish are ectotherms, they are easily affected by small changes in their environment, which makes it easier to gather data that can reflect the impact of the substance being tested. Crayfish submerged in the freshwater served as our controlll group, while those placed in salt water were the experimental group. An experiment conducted by David Rouse found that crayfish in waters with high concentrations of salt weakened and struggled to maintain their metabolic rates. The salt made it harder for them to function and required more effort [Rouse 1992]. Based on this information, our group biological alternate hypothesis states that adding salt to the water will increase the metabolic rate of the crayfish because the more salt is added, the harder the gills will have to work, therefore increasing their metabolic rate. 


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we began by weighing the crayfish. Each crayfish was then placed in a container and the container was filled to the top with room temperature, 22℃, fresh water (no salt added) that had been saturated with air. The container was then placed in a plastic dish pan with water that reached the neck of the jar.  A dissolved oxygen probe was placed in the jar, which caused some water to overflow, and the lid was screwed on tightly. The dissolved oxygen probe was then given a chance to stabilize and the baseline dissolved oxygen consumption reading was taken.  The oxygen concentrations were taken again at 5, 10 15, and 20 minutes.  All of the above steps were repeated exactly the same way on three crayfish who were the controlll group.  After this, the above steps were repeated on the same three crayfish for a second time however, this time room temperature salt water (0.72-0.73% salinity rate) was used in place of the fresh water to serve as the experimental group. At the completion of the experiment and once all of the data had been collected, a paired t_test was run to determine the reliability of our findings. 


Results:
The average metabolic rate of the crayfish in freshwater and saltwater were calculated from the data.  A standard paired t_test was run on the difference in metabolic rate between freshwater and saltwater crayfish. The statistics revealed a degree of freedom of 2, a T-value of 3.64, and a P-value of 0.07 for our data. 
Figure 1 (see below) shows that the average metabolic rate in freshwater was 0.0006333, while the average metabolic rate in salt water was 0.00021333. From this it can be seen that the metabolic rate was lower in the salt water than in the freshwater. 


Discussion:
Overall, the data from this experiment does not support our original hypothesis which predicted that higher salinity rates would proportionally increase the metabolic rate.  In fact, the opposite occurred; the higher the salinity rate of the water, the lower the metabolic rate was. For all three crayfish, the experimental metabolic rates calculated were lower than those in the controlll group. One reason this may have happened would be because in fresh water, the crayfish have to use energy to try to keep ions in that are essential for life, whereas in the salt water, the crayfish have to spend less energy trying to keep the ions in, as they wouldn’t have to work as hard to maintain diffusion. In a study conducted by Dr. Mark E. Meade, results similar to ours were found. Their research showed that when low levels of salt were added to the water, the metabolic rate would decrease. Meade furthered his experiment and found that high salinity rates could be lethal to the crayfish, instead of being more efficient metabolically [Meade 2002]. The statistics from this study gave us a P-value of 0.07 which is technically insignificent as a P-value of 0.05 or lower is considered significent.  However, since our P-value is so close to the accepted 0.05, there is still a high chance of our results occurring again and therefore they should not be completely disregarded.  If we were to attempt to run this experiment again, one change we would make would be to test metabolic rates in a larger range of salinities to see if there is a point where the salt is worse than freshwater for the crayfish and to verify the results from Meade’s study discussed above. Also, a study by researcher D. Neilson examined the effect of salt water increases in freshwater environments and found that high salinity rates had a negative effect on the life quality and lifespan of the crayfish [Nielsen 2003].  Another change we could make would be to use a larger sample size, so we would have more data to work with and our data could more accurately reflect the trends of the population. It is important that research be conducted on this topic because it helps show how small changes to the environment can have a large impact on the quality of life of the organisms living in it, especially the ectotherms.  In many areas around the globe water temperatures are rising, pollution is increasing and many other changes are occurring, so it is crucial that we understand the effect this has on the biodiversity.
