Title: The Effects of Increased Salinity on the Rate of Photosynthesis of Spinach

Abstract:
Farming is the lifeline of society and increasing salinities in groundwater is a major concern.  In select locations around the world farmers have to try to deal with groundwater with increasing salt concentration. This experiment focuses on the effects of salinity on photosynthesis.  Three different test groups of varying salinities (0, 0.25 M, and 0.5 M) were studied.  After data was obtained over a 30-minute duration, an ANOVA test was conducted and yielded a p_value of 0.922. This is not a significent value, so it was concluded that photosynthesis was not directly affected by salinity.  Although photosynthesis is not directly affected in this particular experiment other vital processes could be impacted.  Further studies of different processes should be conducted to see the effect of salinity on the plants physiology overall.

Introduction:
With an ever-growing human population, farmers have been innovating to keep up.  Over the years there have been many steps forward with some setbacks.  Due to the changing climate around the world sea levels have been rising and recently in select locations around the world there has been an issue with increased salinity of groundwater that is used for agricultural purposes.  Increasing salinity is known to many scientists as one of the largest threats in food security around the world. [Julkowaska 2015].  The salt itself builds up over time naturally, but with modern farming practices the rate is significently increased [Qados: 2011].  Recently there have been many studies centered around the effects of increased salinity on plant growth and other biological processes [Katerji: 2003].  In this experiment, we focused on the effects of salinity on the photosynthetic processes of the chloroplasts that came from spinach leaves.  Spinach is a good model-organism because is grown all over the planet, is easily obtainable, and cheap.  When speaking about photosynthesis there are two different reactions, the light-depended and the light-independent and in this experiment, we focused on the light dependent hill reaction. We are utilizing the process in which creates the proton gradient (for ATP Synthesis) to understand the rate when it reacts with DCPIP (this is how we determined the photosynthetic rate).  These reactions need specific environment in order to be effective as a result chloroplasts are used.  The main question is whether not high salt levels will hinder the chloroplasts ability to conduct photosynthesis.  This could be possible because there could be dehydration of the chloroplasts themselves due to the osmosis of water to the outside (high salt concentration).  There are many different applications in which knowing more about how photosynthesis is affected when exposed to higher levels of salinity.

Materials and Method:
The experiment began with the removal of the veins of five spinach leaves.  The leaves were then ground in a mortar and pestle with 36Ml 0 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). The liquid was then run through three layers of cheesecloth in order to be filtered.  This filtered solution was then centrifuged twice once at 200g, 1200 rpm (in order to remove any debris) and second at 1000g, 2800 rpm (in order to get a concentrated pellet of chloroplasts).  This pellet was then re-suspended in 20 Ml grinding buffer.  We then proceeded to create three different solutions containing the suspended chloroplasts (100 microliter aliquots) each with a different salinity.  There was the controlll which contained no salt, one that was .25 molar NaCl, and the last that was .5 molar NaCl (similar to seawater).  Each of these solutions were then prepared with different reagents including: water, 2Ml 130 M DCPIP, and 2Ml reaction buffer.  Each of these were allowed to react over a 30-minute time period and the absorbance was checked repeatedly (0,10,20, and 30-minute marks).  The absorbance is inversely proportional to the rate of photosynthesis due to the reactivity/nature of the DCPIP compound.  DCPIP is blue until it absorbs the electrons supplied by the hill reaction.  After all the data was obtained an ANOVA test was performed on the results to conclude whether or not salinity has an effect on the photosynthetic rate of chloroplasts.

Results:
Using the data that was collected in the experiment an ANOVA test was performed.  The test was conducted with a null hypothesis: There is no correlation between photosynthetic rate and salinity concentration and an alternative hypothesis: There is a correlation between photosynthetic rate and salinity concentration.  The ANOVA test resulted in a p_value of 0.922 which was not significent at an alpha-value of 0.05.  As a result, we conclude that Ha: There is no correlation between photosynthetic rate and salinity concentration.



Discussion:
In this experiment, we focused on the direct effect of increasing salinity on the light dependent portion of the photosynthetic processes in plants.  Based on the p_value of 0.922 obtained from the ANOVA test, we have to conclude that there is no correlation between salinity and the photosynthetic rate of chloroplasts.  It appears that the concentration of salt on the outside of chloroplasts does not harm the photosynthetic process.  Despite the idea that the could be dehydration or hindrance in the ability to create a proton gradient, there did not appear to be an effect.  This is a very promising result for the areas that have to deal with quickly increasing salt levels.  This does not mean that the plants are perfectly fine in high salt environments.  Further tests should be conducted to see if other processes are affected by the salt levels.  Different crops handle different salinities better or worse depending on their specific adaptation [Katerji: 2003].  Other processes such as water uptake, perspiration, and yield could be more severely hindered by high salt levels [Hakkwan, 2016].  Farmers are focusing on perfecting different practices such as crop rotation and crop diversification in order to best utilize the lands they have.  In conclusion, although this particular experiment came up with a result that shows no correlation between salinity and photosynthesis overall plant health could be negatively affected.
