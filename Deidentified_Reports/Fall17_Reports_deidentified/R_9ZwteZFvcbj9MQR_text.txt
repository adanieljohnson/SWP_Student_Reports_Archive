Title: Muscular strength of threshold contraction in Rania pipien gastrocnemus with addition of tetraethylammoniun chloride ion

Abstract:
Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA Cl) is an ion that blocks the K+ channels in a membrane. 
The purpose of this study is to test the reaction of a R. pipien frog leg to the TEA Cl and observe if there is an increase in amplitude of the threshold contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle.
We measured the threshold amplitude value of a muscle without (controlll) and with the TEA Cl in three trial legs using pin electrodes inserted in the gastrocnemus muscle and increasing intervals of stimulus amplitudes. The resulting data was inconsistent across the three leg muscles studies – some in which the controlll amplitudes were higher and one in which the treatment was higher. The results were inconclusive due to the insignificent one tailed two-sample T-test that was conducted. The controlll group was not statistically different from that of the experimental group (t_stat=0.25, d.f.=3, P=0.816). Our hypothesis may not have been supported because of the R. pipien legs tiring out from contractions or possibility of the TEA Cl effect on contraction length rather than strength.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle contraction begins with the release of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter into the neuromuscular junction between a neuron’s axon terminal and the muscle fiber membrane. This creates an influx of Na+ from the extracellular fluid into across the fiber membrane in order to create an action potential across the muscle fiber membrane. This leads to the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating muscle contraction [Sadava: 2017]. Potassium channels are located in the muscle fiber membrane and take part in restoring the resting potential in a muscle fiber membrane, thus stopping the release of Ca+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and relax the muscle [Johnson: 2017]. This action potential that causes the contraction continues until the K+ channels restore the relative negative charge of the muscle fiber to the extracellular fluid. Tetraethylammonium chloride is a substance that blocks the K+ channels, preventing an end to the contraction. Hagiwara and Natawabe conducted an experiment to test the effects of tetraethylammonium chloride on a vertebrate muscle and how the muscle fiber membrane was affected. The result was that the action potential across the muscle fiber membrane lasted longer than that of a muscle with no TEA added at the same electrical voltage. This study suggests that the action potential of a muscle fiber lasts longer with the addition of TEA Cl [Hagiwara: 1955]. However, another question to be asked is whether blocking the K+ channels will strengthen the initial contraction. In a study of the action potentials in leeches, it was not only suggested that the action potential lasted longer, but also that the amplitudes of the threshold contractions were actually higher than that of the controlll [Kleinhaus: 1975]. The gastrocnemus of the Rania pipiens is being studied in this experiment because its gastrocnemus is easily identifiable and easily isolated. By injecting the gastrocnemus with TEA Cl, the K+ channels with be blocked, therefore increasing the strength of the muscle fiber. The prediction is that the muscle fiber contraction will be stronger in a muscle that has been injected with TEA Cl than in the controlll. 


Materials and Method:
In order to test whether the strength of the muscle contraction is increased by the addition of TEA Cl, three trials were run testing the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens by controlllling the amplitude stimulation from electrodes and measuring the amplitude of contractions. The 100mM TEA Cl solution was prepared by dissolving 1.7g of TEA Cl in 100 Ml of Ringer’s solution. Each leg was de-gloved and the gastrocnemus was cut off at the bottom tendon of the leg. The cut end was tied to string and hung from a force transducer. The rest of the leg was pinned on the dissection plate and the muscle was pulled to slight tension of the string. We placed the pen electrodes in the gastrocnemus – black electrode near the bottom of the muscle and red electrode near the top. From the LabScribe application on a laptop, we set the first let at 0 Amp and recorded the contraction. For the entire experiment we set the stimulus mode to pulse, the number of pulses to 1, the pulse width to 0, the time off each cycle to 0, and the holding potential at 0. We then increased stimulation amplitude to 0.1, and increased amplitude by 0.1 until 0.5, then jumped to increments of 1 amp starting at 1 and up to 5 amp. We recorded the threshold at wherever the stimulus first caused a muscle contraction. After, we injected the muscle fiber with TEA Cl and started the process over again from 0-0.5 and 1-5 Amp, recording the threshold. We repeated both the controlll experiment and the TEA Cl process for all three Rania pipien leg trials.

Results:
The data collected in the experiment was inconsistent across the three Rania pipien legs. As shown in Figure 1, the controllls of the first two trial legs had higher threshold amplitudes than when they were treated with TEA Cl. Even so, the threshold amplitudes for the controllls were not consistent at all on their own, with Trials 1 and 3 below 0.2 Amp and Trial 2 almost 1 Amp. Although the controlll trials in the first two legs have higher threshold contraction amplitudes than that of their treatment, the fact that the amplitudes of all three makes us unable to determine a trend. The threshold amplitudes after treatment in the three legs were also inconsistent. As seen in Figure 2, the standard deviation of the averaged controlll amplitudes and averaged treatment amplitudes were considerably high, especially in the controlll. As shown in Table 1, the individual stardard deviations of each Rania pipien leg was significently different. The deviation of leg 1 is almost significent, not quite below 0.5There are no clear trends in our data because each starting controlll amplitude is significently different as are the experimental amplitudes. We conducted a one tailed two-sample t_test, in which our t_statistic was 0.25, our degrees of freedom was 3, and our P-value was 0.816.

Discussion:
Our original hypothesis was injecting the Rania pipien gastrocnemus with tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA Cl) would block the K+ channel in the muscle fiber membrane, increasing the strength of the muscle fiber contractions. In order for our P-value to be significent, it had to be less than 0.5, a requirement that our statistics did not meet. Because our data was inconsistent and our standard deviation values were insignificent, our hypothesis was not supported by the experiment. An explanation for this is the blockage of K+ channels has little or nothing to do with the strength of the initial threshold muscle contraction. This is because K+ channels are not as involved in the initiation of an action potential as they are in stopping an action potential and restoring the resting membrane potential. K+ channels are in fact open throughout the creation and destruction of action potential. However, more K+ channels open when negative feedback is introduced and the muscle contraction is meant to end. If the K+ channels are blocked, the contraction would continue, but not necessarily be stronger than a fiber with no TEA Cl [Sadava: 2017]. A reason for the inconsistency of the Rania pipien leg contractions may be that some legs tired out faster or had more initial contraction ability. Our data also could have been affected by the fact that we used the same frog legs for the controlll and the treatment trials, so the legs could have been more tired during the treatment trials. This could be a cause is varying data and the fact that in legs 1 and 2, the threshold amplitudes were lower than that of the controlll trials. In the experiment conducted in 1955, the increased threshold amplitude of the frog leg was not observed. However, their results did suggest that the duration of the contraction was longer in a muscle treated with TEA Cl, supporting the statement that the duration may be affected instead of the strength of the muscle contraction [Hagiwara: 1955]. In the experiment conducted by Kleinhaus and Prichard, the Ringer solution was treated with TEA Cl in one part of the experiment and TEA Cl was injected into the muscle of the leech in another part. In both situations, the nerve was stimulated. The results of this study suggested that the addition of a K+ channel blocker did in fact increase the threshold amplitude of the muscle fiber in a leech [Kleinhaus: 1975]. We attempted to conduct nerve stimulation of the sciatic nerve in the Rania pipien, but we were not able to gather any data that way. This may be because the nerve was damaged. We stimulated the muscle instead, which could have affected our results compared to the above study. Because our data was inconsistent and insignificent, there cannot be any alternate hypotheses to explain our data. The next step in this study would be to regress attempt to minimize errors that were made in order to obtain more valuable and significent data to improve standard deviation.
