Title: Body Size Influence Aggressive Behaviors of Species

Abstract:
	It is common to see that in nature, intraspecific competition between the same species is always along with the display of certain degree of animals’ aggressive behaviors. Our goal is to study whether body size is associated with the degree of animals’ aggressive behaviors, when referring to intraspecific competition. We mainly choose to study Betta Splenden, because they are perfect example of displaying aggressive behaviors. We hypothesize that the fish that are larger is more aggressive than the smaller on, because their difference in body size. In order to prove our hypothesis, we choose several median size fish and put them into eye contact with the larger size fish and the smaller size fish, and we mainly record the time interval of the duration of aggressive behaviors displayed by smaller fish and the larger fish. Not surprisingly, our result from the experiment successfully proves our hypothesis to be valid--- body size does influence the aggressive behaviors of Betta fish and the larger one is more aggressive. In later part of the discussion, we try to explain this phenomenon by applying the knowledge we learnt and the resources we collect.

Introduction:
	The study of animals’ aggressive behaviors is always associated with the understanding of intraspecific competition, the competition within the same species. In nature, “Competition can occur indirectly, where competitors limit resources, or individuals can come into direct contact with each other near a resource and engage in interference competition”, especially for males [Birch: 1957]. It is a rather common phenomenon that males combat to win over the favor of females and dominance rights in order to increase their own reproductive success. However, “competitive ability is often context dependent, so a male’s relative success depends on the local physical and/or social environment” [Zajitschek: 2008]. For example, the competitor who owns big body size is able to gain certain advantages in competition and have higher reproductive success. Thus, in our experiment, we want to find out that whether body size can influence animals’ aggressive behaviors due to intraspecific competition. We chose to use Betta Splenden, because this kind of species is identified with easily observable aggression behaviors that are sort to different levels. We hypothesized that body size can influence the aggressive behaviors of Betta fish, and the bigger one tends to be more aggressive. 

Materials and Methods:
	We selected six male middle size Betta fish, one small fish and one big. Every time, we choose one middle size fish with the small fish and the big one, and put them independently in to three glass boxes which were separated by opaque board to prevent the fish from seeing each other. We first remove the board between the small size male fish and the middle size one, and record the endurance of time that the small fish start to show aggressive behaviors, for example, tail beating, showing “red mane”, standing dorsal fin, and so on to the time that it starts to ignore its competitor. Later, we put the board back and let the middle size fish rest for about five minutes, and then remove the board between the middle size fish and the big one. This time, we record the duration of aggressive behaviors of the big size fish. We repeat the same process for five times with the changing of the middle size fish, and we keep tracking the behaviors of the small and big size fish. 
Statistical Analysis
	We use paired T test to examine how different the duration of the aggressive behaviors of the small size and the big size fish. We intentionally remove the data from the trial 1 and trail 3, because the big size fish does not show any aggressive behaviors, which contains significant difference than the other data.


Results:
	We have calculated the P value for the paired T test. And the result is that, P value equals to 0.047508 for the comparison of the duration of time of aggressive period for the small size fish and the big size fish. Since this value is bigger than 0.05, we can conclude that our experiment provides convincing evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is that there is no correlation between body size and aggressive behaviors.

Discussion:
   It makes sense that the species that who have larger body size is more aggressive than the one who is smaller, and since the smaller owns obvious disadvantages in the combat, they are less active in showing aggressive behaviors, due to our observation, “both male and female mud crabs dominated smaller crabs of the same gender, causing them to spend more time avoiding” [Beattie: 2012]. Additionally, we can also explain this phenomena by applying to Game Theory, which generally, is to predict the behavior of individuals in contest. “During contest, individuals are thought to assess each other’s competitive abilities, or resource-holding potentials (RHPs)” [Enquist and Leimar: 1983]. According to the Game Theory models, “they predict that the individual with the lower RHP will likely disengage early or avoid a fight, because fighting would likely have greater costs and, thus, is unlikely to have become an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS)” [Beattue: 2012]. Thus, we can understand our result as since both the larger size and the smaller size individuals understand well their own advantages and disadvantages during combat, so the larger one tend to maximize its advantages, by being more aggressive, while the smaller choose to retreat or avoid from the conflict in order to minimize the cost.
