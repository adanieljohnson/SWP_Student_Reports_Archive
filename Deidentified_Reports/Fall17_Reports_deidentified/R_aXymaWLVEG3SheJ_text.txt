Title: The Effects of Different Light Intensities on the Plant Resource Allocation of Pisum sativum

Abstract:
The study aims to find the effects of different light intensities on the root shoot ratio of field pea plants or Pisum sativum. Plants can allocate their resources either above the ground to its leaves or below the ground to its roots and shoots. Six field pea plants have been grown for two weeks under controlled light conditions: direct sunlight and shade. Three of the six field pea plants harvested during the lab were placed under the shade, while the other three of the six field pea plants were placed under direct sunlight in the greenroom. The relationships between the root dry weight and dry weight of the total plants was recorded as well as the relationship between the root dry length and the total length of the plant. The mean weight root shoot ratio was highest in the plants that received direct sunlight, while the mean length root shoot ratio was higher in the plants that received no direct sunlight.


Introduction:
	Plants respond to their environment in such a way as to optimize their resources.  Different light intensities affect the rate of photosynthesis and other important processes in plants. Plants and animals are affected by abiotic factors (as well as biotic factors) and have to allocate their resources because of limitations. Light is an abiotic factor (since it is an environmental stimulus) and without any light for a prolonged period of time, the plant would die. The field pea plant or Pisum Sativum is generally grown for stockfeed and human consumption. A plant’s root shoot ratio indicates its response to growing conditions in the environment. The mean R:S ratio weight and length ratio should increase under direct sunlight because these plants will shift their resources to their roots, since they are already tall enough to reach light. Generally, when nutrients are more available, the root shoot ratio increases. The field pea plants in the shaded environment will have a lower R:S ratio than the field pea plants in direct sunlight since the former needs to put its energy into growing tall and not into its roots. 

	The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of light intensity on the mean R:S ratio of Pisum sativum. We will observe the phenomenon of plant growth, which can be applied to daily life. We are interested in this lab because we want to know how to optimize a plant’s nutrients, so that we can grow healthy plants. The field pea plants grown under direct sunlight will have a larger mean weight and length R:S ratio. 



Materials and Methods:
The general experimental set-up is described in the BioCore Resource Guide. The experiments were carried out in the greenroom and in the classroom. Six field pea plants of equal size were harvested from the instructor. 20 germinated seeds were placed into all of the six pots along with vermiculite and miracle grow (liquid fertilizer). 3 field pea plants were placed in direct sunlight and the other three field pea plants were placed in the shade tent in the greenroom. The plants were then watered everyday for 2 full weeks. After the initial process of growing the plants, the plants were washed in a container of water. During the experiment,  the vernacular was broken apart in the six plants to separate the roots out of the mixture. Then, the plant was weighed. Next, the roots were separated from the shoots in order to weigh the shoots and record that data. The maximum shoot length and root length to the nearest mm were measured and the mean R:S ratio value for each group of data was recorded. The experiment needed a two-sided T test to see if there is a significant difference between the mean values of the data with an alpha level of 0.05.


Results:
The mean weight R:S ratio for the plants that received direct sunlight was 0.61 ± 0.108 grams and the mean weight R:S ratio for the plants that did not receive direct sunlight  was 0.46 ± 0.404 grams, which is reported in table 1 above. The mean length R:S ratio for the plants that received direct sunlight was 1.28 ± 0.108 mm and the mean length R:S ratio for the field pea plants that did not receive direct sunlight was 1.46 ± 0.344 mm, which is reported in table 1 above. After running a two-tailed t test with an alpha level of 0.05, it is reasonable to conclude that the two groups did not have significantly different means for the weight R:S ratio (0.6213, 4, 0.2954). Likewise, the mean length R:S ratio are not significantly different for both groups (-0.8647, 4, 0.7674). Since the P values for both groups are above the alpha level, there is a high probability that the results we saw were purely due to chance and not based on the relationship between the variables. Therefore, the mean values are not significantly different. The general trend in this data shows that the resource allocation pattern for a plant species is directly related to the environmental conditions in which it adapts. 


Discussion:
The data partially supports our hypothesis. Our hypothesis about the mean R:S ratio was supported, while our hypothesis about the mean length R:S ratio was not supported as shown in the results above. The mean weight R:S ratio was larger for the plants grown under direct light. since these plants had to extend their roots deep into the soil in order to find growth. The three  field pea plants under direct sunlight had a larger mean weight R:S ratio; therefore, these plants had larger roots relative to their shoots. The mean weight R:S ratio was smaller for the plants not grown under direct sunlight (shade) because these plants needed to put their energy into growing taller, so that they could reach light and survive. Based on our initial observations, we thought that the mean length R:S ratio would be larger in the plants placed under direct light. However, as shown in table 1, the plants placed in the shade had a higher mean length R:S ratio. 
We thought that the plants placed in direct sunlight should have larger roots since they do not need to make their shoots as long. The discrepancies between the weight and length R:S ratios could be due to the results of error in the lab. Sources of error include a small sample size of only 6 plants. If the experiment is conduced again, the sample size should be larger and should include more plants. This experiment could also be completed more accurately in the future by carefully selecting the amount germinated seeds placed into each pot and ensuring that only 20 germinated seeds were placed in each pot.  In a similar study that focuses on plant resource allocation, the root microbes were found highest in roots of emergent plants than the floating plants; the emergent plants had higher R/S ratios ((Sukumaran, Anilkumar, & Thanga, 2015). This is similar to the idea that the mean weight R:S was larger for the plants grown under direct sunlight since more nutrients were allocated to them. Another study focused on the biomass allocation between vegetative growth and reproduction of clonal plants (Ericsson, 1995). According to the results of that lab, the mean effect sizes of light intensity and nutrient level on vegetation and reproduction were positive. Therefore, direct sunlight did increase the allocation between these variables, which is similar to the results in our lab. Finally, another study investigated the effects of seed size and light intensity on germinability and seedling development of Copaifera oblongifolia.(“0102-3306-abb-2017abb0032.pdf,” n.d.). This study was similar to our study in that it used light as the independent variable to test the dependent variable of seed germination. Direct sunlight increased the germination of the seeds. Likewise, direct sunlight increased the mean R:S ratio of the field pea plants. All of these studies relate to the idea that direct sunlight enables a plant to allocate its resources more effectively.  The results from the lab would be important to as farmer who wants to know where he or she should place their plants in order for the plant to allocate its resources more effectively and have a higher R:S ratio. The farmer can then use Pisum Sativum as stockfeed. The next logical step in this study is to repeat the experiment and look at the new data in comparison to the old.
