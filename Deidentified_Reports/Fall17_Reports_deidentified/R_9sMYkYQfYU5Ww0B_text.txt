Title: The Effect of Temperature on Specific Metabolic Rate of the Procambarus specie

Abstract:
Metabolism is critical for all living organisms. The goal of this lab is to see how specific metabolic rate changes in relation to a temperature change. This study will be done on crayfish since they are ectotherms and rely on water temperature to keep their bodies warm. The crayfish were weighed and put in 7 and 18 degree Celsius water. The crayfish's oxygen was measured at 0,5,and 10 mins in the chamber. This was repeated with 3 crayfish. It was shown that the temperature had no significant change  with a P value of 0.154 on the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. 

Introduction:
    Metabolism is a chemical process that occurs in living organisms in order to make energy to maintain life. The Metabolism formula is O2+ glucose+ ADP ⇔CO2+ H20 +ATP. ATP is used by the organism for energy. Since O2 is used directly in metabolism, it is a good indicator for calculating metabolic rate. 	
      In this experiment, we will be studying the metabolic rate of the Procambarus specie, also known as crayfish. Crayfish are ectotherms, animals that do not make their own body heat.  Also, temperature has an effect on how much oxygen the ectotherm can take up(Powell,2006).  This experiment will look at the effect of temperature on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish.  The warmer the water, the higher the specific metabolic rate will be. According to Zou et. al, it is well known that the higher the temperature is, the metabolic rate goes up exponentially ( Zou, 2012).  Powell et. al did an experiment, where they acclimated crayfish in 30 degree Celsius water and 10 degrees Celsius water and she showed that the species has higher specific metabolic rate in the 30 degree Celsius water( Powell,2006).  Also, according to Powell et. al, temperatures change the binding affinity of oxygen in the hemocyanin and the binding affinity of the oxygen alters the Procambarus specie's specific metabolic rate( Powell,2006).

Materials and Methods:
First, each one of the three crayfish used were weighed. To test the specific metabolic rate for the colder temperature water, we made an ice bath. The temperature of the ice bath ended up being 7 degrees Celsius. We then put one of the weighed crayfish in a Mason Jar with oxygenated water from the fridge and an oxygen probe. We then took the oxygen concentration at 0,5,and 10 mins. Next, the volume of water was measure in order to calculate specific metabolic rate.  This was repeated for the two other crayfish.  Room temperature water was then used as the warmer water. The above procedures were then followed to determine the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in warmer water.  The specific metabolic rates were calculated using the specific metabolic rate formula . Then a paired T-test is used to see if the data is significant.


Results:
The results showed that there was barely a difference in the crayfish’s specific metabolic rate. The crayfish in 7 degree Celsius water had a slightly higher metabolic rate than the 18 degree Celsius water. 


Discussion:
 The data was not significant to prove that crayfish’s  specific metabolic  rate depends on the temperature of the water.  This also means it does not support the hypothesis that the warmer water makes the specific metabolic rate higher. The T test showed that the P value was 0.154 which is much greater than 0.05. One of the reasons why this experiment might not have worked, was there was not enough difference in the temperature to see a significant change of specific metabolic rate. According to Powell et. al, the crayfish could have been already acclimated to the water temperature before the experiment started depending on what water temperature the crayfish were kept in before the experiment( Powell,2006).  Prior to the experiment, our group was not given the temperature in which the crayfish were kept in. With the temperature being so close together it could be that the crayfish were already acclimated to both water temperatures. To overcome this next time, we should probably put the crayfish in 0 degree Celsius Water and then in 40 degree Celsius water to see if the specific metabolic rate changes. Another reason, why the data did not support our hypothesis was due to only having the crayfish in the water for 10 minutes. The crayfish should have been left in the water for 20 minutes since it takes time for the crayfish’s internal body temperature to adjust to the water. This is a major contributor to the data not support the hypothesis.
