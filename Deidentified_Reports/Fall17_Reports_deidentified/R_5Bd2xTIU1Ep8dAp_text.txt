Title: Temperatures effect on root:shoot length and weight ratios

Abstract:
 The aim of the experiment was to use root: shoot weight and length ratios to determine how temperature influences plant growth and phenotypic plasticity. The plant's species Avena sativa or oats were grown and harvested in two different temperature conditions. Half of the sample was grown in an incubator which kept soil temperatures at about 27°C and the other half was grown at 31.6 °C. In the incubator at 27°C, the oats were grown at a temperature that was closer to being within the optimal temperature range and because of this, it was deduced that the oats would have less need to reallocate resources. Based on this premise, it was hypothesized that in the condition where oats were grown at 27°C the root: shoot length and weight ratios would be lower when compared to the root: shoot length and weight ratios of oats in the condition where they were grown at 31.6 °C. The results showed that the mean of the root: shoot weight ratio was significently smaller in the oats grown in the optimal condition. Therefore, this hypothesis was supported. The difference in root: shoot length ratios, however, was found to be statistically insignificent. Because of this, the hypothesis related to root: shoot length ratios was rejected and the null hypothesis was accepted. 

Introduction:
Plant resource allocation refers to the pattern in which a species uses and distributes its limited resources. Modification of the allocation of resources can occur in response to variations, both biotic or abiotic, within an environment. A species’ ability to modify its resource allocation in response to environmental factors is referred to as phenotypic plasticity and this varies among species. These factors can modify the expression of individual genotypes to help an organism survive under specific conditions (Bradshaw: 1964). The allocation of biomass in either the root or the shoot of a plant can help indicate the availability of certain resources within an environment due to the fact that the roots and the shoots of a plant have very different functions. For example, when a plant is in an environment where light is plentiful there may be high resource allocation to the shoot as the leaves and stem play a vital role in the capture of light and hence photosynthesis. On the contrary, if a plant is grown where water is scarce, resources may be allocated to root growth due to the fact that roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil.  Because of this, a commonly used measurement for resource allocation, specifically focusing on growth pattern changes, are the root: shoot ratios. To find these ratios, the biomass or the weight and length of the root is divided by the biomass of the shoot. 
The experiment conducted will use root: shoot ratios to determine how the abiotic factor of temperature influences plant growth and phenotypic plasticity. Environmental factors such as temperature affect plant growth due to the fact that plants have an optimal temperature range in which they thrive (Went: 1953). The plant species Avena sativa, more commonly referred to as oats, will be studied. It is important to note that oats are known to grow best in areas where the annual temperature is between 5 and 26°C (Duke: 1983). Because of this, it is predicted that the plants will exhibit better root and shoot biomass growth when in optimal conditions and hence the root: shoot ratios will be smaller. In addition, oats grown in optimal conditions will have less need to reallocate resources given that the condition will favor standard allocation. Based on this premise, it is hypothesized that in the optimal condition or the condition in which oats are grown at 27°C, both the root: shoot length and weight ratios will be lowest while in the heat condition in which the temperature is far above optimal levels, the root: shoot ratios will be higher. The null hypothesis is that temperature will have no effect on the root: shoot weight ratio, or the root: shoot length ratio. 


Materials and Method:
In order to study the effect of temperature on phenotypic plasticity and root: shoot ratios, one hundred and twenty oat seeds were planted in six containers. Twenty seeds were placed in each conditioner and these six containers were then separated into two separate groups: the optimal condition and the heat condition. In the optimal condition, containers 1-3 were placed in an incubator held at 27°C. The remaining three containers, or containers 4-6, were placed in the heat condition. This involved an incubator held at 31.6°C. In these conditions, the oat seeds were allowed to germinate and grow for a period of 14 days or two weeks. During this time period, they were watered once a day with 355 Ml of water. After two weeks, the oats in both conditions were harvested. The oats harvested from containers 1-3 were first weighed in groups of five. Then the plants were cut apart at the root-shoot junction and separated. The roots and shoots were weighed separately and from this, the root: shoot weight ratio was determined. Next, the longest shoot and longest root were measured and recorded in centimeters. From this data, the root: shoot length ratio was determined. This procedure was repeated for containers 4-6. After results were collected a two-sample t_test was conducted on the data. This statistical test was selected because it allowed for the comparison of the means between two groups of data.  The two groups compared were the mean root: shoot ratios of the optimal condition and of the heat condition. 
 

Results:
The results of the experiment show that the mean of the root: shoot weight ratio was greater in the oats grown in the heat condition when compared to the oats in the optimal condition (figure 1). In addition, the root: shoot length ratio of the oats grown in the heat condition was also larger. As shown in table 1, the mean root: shoot weight ratio for oats in the optimal condition was 1.08 g with a standard deviation of 0.21. The mean root: shoot weight ratio for oats in the heat condition was 1.45 g with a standard deviation of 0.08 as depicted in table 2. The oats in the optimal condition also had longer roots and shoots on average when compared to those in the heat condition. This lead to a smaller root: shoot length ratio in oats in the optimal condition as shown in table 1. The mean value of root: shoot length ratio for oats in the heat condition was 0.87 ± 0.16 while the mean value of root: shoot length ratio for oats in the optimal condition was 0.83 ± 0.21. The results of the two-sample t_test showed that the mean of the optimal root: shoot weight ratio was significently different from the mean of the heat condition root: shoot weight ratio (t_stat=2.89, d.f.=4, P= 0.04). This relationship can be seen in figure 1. However, as also illustrated in figure 1, the mean of the optimal root: shoot length ratio was determined to be statistically insignificently different from the average root: shoot length ratio in the heat condition (t_stat=0.22, d.f.=4, P=0.84).  

Discussion:
The hypothesis of the experiment was that in the optimal condition both root: shoot weight and length ratios would be lowest while in the heat condition in which the temperature was above optimal levels, the root: shoot length and weight ratios would be higher. The results did show that the root: shoot length and weight ratios were lower in the optimal condition with an average of 0.83 ± 0.21 for length and 1.08 ± 0.21 for weight. The difference in root: shoot weight ratios did demonstrate this trend in a statistically significent way. It could be deduced that this was because more resources were allocated to the roots in the heat condition (table 2). When exposed to high temperatures, the soil may have absorbed more water leaving the oats struggling to absorb enough water to continue growth. Because of this the biomass or weight of the roots in the heat condition was higher, leading to an increase in the root: shoot weight ratio. However, the difference between root: shoot length ratios in the two conditions were determined to be statistically insignificent. Based on this premise, the hypothesis that the root: shoot weight ratios would be lower in the optimal condition was supported while the hypothesis that the root: shoot length ratios would be lower in the optimal condition was not supported. Because of this, the null hypothesis was retained in relation to the root: shoot length ratios. 
Other existing studies do support the conclusion that temperature has an effect on root: shoot weight ratios. In fact, a study by R.L. Davidson on pasture grasses found that the root: shoot weight ratio was lowest at the optimum soil temperature as hypothesized and demonstrated by the comparison of root: shoot weight ratios in this experiment (Davidson: 1969). In addition, a study by Giri et al. stated that heat stress most deeply affected the roots in tomatoes and negatively influenced the concentration of nutrient-uptake proteins. This may explain the allocation of energy to root biomass growth as roots have the primary function of absorbing nutrients (Giri et al. 2017). Hence, a general lack on nutrient uptake could cause the plant to allocate its resources to root growth. The premise that temperature has no effect on root: shoot length ratios, however, is not supported by other research. A study on root and shoot growth and length on Norway spruce seedlings exhibited that as soil temperature became closer to the seedlings optimum soil temperature of 21°C, the growth of the root and shoot increased. This would have led to a lower root: shoot ratio (Lahti et al.:2008). In spite of this, this study focuses more on plant growth rather than the allocation of resources to the growth of the root and the shoot. Because of this, it is unclear whether a change in temperature would influence the allocation of resources to plant growth. 
This discrepancy between previous research and the conclusions made from this experiment in relation to root: shoot length ratios could stem from a wide variety of errors in the experimental design. Primarily, only five oats were harvested from each pot. Not only is this a relatively small sample size but also there was no random sampling method implemented. Because of this, selection bias may have played a role in the collection of data. Since selection bias was not taken into account, the conclusions drawn from the experiment may not be entirely accurate. 
Despite this, the results of this study are likely valuable when describing root: shoot weight ratios but not when describing root: shoot length ratios. Because of this, further experimentation should be done on how temperature influences root: shoot length ratios. To increase validity, a larger sample size should be obtained and the oats selected to be weighed and measured should be selected by a random sampling method. However, it is also possible that temperature does only influences root: shoot weight ratios but not root: shoot length ratios. This premise should be studied more in depth as this could be a possible explanation for the results of this experiment. 
Studying resource allocation in relation to root: shoot ratios can help determine how certain environmental factors influence plant growth and phenotypic plasticity. Understanding that certain plants need to change in response to stimuli can allow for more in-depth analysis on the trade-off between survival, growth, and reproduction.
