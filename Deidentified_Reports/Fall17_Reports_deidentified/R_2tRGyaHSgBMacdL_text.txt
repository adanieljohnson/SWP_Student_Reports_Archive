Title: Decreasing aggressive displays in Betta splendens towards fake fish 

Abstract:
Ethology combines the physiological purpose for behaviors with an evolutionary history to learn more about why organisms act in a certain way. Through ethological principles, researchers can learn more about specific behaviors. In this study, interspecific behaviors of Betta splendens were observed and quantitated by counting red manes, a certain agonistic behavior that involves the protruding of branchiostegal membranes, displayed in response to real and fake fish. The hypothesis predicted that there would be a difference in aggressive behaviors in real fish:real fish interactions compared to real fish:fake fish interactions. After observing different interactions in 5 minute intervals, it was determined that there were significantly fewer red manes displayed when the B. splendens were exposed to fake fish instead of real fish. This statistically significant reduction in red manes directly correlates with a decrease in agonistic behaviors, signifying that this particular species will perhaps not allocate as many resources to aggressive behavior if it is not a conspecific interaction. These results continue to support the theory that Betta splendens act very differently in interspecific interactions compared to intraspecific interactions. 

Introduction:
Ethology, or the study of animal behavior, is a strong field that pulls many aspects of science together. Seeking to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, ethologists practice long periods of patient observation to add depth and appropriateness [Johnson: 2017]. It is important to maintain objectiveness when observing behavior to gather unbiased information. Things such as following the proper time intervals, using quantitative behaviors, and employing descriptive, empirical terms helps to enforce this. Betta splendens, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, are Asian fish that deserve this colloquial name due to their well-known tendency to attack fish of the same species [Johnson: 1972]. Being frequently found in aquariums, these were applicable organisms due to their accessibility and distinct aggressive displays in conflict. Siamese fighting fish display unique agonistic behaviors, such as broadside and facing movements, when in an intraspecific situation [Johnson: 2017]. The most threatening behavior is commonly known as a “red mane” and occurs when male Siamese fighting fish supply enough oxygen to the opercula for the branchiostegal membranes protrude. These aggressive displays serve as a territory defense in hopes of dissuading an opponent, but they are also metabolically costly [Bones: 2017]. Although these intraspecific aggressions are widely studied, there is far less known about interspecific agonistic behaviors in this species. The purpose of this particular study was to see if there is a difference in aggressive displays between real Siamese fighting fish and fake fish. The hypothesis was that there would be a difference in aggressive behaviors in real fish : real fish interactions versus fake fish : real fish interactions. To test this hypothesis, two male B. splendens fish were observed in different scenarios. 

Materials and Methods:
A small aquarium divided into three compartments was used to keep 2 male Betta splendens (betta) visually isolated from each other. A clear piece of glass was placed between the two bettas, and the opaque partition was removed. The two fish were observed for 5 minutes, and the number of red manes displayed by each fish were recorded. The opaque partition was then replaced, and the bettas were given 5 minutes of rest. This interaction was repeated, and this data served as the control group. Then, the same process was repeated between various combinations of real and fake fish. Each real fish faced each fake fish twice. At least 5 minutes of rest were maintained between trials throughout the experiment, and each interaction was observed for 5 minutes. The number of red manes during the real fish : real fish interactions were compared to those of the real fish : fake fish interactions, and a statistical analysis including an ANOVA test (p = 0.05) and Tukey-Kramer test was used to analyze the data. 

Results:
When a real fish was replaced with a fake fish, the number of red manes recorded was significantly lower (p = 0.000085).  According to the Tukey-Kramer test, the difference between the control group and fake fish 1 along with the difference between the control and fake fish 2 are both significant. The mean number of red manes shown in the control group was 17.5 +/- 4.65, and the mean number of red manes shown for the two experimental groups were 1.5 +/- 1.29 and 1.5 +/- 3. There was no statistically significant difference between the two fake fish. Figure 1 displays means of each group, along with the standard deviation shown through error bars. 

Discussion:
After analyzing the data, the alternate hypothesis is accepted. The data shows that Siamese fighting fish do not display as aggressive behaviors towards fake fish. One possible explanation for this outcome could be that the real fish detected that the fake fish were fake. If they knew that they were fake and offered no real threat, then they would not have allocated energy for aggressive behavior. A second explanation may be that the Siamese fighting detected that the fake fish were fish of a different species, thus decreasing their desire to fight in an interspecific situation. In addition to this, the real fish may have not responded as aggressively because they could not detect any fighting social behavior of the fake fish. According to a study done at Ramapo College, the social behavior of a fish’s opponent is far more important than a simple visual stimulus [Johnson: 1972]. This study also obtained similar results in terms of the quality and duration of aggressive displays in interspecific reactions. Although the amount of rest was consistently maintained at 5 minutes, habituation may have played a role in the final outcomes. Fish are known to learn quickly and possess good memories [Johnson: 2017], so the fish may have shown fewer red manes in the second trials because of their previous exposure to the fake fish. As mentioned previously, aggressive behaviors, such as a red mane, are metabolically costly. Siamese fighting fish are not going to spend energy resources on something that is not worthwhile, and this cost-benefit relationship may help researchers learn more about underlying motivational processes. A study done at the University of Southern Maine established that Betta splendens will even decrease aggressive behaviors towards different colored fish of the same species [Bones: 2017]. This experiment at the University of Southern Maine paired with the results of the study at hand could open the door for further investigation of the effect of varying colors in interspecific interactions.
