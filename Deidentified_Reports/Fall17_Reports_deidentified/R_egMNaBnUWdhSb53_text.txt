Title: How the presence of shelter affects the aggressiveness of aggression in Betta splendins

Abstract:
In this experiment,  observed Betta splendins was observed on its aggressive behavior with and without shelter. All of the trials were between two fish and the observations recorded were of a single fish. It was hypothesized that the shelter would increase the aggression response due to the fish having something to protect. Aggressiveness measured on a scale of physical reactions that were ranked from least to most aggressive. The controlll group consisted of the fish seeing each other for five minutes, and the experimental group was the fish, one with a shelter, seeing each other for five minutes. In our results, it was seen that the fish were less aggressive in the experimental group. The decreased aggressiveness could be because the shelter reduced the aggressiveness of the fish. However, it is more likely that the fish was less aggressive because the experimental trials took place after the controlll trials, so the fish was tired. The experiment was supposed to emulate a bettas response to another betta in the wild, but instead, it showed us how the display patterns might change overextended continuous period of aggression.

Introduction:
Betta splendins, also known as the Siamese fighting fish, can be very aggressive and territorial. The fish have various displays and movements that inform their opponent or possible mate of their state of aggression. The expression of territorial aggression is seen in a variety of ways ranging from patrolling behavior, chasing intruders to even physical combat. The different parts of a betta’s surroundings like food, mates, nesting sites and shelter can often alter their behavior depending on the scarceness of a resource [Lynn et al.: 2007]. To emulate competition for resources in the wild a shelter will be included in our experimental group to see how that affects the aggressiveness of the behavior of a male. The behavior of a male, i.e., how aggressive he is when defending his resources can be extrapolated to relate to how he completes for resources overall. A male that is aggressive and wins most encounters with other males is likely to have a higher fitness as he will attract more females that.  For example, a male that is not aggressive and therefore loses a potential mate to its competitor whose aggressive bright colored displays showed the potential mate that he is the best potential mate. If the male loses out on a mate because he was not aggressive enough then he has decreased his fitness, in comparison to the fish that won the mate. A betta males fitness is directly correlated to the aggressiveness of his displays when a female is present [Clotfelter et al: 2006]. Hypothetically the Betta male with the shelter is likely to be more aggressive as he has resources to lose, i.e. shelter. This is important to test so that we can get an idea of the effects of competition on betta males aggressive behavior. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment is purely for the observation of their aggressive behaviors. For overall safety and uniformity of the results the fish were separated via a glass barrier throughout the experiment.  This experiment will require two male betta fish in one tank split by two barriers, one translucent and one opaque. A shelter is needed a shelter for the latter part of the experiment. The dividers were removable so that they could be added and taken away as needed. The research took place in multiple timed sections. There were be six total trials: a trial consists of removing the opaque barrier so that the fish can see one another for 5 minutes. After each trial took place, there was a 5 minute rest period where the transparent wall was put back so they could not see each other. The second three tests took place with one of the fish having a shelter on its side. The shelter was a skull looking hollow item. We quantified aggression via four levels that are divided into broadside and facing displays. Whatever aggressive behavior took place one group member timed how long they saw the action, and the determined multiplier will multiply the response. The more aggressive behaviors have high multipliers, the rankings are in figure 2. Most of the behaviors are given in the name, except the Red Mane which is when the fish flares its operculae making its gills flare out giving it a pseudo 'mane'. The numbers next to each behavior correlate to the multiplier. One being slightly aggressive and three being extremely aggressive. A two-tailed 2 test will most likely be used to analyze this data. 

Results:
The outcome, as displayed in figure 1, is that the experimental group overall was aggressive for less time than the controlll group was, an average difference of 140 seconds. The difference between controlll and experimental in less aggressive behavior was only ~40 seconds, but the difference in more aggressive behavior was ~100 seconds. The standard deviation for the controlll group is 13 for less aggressive and 45 for more aggressive. In the experimental group, the standard deviation is 38 for less aggressive and 24 for more aggressive. The p values are .006613 which is statistically significent, and our t value was 5.17.

Discussion:
The male bettas were very aggressive with one another right away, showing multiple aggressive behaviors all at once and various times. Compared to the experimental group the controllls groups averages were all higher, but the pectoral. When the first experimental group trial was starting the fish had already been aggressive for ~460 seconds during the controlll period. In an experiment done that tested the metabolic costs of aggressive behavior, it was found that displays like the ‘Red Mane’ and Dorsal Fin Spreading have positively correlated with higher oxygen consumption [Castro et al.: 2006].Based on the betta's behavior, the decrease in aggressive behavior in the experimental group has less to do with the experimental variable and more to do with the experiments being right after one another. The fish being exasperated or over-taxed makes more sense than the presence of the shelter reducing aggressiveness. It is possible that the shelter added security to the betta’s section reducing how aggressive it behaved. To properly expand this experiment multiple controlll and experimental groups would need to form, and the tests between the two groups would need to separate by the rest period of a day. The outcome directly disagrees with the hypothesis. Attributing the issue to a flaw in the experimental design so that if it were to run again, the fish would have ample time to calm down and rest before the experimental tests occurred. Other experiments found that when the fish are given the option between food and a mirror, often the betta male would choose the food. This behavior is a good indicator that bettas would prefer a resource over aggressiveness [Hogan: 2004]. Although this counteracts the claim that the fish was more likely exhausted than less aggressive while shelter was present, it also shows that more testing should be done to gain a more definitive answer. A separate study found that a betta’s response to a constant stimulus decrement over time. That is to say that habituation may occur over short exposure to the same stimulus, similar to the exposure and results of this experiment [Peeke: 1970]. This experiment was supposed to show the significance of resource competition on betta fish aggression behavior. It ended up showing that the fish can only be very aggressive for a limited amount of time before the cost of the response is too high, or the fish is tired and cannot keep up the aggression for as long. Also moving into future experiments, it would be interesting to test that if there were no physical barrier in the experimental group if the fish would retreat to its shelter.  Perhaps the fish without a shelter would try to take the shelter; this would be a better gauge on how the scenario would play out in the wild.
