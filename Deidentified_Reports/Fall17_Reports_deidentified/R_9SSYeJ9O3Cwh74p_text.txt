Title: The effect of salinity on the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus spp. 

Abstract:
Metabolism is the sum of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells of an organism. Any internal process that requires energy will result in an increase in metabolic activity and consequently, a rise oxygen consumption. Fortunately, metabolic rate can be measured through oxygen consumption as it's directly proportional to the amount of energy expended. This experiment examines the relationship between environmental salinity and specific metabolic rate in Procambarus spp. These organisms have to maintain an ion concentration balance between their bodies and the environment. Therefore, if placed in a solution with high salinity, they will have to actively excrete ions to maintain equilibrium. This process requires energy, so we hypothesize that increasing the salinity of the water will increase the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus spp. compared to their specific metabolic rate in freshwater. First, the crayfish was placed in room temperature water that had been saturated with air, and the specific metabolic rate was determined over a 20 minute period. The same procedure was done, but with a 0.65% NaCl solution. Results showed that the mean specific metabolic rate in the saline solution was not statistically significant greater (p=0.30712). 




Introduction:
The following experiment examines metabolism and gas exchange in Procambarus spp. Metabolism is the sum total of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells of an organism [Johnson: 2017]. In a metabolic reaction, glucose is converted to energy in the form of ATP [Johnson: 2017]. Within glucose molecules, the carbon and oxygen atoms undergo a series of reactions forming carbon dioxide gas [Johnson: 2017]. Also, high-energy electrons are released and transferred to the electron transport system [Johnson: 2017]. As the electrons move throughout the electron transport system, they give up energy to generate high-energy ATP [Johnson: 2017]. Consequently, adding electrons will go to oxygen, and form water in the process [Johnson: 2017]. There are different ways to measure metabolism, but more efficient methods focus on oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. This is because oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended [Johnson: 2017]. 

In a similar experiment, the effects of salinity were tested on Daphnia magna metabolism [Garreta-Lara: 2017]. The scientists looked at metabolism through changes in the organism’s metabolites [Garreta-Lara: 2017]. Metabolites are the small molecules of metabolism, and are directly related to energy stress and metabolic pathways [Garreta-Lara: 2017]. The results of this experiment proved that increasing salinity affect the concentration of different metabolites in D. magna, specifically carbohydrates, fatty acids, organic acids, and amino acids [Garreta-Lara: 2017]. 

Procambarus spp. is a freshwater crustacean, also known as crayfish [Fitzgerald: 2006]. They are useful for this experiment because they contain internal gills, which are adaptations for gas exchange with water [Sadava: 2016]. Furthermore, because these organisms live in environments with extremely low osmotic concentration compared to their extracellular fluids, they face the challenges of hyper-osmoregulation [Bradley: 2010]. This means the crayfish must actively regulate the osmolarity of its extracellular fluids in terms of water gain and salt loss [Sadava: 2016]. The crayfish can tolerate a wide range of salinities, but it also costs metabolic energy to move ions across membranes to achieve osmotic regulation [Sadava: 2016]. If the organism is put into an environment with a higher concentration of Na and Cl ions, it will have to use their gills to actively excrete more ions to maintain an ion concentration balance between their bodies and the water. And since excretion is an active process, the metabolic rate and oxygen consumption will increase. This experiment will explore how an increase in the salinity of the environment will affect the specific metabolic rate of crayfish. We hypothesize that increasing the salinity of the water will raise the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus spp. compared to their specific metabolic rate in freshwater. 


Materials and Methods:
To begin, select three crayfish of similar size. Then, completely fill the screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air. The water is at room temperature, which roughly equates to 18 degrees Celsius. Place the glass chamber in a plastic dishpan filled with the same room temperature water. Weigh a crayfish, place it into the test chamber, and screw on the dissolved oxygen probe. Take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. At 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes, read the oxygen concentration again. After 20 minutes, determine the volume of water in the jar. Create a saline solution by adding 100 mL of 6.5% NaCl solution to 900 mL of the room temperature, oxygenated water. Pour this solution into a glass testing chamber and place the same crayfish in there. Again, take a baseline reading, as well as at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Also, measure the volume of water in the jar afterward. Repeat these steps with the other two crayfish. Calculate the specific metabolic rate by multiplying the change in O2 concentration in the water by the total volume of water in the jar (in liters). Then divide that number by time, multiplied by the weight of the respective crayfish. The results were analyzed with a two-sample t-test. The statistical test will be paired. All error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean. 


Results:
On average, the specific metabolic rate was higher when the crayfish were placed in a salinity solution compared to freshwater (Figure 1). For Crayfish 1, the specific metabolic rate was lower in the salinity solution over the 20-minute period. For Crayfish 2 and Crayfish 3, the specific metabolic rate was higher in the salinity solution. However, there was not a statistically significant difference. The paired, two-sample t-test showed a corresponding P-value of 0.30712, a resulting t-statistic of 1.358957, and the degrees of freedom was 2.0. 

Discussion:
To restate the hypothesis, increasing the salinity of water will raise the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus spp. compared to their specific metabolic rate in freshwater. Based on the results of the paired, two-sample t-test, the findings do not support the hypothesis. While two out of the three crayfish had a greater specific metabolic rate in the salinity solution, it was not statistically significant (p=0.30712). The outlier came from Crayfish 1, which surprisingly showed a drop in specific metabolic rate when placed in the salinity solution. While the drop in specific metabolic rate was less than 0.0005, it was enough to reject the hypothesis. A possibility for the drop in metabolism could be due to the O₂ concentration at the beginning. The concentration of oxygen molecules in the saline solution was higher than in freshwater. This was reverse for the other two crayfish because the solubility of dissolved oxygen decreased as salinity increases [MacArthur: 1915]. This lead to the possibility that maybe we did not mix the NaCl solution well enough, or that there was an error in the reading from the dissolved oxygen probe. Also, since there was more oxygen available, there is a possibility that the crayfish did not have to actively excrete more ions to maintain a balance between their extracellular fluid and the environment. 

The results of this experiment were surprising because other experiments have shown that salinity has a significant affect on metabolism, even more so than temperature and hypoxia [Garreta-Lara: 2017]. This experiment tested Daphnia magna, but they are similar to Procambarus spp in that they are both crustaceans and inhabit freshwater environments. The experiment found that occupying a salinity solution affects the concentration of metabolites of D. magna [Garreta-Lara: 2017]. Metabolites are related to respiration, energy stress, and cell osmoregulation metabolic pathways [Garreta-Lara: 2017]. Therefore, since more energy is being expended, this proved that metabolism increased [Garreta-Lara: 2017]. Going forward, our experiment could have been performed with more crayfish, giving us a wider variety of results. This could have allowed for the statistical test to show statistically significant results. In addition, we could have tested the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish at higher NaCl percentages in the solution. A more extreme salinity could have led to more active exertion of ions, and therefore a greater increase in metabolism.
