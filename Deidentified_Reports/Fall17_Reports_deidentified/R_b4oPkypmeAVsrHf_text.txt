Title: Observation of aggressive behaviors in male Betta splendens in the presence of another male with and without the stimulus of food

Abstract:
Male Betta splendens are known to be very aggressive, especially when in the presence of other male Betta splendens. These aggressive behaviors include tail flashing, red maning, and darting. The purpose of this study was to determine whether male Betta fish would change their aggression level in the presence of another male if the stimulus of food in the tank was added. In order to objectively quantify the behaviors of these fish, point values were assigned to each aggressive behavior, and the results found that the aggressive behaviors did decrease with the addition of the food stimulus. This is most likely due to the allocation of resources of these fish; it is more beneficial to the fish to take advantage of the available energy from food rather than expending more energy with the aggressive behaviors and forgoing the food. 

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior and the Betta splendens, or the siamese fighting fish, have intraspecific behavior. Broadside movements occur when a fish turns its side to an opponent and includes behaviors of pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing (Johnson). Facing movements also increase in aggressiveness, from facing opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading opercula, and protruding branchiostegal membranes (red mane). Other agonistic (aggressive) behaviors include raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, darkening skin, darting, biting and nipping (Johnson). A study by Yvonne Yau and Marc Potenza looked into the effect of food on eating behavior. Food is used in a reward system with animals, and when they eat food dopamine is released in the brain (Yau). Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that triggers pleasure impulses in the brain, and when those neurotransmitters are released the animals may be less likely to exhibit aggressive behaviors. We will be identifying the behaviors that we have found to be most common, and quantifying them to determine levels of aggression. We will be adding the independent variable of the presence of food in the tank in order to determine whether this added stimulus affects the levels of aggressive behavior in the betta fish. The biological alternate hypothesis is that he male Betta fish (Betta splendens) will be less aggressive towards each other while in the presence of food. 
Variables
In this experiment we will be studying the dependent variable of level of intensity of aggressive behaviors by manipulating the independent variables of presence of another male and presence of food. 


Materials and Methods:
Materials
You will need 4 male betta fish, normal betta fish food, and a tank with 3 separate compartments and 2 glass and 2 opaque partitions. 
Methods
Place two male betta fish in a tank. One fish will remain through each trial and will not be observed for behaviors, and the other will be removed and replaced after each trial and its behaviors will be analyzed. Keep them separated to allow them to habituate to the water and then remove the partitions. For five minutes, record the behaviors of pectoral fin flickering, tail flashing, red maning, and darting when the fish is isolated and cannot see the other male Betta fish. Next, remove the opaque partition so that the fish are able to see each other through the glass.  For five minutes, observe and record for the same behaviors in the fish and record the aggressive behaviors. Replace partitions and allow five minutes of rest time to prevent habituation. Now, remove the opaque partition again (the glass stays in place) and place regular pet fish food on the side of the fish whose behaviors you are observing. Observe for five minutes and record aggressiveness of behaviors. Remove the fish that you have been observing and remove any remaining fish food from the tank. Replace with another male Betta fish and repeat all procedures. Repeat everything again to have 3 trials with 3 different male Betta fish being observed. 
In order to determine a level of aggression in the fish, each of the four behaviors that are being observed have been given a point value that increases in order of how aggressive the behaviors are. Pelvic fin flickering receives one point, tail flashing receives two, red maning three, and darting four. Multiply the point values by the frequency of behaviors to give each fish a point value for each of the three situations. To analyze behaviors a paired T-test will be used because we are analyzing different populations for multiple different behaviors, and therefore several behaviors need to be quantified for each of the three male fish. 


Results:
The results of this experiment were that the three fish received aggression scores of 8, 4, and 0 with no stimulus, 46, 16, and 23 with the stimulus of seeing the other fish, and 7, 8, and 0 when they could see the other fish but had the additional stimulus of food. 

The P value from the paired T test is 0.121. 


Discussion:
The results from this experiment supported the hypothesis that the fish would become more aggressive when they could see each other through the glass, but those aggressive behaviors would reside if food was also introduced. The P value is 0.121, which means that the differences between the levels of aggression with food and without was not statistically significant. However, the results did show a trend that the food stimulus decreased aggressive behavior. In a study conducted by Sofyan Alyan, it was found that male betta fish are equally aggressive when they are shown another male through a glass divider whether they knew the fish previously or not. This shows that male betta fish are inherently aggressive and territorial and will exhibit aggressive behaviors when in the presence of another male betta fish. This in addition to the evidence from Yau’s study about the neurochemical components of fish eating behavior show that there is strong evidence for the hypothesis.
