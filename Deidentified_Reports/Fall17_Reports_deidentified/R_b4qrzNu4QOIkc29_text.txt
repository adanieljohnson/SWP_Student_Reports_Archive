Title: Differences in metabolic rate for Procambris spp. while in varying temperatures of water

Abstract:
In this experiment, we worked with Procambris spp. and measured each of their specific metabolic rates by using different water temperatures. We used room temperature water (22C) and cooler water (10C) to see how the difference in temperature would affect the metabolic rates of Procambris spp. where we used a testing chamber and a probe to measure the dissolved oxygen. For our experimental group, we placed the testing chamber into an incubator filled with ice to keep the temperature constant. We believed that the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. would decrease if the temperature of water decreased. However, our hypothesis was not supported because Procambris spp. that was in the cooler water actually had an increase in their metabolic rate. Our experiment had 2 degrees of freedom, a t-value of 8.1362 and a p_value of 0.0148.


Introduction:
In this experiment, we used crayfish, Procambris spp., to measure the specific metabolic rate of them. We used a various group of crayfish for this experiment because they are easy to calculate oxygen consumption with which makes noticeable changes on the probe machine. The amount of energy produced by breaking down glucose is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen consumed and the amount of carbon dioxide excreted [Johnson 2017]. Metabolic rate is the process where energy and materials are transformed within an organism and then exchanged between the organism and its environment [Gillooly 2001]. We measured each Procambris spp. metabolic rate in two different temperatures which included room temperature (22C) and cooler water (10C). We wanted to know how lower temperatures will impact the specific metabolic rate of each Procambris spp. We believed that the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. will decrease if the water temperature decreases.


Materials and Method:
We first weighed each Procambris spp. then filled up a screw top glass testing chamber with room temperature water (22C) and then placed Procambris into the testing chamber. Then we placed the entire tank set-up into a dishpan filled with room temperature water. Next we inserted the oxygen probe into the top of the testing chamber which measures the dissolved oxygen concentration. Turn on the oxygen probe machine to stabilize readings and take a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Every 5 minutes, another dissolved oxygen concentration reading should be conducted and recorded for a total of 20 minutes. Once the 20 minutes has elapsed, record the dissolved oxygen concentration and remove the probe from the testing chamber. To measure the volume of water that was in the testing chamber, pour the water through a funnel and into a graduated cylinder and record the volume. After all the data has been recorded, repeat these method for all 3 Procambris spp. Then, for the experimental group, we filled up the screw top glass testing chamber with room temperature water and then placed the testing chamber into a incubator full of cooler water (10C). Wait two minutes for the Procambris spp. to get acclimated to the difference in water temperature. We repeated all of the same method as we did for the controlll group that was in room temperature water. Once all the data was gathered, we used a statistical test in of a bar graph to show our data for both the controlll and experimental group with two degrees of freedom to show the results. 


Results:

The test that we conducted for this experiment was on finding the amount of oxygen consumed by each Procambris spp. and then calculating the specific metabolic rate for each. In the controlll group, controlll 1 had a specific metabolic rate of 0.00087, controlll 2 was at 0.0021 and controlll 3 was at 0.0011. The standard deviation between the controlll group was 0.00065. In the experimental group, experimental 1 had a specific metabolic rate of 0.0045, experimental 2 was at 0.0077 and experimental 3 was at 0.0061. The standard deviation between the experimental group was 0.0016. From Figure 1, you can tell how the controlll group had a smaller metabolic rate than the experimental group did. Each Procambris spp. had a larger specific metabolic rate than the controlll group had. From our data we were able to find the mean, degrees of freedom, t_statistic and the p_value. The mean of the controlll group was 0.0014 and the mean for the experimental group was 0.018. The degrees of freedom were at the value of 2, the p_value was 0.0148 and the t_statistic value was at 8.14.


Discussion:
For this experiment we were able to find the specific metabolic for both the experimental and controlll group by using a dissolved oxygen probe that was hooked up to a dissolved oxygen reader. We believed that the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris spp. would decrease as the water temperature decreased because usually as the water temperature rises, an ectotherm’s body temperature and metabolic rate rise making the water breathers need more O2 as the water gets warmer [Sadava 2017]. However, from our findings in this experiment, we can say that our results did not support our hypothesis. We found that the experimental group actually had a higher specific metabolic rate. The sudden decrease in temperature caused the stress levels of Procambris spp. to increase. The increase in stress level in the experimental group may have caused the oxygen consumption to increase thus, causing the specific metabolic rate to increase as well. A possible source of error that came about was the fact that we may have not given each Procambris spp. a sufficient amount of time to adapt to the cooler water temperature. In another experiment in measuring oxygen consumption, the people that conducted the experiment gave each crayfish twenty to thirty minutes to let the animal adjust to the different temperature in water [Wiens 1961]. This extra time could have been useful and could have made our data change due to the fact that Procambris spp. could have potential have time to adapt to the difference in water temperature. It could have also possibly changed our results if we gave them this extra time. Also, having a larger group of Procambris spp. would have made our results more conclusive since we would have had more specific metabolic rates to discuss. However, our results were significent with our p_value being at 0.0148.

Figure Legends: 
This figure represents the specific metabolic rate of the three Procambris spp. that was measured for both the controlll and experimental group. The error bars show the standard deviation for each group. For the controlll group the standard deviation was 0.00065 and the mean value was 0.0014. For the experimental group the standard deviation was 0.0016 and the mean was 0.018. Our experiment had 2 degrees of freedom, a t-value of 8.1362 and a p_value of 0.0148.
