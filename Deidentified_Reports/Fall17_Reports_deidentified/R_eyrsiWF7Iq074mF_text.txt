Title: The effects of manipulating pH on photosynthetic rates in C3 and C4 plants

Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to sufficiently explain our experiment in which we measured the differences in photosynthetic rates among C3 plants (Spinacia oleraca) and C4 plants (Sorghum halepense) when each is mixed with water and 5M NaCl. The purpose of this study was to obtain a better understanding of the photosynthetic rates of C3 and C4 plants and the effects of manipulating each with different pH-based solutions which can pertain to the acidic solutions used on specific agricultural plant types. In this experiment, the effects of using NaCl as opposed to water on C3 and C4 plants were measured and evaluated through the observation of change in photosynthetic rates. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis is a crucial process for sustaining life, and a slight change in rate can significently alter multiple characteristics of the plant. Based on past experiments, our group hypothesized that the C3 plant with NaCl would have the highest photosynthetic rate [Wang: 2012]. The data recorded for the average absorbances showed that C3 plants with NaCl had the largest decrease in absorbance, depicting a higher rate of photosynthesis and supporting our hypothesis. From our results, we have a better

Introduction:
Through photosynthesis, plants store energy from the sun in the form of chemical energy in covalent bonds, oxidation-reduction potential, and an electrical/chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer. The stored energy is released by glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm, and respiration, which occurs in the mitochondria. Environmental factors can alter photosynthetic rates, which can significently affect the plant’s growth. In our experiment, our group tested the difference in the photosynthetic rates of a C3 plant and a C4 plant with water and NaCl each. The plants used for our C3 plant samples were spinach leaves (Spinacia oleraca) while the plants used for our C4 plant samples were grass blades (Sorghum halepense). A C4 plant cycles carbon dioxide into 4-carbon sugar compounds which enter the Calvin Cycle. A C3 plant cycles carbon dioxide into 3-carbon sugar compounds. We mixed each with either water or salt to find the best conditions for photosynthetic rate, which can be important in creating the best conditions for specific plants in labs or agriculture.

Materials and Method:
This experiment was performed by evaluating four leaves of spinach (Spinacia oleraca) and six blades of grass (Sorghum halepense), along with measuring the change in photosynthetic rate of each when saturates with water and 5M NaCl. In which, we began by cooling our containers and mortar and pestle in order to achieve a common temperature. We proceeded to remove the large central veins from four spinach leaves and obtained six blades of grass. Each group of plant leaves were placed in respective mortars along with 10 Ml of cold 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer. Each mixture was grinded to a thick, green paste. We added an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer to each and strained the slush-like paste through a cheese cloth into a beaker. After the resulting liquid was obtained, we transferred 200 l of each to microtubes labeled “A” and “B” respectively. The remaining liquids were transferred to separate 50 Ml centrifuge tubes labeled “A” and “B” and were spun in the centrifuge at 200x the force of gravity. Once finished, we poured the supernatants into two other 50 Ml centrifuge tubes and labeled each. 200 l were obtained from each and placed in 200 l microtubes. An additional 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to “Sample B,” from which we transferred 200 l of the pellet into a microtube labeled “B-pellet” and put on ice. We placed 10 l aliquots of each “B-pellet” derived from each mixture onto a hemocytometer and examined each to count the amount of random debris and relative number of chloroplasts present. To calculate the number of cells per milliliter of cell suspension, we used the equation, Cell Density =  x  = ______ cells/Ml. To measure the rate of photosynthesis in each solution, we measured the absorbance of thirteen solutions after zero minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes of exposure to light. One solution served as the blank, containing no chloroplasts, 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM of phosphate with a pH of 6.5). Three of the solutions included 100 microliters of C3 plant chloroplasts, 6 Ml of NaCl, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Three more solutions included 100 microliters of C3 plant chloroplasts, 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Three additional solutions included 100 microliters of C4 plant chloroplasts, 6 Ml of NaCl, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. The final set of three included 100 microliters of C4 plant chloroplasts, 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Each tube was mixed and placed under light for the duration of the experiment. To measure absorbance, we blanked (A = 0.0) a spectrophotometer with the blank solution and measured each absorbance at 600 nm. A table was used to record the measured absorbances, from which we obtained a graph displaying the linear progression of each set throughout the experiment.

Results:
Figure 1 represents the linear progression of average absorbances of each solution as time intervals 0 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. The average absorbances for C4 with water progressed from 0.587 A, to 0.589 A, to 0.546 A, to 0.543 A. The average absorbances for C4 with NaCl progressed from 0.566 A, to 0.552 A, to 0.538 A, to 0.530 A. The average absorbances for C3 with water progressed from 0.526 A, to 0.448 A, to 0.380 A, to 0.335 A. The average absorbances for C3 with NaCl progressed from 0.449 A, to 0.409 A, to 0.348 A, to 0.283 A.

Tables 1 and 2 represent the chloroplast densities of both the C3 and C4 plants.

Discussion:
The results of our experiment supported our hypothesis, showing a higher absorbance in C4 plants (Sorghum halepense) mixed with water. Our group found that C3 plants (Spinacea oleraca) had the highest density of chloroplasts (6.5 chloroplasts) as opposed to our C4 plants (2 chloroplasts). Using these recorded densities, our group found that after the duration of our experiment (30 minutes in light), our C4 plant mixed with water showed the highest absorbance among all of our solutions with an average final absorbance of 0.543 A, and our C3 plant mixed with NaCl displayed the lowest absorbances of our solutions with an average final absorbance of 0.283 A. The solutions decreased in absorbances as follows, C4 plants with water (0.543 average final absorbance), C4 plants with NaCl (0.530 average final absorbance), C3 plants with water (0.335 average final absorbance), and C3 plants with NaCl (0.283 average final absorbance). From these results, our group found that the greater the decrease in absorbance, the higher the photosynthetic rate [Deering: 2007]. Our C3 plant solution with salt had an initial average absorbance of 0.499 A and proceeded to decrease to an average absorbance of 0.283 A. This difference in absorbance was greatest among our experiment, showing that C3 with NaCl had the highest photosynthetic rate. Also, previous studies have allowed us to observe similar results when comparing the majority of C3 and C4 plants, with many holding an objective to engineer C4 plants into C3 plants as a way to increase photosynthesis in agriculture [Wang: 2012]. This experiment allowed us to better understand the effects of different pH solutions on different types of plants’ photosynthetic rates. Future directions for this experiment could be the examination of which plants work best with what environmental and pH conditions, from which we could understand the appropriate geographical settings for each specific plant.
