Title: The effect of the achytocolinesterae inhibitor, sevin, on muscular contractions of anura legs: application of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor results in higher amplitude and relaxation period

Abstract:
This experiment looks at how an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor affects the amplitude and the relaxation periods of a muscular contraction.  In synaptic transmission, when acetylcholine is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors in the postsynaptic nerve, it causes muscle contractions to occur.  The contractions continue until acetylcholinesterase is released causing the gated receptors to close. To test this, we used three frog legs, each acting as their own experimental and controlll group. The frog legs were injected with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Sevin.  While my group hypothesized that acetylcholinesterase inhibitor would lengthen the muscle contraction and the relaxation periods, our finding did not support this.  The statistical tests run in this experiment deemed our results to be extremely insignificent causing us to have to rely on and compare our findings to that of other researchers. The data from this specific experiment is inconclusive, but based on experiments run by others with more significent results it can be concluded that effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on the muscle is in support of our original hypothesis. 


Introduction:
The aim of the experiment is to see how acetylcholinesterase affects neuromuscular controlll in the leg of a frog. It is important to note that one function of the neuromuscular system is nerves causing the muscle to contract.  This is known as excitation contraction coupling and the process begins with an action potential traveling along the axon to the neuromuscular junction, leading to depolarization. The depolarization at the neuromuscular junction is what allows the acetylcholine  to be released. The acetylcholine is diffused to the receptors on muscle fibers, opening the sodium channels that generate action potential in the muscle fibers. The action potential from this spreads and stimulates the release of calcium from the internal storage sites. The calcium release is important as it is what activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber.  Following this, myosin filaments use energy from ATP to make the entire myofiber shorten. This process ends with the reuptake of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing the muscle fibers to return to relaxation.  The contraction and relaxation periods described above are difficult to study on a microscale, however it can be studied at a macroscale by looking at how a  whole muscle or nerve reacts, instead of trying to look at the individual fibers [Johnson 2016]. This is one reason a frog leg was chosen as our organism for this experiment. Another reason a frog leg was chosen was because its size is easy to manipulate and see reactions by simply using the human eye. The experimental group in this experiment is injected with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor known as sevin.  This will inhibit the acetylcholinesterase from breaking down into acetylcholine and therefore increase the duration of the action of the neurotransmitter. In a study conducted by researcher Trinkaus, et al., Acetylcholine-associated collagen Q, a tail subunit of acetylcholinesterase,  was found to be important in the activation in of the calcium signaling in rat skeletal muscles. This study revealed that the longer the collagen Q was present, the shorter the contraction was, while if collagen Q was inhibited, the muscle contraction would lengthen [Trinkaus 2008]. Due to these findings it is expected that the acetylcholine esterase is necessary to end the muscular contractions in an organism.  While this particular experiment was conducted on rats and not frog legs, as are being tested in this study, the Ach and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor are expected to behave in a similar manner.  The three phases of muscle contraction, the latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period will all be affected by this process.  Our group hypothesis states that after the frog legs are treated with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, the leg muscle contractions will have a higher voltage and be continuous. It will cause the contraction period to lengthen and the relaxation period to lengthen as well, while having no effect on the latent period.  This will happen due to the fact that there will be no more acetylcholinesterase. The acetylcholine will continue to bind to its receptor in the synapse causing the signal in the neuromuscular junction to last a lot longer than it should.  Our null hypothesis states that the addition of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on the frog legs will not have any impact on the voltage of the muscle contractions. 


Materials and Method:
The procedure conducted for this experiment began with the preparation of the frog leg. The leg was placed in a dissecting tray and the skin of removed. Then, forceps were used to separate the upper thigh thus revealing the sciatic nerve.  Following this the gastrocnemus muscle is detached from the bone and hung by a string from the force transducer.  The software is setup on a computer to receive the results shown by the force transducer on the frog leg.  In order to attain accurate results, a probe must be properly connected to the sciatic nerve with the nerve touching both metal wires.  The software is then able to track the contraction and resting periods with a constant of one volt and a frequency of one Hz used. The amplitude of the contraction time is measured. The preceding measurements are taken a total of five times and then the frog leg is injected with one cc of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 2% solution of Sevin, with a syringe. After the injection of the inhibitor, wait five minutes to allow the inhibitor to stabilize within the muscle.  The same software with the same voltage and frequency is run and the amplitude is measured four more times for a total of five trials. In between each trial, it is necessary to wait one minute in attempt to minimize the fatigue of the frog leg. Repeat all of the above steps with the other 2 frog legs.  It is important to note that this experiment was run on three frog legs and each leg had a total of ten trials run on it.  Each frog leg acted as its own controlll and experimental condition with five trials run on the leg during its respective condition. Once the experiment was completed, a paired t_test was run and the p_value found to determine the reliability of our findings. 


Results:
When the experiment was run on the frog legs, the initial threshold chosen did not cause a contraction to occur in some trials, requiring the use of different thresholds. No general trend was noticeable as the data fluctuated revealing some experimental trials that were longer than the controlll and some that were shorter. The statistical test run was a paired t_test. The statistics for the controlll and treatment amplitudes from this test showed a degree of freedom at 4, T-value of  0.532088, and a P-value of 0.622846. However, the results of the statistical test for the controlll and treatment relaxation period showed a degree of freedom at 4, a T-value of 0.164522, and the P-value of 0.877299
.
The charts below compare the average of the amplitude and the average relaxation periods of the controlll legs in relation to their experimental groups counterparts.  Figure 1 shows that the average amplitude of the controlll was higher than the average amplitude of the experimental. Figure 2 on the other hand shows that the relaxation period was longer for experimental group instead of the controlll group. 


Discussion:
The data collected during this experiment appears to not support our original hypothesis. In all cases the amplitude went down, but the relaxation period was inconsistent.  While in some cases the length of time went up, supporting our hypothesis, other trials showed the time decreases.  Due to the variability in our results, they do not directly support our hypothesis. Based on the charts above, figure 1 goes against what we hypothesized while figure two supports our original hypothesis.  In order to truly understand the impact of our results more data would need to be collected to attempt to establish a trustworthy trend in the data. It is not clear why our results came out the way they did. In statistical tests, if the P-value is below 0.05 then the results are considered to be significent. Since the P-values from our test were both well over this number, the results in this study were deemed insignificent. Due to this it is important to look at the results found in other experiments that held more significance to see if they support our hypothesis.  In research conducted by Petrov et al. a novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor C-547 which works in a manner comparable to the sevin in our study.  The experiment showed an increase in the amplitude and an increase in the time of the contraction of extensor Digitorum Longus, Soleus and Diaphragm Muscles in a rat skeleton [Petrov 2006]. These findings support our hypothesis, unlike our results. Since the results from the Petrov et al study and the Trinkaus study (mentioned in the introduction) are in agreement, it can be assumed that something went wrong in our experiment. If we were given the chance to run this experiment again we would set a higher threshold, so the amplitude and relaxation times will not been as inconsistent even as the frog leg fatigues. Also, we would need to run the experiment on a larger sample size with more trials to have more data to compare.  Another way we could improve our experiment is by leaving a longer resting period in between the trials to avoid the frog leg reaching a point of fatigue too fast. Research looking into how acetylcholinesterase inhibitors affect muscle contraction are critical to understanding some problems in the real world. One example of this is in a study from Mimori that looked at acetylcholinesterase in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. When an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was applied to patients with Alzheimer’s they acted in ways that were abnormal when compared to how acetylcholine functioned in a healthy brain (Mimori 1995).  If we can grasp a better understanding of how acetylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors affect muscular controlll, it may be possible to find ways to slow down the onset of certain diseases or eradicate them completely.
