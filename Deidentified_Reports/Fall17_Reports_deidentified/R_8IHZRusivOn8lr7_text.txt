Title: Pollution of air-saturated water with agricultural waste shows a decrease in the specific metabolic rate of Procamburus sp. 

Abstract:
	The amount of oxygen used by an organism is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended during its physiological processes. Specific metabolic rate (SMR) is the amount of oxygen consumed by an organism per gram of body mass per unit time. Environmental conditions can have an impact on an organism’s SMR. The goal of this experiment was to test the effects of pollution on the SMR’s of crayfish, Procamburus sp. It was hypothesized that the SMR’s of crayfish would increase in a polluted environment to fight off contamination. To test this, crayfish were placed in a chamber filled with 1000mL of air-saturated water, and the experimental group was placed in a chamber filled with 100mL of an agricultural waste solution diluted in 900mL of air-saturated water. Oxygen concentrations were recorded every 5 minutes for 20 minutes; SMR’s for both groups was then calculated. A two sample t-test determined that the results were not significant due to a P-value of 0.152 above the significance level (P>0.05). The SMR’s of the crayfish decreased with the addition of agricultural waste. The results of this experiment were attributed to the short term exposure and the type and/or concentration of the pollutant used.  

Introduction:
	When high energy molecules are converted to those with low energy, energy is released in the form of ATP; this is transferred within the cells of an organism in a process known as metabolism. The amount of ATP used by all of an organism’s physiological processes at any time is referred to as metabolic rate. It is important that the amount of energy expended is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen used. The amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass per unit time is known as specific metabolic rate (SMR). 
	It is known that there are environmental conditions that can affect an organism’s SMR. A 2001 experiment studied the metabolic effects of element-polluted (coal-ash) habitats on crayfish (Procamburus acutus) over twenty-seven days. It was observed that the SMR’s were approximately 30% greater in populations that were exposed to the contaminants. These results were attributed to the need for crayfish to increase their energy expenditure to fight off contaminants in their environment [Rowe et al.: 2001]
	In this experiment, the Procamburus sp. is used as a model organism because of its ability to breathe dissolved oxygen through its gills and its sensitivity to toxic material in its surrounding environment.  The goal of this experiment is to test the effects of agricultural waste pollution on the specific metabolic rates of the Procamburus sp. It is hypothesized that the presence of agricultural waste will contribute to a significant increase in the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to test the effects of agricultural waste pollution, we measured the SMR’s of a population of crayfish. For this experiment, three crayfish acted as both the control and the experimental groups. 
	Three crayfish of relatively the same large size were obtained; each was weighed. A crayfish was placed in a testing chamber filled with air-saturated water, which was placed in a water bath at room temperature (22°C). A dissolved oxygen probe was placed in the chamber to read levels of oxygen concentration every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. The volume of the air-saturated water was then measured at the end of the time period. 
	After measuring the oxygen concentration for the control group, 100mL of agricultural waste was diluted in 900mL of air-saturated water to create a polluted environment for the experimental group. Oxygen concentrations were measured at the same time intervals as previously stated. This process was then repeated for the two remaining crayfish. 
	In order to calculate specific metabolic rate, the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass per unit time was measured for both the control and the experimental groups. To evaluate the SMR’s of both groups, a two sample t-test was performed. 

Results:
	Figure 1 represents the comparison of the average specific metabolic rate of crayfish populations before and after the pollution of 900mL of air-saturated water with 100mL of agricultural waste. When the crayfish spent 20 minutes in unpolluted water had a mean SMR of 0.0016 ± 0.00039 mg O₂ g⁻¹ hr⁻¹. The mean SMR of the crayfish with the addition of 100mL of agricultural waste to their water was 0.0012 ± 0.00021 mg O₂ g⁻¹ hr⁻¹. The SMR of each crayfish decreased with the addition of agricultural waste to their environment. Based on the data, the mean SMR of the control group was greater than that of the experimental (t-value= 1.77, degrees of freedom = 4, P-value = 0.152)

Discussion:
	The results of this experiment do not support our hypothesis that specific metabolic rate of crayfish (Procamburus sp.) would increase with the presence of agricultural waste in their surrounding environment. The P-value determined from the two sample t-test (P-value = 0.152) is above the significance level (P>0.05), therefore the results were not significant. 
	The 2001 experiment of the effects of coal-ash pollution in the environment of the Procamburus acutus’ environment showed an approximately 30% increase in the SMR’s of their experimental group, which was attributed to the increased need for energy to combat pollutants. 
	The unexpected results of our experiment can be attributed to the short term exposure of the crayfish to the agricultural waste; sensing pollutants in the environment could have caused the decrease in the amount of oxygen consumed by the crayfish. Explanations for the differing results between this experiment and the 2001 experiment may include: the types and concentrations of the pollutants in the crayfish’s environment and the difference in exposure time (chronic versus short term). 
	Due to the unexpected results of this experiment, further experimentation of the effects of pollution on the specific metabolic rate of organisms can aid in regulating environmental waste contamination in aquatic environments for the preservation of populations.
