Title: Effect of Salt Concentration of Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
Studies have shown a decrease in overall health of the plant based on increased soil salinity, but data are inconclusive regarding the direct impact of sodium ions on the rate of photosynthesis. We hypothesized that increased concentrations of NaCl would decrease the rate of photosynthesis in chloroplasts from Spinacia oleraca. DCPIP was used as the reduced substrate because its color change can be measured using a spectrophotometer to determine the relative rate of photosynthesis. Two 2-sample T-tests were used to compare absorbances of groups affected by salinity to the controlll group, with an alpha value of 0.05 considered to be significent. The T-test between the 0μM and 250μM NaCl group resulted in an alpha value of 0.101, and the T-test between the 0μM and 500μM NaCl group resulted in an alpha value of 0.0357. The data do not support our hypothesis, supporting that 500μM NaCl significently increases the rate of photosynthesis. Rate increased as a result of the medium supporting the necessary sodium concentration needed for photosynthesis to be maximally efficient. Furthermore, salt tolerance varies by species, so the experiment could be improved by increasing the concentrations of NaCl used to more accurately represent salt stress. 

Introduction:
All organisms, in some method, get their energy from the sun. Regardless of whether or not the organism directly uses photosynthesis or consumes other organisms as their energy source, the energy used to fuel an organism’s daily functions comes from photosynthesis. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, beginning with light-dependent reactions in the thylakoid membrane. During photosynthesis, electrons from chlorophyll pigments in photosystem II of a chloroplast are energized using the radiation from the sun, and, as the electrons travel down an electron transport chain, protons are pumped into the thylakoid space, producing a proton gradient [Johnson: 2018]. This chemical energy is then used to reduce a molecule known as NADP+ to NADPH. This process produces very little usable energy on its own; however, coupled with the light-independent reactions, enough energy is made to support the organism. During the light-independent reactions, carbon dioxide is fixed to a pre-existing five carbon sugar, and the reducing power of NADPH is used to create glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate [Johnson: 2018]. This carbohydrate can then be used in the organism as a form of energy once it is oxidized through the process of cellular respiration. Photosynthesis is dependent on factors of the external and internal environment of a plant being within normal limits. These factors include concentration of ions like sodium [Rasmuson: 2002]. 
Furthermore, agricultural production hinges on efficient growing practices, including management of soil content. Salt stress is on the forefront of farmer’s minds, making sure that concentrations of salt are not high enough to damage or kill their plants is important to produce healthy and fruitful crops. More than half of the world’s cultivated and irrigated lands are affected by salt stress due to increased soil salinity concentrations [Sudhir: 2004]. Plants grown in environments with high salt concentrations display yellowing leaves and reduced overall growth. Current research in this field is inconclusive as to whether salt stress directly impacts the rate or efficiency of photosynthesis. Many studies report a decrease in photosynthetic activity as a result of decreased leaf area, or other factors stemming from the overall decreased health of the plant [Rasmuson: 2002]. Furthermore, structural studies of plants have displayed that some amount of sodium ions are necessary for proper functioning. 
When chloroplasts from Spinacia oleraca are subjected to high concentrations of sodium chloride, we predict that the photosynthetic activity will decrease. Spinacia oleraca, commonly referred to as spinach, was chosen for this experiment due to its use in agriculture. In recent years, spinach has become increasingly popular due to its high vitamin content, making it a readily available, and relatively inexpensive, test organism. Furthermore, it is regarded as a hardy vegetable, so many of the necessary chloroplasts would still be functioning when the spinach leaves were ready to be used [“Spinach”: 2016]. 

Materials and Method:
The central veins of five spinach leaves were removed and the leaves washed and added to a mortar and pestle. 10Ml of grinding buffer and the mortar and pestle were used to create a spinach slurry free of large chunks of spinach. Another 10Ml of grinding buffer was added to the mixture, which was then strained through cheesecloth. The resulting fluid was then centrifuged for 3 minutes at 200G, 1200 rotations per minute. The supernatant was decanted and then centrifuged again for 10 minutes at 1000G, 2800 rotations per minute. Again, the supernatant was decanted and the pellet was resuspended using 20Ml of grinding buffer. The resuspended pellet mixture was then used for the rest of the experiment as a solution of chloroplasts. An assay was then completed, using three test groups and a positive and negative controlll. A blank was created for the spectrophotometer using 8Ml of distilled water, 2Ml of buffer and 100μl of chloroplast solution. All of the test groups had 5Ml of distilled water, 2Ml of DCPIP, 2Ml of reaction buffer, 100μl of chloroplasts, and 1Ml of either distilled water, 250μM or 500μM NaCl solution. DCPIP was used as the reduced substrate of photosynthesis based on its color change upon reduction. The reaction mixtures were then transferred to cuvettes, and initial absorbances using a spectrophotometer were taken at 600nm. The cuvettes were then placed under a lamp, and absorbances were recorded every 10 minutes for 20 minutes. Two 2-sample t_tests were used to determine significance, with an alpha value of 0.05 determining significance. Each test was ran using either the 250μM or 500μM salinity groups against the 0μM salinity group, using the 20 minute data. 

Results:
The mean absorbances for the 0μM group at time zero, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes were 0.283, 0.141, and 0.060 respectively. After 10 minutes, there was a percent change of 50.2%, and after 20 minutes, there was a percent change of 78.8%. The mean absorbances for the 250μM group at time zero, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes were 0.264, 0.122, and 0.046.  After 10 minutes, there was a percent change of 53.7%, and after 20 minutes, there was a percent change of 82.6%. The mean absorbances for the 0μM group at time zero, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes were 0.256, 0.099, 0.031. After 10 minutes, there was a percent change of 61.3%, and after 20 minutes there was a percent change of 87.9%. Each test group had an overall downward trend, with absorbances decreasing over time. However, starting at time zero, both the 250μM and 500μM NaCl solution groups had lower absorbances than the controlll group. The T-test between the 0μM NaCl group and 250μM NaCl group resulted in an alpha value of 0.101, and the T-test between the 0μM NaCl group and 500μM NaCl group resulted in an alpha value of 0.0357. 

Discussion:
The data do not support our hypothesis that increased concentrations of salt decrease the photosynthetic rate of Spinacia oleraca. Absorbances measured for the 250μM NaCl group were not significently different from the 0μM NaCl group; however, absorbances measure for the 500μM NaCl group were significent different. This significance was not in the predicted direction. Because absorbances were significently lower, more DCPIP was reduced, turning the solution a lighter blue than originally measured. This indicates that the photosynthetic rate was significently increased, as compared to the controlll group. 
Our hypothesis was based off of the negative effects of salt stress on agricultural plants, such as spinach. Increased soil salinity negatively impacts agricultural efficiency, and plants grown in such conditions have less biomass and decreased leaf area [Rasmuson: 2002]. Increased concentrations of soil salinity increase sodium ion concentrations throughout the plant, so many plants have developed mechanisms in order to combat increased sodium ion uptake from soils that are saturated. Based on known mechanisms to pump sodium ions into or out of the cell, scientists know that plants must sense and regulate the amount of sodium that they take up, but they are unsure of the mechanism that controllls this process [Maathuis: 2013]. Stefanov et al reports that high salt concentrations have a significent effect on photosystem 2, decreasing activity [2016]. However, they also report that the term “high salt concentration” is subjective based on the species being studied and their normal environment. Marine plants can tolerate much higher salt concentrations than freshwater plants [Stefanov: 2016]. 
This could explain why the data do not support our hypothesis. Salt concentrations of 250μM or 500μM could be insufficient at produce salt stress in spinach plants in order to decrease photosynthetic rate. Sodium chloride is also necessary in plants for photosynthesis to be maximally efficient; concentration of chlorophyll actually decreases in chloroplasts in sodium deficient medium [Sudhir: 2004]. Since the controlll group was not exposed to sodium ions, their photosynthetic rate should be decreased, as compared to groups that were exposed to sodium ions. This explains the decreased absorption and increased photosynthetic rate for the 250μM and 500μM NaCl groups. 
Moving forward, this hypothesis should be retested in order to determine whether or not salt stress significently decreases the rate of photosynthesis for spinach plants. This should be done by using salt concentrations much in excess of what was used in this experiment. If possible, a larger sample size should be used in order to eliminate any possible outliers. Though the data was fairly concise throughout the experiment, the second cuvette for the 500μM group was noticeable lighter than others for the same group and, thus, measured lower absorbances. 
Feeding the growing population is on the minds of just about every global aid worker. In order to do so, more efficient growing practices would be necessary. When growing nutrient rich foods, relative salt tolerances for many species could be compared to determine the best location to grow a specific species or how much money would be necessary in order to closely monitor soil salinity for salt intolerant species. This could lead to better land management and increased crop yields based on the creation of more efficient agricultural practices that would feed a larger percentage of the world population. Furthermore, this could lead to the use of lands that were previously assumed to be inhospitable to growing practices due to high soil salinity.
