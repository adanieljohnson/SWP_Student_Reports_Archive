Title: Examining the effect of lidocaine on muscle twitch via electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve in frog gastrocnemus

Abstract:
Lidocaine is widely used in the medical field as a numbing agent. On a more molecular level, lidocaine blocks sodium channels, which are required for generating action potentials in muscle cells. The hypothesis for this experiment is, that when treated with lidocaine, a muscle will require a higher electrical pulse to trigger contracting (i.e. a higher twitch threshold) versus an untreated leg. This occurrence is due to limited firing of action potentials affected by reduced flow of sodium into the cell. We tested this hypothesis on the gastrocnemus of a frog.

We isolated the sciatic nerve and calf muscle from the rest of the tissue in the frog leg, and stimulated the sciatic nerve with electrical impulses to cause the muscle to twitch. The voltage produced by each twitch along with the pulse amplitude required to initially get the muscle to twitch were observed.

We found, through statistically significent results, that lidocaine does heighten the twitch threshold of a frog gastrocnemus. It also lowers the voltage generated by the muscle contraction at a given pulse amplitude.

I hope that more studies on this topic will be done, perhaps with bigger samples or with different organisms. It would be interesting to see if more studies on what this substance does to muscles will 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle in both vertebrates and invertebrates are made of muscle fibers, which are innervated by motor neurons. The axons of these motor neurons run through the entirety of each fiber. When electrical impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junctions (where the motor neuron axons meet the muscle fibers) (Johnson-2017), neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic terminal of the motor neuron into the synapse. Acetylcholine then binds to a specific receptor on the membrane of a muscle fiber (the postsynaptic terminal) which triggers the opening of sodium channels within the fiber. The rush of sodium into the muscle cells causes the release of Ca2+, which enables the contraction of the muscle. The flow of the electrical impulse through the neuron, into the synapse (as a chemical signal) and to the muscle fibers is referred to as an action potential (Sadava-2016). 

The action potentials that travel through the motor neurons and muscle fibers, and ultimately cause the muscle to twitch, are made possible by Ca2+ ions, which depend on the sudden change in membrane potential from a rush of sodium ions into the cell (Sadava-2016). These sodium ions require channels to gain access inside the cell, thus, without working sodium channels, action potentials will not be able to fire and the muscle will not contract. Lidocaine is a numbing agent used by medical professionals in surgical scenarios. It is also a substance that blocks sodium channels, and therefore limits the firing ability of action potentials. 

Each muscle possesses a twitch threshold, which is defined as the amount of electrical stimulation in the nerve required to cause a muscle twitch to twitch the first time. The twitch threshold varies based on type of muscle and organism (Sadava-2016). We predict that twitch threshold can also be altered by certain substances such as lidocaine. Since lidocaine acts as a sodium channel blocker, the motor neurons and muscle fibers will be less able to fire action potentials due to lack of working sodium channels. We hypothesize that lidocaine will thus increase the twitch threshold of the muscle. 

For this experiment, we will be using the calf muscle (gastrocnemus) of a frog. This muscle is innervated by the sciatic nerve (Johnson-2017), which we will be stimulating with electrical pulses to trigger a contraction in the muscle. The independent variables for this experiment are the amplitude of electrical stimulation, and the presence or absence of lidocaine. The dependent variable we will be observing and comparing is the amount of voltage generated from each twitch in untreated versus treated frog legs to determine how lidocaine affects twitch threshold.


Materials and Method:
Materials

The iWorxEP computer program was used to monitor muscle activity. The sciatic nerve was attached to an electrode which connected to a voltage box, which connected to the computer that had the program. Three different frog legs were used as well as several dissecting tools to isolate the gastrocnemus and sciatic nerve. A string and an adjustable stand with a clamp were used to suspend the gastrocnemus above a dissecting platform. A syringe was used to inject 25 mM lidocaine solution. Ringer’s solution was also used as needed to keep the frog leg moist. 

Procedure

Three frog legs from freshly killed frogs were randoMly chosen and placed on a dissecting platform. 

Once the skin was removed, the sciatic nerve and calf muscle were gently isolated from the surrounding tissue of the frog leg (Johnson-2017). The calf muscle was cut away from the bone and surrounding tissue all the way down to the ankle joint (left intact at the knee joint) and suspended with string tied to a clamp stand. The sciatic nerve was attached to an electrode. Pins were used to keep the rest of the leg on the dissecting table 

On the computer program the pulse width was set to 5 ms and the frequency was set to 1 Hz. These values remained constant throughout the experiment (Johnson-2017). 

The untreated frog leg was first stimulated with one pulse at 0-volt pulse amplitude. Each subsequent stimulation consisted of 1 pulse at 0.1 volts higher than the previous pulse amplitude (1 pulse at 0.1 volts, 1 pulse at 0.2 volts etc.). Stimulation was terminated after 0.5-volt pulse amplitude. Then, the frog leg was stimulated with 5 pulses, each at whatever pulse amplitude first caused the frog leg to twitch during the 1-pulse trials (Johnson-2017). 

After this procedure, the gastrocnemus of the same frog leg (remaining in suspended position) was injected with about 0.2 Ml of lidocaine in the middle, top, and bottom parts of the muscle. Five minutes was allotted to allow the lidocaine to take action. Then, the same steps used when the leg was untreated were followed with the treated leg. Twitch thresholds in the untreated and treated legs were recorded.  

This entire procedure was repeated two more times with the other two frog legs.

The statistical method used to interpret data was a paired, two-sample t_test. 


Results:
In every circumstance, the untreated frog leg began to twitch at a pulse amplitude of 0.2. Two of the treated frog legs did not start to twitch until 0.3 amplitude, while one treated leg still twitched at 0.2. Therefore, for table 1, I considered the voltage values for either 0.2 or 0.3 amplitude, depending on the twitch threshold for each individual muscle, and combined them into one sample to determine the average. 

The average voltage produced from the untreated frog leg twitches at threshold amplitude was 0.277 volts for 1 electrical pulse, and 0.2448 volts for 5 electrical pulses. The average voltage produced from the treated frog leg twitches at threshold amplitude was roughly 0.08434 volts for 1 electrical pulse and roughly 0.08364 volts for 5 electrical pulses. With respect to the values mentioned above, the voltages from the treated legs were lower than those of untreated legs (see table 1). 

It is noteworthy that 2 out of the 3 treated frog legs did not begin to twitch until 0.3 amplitude, while every untreated frog leg began to twitch at 0.2 amplitude (see table 2). 

The voltages generated by the treated legs were consistently lower than their counterparts (the voltages generated by the untreated legs at the same amplitude) (see table 2 and figure 1). 

The p_value for all of our combined, raw data was approximately 0.03, showing that the differences in data between the controlll and lidocaine groups was statistically significent and most likely not due to chance.  


Discussion:
Based on our results, since 2 of the 3 treated legs had higher twitch thresholds than those of the untreated legs, we can conclude that lidocaine does in fact heighten twitch threshold. These findings support our hypothesis, along with an interesting discovery that lidocaine also lowers voltage generated by the twitch at a given amplitude.

While our experiment focused on the broad concept of twitch threshold to test the effects of lidocaine, there have been studies that have focused on what lidocaine does to muscles on a more cellular level. The specificity of these experiments compared to ours can help us better understand how and why we got the results that we did. One experiment in particular, for which the article is posted in The Journal of Physiology, focused more specifically on the effects of lidocaine on “Na+ current” around cells (Chen-200). The findings of this experiment could explain the findings of ours: that “lidocaine caused a reduction in P2 peak [voltage produced by muscle] … that was similar in magnitude to lowering Na+ to 10 mM in drug-free solutions” (Chen-2000). In other words, the experimenters found that the administration of lidocaine to a cell seemed to inhibit the flow of sodium ions. As explained in the introduction, the flow of sodium ions in and out of the cell are required for the generation of action potentials, so without this flow, the muscle will not contract as willingly. Therefore, this study further supports our findings that lidocaine does affect twitch threshold. 
 
Aside from other studies that support our results, if it was not the lidocaine that affected the twitch threshold, then it could have been muscle fatigue. Each frog leg was tested without lidocaine first, and then injected and tested with lidocaine, so by the time the frog leg was treated with lidocaine, the muscle had already been working for some time. The muscle could have been running out of calcium ions, which are needed in addition to sodium ions and sodium channels to cause contracting of the muscle. Thus, the change in twitch threshold could have been due to a lack of calcium rather than blocked sodium channels from the lidocaine. 

Future studies should be done one this subject, perhaps using a completely different set of frog legs for the controlll and treatment groups, to ensure that the increase in twitch threshold is due to the lidocaine and not fatigue. This experiment should also be re-done using more frog legs, in order to further support or refute a relationship between lidocaine and twitch threshold across a larger sample. Additionally, it would be interesting for someone to test this hypothesis on a different organism, to see if our results are applicable to other types of muscles. Hopefully, with more investigation into this study, along with information from previous studies, we will come to a better understanding of how muscles respond to outside influence: more specifically, how muscles respond to drugs, which can improve surgical method within the medical field.
