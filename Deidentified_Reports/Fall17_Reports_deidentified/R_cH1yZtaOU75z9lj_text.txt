Title: Effect of salinized water on specific metabolic rate of Procambarus sp.

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to judge whether the specific metabolic rates (SMR) of Procambarus are altered by a change in salt concentration in their surroundings. We hypothesized that with greater salinity, metabolic rate would be increased. To test our hypothesis, we used three crayfish and made each one its own control by first measuring metabolic rate without the treatment, then adding the salt afterwards. We determined from our data that there is no significant data showing that salt concentration and specific metabolic rate are directly proportional (p= .2363). Therefore, we concluded that salinity does not have an effect on the specific metabolic rate in Procambarus. In future studies we will continue adjusting salinity to answer this scientific question more clearly.

Introduction:
In this experiment we wanted to test the effects of salinity on the metabolism of the crustacean Procambarus sp. This species of crayfish is highly invasive and mainly resides in North American freshwater lakes and rivers. They are a suitable subject for this experiment because of their abundance and their highly adaptive nature [Ahern: 2017]. This species is capable of altering their metabolic rates based on what the environment they are in demands of them. Metabolism is essentially the processes that encompass changing food into energy, forming the building blocks of proteins, lipids, etc. and expelling unnecessary nitrogenous substances [Gäde: 1984]. The main characteristic of metabolism is that it requires oxygen to produce the energy necessary for carrying out all of the functions mentioned earlier. Therefore, if the change in oxygen level in greater that means the organism’s metabolic rate was higher and vice versa. In order to determine how salinity affects SMR we must find the change in oxygen in a closed system with and without the salt additive. We will be able to make a conclusion based on if the metabolic rate for the experimental groups are greater than or less than the initial control group metabolic rate. In a study concerning a plant with two variances of salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive, there was significant proof that when salt concentration was raised for both sub-groups, the metabolic rate rose. Furthermore, the salt-sensitive plant showed a more drastic difference in metabolism, but the salt-tolerant plant was still affected in a similar way [Misra: 2005]. To translate this to Procambarus, a study was found comparing salt-water crustacean to fresh-water crustacean and these researchers received very similar results to the previous study mentioned. Therefore, we predicted that if we added salt to the system, the organism’s metabolic rate would increase.

Materials and Methods:
To properly test our hypothesis, we had a total of six trials- three control and three experimental. Although, we only had three subjects, so our method consisted of measuring the metabolic rates for each crayfish in a normal freshwater environment, then introducing a .05 M salt solution to each one and recording the metabolic rate with the same organisms. The system the subjects were placed in and where the testing took place was a sealed mason jar holding around 900 mL of liquid. We left the crayfish in both systems for fifteen minutes and recorded the amount of oxygen every five minutes using an oxygen probe. By dividing the change in oxygen multiplied by the volume of water by time and weight, we were able to find the SMRs. We used a paired t-test to determine significance of the data.

Results:
After collecting the data, we observed that, in general, there was an increase in the specific metabolic rate when the organism was submerged in the salt solution (avg. in water= .0005 kcal/kg avg. in salt= .00086 kcal/kg). However, with the second subject there was a discrepancy where the metabolic rate was higher during the control phase of testing. Therefore, we found that there was no significant difference between specific metabolic rates in water and in the salt solution (p= .2363). 

Discussion:
In past studies the surprisingly adaptive nature of Procambarus clarkii, a closely-related species of crayfish was studied in a highly salinic environment [Bissattini et al.: 2015]. The results showed that the salt did not affect the SMR to a significant degree. However, in Bissattini’s study they used a much higher concentration of salt at 35% which could be explain the significance of their data. That being said, our data did not support our hypothesis. In our initial plan for this experiment, we were going to calculate change in oxygen over the span of fifteen minutes, but in the fifth trial the lid was removed one segment early releasing the oxygen, so we decided to use our fifteen-minute values throughout. Therefore, one possible direction to go in future studies would be to fulfill our original plan and take data over the span of 20 minutes. Furthermore, another compelling next step for this study is to continue testing metabolic rate with salinity, but include different levels of salt concentration and see if metabolism slowly increase as that value does. Using this process, we will most likely see a trendline comparing concentration of salinity and SMR, allowing us to deduce a positive, negative, or nonexistent correlation after all.
