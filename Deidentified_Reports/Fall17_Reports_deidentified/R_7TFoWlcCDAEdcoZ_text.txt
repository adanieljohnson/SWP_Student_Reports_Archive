Title: Lidocaine Prevents Response to Stimulation in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
In this experiment, we injected the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens with 2Ml of 25 mM of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker.  By blocking sodium channels, lidocaine prevents the cellular membrane from becoming depolarized, and thus, prevents action potentials from firing.  Since action potentials cannot fire in the presence of lidocaine, then movement should be prevented in the presence of lidocaine.  Based off of this knowledge, our hypothesis was that this could cause a decrease in response (in Volts) to 1.000 Volts of stimulus.  To test this, we measured the response strength to 1.000 Volts of stimulus before and after injecting lidocaine.  We used a paired t test with an alpha value of 0.05 to find the statistical significance of our study.  Our p value was 0.57375, and thus, we failed to reject our null hypothesis; however, there was an increase in response strength in one out of the three gastrocnemus muscles.


Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to their internal and external environments.  The neuromuscular system allows for a response to a stimulus within milliseconds.  To allow for movement, an action potential must travel down the axon of a motor neuron.  To allow for an action potential to fire, and thus travel down the axon of a motor neuron, voltage-gated sodium ion channels must be opened in order to depolarize the cell.  The depolarization of the cellular membrane causes voltage-gated potassium ion channels to open and repolarize the cell.  This repolarization of the cellular membrane allows an action potential to fire, which allows for muscle stimulation.  Acetylcholine is the hormone that is released in order to allow for muscle contraction.  Acetylcholine release is also dependent on sodium channels. 
 
In this experiment, we want to determine what will occur if these voltage-gated sodium ion channels are manipulated.  Lidocaine is a chemical that blocks sodium ion channels.  To test how lidocaine will affect the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog, we are going to inject a frog leg with 25 mM of lidocaine. Blocking voltage-gated sodium channels disrupts the generation of action potentials and prevents the transmission of nociceptive information to the central nervous system [Binshtok, Gerner, et al. 2009].  In this experiment, it was found that blocking voltage-gated sodium channels disrupts action potential production, which prevents the transmission of information to the central nervous system [Binshtok, Gerner, et al. 2009].  This indicates that a sodium channel blocker, such as lidocaine, would be useful as an anesthetic because the chemical does not allow action potentials to fire in motor neurons, and thus, prevents movement.  In this experiment we are going to be using Rania pippins, commonly known as the northern leopard frog.  We will be using this organism, because it is a model organism.  This means that its anatomy can be used to compare among other organisms and there is much available data about this organism.    

We hypothesize that if we inject lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscles of a Rania pipiens, then the response (in Volts) to 1.00 Volts of stimulation (i.e. contraction amplitude) will be less than the response (i.e. contraction amplitude) to 1.00 Volts of stimulation in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog that has not been injected with lidocaine.  Our null hypothesis is that lidocaine will have no effect on the contraction amplitude or that the contraction amplitude will increase.  Our alternative hypothesis is that lidocaine will cause the contraction amplitude to decrease.  This is because we are using a one-tailed, paired t test.  The dependent, continuous variable in this experiment is the response to the stimulus.  The independent, categorical variable is the presence or absence of lidocaine in the gastrocnemus muscle.  The goal of this experiment is to determine the effect of lidocaine on the contraction amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens.  

Materials and Method:
Prepare three legs of the Rania pipiens according to the videos available.  By the time the legs are prepared, the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of the frog leg should be isolated.  The skin of the frog should be fully removed. 

In this experiment, we used Labscribe software, and thus, these method are based off of this software.  Click “stimulator preferences” icon on the Labscribe toolbar in order to open the stimulator controlll panel on the main window.  Check the values for the stimulus parameters: pulse amplitude (amp) should be set to 1.000 V and the number of pulses (#pulse) to 1, frequency (F(Hz)) to 1, and pulse width (w) to 5 ms.  The value for a stimulus parameter can be changed via two method.  One way is to click on the arrows buttons to the right of the window that displays the value of the parameter in the window that displays the value of the parameter to increase/decrease the value.  The other way is to type the value of the parameter in the window next to the label of the parameter. 

Type 1.000 V in the mark box to the right of the mark button. Stimulate the nerve with 1.000 V and press the mark button to attach the comment to the recording.  Apply a light load to the muscle by raising the force transducer with the tension adjustor until the trace moves a few mV above the baseline.  Once a light load is applied to the muscle, click on Stop.  Repeat these steps for the 3 legs.  This is the controlll group.  

Once the controlll group is completed, inject each of the three legs with approximately 2 Ml (does not have to be exact) of 25 mM of lidocaine.  The controlll group also serves as the experiment group.  Repeat the previous steps with each leg.  Use a paired T test to analyze the data.



Results:
Figure 1.  The Average Change in Response to Stimulation in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens, Without the Presence of Lidocaine and with the Presence of 25mM of Lidocaine.  Error bars represent the standard deviation while the data bars represent the observed response in Volts.  Difference between the Experimental and Control group was significent; the controlll group (n=3) had an average response of 0.417 volts with the experimental group (n=3) having an average response of 0.30833 volts.  Blue represents the controlll group while red represents the response strength after lidocaine injection.

The results of the one-tailed paired t test are as follows: the t_statistic was 0.666377, the degrees of freedom was 2, and the p_value was 0.57375.  The alpha value is 0.05.  The statistical test results are not significent. 

Once lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg, the response to 1.000 Volts of stimulus decreased in two out of the three legs.  In one leg, the response increased in strength after the injection of lidocaine.

The average of the controlll group was higher than that of the experiment group.



Discussion:
Since the p_value of the paired t test is above 0.05 (the alpha value), there is weak evidence against the null hypothesis.  Thus, the data fails to reject the null that lidocaine causes either no change or an increase in response to 1.000 volts of stimulus in the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens.  This means that there was not sufficient evidence to claim that lidocaine causes a weakened response to 1.00 V of stimulus.  Our results are not in line with the results of other experiments, because they found that, the presence of lidocaine resulted in both nonselective sensory and motor block due to its classification of a sodium channel blocker [Binshtok, Gerner, et al. 2009].  While the presence of lidocaine caused a decrease in response to two out of the three legs, there was an increase in response strength in one of the legs.  Since lidocaine blocks sodium channels, there truly should have only been a decrease in response strength.  Therefore, this result could have occurred due to our error.  Error could have occurred when injecting the leg with lidocaine: too much or too little lidocaine could have been injected or the injection could have occurred in wrong location on the leg.  Error could have also occurred if the instructions on how to prepare the leg were not followed all of the way.  Some limitations of the study is that there were only three frog legs used; if there was a larger sample size, then the null hypothesis could have potentially been rejected.   Based on the fact that one leg experienced an increase in response, further testing could determine if the volume or concentration of lidocaine injected into the gastrocnemus muscle affects the decrease of response to the stimulus.
