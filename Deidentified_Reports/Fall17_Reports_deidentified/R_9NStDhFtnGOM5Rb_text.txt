Title: Neuromuscular Control: Measuring the Effect of Calcium Channel Activator on the Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The objective of our experiment was to test the effect of calcium channel activator on the length of contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens. We hypothesized that the introduction of calcium channel activator to the gastrocnemius muscle in the leg of a Rana pipiens will cause the same number of muscle contractions as the control, however the muscle contractions will last longer. We tested three Rana pipiens legs. The three control groups were stimulated by applying a shock to the sciatic nerve with five consecutive pulses at 0.2V, and the results were recorded. The three experimental groups were prepared by injecting 1mL of calcium channel activator, and then, again, stimulating the sciatic nerve with five consecutive pulses at 0.2V, and the results were recorded. The control group had an average contractile period of about 112.4 ms. The experimental group had an average contractile period of about 101.5 ms. The average total time of the contractile periods resulting from stimulation are shown in graph to the right. The average total time for the control groups is 579.7 ms. The average total time for the experimental group is 607.2 ms. Therefore there was a slight increase in contraction length in the experimental group, however, a statistical analysis showed that

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to respond to the internal and external environments. Skeletal muscle in vertebrates and invertebrates are made up of thousands of myofibrils, which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells. They are bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups -- skeletal muscle. These muscles are innervated by motor neurons. They branch out to innervate several individual myofibrils, at points called the neuromuscular junction. Nerve impulses cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane which causes sodium channels to change shape and open. Sodium now moves down its concentration gradient, depolarizes the postsynaptic cell, and generates an action potential (AP) in the muscle fiber. In turn, this releases calcium, which activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten.
	In an article by Daher, Gover, Moreira, Lopes, and Weinrick, the authors explain and experiment in which they test whether the vanilloid family of transient receptor potential channels (TPRV1) underlie the Ca2+ influx pathway after the depolarization of the postsynaptic vesicle. They knew that caffeine-induced transients (CICTs) in ganglion neurons are produced by two mechanisms. The first is due to the release from ryanodine receptors. The second is due to activation of an unknown receptor. In this experiment, they used single-cell microfluorimetry to measure changes in intracellular Ca2+ to test whether the TPRV1 is responsible for the Ca2+ influx pathway. They found that caffeine can induce Ca2+ by activating TRPV1 channels. These findings led us to question what would happen if there was an excess calcium influx.
	In this experiment, we will be studying the effects of calcium channel activator (100mM  A23187) on the opening of calcium channels, and consequentially on the muscle response in Rana pipiens. From the study previously discussed, which found that caffeine can induce the release of calcium in muscle contractions, we believe that calcium channel activator will prolong muscle contractions. We hypothesize that the introduction of calcium channel activator to the gastrocnemius muscle in the leg of a Rana pipiens will cause the same number of muscle contractions as the control, however the muscle contractions will last longer.

Materials and Methods:
We start our experiment with three freshly prepared Rana pipiens legs, provided by the Wake Forest Universtiy Biology Department. This organism is ideal for this experiment because the gastrocnemius muscle is large and contractions are easily visible, and the sciatic nerve is easily accessible. Each leg acts as both a control and an experimental group (resulting in 6 total groups). The control group receives no treatment and is maintained under constant conditions. The experimental group is injected with 1.0 mL of calcium channel activator (100mM A23187). Each leg is prepared under the same conditions. The skin is removed from the leg and the thigh muscle is dissected to reveal the sciatic nerve. A string is tied tightly around the bone at the bottom of the gastrocnemius muscle, closer to the foot, and the other end is attached to the force transducer adjuster. Then, a light load is applied to the muscle by raising the force transducer adjuster to create tension. The leg is then pinned down to the tray to control the contractions. The sciatic nerve is attached to a stimulator which records the contractions on a computer, using a system called LabScribe.
	The threshold stimulus of the nerve is found by stimulating the nerve directly with single pulses of constant duration. The amplitude starts a 0.0 V and it’s increased incrementally by 0.1V until it reaches 0.5. Next, the amplitude is increased to 1.0V and then increased by 1.0V increments until it reaches 5.0V. Each response is recorded after a contraction is observed. 
	Once the threshold is determined, stimulation of the control can begin. Five consecutive pulses are recorded at the voltage that was predetermined as the threshold. For each peak, the contractile period (ms) and total time of contraction (ms) is recorded. Then the gastrocnemius muscle is injected with one mL of calcium channel activator. By injecting the control leg with the experimental variable, calcium channel activator, the control group becomes the experimental group. After 30 seconds, the leg is stimulated under the same conditions as the control group, five consecutive pulses at the voltage that was determined to be the threshold. Again, each contractile period and total time of contraction is recorded. The same process is repeated for each trial. In this experiment, we ran three total trials (three legs).


Results:
After stimulating the legs, we measured the length of the contraction from the lowest point at the beginning of the contraction to the highest point during contraction. The average time of the contractile periods resulting from stimulation are shown in graph to the right. The control group had an average contractile period of about 112.4 ms. The experimental group had an average contractile period of about 101.5 ms. This data shows that the control group had a longer average contractile period than the experimental group. 
After stimulating the legs, we also measured the length of the total period of contraction. That means from the lowest point at the beginning of the contraction to the lowest point at the end of the contraction. The average total time of the contractile periods resulting from stimulation are shown in graph to the right. The average total time for the control groups is 579.7 ms. The average total time for the experimental group is 607.2 ms. This data shows that the experimental group had a longer total contraction period than the control group.


Discussion:
The averages of the contractile period for the control group and the experimental group did not show a large difference. The control group had an average contractile period of about 112.4 ms. The experimental group had an average contractile period of about 101.5 ms. The averages of the total time of the contraction for the control group and the experimental group also did not prove to have a large difference. The average total time for the control groups is 579.7 ms. The average total time for the experimental group is 607.2 ms. This was not the data we hoped for based on our hypothesis. We expected that the length for the contractile period and the total time of the contraction should both be significantly longer than the control group. The results of the contractile period are the opposite result from what we thought would happen. Our hypothesis predicted that the experimental group’s contractile period would be longer than the control. The data for the total time shows that there was a small increase with the experimental group, but a statistical analysis shows that the difference is not significant.
The p-value of the contractile period is 0.443, with a t-value of 0.948, and 2 degrees of freedom. Because the p-value is not below 0.05, the results of the experiment are not statistically significant. The p-value of the total time of the contraction is 0.8197, with a t-value of 0.259 and 2 degrees of freedom. Again, because the p-value is not below 0.05, the results of the experiment are not statistically significant. 
Our null hypothesis is that the calcium channel activator would have no influence or effect on the length of the muscle contraction. The alternative hypothesis is that the calcium channel activator would have increase the length of the muscle contraction. Our results show that the null hypothesis was accepted and the alternative hypothesis is rejected. The results of our experiment reject our original hypothesis that the calcium channel activator would prolong length of contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle
The results of this experiment differed from that of the previous study done by Daher and his team. Their study showed that another experimental variable, caffeine, did have a significant effect on the release of calcium in muscle contractions. However, our experiment did not prove to have a significant effect on the release of calcium in muscle contractions. This difference could be due to the chosen experimental variable, difference in methods, or in error. Our results were admittedly subjective. Defining what constituted the beginning and end of the recorded curve after stimulation was under the discretion of the person recording the data. To improve this error, this method of recording data could have been better controlled, or completely different method could have been used. Another possible error could have been the sample size of our experiment. Our group only ran three trials and if more trials were run, we may have received more accountable and accurate data. Another variable that may have affected the experiment is the amount of calcium channel activator that was used. There was a slight, but consistent, increase in the contractile period and total time for the experimental group. If more calcium channel activator were injected into the gastrocnemius muscle, a larger difference may be observed. It would be interesting to explore this hypothesis in a further study, while also adjusting for the errors observed and previously discussed.
