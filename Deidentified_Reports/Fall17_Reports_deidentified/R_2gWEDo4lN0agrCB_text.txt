Title: Effects of Salinity on the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp

Abstract:
As ecosystems are disrupted through pollution and global climate change, it is important to understand the impact that these environmental changes have on the organisms that live within them. To test the impact of salts on metabolic processes, an experiment was performed to determine the impact of higher salinity water on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. by measuring the amount of dissolved oxygen found in its environment over time. Because crayfish inhabit mostly freshwater, it was hypothesized that exposure to higher salinity waters would change their specific metabolic rate. This hypothesis was not supported, as the data was found to be not statistically significant. Additionally, there is not yet a scientific consensus regarding whether this rate should increase or decrease following exposure to NaCl. When a paired t-test was performed on the results, the p-value was 0.082015. Through this, it was determined that the data indicating that Procambarus sp.’s SMR decreases as salinity increases was not statistically significant.

Introduction:
Crayfish, Procambarus sp., are crustaceans that are often found in streams and rivers. Because streams and rivers are fresh water bodies of water, or sometimes brackish, crayfish have adapted to function in freshwater or low salinity environments. Metabolism describes the process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within the cells of an organism. The cellular processes associated with metabolism are dependent upon the environment that an organism is in. When subjected to different environmental changes, including changes to O2 concentrations, temperature, and salinity, an organisms’ metabolic rate can change, which was found in DeFur’s study regarding the impact of salinity on the metabolic rates of nine different species of invertebrates, including crustaceans. The study increased the concentration of salinity in the environment of the different species of invertebrates from 16-20% salinity to 32% salinity, while maintaining the temperature of the water, and found that the diverse reactions in terms of the direction of metabolic rate change prevented conclusions from being drawn about whether salinity consistently increases or decreases metabolic rate in invertebrates. However, through this study it was made clear that metabolic rate is dependent upon environmental conditions like salinity (DeFur 1978). Because crayfish are accustomed to living in fresh water or low salinity conditions, subjecting them to high levels of salinity through the supplementation of NaCl to their water could increase the energy that crayfish must expend in order to obtain oxygen to breathe. With more salt ions within the water, the crustacean must increase the rate of water flow along its gills in order to obtain all of the oxygen it needs to sustain itself through diffusion. Increasing this water flow across the diffusion surface would likely be achieved by increasing its movement, thus increasing its oxygen intake and its metabolic rate (Sadava 2017). Thus, their metabolic rate should change. To measure metabolic rate, the amount of diffused oxygen present within water can be measured, as these values are directly proportional (Bio114 Lab Manual). The species Procambarus sp. were chosen as the sample organism due to their small size and ease with which their environment can be manipulated. We hypothesize that if crayfish have NaCl supplemented (in concentrations ranging from 0.269 M – 0.276 M) to their water (environment), their specific metabolic rate will change. 

Materials and Methods:
Weigh the first crayfish. Fill the jar with fresh water, and insert the O2 concentration probe. Submerge the closed jar into 22°C & oxygenated water. Press read and record the value on the O2 sensor monitor, and continue this process every 5 minutes until 20 minutes have elapsed. Then, measure the volume of water that was in the jar using a volumetric flask. Next, add 100mL of 6.5% NaCl to the jar and dilute it to the brim with fresh water. Re-insert the dissolved O2 sensor, and re-submerge the jar into room temperature water. Press read and record the value from the sensor initially, and repeat this process at 5 minute intervals until 20 minutes have elapsed. Measure the volume of NaCl + water that was in the jar in a volumetric flask. Repeat both the freshwater and NaCl treatment for the remaining two crayfish specimen after weighing them. Once all data has been collected, calculate the specific metabolic rate of each treatment of each specimen using the equation . Calculate the concentration of NaCl in each diluted NaCl solution in the three trials of salt water. Determine the concentration by first calculating the number of grams of NaCl used, then convert this value to moles using NaCl’s molar mass (58.44 g). Finally, divide the number of moles of NaCl by the volume of solution within the jar to determine the molarity of the solution. Perform a paired t-test comparing the SMR values calculated for the control group to those calculated for the experimental group in order to determine if that data found was statistically significant.


Results:
The specific metabolic rates of the crayfish in the control treatment of fresh water had higher specific metabolic rates than those of the experimental treatment. In the control trials where the specimen were submerged in 22°C & oxygenated water, the average SMB was 0.00193 mg O2/g*min. In the experimental treatments where the specimen were submerged in a solution containing 100mL of 6.5% NaCl, the average SMB was 0.00093 mg O2/g*min. The standard deviation of the control treatments was 0.000404 while the standard deviation of the experimental treatments was 0.000153. The p-value was 0.082015. Figure 1 highlights the difference in SMR’s of the control and experimental treatments. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that metabolic rate changes as salinity increases was not supported by the findings of this experiment, as the data was found to be statistically insignificant. However, other studies have supported this hypothesis. There have not been consistent findings, however, in similar experiments regarding whether or not metabolic rate increases or decreases based on increased salinity levels. In the findings of this experiment, the SMR of each Procambarus sp. decreased when in the presence of NaCl. Some other studies support this finding, including one where the crustacean Idotea balthic was subjected to abrupt salinity changes, from concentrations of 10% salinity to 30% salinity. The results of this study indicate that as the salinity concentrations increased, there was a slight reduction in oxygen uptake and thus, SMR. Bulnheim’s data mirrors that found within this experiment. However, a key difference in Bulnheim’s study was the 6-hour acclimation period, where the sample organisms were able to adjust to the higher salinity levels of the water (Bulnheim 1974). The 20-minute acclimation period may not have been a sufficient amount of time for the crayfish to regulate, and may be a shortcoming of the experiment. However, other studies of the crustaceans M. acanthurus and M. olfersii have found that metabolic rates increased concentrations of 21% salinity. A promising result of Moreira’s study was that SMR rates decreased at concentrations higher than 21% salinity, meaning there is a maximum SMR that can be found by a certain salinity concentration. This would be a great area for future study, as the maximal SMR and salinity concentration can be found by varying salinity levels (Moreira 1983). As the results of both Bulnheim and Moreira’s studies show, there is no scientific consensus on the direction of SMR change in crayfish when exposed to higher salinity rates. Additionally, the environments in which different species live could be taken into account for future experiments. Crayfish tend to live in brackish water, so they may be accustomed to and adapted to the lower concentrations of NaCl that were used. Thus, the freshwater may have been more of a stress to the species used than the NaCl was, converse to what was originally hypothesized. Other potential sources of error include the molarity of NaCl used, as it may have been too low to provoke a significant change in the SMR of the crayfish. Another possible source of error could be not screwing the lid of the dissolved O2 sensor on tightly enough, allowing air to escape from the closed system.
