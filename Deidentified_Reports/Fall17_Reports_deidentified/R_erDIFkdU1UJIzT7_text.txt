Title: Effect of competing species on the root:shoot length ratios of oats (Avena sativa) and mung beans (Vigna radiate)

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the strategy through which plants use available resources like soil nutrients, water, sunlight, and amount of space around them in order to grow above or below ground and increase their fitness. In this study, the effect of interspecific competition was measured on the root:shoot ratios of oat and mung bean plants. Oats and mung beans were grown in separate pots of low-nutrient soil, then oats and mung beans grown together in the same pot. We predicted that if the oat and mung bean plants are grown by themselves in low nutrient soil, the root:shoot length will be lower than the root:shoot ratio of the plants while they are growing in the same pot, and if mung beans and oats are grown in the same container, then oats’ R:S ratio will increase more than the mung beans’ root:shoot ratio. The results of the study supported the aspect of the hypothesis pertaining to oats (p=0.002), but the mung beans showed no significent change in root:shoot length ratio (p=0.415).

Introduction:
In biology, competition means the interaction between biotic organisms for limited essential resources. It drives evolution in that the more competitive genetic structures have a great probability of survival and reproduction. These genetic structures increase in dominance over time, and less useful genetic structures will die out over future generations. Competition between plants can be defined as the process through which plants strive to obtain limited resources and suffer from the presence of other organisms. Examples of such resources include, but are not limited to: sunlight, water, space to grow, Nitrogen, and other micronutrients [Johnson, 2017]. Because there are limited resources available to plants, competition between and among species is critical to survival. The competition for resources is a prevalent force in structuring plant communities and natural selection, but the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie resource competition is still developing [Craine, 2013]. By understanding these mechanisms, scientists can see how competition drives evolution. We chose to study competition in plants because we found the relationship between resource allocation and invasive species, which we hear a lot about in scientific media, very interesting. Not only do invasive species compete to disrupt natural communities and ecological processes, but they also have a very real impact on humans. They result in increased federal spending associated with ecological damage, serious health problems for people in the affected area and beyond, and decreased biodiversity. It is very important to understand how we can protect biodiversity from invasive species, but it is impossible to do that without first understand the mechanisms plants use to compete with one another. Resource allocation is fundamentally a process of evolution where organisms become more fit over time. They pass traits on to their offspring that are either beneficial or detrimental to the process of resource allocation, and plants that are better able to allocate their resources will have much more reproductive success. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a plant to allocate resources and express its genotype in different phenotypic or visual ways based on the environment [Johnson, 2017]. Oats, or Avena sativa, are known to be a rather phenotypically plastic plant, as the environment they are grown in has a large effect on their phenotype [Mahadevan, 2017]. Mung beans, or Vigna radiata, aren’t known to share the same degree of plasticity. In this experiment, we grew oats and mung beans in separate pots of low-nutrient soil, then oats and mung beans together in one pot. We predicted that if the oat and mung bean plants are grown by themselves in low nutrient soil, the root:shoot length ratio will be lower than the root:shoot ratio of the plants while they are growing in the same pot because the plants will need to increase root surface area to increase nutrient intake. Additionally, if mung beans and oats are grown in the same container, then oats’ root:shoot ratio will increase more than the mung beans’ root:shoot ratio because oats are more phenotypically plastic than mung beans.

Materials and Method:
To set up this experiment, we obtained nine pots. In three pots, 50 oat seeds were planted in each. In another group of three pots, 50 mung bean seeds were planted in each. In the last group of three pots, 25 mung bean seeds and 25 oat seeds were planted in each. After two weeks of daily watering the plants in the greenhouse, we harvested two plants from each of the three pots containing only oats and two plants from each of the three pots containing only mung beans. We also harvested two oat plants and two mung bean plants from each of the three pots where they were grown together. The vermiculite was broken apart to separate the roots, then we washed and dried the plants. Each root and each shoot were weighed in grams and the lengths were recorded in centimeters.  The means and standard deviations of all four groups (oats alone, mung beans alone, oats in the presence of mung beans, mung beans in the presence of oats) were calculated. The data collected from the weight of the roots was very inconclusive because the amount of water and dirt left on the roots while they were weighed was inconsistent. Therefore, I decided to focus on just the R:S length ratio. Two t_tests with 10 degrees of freedom were run for length: first between oats in the presence of mung beans and oats by themselves, second between mung beans in the presence of oats and mung beans by themselves.

Results:
The data show that the experimental treatment had a significent effect on the oats, but not on the mung beans (Figure 1). The root to shoot ratio of the oats increased from a mean of 0.6806 to 1.305, and the error bars that represent the standard deviations of these two groups did not overlap at all (p=0.002). The mean of the mung beans, however, decreased very slightly from 0.3033 to 0.2729, but the errors bars completely overlapped. The mung beans showed no significent change in root:shoot length ratio (p= 0.415). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the R:S ratio of both species would increase when grown together was proven false for the mung beans and was supported for oats. The second part of the hypothesis, that if mung beans and oats are grown in the same container, then oats’ root:shoot ratio will increase more than the mung beans’ root:shoot ratio because oats are more phenotypically plastic than mung beans, was supported by the data. This shows that oats are superior in fitness to the mung beans because they are better at resource allocation, and how natural selection is likely to act on plasticity- a great weapon for plants when it comes to competition. Similar results were found in a 2014 study, where it was concluded that plasticity is an important aspect of how species evolve in different environments [Dai, 2014]. For further research, the experiment could be run with two plant species that are both known to be phenotypically plastic, such as oats and a species native to wetlands. A species located in the wetlands is likely to be very phenotypically plastic because it endures drought and flood conditions. This will show how the root:shoot ratio changes when the competition is much stronger. Additionally, the changes in R:S ratio could be measured under conditions where the plants are deprived of specific resources. The difference between water deprivation and nutrient deprivation are important for understanding the mechanism by which the plants compete. It is still poorly understood how the mechanisms of competition may change with “heterogeneity of resource supplies” [Craine, 2013].  Further experiments and research are necessary, as this topic can have practical agricultural uses. By understanding how plants such as oats compete for resources in an environment, farmers can artificially tailor the environment of their crops to increase yield. Traits that increase plasticity can be artificially selected for, assuming the technology were available [Mahadevam, 2017]. Additionally, plasticity shapes how organisms phenotypically respond to environmental disruptions such as global climate change. Plants that aren’t as phenotypically plastic could become extinct as the environmental conditions of our planet change so rapidly. In this case, changes in phenotype could either be genetic, or due to phenotypic plasticity, and further experiments are required to differentiate the two [Merilä, 2014]. Climate change is definitely not the only stressor acting on plants, but it is a significent one. In conclusion, this study was effective in accomplishing its purpose, and provided useful insights as to how phenotypic plasticity in plants contributes to evolution, and vice versa.
