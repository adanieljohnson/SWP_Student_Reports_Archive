Title: Effect of Moderately Hot Temperature on Buckwheat’s Resource Allocation

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the pattern in which a species distributes more energy and mass to grow a particular structure and reduces the amount of energy it spends elsewhere in order to more efficiently use the limited resources. Temperature is a primary abiotic factor affecting the R:S weight ratio of plants. We set up two groups of buckwheat with Group A grown at room temperature (27 °C) and Group B grown at a moderately hot temperature(32°C). We predicted that temperature would effect buckwheat’s resource allocation and that the buckwheat at the hot temperature would grow smaller R:S weight ratio than at room temperature. We found that the mean of R:S weight ratio of buckwheat at 32°C is smaller than that at 27°C, but the two-sample t-test with one tail shows that the difference is not significant enough to support our hypothesis. This paper supposes that global warming can possibly increase the production of shoots of buckwheat, and thus alleviate the problem of food shortage. 

Introduction:
	In any ecological community, there are two major groups of factors that can influence the growth, fitness, and reproduction of organisms. The first is biotic factors, which are the interaction among organisms, such as competition and predation. The second is abiotic factors, which are the environmental stimuli originated from non-living sources, such as the concentration of carbon dioxide, sunlight, and temperature [Johnson: 2017]. Temperature is the abiotic factor this paper focuses on. The amount of usable abiotic factors that are essential to the survival of organisms is not unlimited, and organisms always need more resources than are available on the planet. Due to this selection force, plants develop strategies of resource allocation to make use of the limited resources more reasonably, and thus increase the survivorship.
	Resource allocation is defined as the pattern in which a species distributes more energy and mass to grow a particular structure, thus reducing the amount of energy it spends elsewhere in order to more efficiently use the limited resources [Johnson: 2017]. It is an evolutionary trade-off for organisms. For plant growth, resources can always be meaningfully divided into the part above ground, called shoots, and the part below the soil surface, called roots. Leaves, part of the shoots, are the principal photosynthetic organs gathering light and carbon in the atmosphere, while the roots are the part in charge of gaining water and nutrients for plant growth and anchoring the plants into the soil [Johnson : 2017]. The ratio of roots to shoots weight is a good way to illustrate resource allocation. When allocating resources, plants always expand more energy to grow the structure that is used to obtain the limited resources. For example, in the rainforest, there are plenty of tall trees that prevent light from reaching the understory, and then light becomes the limited resource for the understory plants. In order to capture enough light energy for photosynthesis, these small and short plants distribute more energy to grow larger and heavier shoots rather than roots, and thus grow smaller R:S ratio. 
	Temperature, as a primary abiotic factor, can also affect plant growth by influencing the rate of photosynthesis [Hatfield & Prueger: 2015]. In Powles’s plant growth experiment, which studied the effect of chilling temperature on the inhibition of photosynthesis, fully expanded leaves of 25°C grown Phaseolus vulgaris and six other species were exposed for 3 hours to chilling temperatures. Four of the species displayed substantial inhibition of CO2 uptake, indicating the reduction of the photochemical efficiency of photosynthesis [Powles et al: 1983]. 
	High temperature, whether transitory or constant, can also cause physiological changes that limit the rate of photosynthesis [Song et al: 2014] In this paper, we study the effect of moderate heat stress on buckwheat’s resource allocation. We chose buckwheat as our experimental subjects because it is a typical low input plant and is capable of rapid plant development [Kreft & Luthar: 1990]. Also, the optimum photosynthetic intensity for buckwheat is between 15°C - 25°C.  Given the information we have above, we predict that temperature has an effect on the resource allocation and that the buckwheat will have larger R:S ratio of weight at room temperature (27°C) than at a hot temperature (32°C).

Materials and Methods:
We harvested two groups of buckwheat with three pots in each group. The buckwheat in Group A was grown in the room temperature 27 °C, and Group B was put into the incubator with temperature 32°C. In each pot, we harvested approximately 250 buckwheat for two weeks while controlling the amount of light, water, and the concentration of nutrients for every pot. After two weeks, we took out Group A of buckwheat first and pulled out three buckwheats in each pot with the adhered medium.
	We washed them gently in a container of water and patted them dry with a paper towel before we weighed the whole plants individually and recorded the mass. We used scissors to break apart the roots from the shoots, weighed only the shoots, and recorded the mass. We then got the weight of roots by subtracting the mass of the whole plants by the shoots mass. We repeated the procedure for Group B and recorded the mass in a separated table.
	After the collection of data, we used excel to calculate the mean R:S weight ratio and standard deviation of the mean weight of buckwheat in Group A and Group B separately. 


Results:
According to figure 1, which summarizes the mean R:S weight ratio of buckwheat at room temperature 27°C and at hot temperature 32°C, the mean of R:S weight ratio at room temperature is 0.2178±0.2436, which is larger than the mean of R:S weight ratio 0.1441±0.0727 at hot temperature most of the time. However, after we used a two-sample t-test with one tail to analyze the data we collect, we find out that the mean of R:S weight ratio in Group A is not significantly greater than that of Group B (t-stat = 0.8697, df = 16, P = 0.397), and thus we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.


Discussion:
	The rate of plant growth is dependent upon the temperature surrounding the plant, and each species has a specific temperature range represented by a minimum, maximum, and optimum [Hatfield & Prueger: 2015]. We know that the optimum photosynthetic intensity for buckwheat is between 15°C - 25°C. And, from figure 1, the mean of R:S weight ratio in 32°C temperature is smaller than the mean of R:S weight ratio in 27°C, which is closer to the optimum photosynthetic intensity for buckwheat. 
        In 2014, Sinsawat et al conducted an experiment to study the effect of moderate heat stress on the rate of photosynthesis by investigating the means of chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen evolution of maize seedlings grown at 25 °C or 41 °C. Maze seedlings grown at 25 °C to 35 °C for 20 minutes displayed transient inhibition of the rate of photosynthesis, and those grown at 45 °C led to permanent damage [Sinsawat et al: 2004].
	This study of maze seedlings can be used to explain the behavior of our experimental subject buckwheat. When the temperature reaches 32°C, it is too hot for buckwheat to operate photosynthesis normally and the rate of photosynthesis decreases. Since the shoots of the plants are the principal photosynthetic organ in charge of gathering light and carbon, and plants should maintain proportionally more biomass in the organ that acquires the most limiting resource [Reich et al: 2014], buckwheat in the hot temperature grew larger R:S weight ratios in order to capture more light energy and carbon to maintain their life. However, the statistical test provides P-value 0.397 that is too large for us to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot conclude that temperature has an effect on the resource allocation. We also cannot conclude that the buckwheat will have larger R:S ratio of weight at room temperature (27°C) than at a hot environment (32°C).
	There are two possible reasons that the mean R:S weight ratios of two groups are not significantly different enough. First, due to the lack of laboratory apparatus, the difference of temperature in two groups is not large enough to create a largely different R:S weight ratio. The experiment will be more efficient if the experimenters try more significantly different temperatures and try more groups. For example, the experimenters can set up five groups of plants with temperature 10°C, 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C. Secondly, although buckwheat is a low input plant with rapid growth, it is not a good choice for this experiment because their roots are too thin and fragile. When we pulled buckwheat out of the pots, we always broke parts of the roots and thus the mass of the roots we recorded was not accurate. The experimenters in the future study should choose low input plants with stronger roots to make the result of the experiment more reliable.   	
	Energizing and nutritious, buckwheat is available throughout the year and can be served as an alternative to rice or made into porridge. It’s also related to rhubarb and sorrel, making it a suitable substitute for grains for people who are sensitive to wheat or other grains that contain protein glutens. Since global warming is getting more serious today, how will it affect the resource allocation of buckwheat? In 2014, a group of scientists compiled and analyzed a large dataset (>6,200 forests, 61 countries) to study temperature-related patterns of biomass fractions in roots, stems, and leaves of forests. The result shows that the proportion of total forest biomass in roots is decreasing and the biomass in foliage is increasing in warmer climates [Reich et al: 2014]. This finding can be applied to our own experiment and set up the relationship between resource allocation by buckwheat and today’s warming temperatures: although people have an increasing concern with global warming today, moderately increasing hot climates can actually stimulate buckwheat to allocate more resources to grow shoots, which are the edible parts for humans. Under the effect of global warming, it is possible that the increasing temperature can unexpectedly alleviate the food shortage over the world.
