Title:  The Effect of Lidocaine on the Threshold of the Sciatic Nerve in <i>Rana pipiens</i> 

Abstract:
Sodium channels in neurons are responsible for the depolarization waves that allow neurons to signal. Lidocaine blocks Na+ channels, keeping neurons at resting potential, stopping neural signalling. In this experiment, Lidocaine’s ability to inhibit neural signaling in frog legs was tested by stimulating the sciatic nerve in Rana pipiens frog legs treated with Lidocaine. Each leg was used as its own control before being treated with Lidocaine. The minimum voltages needed to signal control legs to twitch were compared to the minimum voltage needed to signal lidocaine legs to twitch. This minimum voltage is the threshold of the neuron. A paired t-test between the control and treatment groups revealed that the difference between the distributions was not statistically significant, indicating that the Lidocaine had little effect on signaling.  This does not concur with other research in this area. The result in this experiment could be due to the low molarity of the lidocaine solution used in this experiment compared to other experiments of this type, but further testing is needed.

Introduction:
Neurons make up the nervous system, which controls muscle function. These neurons can be inhibited, stopping muscle function. Sodium channels are used to depolarize the cell membrane of neurons [Sadava: 2017]. Although other channels are utilized to maintain polarization and to repolarize the neuron, sodium channels are the key to depolarization, and therefore neural signaling [Catterall: 2000]. Once the neuron is depolarized by an action potential, Na+ ion channels open down the neuron, creating a wave of depolarization. In the Rana pipiens frog leg, the gastrocnemius muscle is controlled by the sciatic nerve. When the sciatic nerve is stimulated the depolarization of the presynaptic membrane releases Acetylcodeine (ACh) into the neural cleft. The ACh activates Na+ channels in the muscle cell membrane, which create an action potential in the T tubules of the muscle. This causes the Ryanodine receptor to release Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing the myosin to bind to the troponin in the actin, allowing the muscle to contract [Sadava: 2017].
 This experiment tests the effectiveness of Lidocaine as a sodium channel blocker. The independent variable is the Lidocaine treatment. The dependent variable is the volts of stimulation needed for the muscle to twitch (the indicator that the muscle received the signal from the nerve). This minimum voltage is the threshold, the minimum volts needed to produce an action potential.It is hypothesized that the sodium channel blocker, Lidocaine will stop the sciatic nerve from depolarizing when stimulated, keeping the muscle from contracting.  If this hypothesis is supported, this experiment will add to the body of research supporting that Lidocaine is a compound that prohibits signaling in nerve cells.
The Rana pipiens was used in this experiment because they have a simple nervous structure for the gastrocnemius muscle.

Materials and Methods:
 <i>Rana pipiens</i> frog legs were used for testing, and the frogs were kept in accordance with IACUC standards. The first leg was skinned and sprayed with Ringer’s solution. The inner thigh muscles were separated, and the sciatic nerve was freed from surrounding tissue, but not detached, to allow for easy simulation. The gastrocnemius muscle was suspended from the tendon to allow for free movement and ease of observation. The nerve was stimulated via a sleeve electrode connected to a FT-302 transducer. The FT-302 output data was collected using labscribe software. To test the minimum voltage needed for signalling to the muscle, the voltage output of the force transducer was increased by increments of .05 until a muscle twitch was observed. The voltage that produced the twitch was then repeated to insure accurate results. After a twitch in the leg was recorded, 1ml of 25mM lidocaine was applied. A hypodermic needle was used to inject the muscle with the lidocaine at the base of the muscle and the center of the muscle. Needles were disposed of in the proper sharps container. The voltage output of the force transducer was again increased by increments of .05 until a muscle twitch was observed. This procedure was then repeated two additional times with different legs to ensure accuracy. The voltage threshold distributions of the control group and Lidocaine treated group were compared using a paired t-test.

Results:
In the first and third trials, the lidocaine-treated frog legs had higher thresholds than the control legs. However, in the second trial the threshold in the lidocaine treated test was identical to the untreated test. A paired t-test was performed comparing the control threshold distribution to the lidocaine treated threshold distribution. The result was a p-value of 0.18. 

The first two trials of data were collected by our research group. The third trial completed by the group resulted in the Lidocaine treated leg indicating a lower threshold. Because the third trial was a clear outlier, it was rejected from the analyzed data. To compensate for the lack of a third trial, lab pool data was used for the third data set. 


Discussion:
The data did not support the hypothesis that the lidocaine would stop all signalling to the gastrocnemius muscle. The t-test revealed that although two of the three trials had higher thresholds in the lidocaine treated muscles, the lidocaine results were not statistically significantly different from the control muscles. This means that the lidocaine had no statistically significant effect on the signalling ability of the nerve.
	This is a stark contrast from other research in this area [Chen: 2000], [Kai: 1993]. The difference could be due to the concentration of lidocaine used. Previous studies have shown that Lidocaine has diminishing effects as the concentration decreases under 40mM [Bainton: 1994]. This study used 25mM Lidocaine. The low molarity could account for the lack of signalling inhibition observed in this experiment. A lower molarity could decrease the number of sodium channels affected by the lidocaine treatment. The increase in stimulus needed in trials one and three shows that the lidocaine could have had some effect. This supports that the lidocaine solution inhibited some of the Na+ channels, but left most of them unaffected.
	To test this hypothesis, another experiment should be run in which Lidocaine concentrations are increased incrementally, and the threshold is measured. This could clarify if the lower Lidocaine molarity was the the cause of these results, or if Lidocaine potency was inhibited by another compounding factor.
	Lidocaine research is needed to understand the amounts of Lidocaine in clinical scenarios, where it is most used. It is also important to understand the mechanisms of nervous system inhibitors, as this allows for better understanding of the nervous system.
