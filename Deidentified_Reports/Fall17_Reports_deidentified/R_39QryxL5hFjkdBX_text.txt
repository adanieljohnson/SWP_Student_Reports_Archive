Title: The Effect of Lidocaine on the Neuromuscular System

Abstract:
Abstract
In this experiment we discovered the effect of lidocaine on the gastrocnemius and sciatic nerve of the Northern Leopard Frog. Our hypothesis was if the muscle was injected with lidocaine the contractions would significantly lower than a muscle without lidocaine. We measured the twitch threshold by the nerve to get our results. We noticed that once we injected the lidocaine and waited 5 minutes to stimulate all the contractions that followed were very low in voltage and some could not be seen by looking at the muscle. We concluded that lidocaine made the contractions of the gastrocnemius less powerful like we predicted. 


Introduction:
Introduction
	This experiment explores the neuromuscular system of the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, in a process known as excitation-contraction coupling. It begins with an action potential traveling along a nerve cell to the neuromuscular junction, where it depolarizes the neuron causing the release of Ach. This neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on the muscle fiber, opening up sodium channels and creating an action potential in the muscle fiber. This stimulates the release of Ca+2, ultimately causing the muscle to contract and the re-uptake of the Ca+2 causes the muscle fiber to relax (Johnson AD. )This process can be shown with the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens. The activities of the muscle can be monitored through a monogram. Lidocaine is an anesthetic that causes temporary numbness in the skin by blocking nerve signals in the body(WebMD, 2017). We hypothesized that with the injection of lidocaine into the gastrocnemius of the frog will cause the muscle to produce weak or no contractions. 


Materials and Methods:
Methods
	For our experiment, we first had to isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve from three different frog legs. We had to remove the skin from each frog leg by pulling it down to the frog’s foot. Next we used Ringer’s solution to moisten each in a dissecting pan. Then we separated the inner thigh muscles of the frog leg to expose the sciatic nerve. We then had to use scissors to cut the gastrocnemius muscle from the leg of the frog.  We secured the frog legs in the dissecting pan  by tying the gastrocnemius muscle to a stand with string and we clamped the top part of the leg to the dissecting pan. We connected the sciatic nerve to a sleeve electrode and connected that to the adapter. We ran tests to determine the twitch threshold through nerve stimulation.  The threshold voltage was determined when we increased the stimulus voltage increments of 0.1V. We tested to a pulse amplitude of 0.5 at 1 pulse and then used the threshold to test the stimulation at 5 pulses. Next we injected the gastrocnemius muscle with 0.2 ml of lidocaine and waited 5 minutes for the muscle to relax. Then we repeated the same process that we used for the untreated leg. We repeated this on two other frog legs and recorded the data.

Discussion
Our results proved that when the gastrocnemius muscle was injected with lidocaine the voltage of the contractions was significantly lower than the untreated gastrocnemius. The lower results after the lidocaine injection can be proven due to the fact that lidocaine blocks the signals from the sciatic nerve to the gastrocnemius muscle. The results show that when we stimulated the leg without lidocaine it was able to contract consistently with 1 pulse or 5 pulses but when we injected the lidocaine the muscle wasn’t able to contract consistently at 1 pulse or 5 pulses.  Our results supported our hypothesis because we knew the contractions after the injection would be very weak or absent. A possible error we could’ve encountered was inadequate measurements of the lidocaine injections. We also don’t know if the size of the frog leg played a role in the ability to contract with an injection of lidocaine.
