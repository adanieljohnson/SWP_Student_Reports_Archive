Title: Lidocaine’s Effects on Stimulus Response Rate of the Gastrocnemius Muscle (Rana pipiens) when Stimulated through the Sciatic Nerve

Abstract:
We worked with the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens to demonstrate the properties of neuromuscular control. We viewed the effects lidocaine has on muscle tension and neuromuscular control. Our null hypothesis was that there would be no change or an increase in response when stimulating the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts after injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with lidocaine. Our alternative hypothesis was that there would be a decrease in response when stimulating the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts after injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with lidocaine. Three frog legs were used in this experiment. They each served as their own control. We injected each experimental gastrocnemius muscle with 0.2 ml of 25mM lidocaine. There was an overall decrease in the average response of our experimental group. However, our P-value was 0.57375 which was not below our alpha level of 0.05. The results were not significant and we failed to reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis was not supported (P= 0.5375, t= 0.666377, df=2).

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles can respond in miliseconds. Axons of motor neurons extend into a muscle and then branch out to myofibers at neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2016]. Muscle tension is generated by spatial and temporal summation. We will be viewing the effects lidocaine has on muscle tension and neuromuscular control. Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker [Binshtok: 2009]. Sodium channels are necessary to depolarize the cell membrane and generate action potentials. Blocking sodium channels disrupts action potential generation and prevents information transmission to the central nervous system [Binshtok: 2009]. ACh crosses the neuromuscular junction and binds to the specific ligand-gated channels. The influx of sodium depolarizes the cell and causes sodium voltage-gated channels to open to propagate the action potential. We will be using a myogram to visualize the inner workings of a muscle twitch. A myogram gives a visual to muscle twitches and has a latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase [Johnson: 2016]. We will be working with the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens to demonstrate properties of neuromuscular control. Rana pipiens were bred to complete experimental designs like this one and to be worked with to understand muscle tension and neuromuscular control. Our null hypothesis is that there will be no change or increase in response when stimulating the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts after injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with lidocaine. Our alternative hypothesis is that there will be a decrease in response when the sciatic nerve is stimulated with 1.0 volts after injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with lidocaine. The dependent variable is stimulus response measured in volts. The independent variable is the injection of lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle. 



Materials and Methods:
Methods:
Three frog legs were used in this experiment. They each served as its own control. To prepare the leg, we pulled the skin down towards the foot, moistened with ringer’s solution, separated inner thigh muscles, and freed the sciatic nerve. Then we placed an electrode on the sciatic nerve and suspended the gastrocnemius muscle as shown in Diagram 1.

After the preparation, we stimulated the gastrocnemius muscle through the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts and record the response with Labscribe. Repeat for all 3 controls. 
We injected each of the 3 gastrocnemius muscles with 0.2 ml of 25mM lidocaine. We evenly injected the lidocaine throughout the muscle. Then we stimulated the gastrocnemius muscle through the sciatic nerve with 1.0 volts and recorded the response. This was repeated for all 3 treatments. 
To evaluate the data we used a 1-tailed paired t-test to determine if the null hypothesis could be rejected or if we failed to reject the null hypothesis. An alpha level of α=0.05 was used. The control and treatment groups were compared.

Error Bars Represent the Standard Deviation while the Data Bars Represent the Response in volts. (P= 0.5375, t= 0.666377, df=2)

The control group (n=3) response was an average of 0.417 volts. The experimental group (n=3) response was an average of 0.308 volts. The response rate for experimental 1 increased while experimental 2 and 3 decreased. 


Discussion:
Our P-value was 0.57375 which is not below our alpha level of 0.05. The results are not significant and we failed to reject our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis was not supported (P= 0.5375, t= 0.666377, df=2). There was an overall decrease in the average response rate of our experimental group. This could have been caused by the incomplete propagation down the neuron. Blocking sodium channels disrupts action potential generation [Binshtok: 2009] and this in turn could explain why experimental 2 and 3 had decreased firing rate. Since threshold was reached, the lidocaine did not result in a complete block of all sodium channels. Experimental 1 increased its firing rate after the injection of lidocaine. This must have been due to experimental error since the blocking of sodium channels disrupts action potential generation. The increase in response for experimental 1 also contributed to a high p-value. Our limitation was our sample size. A larger sample size gives a smaller standard deviations of the sample mean and is more representative. An increase in sample size could make our data significant. Our next step would be to expand this research to test its effectiveness with different concentrations of lidocaine. We would want to know which dose is sufficient to result in a significant decrease in response rate and which dose results in the most significant decrease.
