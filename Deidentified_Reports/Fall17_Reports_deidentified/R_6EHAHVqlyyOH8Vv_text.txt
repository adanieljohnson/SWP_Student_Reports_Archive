Title: Tetraethylammonium Chlorides effect on Muscle Twitch Amplitude

Abstract:
The electrical events of muscle contraction involve 3 main ions Na+ to generate an action potential and depolarize a cell, Ca2+ to stimulate the contractile mechanism and K+ to repolarize the cell backing to resting potential. Each of these ions travel through gated channels that must be opened for any ion movement to occur. This experiment considers what happens to the myogram peaks of muscle contraction units when K+ gated channels are blocked. The Northern Leopard frog’s gastrocnemus muscle was studied using iWorx software and tetraethylammonium chloride was used as the potassium channel blocker. The blocker was predicted to cause a difference in the peak amplitudes of the muscle twitches from the myograms. During the study the frog was stimulated at different volts and then injected with the solution. These results were recorded and a paired t_test was performed on the raw data collected. The t_test revealed that the difference between the treatment and controllls groups were statistically significent. Tetraethylammonium chloride appeared to cause a difference in the muscle twitch amplitudes of the gastrocnemus muscle of the frogs studied.

Introduction:
Neuronal signals are electrical events which involves ion transfer, depolarization, and repolarizations [Sadava: 2016]. The three main ions, Ca2+, Na+, and K+, travel down their individual concentration gradients to eventually stimulate an action potential. At synapses between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber, or neuromuscular junctions (Sadava 2016), “nerve impulses can cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh)” from the presynaptic cell [Johnson: 2017]. ACh is a neurotransmitter that will bind to the muscle fiber membrane and open the Na+ gated channels [Johnson: 2017]. Once these channels are opened Na+ will flood down its concentration into the cell causing the fiber to depolarize [Sadava: 2016]. The release of Na+ ions raises the membrane potential of the fiber to threshold and generate and action potential [Sadava:2016]. The action potential propagates down axons of the cell and causes depolarization [Sadava:2016]. Depolarization of the cell will cause the ryanodine gate on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to open which will cause Ca2+ ions to rush out of the lumen of the SR into the sarcoplasm, due to a strong concentration gradient [Sadava: 2016]. This Ca2+ will travel through the sarcoplasm and eventually activate the contractile unit of the fiber to shorten [Johnson: 2017]. As Na+ continues to enter the cell, the membrane potential will continue climbing which stimulates the opening of K+ gated channels to cancel out the positive charge [Sadava:2016]. K+ ions then will flood down its gradient out of the cell which decreases the membrane potential and repolarizes the cell [Sadava:2016]. The electrical events can be studied and monitored using myograms, which record a single muscle twitch [Johnson: 2017]. A twitch is the minimum unit of contraction ant a stimulus can make [Sadava: 2016].
The goal of this experiment was to determine how restricting the gated potassium channels can affect contraction in mammal skeletal muscles. These parameters were studied by examining twitch amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle in Northern Leopard frogs. Using the muscles of Northern Leopard frogs, of the phyla Rania Pipiens, is useful because the frog’s gastrocnemus is very similar to that of mammal calf muscles. Therefore, using the frog’s leg muscle is an easy and inexpensive way to study these functions. In addition, in order to study the contractile units in a lab the contractile units must work, therefore the frogs were kept alive until just before completing the lab. Frogs are easier to maintain for these conditions. To study the gated potassium channels, we used a tetraethylammonium treatment on the frog legs. Tetraethylammonium (TEA Cl), has been proven to be a gated potassium channel blocker and “delays the outward potassium current” during contraction [Stanfield: 1970]. During our experiment we used 100 mM of TEA Cl by dissolving 1.7g of it in 100 Ml of Ringers solution. We predict that blocking the potassium channels in the gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs, using TEA Cl, will result in a difference in muscle twitch amplitude when compared with a controlll group.


Materials and Method:
The frogs were skinned by hand and exposing the both the gastrocnemus and soleus muscles. The Achilles tendon was then cut using laboratory scissors to separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the bone and then tied the muscle off with thread. After tying off the muscle we set up the apparatus for direct muscle stimulation, by hanging the muscle up by the string (and applying a slight amount of tension to the string) and applying 2 probes directly to the muscle. The iWorx software was used to monitor the muscle twitches on our computer. Once the system was accurately set up, we started the stimulation on the first frog leg, without injecting it with anything, at 0 volts and observed the resulting amplitude of the muscle twitch. After we increased the stimulation in 0.1 increments until we got to 0.5 increments. During each stimulation we monitored the amplitude of each twitch and recorded it in our notebooks. After stimulating the muscle with 0.5 volts we skipped stimulating the 0.6-0.9 volts and stimulated with 1 volt to observe higher amplitudes. We increased our stimulation voltages from 1-5 in increments of 1 and recorded our observations each time. Once the frog leg was stimulated with 5 volts we saved our data under “Control Frog Leg 1” and prepared for treatments. We injected 0.2 Ml of tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA Cl) directly into the muscle, while being careful not to insert the needle too far into the muscle (making sure that the chemical is being injected into the muscle and not outside of it). After injection waited about 30 seconds for the muscle to absorb the blocker and then began stimulated the muscle under the same conditions done previously to the leg (increasing by 0.1 increments from 0 to 0.5 and then increasing by 1 increment from 1-5). After we finished the treatment stimulation of frog leg, the data was again saved under “Treatment Frog Leg 2.” We repeated this process for both frog leg two and three and then compared the results. Throughout the lab we maintained our leg by wash it with Ringers solution every now and then to make sure the leg never dried out. We took certain safety measures to complete the lab making sure to wear gloves at all times when handling any part of the frog. Once the lab was completed every piece of equipment was cleaned of with ethanol and the disposed frog legs in designated bags at the back of the room.

Results:
From the plot the treatment legs have smaller standard deviations than the controlll group legs. The amplitude of each muscle twitches for the treatments group were generally lower than the amplitudes of the controlll grog for both for each frog leg. In addition, for the most part the treatment frog legs began twitching at lower voltage stimulations compared to the controlll group legs. However, after adding TEA in our third frog leg, the twitches began at higher voltages than that of the controlll group. The experiment had t-values of 2.64, 2.46, 3.21 for Frog Leg 1, 2, and 3 respectively. After running a paired t_test the p values for frog leg 1 was p=0.0245, p=0.0334 for 2, and p=0.0093 for the third frog leg. In addition, there were 10 stimulation values for each frog used in our sample so the degrees of freedom for each frog leg was 11.

Discussion:
After injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA Cl) presented an experimental difference in the muscle twitch amplitude of each frog leg. These differences were statistically significent since every p value was less than 0.05. Since our data was statistically significent, the null hypothesis was rejected, there is strong evidence that blocking the potassium channels in gastrocnemus muscle will cause a difference in muscle twitch amplitude compared to a controlll group. In addition, since the first to frog legs injected with TEA Cl (Frog leg 1 and 2) demonstrated twitches at lower voltages than the controlll frog legs, one can assume that TEA lowered the threshold for the muscle fibers. This finding is -supported by Stanfield’s study who found that “TEA tended to shift the threshold” of membrane potentials of those muscles that were stimulated [Stanfield: 1970]. In addition, Stanfield found that TEA affects the overall kinetics of the twitch [Stanfield: 1970], which supports our experiment because the twitches treatment frog leg had a smaller standard deviation (SD) than that of the controlll legs. Since the treatment had a lower SD, then one can assume that the muscle twitch amplitude were increasing slower than the controlll group; therefore, the maximum contraction amplitude values would occur at later voltages for the treatment group. However, during maximum contraction was not a focus for this study and we did not stimulate the treatment frog legs to maximum contractions. It would be useful to include these values in future studies and stimulate the frog legs injected with TEA Cl to maximum contraction in the future. In addition, we only used a very small sample size of only 3 frogs. This small sample makes it difficult to extrapolate the results for a general population, so increasing the number of frog legs would greatly improve our study if done in the future.
