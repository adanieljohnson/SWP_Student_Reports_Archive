Title: Aggression Levels of Betta splendens Based on Fish Color

Abstract:
In our experiment, we observed and tested the facing movement aggressive behaviors of male betta fish of different colors. We did this by timing how long the betta fish displayed their red mane. We used an ANOVA test and followed with a Turkey-Kramer test to test the significance of their behaviors. Our hypothesis was that there would be an increase in aggressive behaviors for bettas of different colors. Our ANOVA results showed that there was no significant difference in aggression levels of Betta splendens based on color, therefore color playing no role in aggression levels. There was no increase in duration of time spent displaying a red mane for red vs. blue betta fish. This could have been due to them getting tired, they may have gone into habituation, or that color doesn’t matter to aggression levels. Our results showed that betta fish will always display aggressive behaviors towards each other, regardless of color, disproving our hypothesis that there would be an increase in aggressive behaviors for bettas of different colors. Therefore, it is important for pet stores, aquarium owners, and researchers to know that betta fish will fight each other when they live together and serious cautions should be taken.

Introduction:
In this experiment, we tried to understand the typical pattern of behavior and how/why the allocation pattern changes in Betta splendens fish in response to certain conditions and stimuli. We tried to understand and explain these behaviors based on their evolutionary basis. Betta fish exhibit aggressive behaviors when in contact with other betta fish. Intraspecific behaviors are very important to determining the level of aggression. These intraspecific behaviors include broadside movements, facing movements, and agonistic behaviors to display their aggression. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing, all listed in level of aggression. Facing movements include erection of the pectoral fins, spreading the opercula, and displaying their “red mane”, all listed in level of aggression (Johnson, AD. 2017). We believed that fish color would be a certain stimulus that would evoke an intraspecific behavior of the Betta fish. Their color is so intense and each fish differs greatly in color that we believed there would be some type of aggression stimulus. Before selective breeding, Betta fish would change their colors when their aggression levels increased in the presence of another male. However, selective breeding has caused Betta fish to maintain their intense aggressive colors at rest, so we wanted to test if their colors have an effect on their aggression. It has been shown in previous studies that betta fish responded less to other betta fish with color like their own (Thompson and Sturm. 1965). Therefore, in our experiment, we observed and tested the aggressive behaviors of male betta fish of different colors. We did this by timing how long the betta fish displayed their red mane. We chose to focus on the red mane because it is the most aggressive form of facing movements. We hypothesized that there would be an increase in aggressive behaviors for bettas of different colors. 

Materials and Methods:
We had three trials of blue to blue male betta fish control, three trials of red to red male betta fish control, and three trials of blue to red betta fish experimental. We placed two blue fish and two red fish in separate tanks separated by a glass barrier and opaque barrier. For each trial, we removed the opaque barrier to observe the betta fish. We observed the duration of the betta fish display of their red mane by timing on our cell phones. Each of the trials lasted five minutes with five minutes of rest time. We then tested the significance of their behaviors with an ANOVA test and followed with a Turkey-Kramer test. 

Results:
The ANOVA showed that there was no significant difference (r2=1.109, d.f=17, P=0.356) in aggression levels of Betta splendens for the control groups or the red vs. blue experimental groups. There was no increase in duration of time spent displaying a red mane for red vs. blue betta fish. In fact, the graph shows red vs blue betta fish to be smaller than red vs. red and blue vs. blue (Figure 1). The ANOVA test showed that the control blue on blue had a mean of 143 +/- 61.94, the control red on red had a mean of 172.83+/- 90.82, and the experimental red/blue had a mean of 103.33+/- 87.60. The ANOVA test was not significant; therefore, the Turkey Kramer test was not significant. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that there would be an increase in aggressive behaviors for bettas of different colors was not supported by our data. Perhaps this was due to their environment being altered and them getting tired after being placed in more than one tank. In addition, it is possible that that the fishes may have gone into habituation which would decrease the duration of a red mane display. A study done on red and blue betta fish found that females were more sexually attracted to red males than blue males (Clotfelter, Ardia, and McGraw. 2017). This is interesting, because there is an increased color response for sexual selection, but, based on our results, there is not an increased color response for aggression. An experiment could be done on the aggression levels of females to red males and females to blue males to see if the aggression levels were changing. However, because our results showed a display of red mane to every fish color, it appears that betta fish will always display aggressive behaviors towards each other, regardless of color. During the trials, if one of the fishes exhibited habituation or got tired, the other fish was almost always displaying its red mane. It is shown that a betta fish will almost always exhibit aggressive behavior towards another betta fish. Therefore, it is important for pet stores, aquarium owners, and researchers to know that betta fish will fight each other when in the presence of each other. Cautions should be taken or betta fish should not live together in the same tank or serious injury and/or death to the fish could be the result.
