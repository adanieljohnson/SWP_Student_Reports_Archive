Title: Effects of Various Light Intensities on Resource Allocation in Pisum sativun

Abstract:
Plants rely on sunlight to power photosynthesis and without this sunlight, plants would without usable energy necessary to support life. Differing amounts of sunlight lead to differing amounts of energy available, thus plants with low amounts of sunlight available must function differently than those with high amounts of sunlight available to gain this essential energy. We are interested in the way that plants allocate their resources based upon the amount of light they receive. We will use the plant Pisum sativun to test this hypothesis by putting some in a high intensity environment and some in a low intensity environment. We predict that plants exposed to shaded conditions will allocate more resources to shoot growth than root growth and plants exposed to direct sunlight will allocate more resources to root growth than shoot growth. Overall, we saw a higher R:S ratio in pea plants in shaded conditions however, our results were not statistically significent enough to make any conclusions.

Introduction:
equation for photosynthesis. Without receiving adequate amounts of solar energy plants are unable to attain enough usable energy, thus they are unable to perform the necessary functions needed to sustain life. Furthermore, in the absence of sufficient energy plants are forced to allocate their resources in the most efficient ways. Hence, plants in higher light exposure will allocate their resources and perform differently than those in low light exposure. We want to know what differences in resource allocation occur with variance in light intensity and ultimately what physical effects they have on plants. In order to answer this question, we need to analyze the levels of growth in different aspects of a single plant species, Pisum sativun. Pisum sativun, or field pea plants, are ideal because they are quick-growing and thus we will be able to observe large amounts of growth in the two weeks (Kelman, 2012). We predict that Pisum sativun in the high light intensity environment will allocate more resources to roots and will have a larger root to shoot ratio than those in low light intensity environments. On the contrary, we predict that Pisum sativun in the low light intensity environment will allocate more resources to shoots and will have a smaller root to shoot ratio.

Materials and Method:
We planted Pisum sativun seeds in six containers with soil that was thoroughly watered. We randoMly assigned 3 of the plants to the light treatment group, in direct sunlight, and 3 to the controlll group, in shaded conditions. placed the light treatment group in an area of the greenhouse that receives full and direct sunlight and we placed the shade group in an area of the greenhouse that is covered by a mesh cloth that inhibits direct sunlight. We watered the plants until the soil is thoroughly wet daily for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks we removed the Pisum sativun from the soil and took measurements of the plant’s root and shoot mass with a scale and of the root and shoot length with a ruler. We then computed a two sample, one tailed t_test for the significance of our results. 

Results:
Overall, we observed that the R:S Length Ratio tended to be smaller in the Pisum sativun in the shaded environment, 1.28 g than in direct sunlight environment, 1.46 g. Also, we observed that in general the R:S Weight Ratio tended to be smaller in the Pisum sativun in the shaded environment than in the direct sunlight environment, however, an outlier in the shaded environment group caused skewed results and thus caused the mean R:S weight ratio to be higher in the Pisum sativun in the shaded environment, .61 g than in the sunlight environment, .46 g. The mean R:S weight ratio for field peas in the shaded environment indicates that for every 1 gram in shoot weight there is on average .61 in root weight. The mean R:S weight ratio for field peas in the direct sunlight environment indicates that for every 1 gram in shoot weight there is on average .46 grams in root weight. The mean R:S length ratio for field peas in the shaded environment indicates that for every 1 mm in shoot length there is on average 1.28 mm in root length. The standard deviation for R:S weight ratio is The standard deviation for R:S length ratio is 0.108 for field peas in the shaded environment and 0.404 in direct sunlight conditions. The standard deviation for R:S length ratio is 0.108 for field peas in shaded conditions and 0.344 in direct sunlight conditions. The mean R:S length ratio for field peas in the shaded environment indicates that for every 1 mm in shoot length there is on average 1.46 grams in root weight. For R:S Weight Ratio the degrees of freedom is 1, the t statistic is .6213, and the p_value is 0.2954. For R:S Length Ratio the degrees of freedom is 1, the t statistic is -0.8647, the p_value .7674. Neither of these tests are statistically significent as neither 0.2954 and 0.7674 are smaller than the alpha value, 0.05.

Discussion:
Our results support our hypothesis because in our data we saw a larger root to shoot length ratio in the plants exposed to direct light as opposed to those not exposed to direct light. This is supported by our data showing an average R:S length ratio for Pisum sativun in shaded conditions t is 1.46 mm while the the R:S length ratio for Pisum sativun in shaded conditions was only 1.28 mm. The reason for the smaller R:S ratio in the plants in shaded conditions is because the lack of essential sunlight makes it necessary for these plants to allocate more resources into growing taller shoots in order to reach sunlight whereas this is not necessary in plants already exposed to adequate sunlight. As is stated in A. Carl Leopold’s work photosynthesis is generated by light, thus the plant will put as much of its resources as necessary into getting that light (Leopold, 1964). Our findings are consistent with those of E. C. Wassink and J. A. J. Stolwijk as they observed in their own research that plants in low light conditions generally all had extremely long stems (Wassink & Stolwijk, 1956). Our hypothesis, however, was not supported by the R:S weight ratio as the weight of the Pisum sativun in the shaded environment was .61 grams, much higher than the .46 grams of the Pisum sativun in direct sunlight. In the future a larger sample size might help to decrease overall variation in our data according to the statistical law of large numbers.. In the future this experiment can also be broadened to assess the impact of light intensity on entire plots of land. The results could potentially benefit farmers in knowing the best areas to plant crops as was the case in M. J. Kasperbauer’s experiment studying the effects of light distribution on tobacco plant growth (Kaserbauer, 1970).
