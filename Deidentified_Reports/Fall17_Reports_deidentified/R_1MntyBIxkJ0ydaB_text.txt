Title: The effects of various colored fake fish on the agnostic behavior of male Betta splendins specimen

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to identify the cause of agnostic behaviors demonstrated by the male species of fish Betta slpendens. Male betta fish typically show specific aggressive behavior when exposed to other male betta fish. Of the physical characteristics of male betta fish, their vibrant colors are the most notable. Thus, we hypothesized that color has an impact on male betta’s aggressive behaviors. Using differently-colored fake fish as treatments and observing the male betta fish selected for experimentation, we timed in seconds how long the betta fish would swim or stay in the same half of the tank as the fake fish. Our results proved that color did not have a significent effect on the behavior of the betta. In fact, they hardly acknowledged the existence of the fake fish. Save any potential confounding variables, we believe that this data at least helps show that betta fish are not chaotically aggressive, and can identify potential threats—color is simply not an indicator of threat.

Introduction:
In the world of ethology, the study of animal behavior, biologists aim to understand actions made by organisms from a physiological perspective. Through doing we so, we may better our knowledge regarding how certain behaviors are developed in different species. Male Betta spledens are a very interesting population for ethologists, as they display very distinct aggressive or agnostic behaviors when in the presence of another male specimen. Their highly aggressive nature is an interesting topic as they possess a variety of “broadside” and “facing” movements. These various agnostic behaviors are displayed when a male betta is exposed another male betta, or even other organisms that resemble male specimen. Thus, we were interested in investigating which characteristics of fish that triggered betta fish to act aggressively. As betta fish are known for their vibrant colors, we assumed that the color of a fish (or fish-shaped object) may be what betta fish recognize as a threat. We decided to test the effects of different colored fake fish on male betta specimen’s behavior to determine whether color is the determining factor of male betta recognizing a threat. Other studies have suggested that the gender of dummy fish is what triggered the agnostic behavior of betta—that is, when a pair of male and female fake fish are presented to the male specimen, this triggers its agnostic behaviors (Dziewecyznski 2012). This makes sense, as male betta fish are extremely territorial and are very aggressive when a threat is posed upon its partner or territory. This study somewhat correlates with our own, as male betta are typically much more vibrantly colored than females. It is under this fact that we pose the following hypothesis: male betta fish are more likely to display agnostic behaviors towards the colorful fake fish than the colorless fake fish when exposed.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we required three male betta fish subjects, three sheets of different colored soft foam (red, white, and blue), a black sharpie, scissors, fishing wire, and a timer. Firstly, while the three bettas were isolated from each other and resting, we traced a basic betta fish shape onto the three sheets of colored foam, and cut each one out (and made sure they looked the exact same in shape in size.) Then, we cut pieces of fishing line for each fake fish, poked a hole through the top of each fake fish, and knotted the fishing line through the hole. The fake fish were then ready to be dipped in the tanks. With a timer ready for each fish observation, we placed each fake fish in the tank of each male betta in the same physical location of each tank and let them sit there for three minutes. While each fake fish was presented to the male betta specimen, we observed the proximity of the betta fish to the fake fish in their tanks. We did so by counting the seconds out of the three-minute duration in which the betta remained in the same half of the tank as the fake fish. After three minutes passed, we allowed the fish to rest for a few seconds before switching the fake fish for each tank until each fish had been presented with each fake fish. We used this data to carry out an ANOVA test at a significance level of 0.05, followed by a Tukey-Kramer test for statistical significance.

Results:
For the presence of the red fake fish in each tank, male betta 1 remained in the same half of the tank as the fake fish for 129 seconds, 80 seconds for male betta 2, and 22 seconds for male betta 3. For the white fake fish, male betta 1 stayed in the same half of the tank as the fake fish for 168 seconds, 64 seconds for male betta 2, and 126 seconds for male betta 3. For the blue fake fish, male betta 1 stayed in the same half of the tank as the fake fish for 103 seconds, 0 seconds for male betta 2, and 80 seconds for male betta 3.
The average time (in seconds) in which male betta specimen swam or stayed in the same half of the tank as the red fake fish when present was 77 seconds. The average time in which male betta specimen swam or stayed in the same half of the tank as the white fake fish when present was 119.3 seconds. The average time in which male betta specimen swam or stayed in the same half of the tank as the blue fake fish when present was 61 seconds. We entered our data into an ANOVA test, which produced a p_value of 0.435.

Discussion:
As the ANOVA significance test conducted obviously shows, our findings were not at all statistically significent (with a p_value of 0.435), not to mention the Tukey-Kramer test suggested no significent differences in the means of time in which betta were near the different colored fake fish. In fact, hardly any aggressive/agnostic behaviors were displayed when the male betta fish were presented with the fake fish—they seemed rather indifferent. While these findings were not very telling of what specifically triggers the agnostic behaviors in betta fish, it does eliminate the possibilities of what does this. A study that also implemented fake fish to test whether the treatment affected male behavior also showed no effects on their behavior (Dzieweczynski 2006). In fact, their experimental design also concluded with a process of elimination statement: the variable tested was not the specific cause of agnostic behavior in betta fish, and the direct cause could not be identified from this experiment alone (Dziewecynski 2006). Determining the specific feature of organisms that betta fish see as a threat seems to be a process of slimming possibilities down until the truth is sought. Thus, more research is required to identify the trait in which affects the behavior of betta fish. A potential confounding variable that was unavoidable is identified in the research of another experiment that explored the effects of social isolation on betta fish aggression (Halperin 1997). The experiment suggests that betta fish become more aggressive towards other betta the longer they are kept in isolation (Halperin 1997). This variable can be understood as over-exposure: these betta fish have been used for recently prior experiments to this one, which could very well have generally exhausted the fish. By exhausting them, the lack of aggressive behavior these fish displayed could be explained by a lack of isolation from other betta fish for other experimentation. Taking this confounding variable into consideration, further research regarding color of an opponent fish affecting agnostic behavior in betta is necessary to safely conclude whether color of a potential opponent has no effect on male betta behavior. Regardless, we can conclude from our experiment that betta can save their energy from forces in their environment (the fake fish, in this instance) that do not seem threatening. Our research does show that betta fish are not chaotically aggressive, and that there is certainly a rhyme and reason to whom they may target with their agnostic behavior.
