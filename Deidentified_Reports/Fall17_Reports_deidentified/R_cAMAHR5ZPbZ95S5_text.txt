Title: The Effect of Salinity on Root to Shoot Ratios in Wheat Plants

Abstract:
In this scientific experiment, one group of wheat plants were watered with 0.35% NaCl solution and one group was watered with pure water to see if the salinity affected the plant’s R:S.  The hypothesis was that salinity would have an effect on the R:S.  We watered these plants for two weeks and weighed and measured the roots and shoots of each group to determine the R:S.  The mean of the R:S by length with plants exposed to salt water was significantly different than the group not exposed to salt (t-stat = 7.09, df = 4, P = 0.002). The mean of the R:S by weight with plants exposed to salt water was not significantly different than the group not exposed to salt (t-stat = 1.78, df = 4, P = 0.15).  The difference in the R:S is due to the fact that the wheat plants that were watered with a NaCl solution needed to allocate their resources effectively in response to the decrease of available water.  

Introduction:
The resources that living organisms need are finite, so living organisms need to allocate their resources efficiently to live, grow and survive.  Organisms chose how to use these limited resources to accomplish these certain goals and plants are no exception to his rule.  Plants need to efficiently allocate vital resources like CO2, water, nitrogen and sugars to grow, reproduce or defend themselves against predators [Bazzazz: 1997].  Plants accomplish resource allocation by placing nutrients into separate organs like the shoots, leaves, roots, depending on what the plant needs to accomplish or depending on environmental conditions [Johnson: 2017]
One way to determine a plants allocation of resources is to calculate the root to shoot ratio (R:S).  If the plant has a high R:S then, the plant is contributing more resources to the roots and if it has a low R:S, then the inverse would be true [Johnson: 2017].   Plants will usually have a higher R:S if the plant has a deficit of nutrients or water in the soil [Muns: 2010].  This leads to the question of what happens of what happens to the R:S when a non-vital resource like NaCl becomes introduced into the soil of a plant?  With the introduction of Na+ and Cl- ions, water potential is disrupted [Parida: 2004].  This eventually leads to an ionic, homeostatic and toxicity imbalance within plants [Parida: 2004].  All of this cumulates in the inhibition of photosynthesis and stunted growth [Parida: 2004].  What is uncertain though is if this stunted growth affects the roots and the shoots proportionally?  Our hypothesis is that with the introduction of salinity, the R:S of wheat plants will be different than the plants that were only watered with water with no salinity.


Materials and Methods:
To start the experiment, 3 handfuls of wheat seeds were placed in water.  After allowing the wheat seeds to soak in the water, one handful of wheat seeds were placed into each of the 6 pots that all contained vermiculite.  All 6 of the wheat trials were then watered with water.  All 6 of the pots were then placed in a green house.  Every two days, 3 of the plants were watered with water, while the other 3 were watered with 0.35% NaCl solution.  All 6 trials were watered every other day for two weeks.  After the two weeks, the wheat plants were harvested.  For every pot, 10 wheat plants were harvested.  Their root length, weight and shoot length and weight were all measured.  To do the measurements, the roots were cut from the shoots.  We classified the start of the roots just below the seed and the shoots were above the seed.  The root length and shoot length came from the longest root and shoot out of the 10 plants from one specific pot.  To get the mass of the wheat plants, all 10 plants were weighed using an electronic balance.  After all of the data collected tables and graphs were created from taking the means of the R:S.  A two-tailed, 2 sample t-test was run to verify the significance of the NaCl solution on the R:S.

Results:
On average, the shoots were smaller, both in regard to weight and length in the plants exposed to salt, while the roots did not change greatly between the two treatment groups.  This created a higher R:S ratio in the plants with exposure to salt. The mean of the R:S by length with plants exposed to salt water was significantly different than the group not exposed to salt (t-stat = 7.09, df = 4, P = 0.002). The mean of the R:S by weight with plants exposed to salt water was not significantly different than the group not exposed to salt (t-stat = 1.78, df = 4, P = 0.15).

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported for the R:S regarding length.  There was not a great difference between the root lengths between the two treatment groups but there was a sizable difference between the shoot lengths, which contributed to the significant difference between the two treatment groups. Another study has found the same result where they found that salinity affected the shoots of plants more than the roots [Shalhevet: 1995].  This resulted in the wheat plants that were exposed to salinity to have a much higher R:S since the growth of the shoots were stunted while the roots seemed unaffected.  
The results did not support the hypothesis that salt water had an effect on R:S in regard to mass.  The plants that were exposed to the salt stress, did have on average a lower root and shoot weight, which can be attributed to stunted growth.  This is consistent with another experiment where an increase of salinity resulted in the reduction of the dry weight of plants stems, leaves, and roots [Parida: 2014].  There was no significant difference though, because the average mass of both the roots and the shoots both decreased similarly.  This means that the R:S changed, but not significantly because the roots and the shoots were changing at similar rates, keeping the ratio somewhat stable and close to the control group.	
There are multiple reasons why the R:S increased significantly in the wheat plants.  Salinity contributes to a hormonal imbalance within plants[Bernstein: 1975].  An increase of salinity causes a decrease in the transport of kinetin from the roots to the shoots, which results in the stunting of shoot growth [Bernstein: 1975].  Another explanation of the difference in the R:S in the wheat plants can be found within resource allocation.  Because of the water potential difference of the NaCl solution and pure H2O, the roots of the wheat plants with the saline solution were not receiving the same amount of water than the control group.  This led to the plant having less resources and the wheat plant allocated its limited resources to it roots over the shoots.  This same result was replicated in an experiment with the plants perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne).  These plants went from a R:S of 0.82 to 3.44 in response to the  reduction of H2O [Munns: 2010].
There were multiple areas where error could have skewed the data that was collected.  Firstly, it was difficult to completely clean off all the vermiculite from the roots of the plants.  With the added mass, the weight of the roots might have been artificially inflated.  Also, to clean the vermiculite, the roots were washed with water.  If the roots were not thoroughly dried, then the mass of the roots would again be artificially inflated.  Also, the sample size was relatively small.  We only massed and measured 10 plants from each treatment group.  These 10 plants were not separate data points either since they were all massed together and only the longest root and shoot out of the 10 were recorded.  This resulted in only having 3 data points to average together for the experimental and control group.  A small sample size may lead to a high source of error.  To improve this experiment, I would suggest increasing the sample size and individually massing and measuring each plant.  Even though this is time consuming, it will lead to more accurate results.  I would also suggest redoing the experiment with varying levels of salinity.  By doing this, it would be possible to see what different concentrations of NaCl does to the R:S.  Also, it would also be beneficial to use multiple species of plants to see the varying levels of salt tolerance and its effects on a wide range of living organisms.  
Salinity is shown to have a significant effect on the R:S and it is important to keep this in mind.  It is important because it shows that is crucial for humans to not allow humans to pollute the with salts, since it disrupts their growth and their resource allocation.  It also proves the importance of limited resources.  Water, nutrients and many other necessary resources are vital for life to continue on Earth. When these vital resources are taken away, growth will be stunted, just like the growth of the wheat plants.
