Title: Effect of Exercise on Procambarus spp. Specific Metabolic Rates

Abstract:
Animals gain energy through metabolic processes that can be affects by both the individual organism or the environment that it is in. During this process energy can be converted to oxygen for an organism to use for aerobic respiration. As the organism uses energy they also increase their oxygen consumption. This experiment considers how external factors can affect specific metabolic rate for Procambarus spp., or crayfish, specifically during exercise. The crayfish were weighed and placed in a test chamber to monitor oxygen consumption using an oxygen meter probe. After, they were removed from the test chamber to be exercised with prodding for 20 minutes. Exercise was predicted to increase oxygen consumption and increase specific metabolic rate; however, the results only yields a p-value of p=0.1156 after performing a paired t test. Exercise did not cause a significant increase in specific metabolic rate. These findings could have resulted from stress on the organism, however they are not very applicable to a larger population due to a small sample size.

Introduction:
Heterotroph organisms obtain energy and other raw materials indirectly, by consuming both autotrophs and other heterotroph through metabolic processes. Metabolism can be described as the process of balancing the capture, conversion, and transfer of energy within the cells of an organism. Metabolism can be affected by both the organism and environmental factors. The Procambarus spp., commonly known as crayfish, are heterotroph organisms whose body temperature fluctuates with the environment and can alter their metabolism. When crayfish convert glucose to energy carbon dioxide, CO2, is formed which releases high energy electrons. These electrons are captured by two molecules, NAD+ and FAD, which transport them to the electron transport system. This transport causes the electrons to release small amounts of that convert adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a high energy compound. As this occurs, electrons are removed from the mitochondria and transferred to oxygen to be delivered to respiratory organs. This oxygen can be used by the crayfish for aerobic respiration during activity. When the organisms perform activity, such as exercising, their muscles and other tissues require energy which affects the rate of oxygen consumption. The amount of oxygen used during the course of activity is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended by the organism [Johnson:2017].
	The goal of this experiment is to observe the effects of exercise on crayfish metabolism, specifically how exercising affects oxygen consumption and specific metabolic rate. Specific metabolic rate is the amount of oxygen that an organism consumes per gram of body mass and unit time. Crayfish are ectotherms and water breathing organisms, and are therefore able to obtain oxygen easily, making them useful for this experiment. Since crayfish are ectotherms, their core body temperatures fluctuate with the environment, which has an effect on its oxygen studies. In previous studies, activity was found to have the “largest effect on oxygen consumption” by nearly three times the normal amount [Crear: 2000]. Since oxygen consumption is proportional to energy expended we predicted that exercise would increase the amount of oxygen consumed by the crayfish, thus increasing the specific metabolic rate.

Materials and Methods:
Three small crayfish were studied during this experiment and each were place in a test chamber where oxygen consumption was monitored using a dissolved oxygen meter. The crayfish were each the same size and kept in similar environments (at room temperature, 22°C), to set a control in our experiment and limit the number of confounding variables affecting the experiment. Prior to placing the crayfish into the chamber, the chamber was filled to the top with room temperature water and placed into a plastic bin filled half way with fully oxygenated room temperature water. We used fully oxygenated water to account for any confounding oxygen concentration effect in water. After the chamber was filled we weighed the crayfish and recorded its weight then gently placed it into the chamber. Once the crayfish was safely inside the testing chamber and placed the oxygen meter instrument in it. Once this was set we read and recorded the amount of dissolved oxygen for 20 minutes at every five minutes. After 20 minutes had passed we removed the probe and poured the contents of the test chamber through a funnel into a large graduated cylinder to measure the volume of water. After recording the volume of water, we removed the crayfish from the funnel and placed into another plastic bin, filled with about an inch of water, and exercised it with continuous stimulation by prodding the crayfish for two minutes. While the crayfish was exercised, the test chamber was refilled with room temperature water and the specific metabolic rate for the first trial was calculated. After exercising the crayfish, we placed it back into the test chamber gently and begin recording the oxygen consumption in the same format as before. Once 20 minutes had passed we determined the volume of water in the chamber using the graduated cylinder and calculated the specific metabolic rate for the same crayfish after exercising it. After, we repeated this process for the remaining two crayfish and compared our results using a paired t-test.


Results:
For all three of the crayfish we tested the specific metabolic rate appeared to decrease after exercise, as shown in Figure 1. In addition, Figure 2 shows that the total oxygen consumption for both crayfish one and two was decreased by about half after exercise, while the total oxygen consumption for Crayfish 3 remained about the same after exercise as it was before (though it was still lower for after exercise). The standard deviation of the specific metabolic rates was 0.002017 with a mean of for the crayfish before exercise and 0.001133 after exercise. After running a t-test on the data collected during the experiment we found our data had a t-value of 2.678 and a p-value of p= 0.1156 for the crayfish’s specific metabolic rates before and after exercise. Since we used the specific metabolic rates of 3 different crayfish the t-test had 2 degrees of freedom.

Discussion:
Our experiment yielded unexpected results and it appeared that exercise decreased the specific metabolic rate rather than increasing it. Since the p-value obtained from our data was greater than an alpha level of 0.05, our results were not statistically significant, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There was not significant evidence that exercise caused a difference in the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish. These results are contrary to the significant increases in oxygen consumption after activity found in Crear’s study of lobster metabolism. The study found that activity had the largest influence over oxygen consumption over both other intrinsic and extrinsic factors [Crear: 2000]. Similarly, Fanjol-Moles found that generally there was a “positive correlation between variations in locomotor activities” and the organisms’ oxygen consumption [Fanjol-Moles: 1998]. One reason we may have seen these lower metabolic rates was because during high stress situations the crayfish can begin to use anaerobic processes.  Anaerobic respiration does not require consumption of oxygen to produce energy, thus the oxygen levels in the water would increase and the amount of oxygen consumed by the organism would decrease [Newell: 1973]. The crayfish were placed in a very stressful environment with loud noise, a classroom full of people, and was enclosed in a glass jar, which could account for the discrepancies in our results. Our experiment was limited to only three crayfish and can therefore not be generalized for the general population. It would be useful in create less stressful environments to monitor oxygen consumption and include more test subjects for future.
