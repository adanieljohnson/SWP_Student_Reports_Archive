Title: The effects of a potassium channel blocker on the strength of contractions of the gastrocnemius muscle of the Leopard Frog

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to test the effects of a potassium channel blocker on the strength of muscle contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog. Potassium channels open due to depolarization of the muscle cell, and they allow an efflux of positive charges out of the cell, causing the muscle to relax. We therefore predict that blocking these potassium channels will cause threshold to be reached sooner, as excess positive charges will not be able to leave the cell. To test this hypothesis we treated the gastrocnemius muscle with tetraethylammonium Cl, a potassium channel blocker, and used a force transducer to stimulate the muscle. Our results did not support our hypothesis, as the treatment experiment on average had a higher threshold voltage than the control experiment (t-stat=0.377964, df=2, P=0.741801). We therefore cannot say that treating the muscle with a potassium channel blocker will result in a lower threshold. Blocking the potassium channels could have caused excess membrane depolarization of the muscle cell, this causing the muscle contraction to be weaker. It would be interesting to test the effects of a potassium channel activator on threshold contraction, to see if this produced contrasting results to our experiment.

Introduction:
A nerve stimulates muscle contraction through a process called excitation-contraction coupling [Johnson: 2017]. We will be monitoring the contraction and relaxation at the macroscopic level of muscles and nerves in the Rana pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog, specifically the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve. We are performing our experiment on the gastrocnemius muscle because it is easy to identify and isolate, also skeletal muscle is common in many other organisms, so we may be able to compare our results from this experiment to other organisms. Muscle contraction occurs as a result of neuronal signaling. At the neuromuscular junctions, nerve impulses can cause a release of ACh into the synapse. ACh will bind to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, this which causes depolarization of the cell. Slight depolarization of the cell causes voltage gated sodium channels to open, sodium then travels down its concentration gradient, and floods into the neuron. Once enough sodium channels have opened, and threshold is reached in the cell, the cell will fire an action potential, this which causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2017]. This release of calcium triggers a series of interactions between the actin and myosin muscle filaments, which causes the muscle to contract. The release of calcium ions also causes the potassium channels to open, and potassium ions leave the cell, moving down their concentration gradient. Sodium channels open quickly, whereas potassium channels are slower to open, and they stay open for longer. This allows potassium ions to carry excess positive charges out of the cell, allowing the cell membrane to return to a negative state [Johnson: 2017]. 

In our experiment we will be examining the effect of a potassium channel blocker on threshold contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle. The muscle is located on the back of the frog leg, below the knee. We will be treating our muscle with 100 mM of Tetraethylammonium Cl, which will inhibit the opening of the potassium channels. The independent variable in this experiment is the potassium channel blocker, and the dependent variable is the threshold voltage of muscle contraction. Potassium channels are crucial in preventing excessive membrane depolarization, and they contribute to the decrease in force during fatigue [Cifelli, 2008]. In a previous experiment done on the skeletal muscle of mice they found that disrupting the function of potassium channels through the use of a blocker, resulted in an increase in contraction force [Zhu, 2013]. If the potassium channels are unable to open, then the potassium ions will not be able to carry excess positive charge out of the cell, this which will prevent the muscle fibers from returning to a depolarized state, and therefore threshold will be reached sooner. We therefore predict that blocking the potassium channels in the treatment experiment will cause threshold to be reached sooner, compared to the control experiment.

Materials and Methods:
Frog leg preparation:
Deglove the frog leg and expose the sciatic nerve. Isolate the gastrocnemius muscle by cutting it away from the foot of the frog. Place the leg in a dissecting pan and suspend the gastrocnemius muscle from the force transducer. Insert the two needle probes into the muscle, placing the black probe into the lower part of the muscle, and the red probe into the mid/upper part of the muscle. Keep the leg moist with Ringer’s solution. 

Control experiment: Testing muscle contraction strength: 
Using iWorx, set the pulse amplitude to 0.000V, number of pulses to 1, frequency to 1, and pulse width to 5ms. Starting at 0.1V, record the muscle amplitude in 0.1V increments up to 0.5V, then increase the voltage to 1.0V and continue to increase the voltage in 1.0V increments up to 5V. These results will serve as the control experiment for this frog leg. 

Treatment experiment: Testing muscle contraction strength:
To prepare the potassium channel blocker, dissolve 1.7g of 100 mM Tetraethylammonium Cl in 100 mL of Ringer’s solution. Treat the gastrocnemius muscle with 0.2mL of 100 mM of Tetraethylammonium Cl solution, by injecting it directly into the muscle. Repeat the above steps for stimulating and recording muscle amplitude. These results will serve as the treatment experiment for this frog leg. 

Repeat these methods for the second and third frog leg. 

Statistical test:
Once results were recorded for all three frog legs, we used a one tailed paired t-test to compare the observations taken from the control experiment and the treatment experiment. We used a one tailed paired t-test because our hypothesis predicts that threshold voltage of muscle contraction of the treatment experiment will be statistically smaller than the threshold voltage of the control experiment.

Results:
The threshold voltage of the treatment experiment was on average, higher than that of the control experiment (Figure #1). In the first trial, the threshold voltage was lower for the treatment experiment, in the second trial, the threshold voltage was the same for the treatment and the control experiments, in the third trial, the threshold voltage was higher for the treatment experiment (Table #1). Looking at the values from each individual trial we cannot see a clear trend in whether the control or treatment experiment had a higher threshold voltage, however looking at Figure #1 we can see that the average threshold voltage is higher for the treatment experiment than the control experiment. 

After using a one tailed Paired t-test, we can see that the difference in mean threshold voltage of the treatment experiment and the mean threshold voltage of the control experiment was not significantly different (t-stat=0.377964, df=2, P=0.741801). Our hypothesis was therefore not supported as the mean threshold voltage for the treatment experiment was higher than the mean threshold for the control experiment.

Discussion:
Our statistical results do not show a lower threshold contraction for the treatment experiment, compared to the control experiment, and therefore our hypothesis is not supported. Although we hypothesized that treating the gastrocnemius muscle with a potassium channel blocker would result in threshold being reached sooner, the treatment experiment had an average higher threshold voltage. Potassium channels are crucial in allowing the muscle cell membrane to hyperpolarize, and return back to its ready state in order to contract again [Cifelli, 2008]. We therefore assumed that blocking these channels would stop the potassium efflux, meaning that the muscle fibers would not be able to relax as quickly, resulting in threshold being reached sooner. 

As mentioned previously, potassium channels are crucial in preventing excessive membrane depolarizations, as they allow the potassium ions to carry excess positive charge out of cell. Perhaps blocking the potassium channels in the treatment experiment did result in excessive depolarization of muscle fiber cells in the gastrocnemius muscle. A study on the skeletal sartorius muscle of the Rana pipiens revealed that adding a potassium channel blocker caused a decrease in tetanic force. This which was attributed to the significant membrane depolarizations [Gramolini, 1997]. 

Furthermore, A study on the skeletal muscle of mice revealed that potassium channels are essential in preventing skeletal muscle contractile dysfunctions. These dysfunctions can include fiber damage, large membrane depolarizations, and large increases in unstimulated intracellular calcium [Cifelli, 2008]. This could be a potential explanation as to why our treatment experiment did reach threshold sooner than the control group. The potassium channel blocker disrupted the normal efflux of potassium ions out of the cell during hyperpolarization, and as a result the cell membrane remained depolarized. This excess depolarization could have caused a slight muscle contractile dysfunction, and could account for the higher threshold voltage of the treatment experiment compared to the control experiment. 

If we were to conduct another experiment on the contractions of the gastrocnemius muscle, it would be interesting to test the effects of a potassium channel activator. Adding additional potassium into the cell could cause threshold to be reached sooner, as it takes longer for the potassium to carry positive charges out of the cell, and it will take longer for the muscle to relax.  Or maybe the additional potassium will speed up the process of hyperpolarization, and cause threshold voltage to be higher. It would also be interesting to test the effects of a potassium channel activator on the strength of a series of contractions. Channel activation causes resting potassium permeability to be increased [Ashcroft, 1988], so perhaps threshold would be reached sooner and the first contraction will be stronger, but the following contractions may decrease in strength. The additional potassium might mean that not enough positive charge will be carried out of the cell, resulting in no undershoot, therefore the muscle cells will not be able to depolarize as well for the following contractions, causing weaker or shorter contractions. On the contrary, activation of the potassium channels may increase potassium efflux from the cell, causing a larger undershoot, and this may cause quicker depolarization of the muscle cells. 

Ultimately, our results did not support our hypothesis, as the treatment experiment had an average higher threshold voltage than the control experiment. We therefore cannot say that treating the gastrocnemius muscle with a potassium channel blocker will result in threshold being reached sooner.
