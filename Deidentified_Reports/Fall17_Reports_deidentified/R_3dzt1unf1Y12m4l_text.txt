Title: Aggression of Betta splendins decreases with shelter present in tank

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to see if aggressive behavior would be different for betta splendins with and without a shelter in their tank. My hypothesis was that having a form of shelter in the tank will result in an increase in the aggressive behaviors in the betta. This hypothesis was not supported by the results of the experiment. We observed and recorded the number of seconds that the betta fish participated in aggressive behaviors and quantified the behaviors. We found that there was decreased behavior when the shelter was present but we were not sure whether that was due to the presence of the shelter or another circumstance like habituation and tiredness towards the end of the trials. 

Introduction:
Betta Splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are native to Thailand. These fish are commonly kept in homes due to their bright colors, but are usually kept solo in tanks due to their propensity towards more aggressive behaviors. Intraspecific competition, or competition within a species, is a common occurrence for betta splendins. The two general categories of aggression for bettas are broadside and facing movements and bettas display a variety of combinations of behaviors when in an aggressive encounter. Different behaviors have different levels of aggression and males tend to be more aggressive than females, overall. Male bettas in particular are very territorial, therefore, they are often more aggressive around other male bettas. One study found that the presence of another male resulted in aggressive behaviors and more building of the nest [Bronstein: 1981]. In addition, much of intraspecific competition is for mating territory. Bettas must also make decisions about energy allocation when participating in aggressive behaviors. All organisms, bettas included, must have trade-offs in which they decide where to allocate their resources in order to maximize benefits. By participating in aggressive behaviors, they are using energy that could be used elsewhere, the costs, but are fighting for females and territory in the future, the benefits. Observing these aggressive behaviors allows us to gather information about the costs and benefits of aggression and learn more about the energy allocation process for bettas. Due to the territorial nature of male betta fish, we would expect that adding some sort of shelter to the tank during intraspecific competition would increase the betta’s aggressive behaviors [Johnson: 2017].

Materials and Method:
In order to quantify the bettas’ aggressive behaviors, we ranked their behaviors with different multipliers, either a one or a two, depending on the level of aggressiveness of the behavior. The less aggressive behaviors were behaviors that were quantified by a one multiplier. These were pelvic fin flickering and erect pectoral fins. The more aggressive behaviors were quantified with a multiple of two. These were tail flashing and presence of the red mane. For the trials, we observed the recorded the number of seconds in each behavior for one of the betta splendins in our tank without the shelter three times at five minute intervals with five minutes of rest in between each trial. We repeated the same process but with the shelter in the tank for an additional three trials. At the end of the trials, the behaviors that were identified as more aggressive were multiplied by two in order to exhibit increased aggression in our data. We used a two-sample t_test to measure the statistical significance of our data and our alpha value was 0.05 [Johnson: 2017].

Red mane	2


Results:
Our results showed that the betta had decreased aggression when there was shelter present. The data from our controlll group, where there was not shelter in the tank, was an average of 691.3333 seconds as opposed to an average of 464.3333 seconds from our experimental group. The standard deviation for our controlll was 105.6709 and for our experimental group was 44.5234. From our two-sample t_test, there were 4 degrees of freedom, a t-value of 3.428827, and a p_value of 0.026564. Because the p_value was less than 0.05, our results were statistically significent. 

Discussion:
In our experiment, the aggressiveness of the betta fish that we observed decreased when the shelter was present in the tank. My hypothesis was not supported by the experiment’s results, but I do not think that the decrease in aggressive behavior was due to the presence of the shelter. Because the betta went through a total of six trials, I think that the decrease in aggressiveness during the last three trials was due to tiredness and some degree of habituation. The first three trials quantified the controlll group and the last three trials quantified the experimental group, making me believe this to be true. In a similar study, which aimed the show the effect of betta habituation, aggressive behaviors became almost non-existent after 4 days with mirror exposure [Clayton et. al: 1968], supporting that habituation could have affected our results in the experimental trials. Another related study found that the metabolic costs of aggressive behavior in betta splendins was increased in the winner of the fight [Castro et.al: 2006]. Our betta fish could have expended too much energy in the first three trials, which is why aggressiveness could have decreased in the last three trials. If we were to conduct our experiment again, using multiple fish instead of one fish would have allowed for more reliable results, as the tiredness and habituation of the betta could have factored into the results.
