Title: Response to herbivory in R. raphanistrum under stressors effecting leaf productivity

Abstract:
My group was experimenting on R. raphanistrum or the wild radish. The plant was chosen for the way it grows it leaves because we wanted to research the effects of herbivory o a new young plant. The kind of herbivory we focused on was leaf stressors, more specifically the holes made in leaves. Our hypothesis was that the plants with the holes in their leaves would grow more leaves and have a higher R:S ratio due to growing more leaves. We had six total groups, three controlll and three experimental, as soon as the experimental group had leaves large enough to punch holes in we did so, and then data was collected from both groups around two weeks later. The results showed that there was no significent difference between our experimental and controlll groups. It was discussed that a better experiment could be done if it happened over a longer period of time allowing the plants more time to alter resource allocation in reaction to the hole punches. 

Introduction:
When plants grow the environment around them will help define how they allocate their resources and factors that affect the plant directly can make or break a plants survival. All plants have limited resources and must be careful when using them. One reason plants must be so cautious is herbivory, which is the consumption of plants as foods by a predator. Plants must allocate resources to help repel and deter predators while also growing enough to have the energy for reproduction. A simple way to measure resource allocation is R:S or root: shoot ratio. The shoots are the leaves and stem, leaves being responsible for capturing light energy and the intake of CO2 while stems are responsible for moving materials to the major sections of the plant. The roots are responsible for the uptake of water and nutrients underground. The experiment will be manipulating the leaves of a plant and seeing how that affects the R:S ratio of a plant overall.  [Cousens, R 2001] When selecting our plant for the research, we mostly looked at leaf size, so that we could make a sizable hole as our experimental variable. In the lab, we decided on R. raphanistrum because of its large and uniforMly round leaves. We will be hole punching our plants to test the growth of them while under herbivory. The plants that are hole punched will more likely have a lower R:S ration because they will have to grow broader, or more excess leaves, to make up for the lost surface area. The mass of the roots would remain unchanged because they are unaffected by the experimental variable.

Materials and Method:
We examined a few species of plants to make sure that phenotypic variation would not be a confounding variable, what we found was that R. raphanistrum has good phenotypes for the experiment we would like to test for [ Reeves, 1981]. We will only be performing our experiments with R. raphanistrum. We will use six groups, three controlll, and three experimental groups. Each group will have its own pot each pot having approximately 20 seeds. The experimental group will have a hole punched in each of its leaves on every plant in all three pots. First, ~120 seeds were soaked in water for around 20 minutes then each of the containers was filled with vermiculite until they were around 70% full. Before the seeds can be added 50Ml of Miracle-Gro that had a concentration of 38g/10L was added to the vermiculite. Then 15% more vermiculite was added, and water was added until the soil was visibly moist. Each pot was labeled with what group and which number it is. The plants were left to grow in a greenhouse, watered daily till the soil was moist, for roughly two weeks and each leaf in the experimental group was punctured around the same time. The plants were then left to grow for another week after the puncturing, then on lab day the plants were removed from the greenhouse and removed from their pots. Each plant was soaked in water and carefully separated with all of the other plants until we had five from each pot. Each group of 5 was weighed whole, cut into Root and Shoot weighed again, and then each group of root & shoots was measured for the longest in each group of 5. All of the data was calculated and the means and the standard deviation was calculated for each group as well as the R:S ratios.

Results:
The outcome of the experiment did not turn out as the hypothesis had predicted. Figure one shows that the R:S mass values weren’t significently different and the values of the R:S length were within one standard deviation of one another. After performing a t_test on the R:S mass values we received an insignificent value of .0187 which is not significent under our 95% confidence interval. The result of the t_test for the R:S length was once again insignificent. The lack of significance in the mass result informs us that the experimental group did not enact any special resource allocation or change in response to the simulated herbivory. Even though the experimental group grew longer this could be in response to another factor and not the stressor we applied. 

Discussion:
The root-shoot ratios are opposite of my hypotheses. Initially, I had thought that the experimental group would have lower R:S ratios because they would compensate for the lost surface area by growing additional leaves. The data displayed shows that difference between the means of the controlll and experimental groups for the R:S mass is not significent enough. The length ratio is not significent, but that has more to do with how long the shoots were and did not show us that it grew more leaves. This means that despite the hole, and contrary to the hypothesis, there was no significent difference in the amount of plant that was grown. The result of this experiment makes me think that the lack of significent results is due to human error. Like explained in the results section, the hand separation of individuals plants may have caused some plants to be ripped apart and weighed less than the actual amount. Furthermore errors in watering more plants than another, the possibility of more or less Miracle-Gro in any plant, the error that could arise with sunlight distribution within the greenhouse, even the size of the holes may not have been significent enough to cause a shift in resource allocation in the plant. Other research that has been performed in regards to punctures in the leaves of the R. raphanistrum via caterpillars found that the damaged plants had increased numbers of progeny [Holeski, 2007]. In regards to herbivory, our experiment would be the equivalent of a small puncture via a bug or disease that has no real effect on the development of the plant[Agrawal. It could also be said that the hole that was punched may have been punched to late in regards to when we gathered our results, not giving the plant enough time to respond. I think a future experiment could be conducted on a longer time scale where the plants are hole-punched at just two weeks and then data is gathered at the end of an eight-week cycle.
