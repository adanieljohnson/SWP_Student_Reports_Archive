Title: Examining the effect of low and high temperatures on chloroplast activity for Spinacia oleracea and Fragaria ananassa.

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a fragile process, crucial to plant metabolism. The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of temperature on photosynthetic activity, using DCPIP absorbance as an indication of this activity. It was hypothesized that high temperatures would increase chloroplast activity while low temperatures would decrease activity. The experiment was conducted using two types of leaf, spinach and strawberry, and three temperature conditions, cold (1℃), hot (35℃) and control at room temperature (22℃). The chloroplasts for every condition were prepared in solution with water, DCPIP, and Hill reaction buffer and their absorbance was taken initially, and then every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. The percent change in absorbance was very strong in the positive direction for the cold condition and very strong in the negative direction for the hot condition. It was concluded that both hot and cold temperatures have a significant effect on photosynthesis, where high temperatures increase it and low temperatures decrease it.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants synthesize glucose from sunlight, CO2, and water to be used for ATP synthesis in the mitochondria. All plant cells have pigmented organelles called chloroplasts, which are the location of photosynthesis. These chloroplasts are green and easily identifiable under a microscope due to their pigment molecule, chlorophyll. This becomes useful in determining chloroplast density of a chloroplast solution under a microscope. The light reactions where chlorophyll is activated also involves electron transfer. A blue-pigmented compound, DCPIP, can be oxidized in this electron transfer if present, and as it is oxidized it gets more transparent [Johnson: 2017]. Thus, this compound is a wonderful indicator of chloroplast activity, because if it is changing color, then electron transfer vital to the light reactions of chloroplasts is occurring. This change in color can be measured by taking the absorbance of a solution. Knowing the ability to analyze photosynthetic activity, it was questioned what the effect may be on different leaf species, Spinacia oleracea (spinach), and Fragaria ananassa (strawberry) in varying temperature environments. In a study done on temperature’s effect on the growth of seagrass [Bulthuis: 1987], it was found that the normal growth had a tolerance of 6℃-30℃. In a study done on spinach leaves and CO2 intake [Brooks: 1985], it was found that spinach leaves actually respond better to warmer conditions, supporting the use of greenhouses. These studies proved the relevance of temperature and its effect on photosynthesis and plant growth, this became a justified and interesting topic of study. Spinach and strawberry leaves where chosen because they are both plants that do well in higher temperatures, and they were therefore good organisms to study under temperature control conditions, as they were very likely to be affected by non-optimal temperatures. The goal of this study was to determine which temperature range is the most optimal for the activity of these species. After all background information was gathered, it was hypothesized that both types of leaf would show a great negative percent change in absorbance (high photosynthetic activity) over time in a warm environment of 35℃, and would show a great positive percent change in absorbance over time in a cold environment of 1℃. 


Materials and Methods:
Four Spinacia oleracea leaves and seven Fragaria ananassa leaves were obtained from the grocery store, and the veins were removed. The spinach and strawberry leaves were placed in respective mortars with 10mL of pH 8 grinding buffer each, and ground until they were a slurry with no visible chunks. 20mL more of grinding buffer was then added to each solution and mixed. The solutions were then strained through cheesecloth folded three times into respective 100mL beakers. The spinach solution was then poured into a centrifuge tube A and the strawberry solution was poured into a centrifuge tube labeled B; the tubes were then centrifuged for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm and 4℃. The spinach solution from tube A was then transferred to a new centrifuge tube, and the strawberry solution from tube B was also transferred to a new tube B; These tubes were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm and 4℃. After centrifuging, the contents of both tubes were poured into new centrifuge tubes, but the pellets from the tubes were left behind, and they were each suspended with 20mL of pH 8 grinding buffer and shaken. The pellet solutions were then analyzed under a microscope to check the chloroplast density using a hemacytometer. The chloroplast solutions were then used for the rest of the experiment. 19 test tubes were obtained and labeled A 1-9, B 1-9, and +, for positive control. Every tube was prepared by adding 6mL distilled water, 2mL 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL pH 6.5 Hill reaction buffer. The spectrophotometer was turned on and zeroed using a blank solution of distilled water, followed by the absorbance measurement of the positive control without chloroplast being added. Then, 100μl of spinach chloroplast solution from the centrifuge tube was added to test tubes A 1-9, and 100μl of strawberry chloroplast solution from the other centrifuge tube was added to test tubes B 1-9. As each test tube had chloroplast solution added to it, a small bit was obtained and the absorbance was analyzed in the spectrophotometer for an initial measurement. After absorbance measurement, each test tube was put in its respective condition. Test tubes +, A1-A3 and B1-B3 were put under a lamp at room temperature, 22℃. Test tubes A4-A6 and B4-B6 were put under a lamp in an ice bath with a temperature of 1℃, and test tubes A7-A9 and B7-B9 were placed under a lamp in a hot water bath at 35℃. The procedure of recording absorbances was repeated every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. Percent change in absorbance over the time for each condition was recorded at each absorbance measurement, and used for the statistical test for significance. An ANOVA test was run to compare the percent change between temperature conditions within a species percent change between temperature conditions among the species to see if a difference was present.


Results:
For both leaves, the patterns of photosynthetic activity were rather inhibited for cold temperatures and were more efficient for high temperatures, as evidenced by the positive percent changes in figures 1 and 2 for the cold condition, and the negative percent changes in figures 1 and 2 for the hot condition. It was proven using an ANOVA test for significance that for both the spinach and strawberry conditions, the difference between room temperature and cold photosynthetic activity was significant, as was the difference between room temperature and hot photosynthetic activity. 


Discussion:
It is concluded that temperature does have a significant effect on the photosynthetic activity of both spinach and strawberry chloroplasts. This can be most logically explained through the excitement of electrons in the light reactions. In the light reactions, light comes in contact with the chlorophyll in photocenter II, and electrons from oxidized oxygen are excited and gain enough energy to begin the electron transport process [Suss: 1985]. In this experiment, DCPIP was also being oxidized, which is what caused the lowering of absorption, because oxidation of DCPIP makes the compound clearer. In cold temperatures, it takes longer for reactions to occur because cold temperatures slow movement of molecules and electrons. So, it would take longer for the light to provide enough energy for the electrons to get to a point of being able to oxidize DCPIP and continue in electron transport. In warm temperatures, the heat provides more energy, making electrons even more readily available for electron transport because they are so excited.  Some limitations to this test include a small sample size, a lower chloroplast density than one would have in a professional lab, and human error associated with measurements and solution making. All of these factors could have contributed to a false negative result, but luckily they did not confound the study enough to have a significant impact or change the results.  An interesting extension of the study would be to test extreme heat on chloroplast activity. There is most likely a point where heat will no longer be efficient for photosynthesis, where it would instead begin to denature proteins and other structures vital to proper photosynthetic function. A procedure could include testing five or more species of chloroplast at various high temperatures, to see when each of them started to lose photosynthetic ability.
