Title: Higher Temperature Effects on the Weigh Growth Ratio in Fagopyrum Esculentum Roots Versus Shoots

Abstract:
Temperature, an abiotic factor, creates an environmental pressure which could change a resource allocation in plants. This can be observed through changes in the phenotypes of plants. In this experiment, phenotypic variation in the form of mass ratio of roots and shoots was studied to determine if temperature causes resource allocation in plants. The plant used was Fagopyrum Esculentum, or commonly known as buckwheat. Our prediction was that a higher temperature environment would create a lower weight root to shoot ratio in buckwheat compared to a lower/room temperature environment. Using two incubators at different temperatures, room (27°C) and a higher temperature (32°C), buckwheat plants were grown for two weeks. From the data collected, the temperature change showed that buckwheat plants have no phenotypic variance in weigh root to shoot ratio. This shows that at higher temperatures, buckwheat does not go through allocation to survive in warmer environments.

Introduction:
Phenotypic variations are physical differences between species. This variation can occur due to biotic and abiotic factors that influence plant growth/survival throughout generations. Biotic factors could be environmental pressures that come from other organisms and abiotic factors are pressures that come from non-living resources like wind and temperature. When looking at the limitations that these factors bring, plants use a trade-off, the use of one resource they have large amounts of to make up for lack of other resources, in order to survive in the environment. This resource allocation, or the pattern of how a species uses its limited resources, can be studied by looking at phenotypic variation in the growth of plants (Johnson: 2017). Temperature, an abiotic factor, is one environmental stress that is put on plants, whether it be in a low temperature environment or a high temperature environment. Temperature is found to be an important factor which affects plant development in productivity or pollination. Looking in a controlllled environment, higher temperature increases phenotypic development (Hatfield: 2015). The difference between the same plant growing in different temperature environments could show how the plant adapts phenotypically to a resource allocation of heat.
	One way to look at the phenotypic difference in plants to distinguish a resource allocation is by a root to shoot ratio. The roots of the plant are compared to the shoot, or the stem and leaves of a plant. This data can be collected in a measurement of length or weight, when different conditions are put on plants before they grow. After a growth period and data collection, the ratio can be used to show changes in the different environments (Johnson: 2017). One plant that can be used to show this difference is Fagopyrum Esculentum.
	Fagopyrum Esculentum, or more commonly known as buckwheat, is a common crop on northeastern and northcentral United States farms for livestock food and recently, human food. This plant has a short growing period, and needs minimal heat in order to grow. Too high of temperatures have been recorded to prevent seed growth/reproduction (Meyers: 1994). This short growing period of buckwheat would make it ideal to study in a short amount of time, since growth results could be seen quickly. Since it also thrives in environments with less heat, a stress of temperature change could be used to test allocation in the plant’s phenotype (Hatfield: 2015). With this information about buckwheat and temperature in mind, we predicted that the buckwheat plants grown in a room temperature environment will have a higher root to shoot weight ratio than the buckwheat grown in the higher extreme temperature due to putting more weight into roots to survive in a lower temperature environment.

Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis on plant allocation in warm temperatures, experiments were conducted in a controlllled environment of two different temperature incubators: a room temperature (27°C) and a slightly higher temperature (32°C). In each of the temperature environments 3 replicates were placed to grow for two weeks. Both environments had the same air flow and same light source that provides a controlll of resources to the buckwheat plants that were in different temperatures, and to make sure that only the temperature was causing the changes in the plants. In preparation for the growth period, an estimated amount of 20 buckwheat seeds were placed in the vermiculite soil and given water and Miracle Gro. Each group of seeds were placed in a same size container. The same watering process was used every two days for two weeks to water the buckwheat plants. After a growth period of two weeks, the buckwheat replicates were removed from their incubator environments and were measured for a weight root to shoot ratio. This ratio was recorded for three randoMly selected buckwheat plants in each of the three replicate pots for each temperature environments (a total of 9 root to shoot ratios at 27°C and 9 root to shoot ratios at 32°C). After carefully removing the plants, weighing the total plant, weighing the shoot of the plant, and then calculating the root weight from the total and the shoot, a root to shoot ratio was calculated. After averaging the ratios, we used a two sample, two-tailed t_test to figure out the if there was a statistical significance between the data collected from the 27°C buckwheat plants and the 32°C buckwheat plants.


Results:
By only observing the different buckwheat plants, there was no physical difference. Comparing the weight in a root to shoot ratio, the plants living in the room temperature environment showed similar root to shoot ratio as the buckwheat growing in the higher temperature environment. The overall average root: shoot ratio of the room temperature came out to be 0.22±0.24, while the higher temperature had an average was 0.14±0.073(Figure 1). There were a few trials that came out with different results than the others. In the first trial under the room temperature condition, the ratios were higher in the replicates than that of the other two trials. In the higher temperature condition the second trial had one replicate that was four times the amount of the other two. Besides these variations in the data, the higher temperature had more smaller ratios than the room temperature, but overall both groups had majority of ratio from .11 to .19. After completing a two sample, two tailed t_test, the averages of the controlll group (room temperature) was not statistically significently different than that of the higher temperature environment experimental group (t_stat = 0.87, d.f. = 16, P = 0.40).

Discussion:
After looking at the results founded through the root to shoot ratio in the buckwheat plants, we can say that they do not support the hypothesis that a room temperature buckwheat plant (lower temperature) will have a higher root to shoot weight ratio than a buckwheat plant in a higher temperature environment. Temperature may be a defining factor in the growth of a plant, but the difference used in this experiment did not show any significent results on how it impacts plant allocation (Hatfield: 2015). 
These results match with a similar experiment that was conducted by Hatfield. In a study on plant growth, Hatfield concluded that a higher temperature environment increases the rate of phenological growth in plants, yet no change is observed in the biomass of the plants (Hatfield: 2015). His results coincide with our experiment, showing that the higher temperatures do not affect the biomass, or the mass ratio of root to shoot in plants.
	There was one place that error did occur in our experiment. Since many plants were placed into a small pot to grow, after two weeks the buckwheat was all tangled together. The roots where all tangled together with each other, making removing the buckwheat individually difficult and hard to separate without breaking parts of the plants. This error could have caused a problem with the data collected, since parts of the root could have been missing, and a correct weight would not have been able to be measured.
	To proceed further into this experiment, repetition of this study is required with a few adjustments in the procedure. This study only looked at buckwheat plants in 27°C and 32°C temperature. By including more contrasting temperature, a better representation of temperature affecting plant growth might be seen. Also, by placing less seeds in a small pot or the same amount of seeds in a larger pot, the buckwheat plants would not be competing for space and would be easier to remove and weigh. In addition to procedure adjustments, using more replicates in the study would show a better representation of each of the temperature environments and provide more reliable data. 
	As the world’s temperature increases more every year, due to many different factors distributed on the environment, we cannot help but worry how a temperature increase will affect the growth of plants, especially ones that are used as resources to survive. This experiment concluded that with a temperature increase in the environment, even if it was small difference, buckwheat plants were able to survive in a warmer environment. Our buckwheat plants had no resource allocation change with temperature, showing that they will continue to grow in the same way, if a warmer temperature factor is placed on them. Buckwheat might not show plasticity in the new environment, but being a resource that can continue to grow the same way with an environmental temperature change provides potential insight on how plants might grow in the future due to a rising global temperature.
