Title: Effect of Increased Environmental Salinity on Procambrius sp. Metabolic Rate

Abstract:
The objective of this lab was to test the effect of increased salinity on the specific metabolic rate. Metabolism is the collection of cellular processes necessary to maintain homeostasis in the body. Many crustaceans have metabolic processes responsible for maintaining ion concentration as their environmental conditions vary. One can measure metabolic rate indirectly by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed. It was hypothesized that increasing the salinity of the Procambrius sp. environment would result in a change in the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. Each crayfish was placed in a freshwater environment and then in a high salinity solution. By measuring oxygen consumption, the specific metabolic rates for each crayfish in each environment were calculated and then compared. The results were found to be statistically significent (p= .045604) and supported our hypothesis that a change in salinity has an effect on specific metabolic rate. It was found that increased salinity had a negative impact, and lowered the specific metabolic rate of Procambrius sp.

Introduction:
Organisms spend incredible amounts of metabolic energy maintaining internal homeostasis in response to different environmental conditions. Metabolism refers to the collection of cellular processes that result in the synthesis of energy molecules like ATP that are necessary for all physiological processes to occur. Metabolic rate is the measurement of all energy being expended by these processes at a given time and can be measured directly by measuring ATP production and consumption. However, this is incredibly difficult and unrealistic to measure in a whole organism and instead, metabolic rate can be indirectly measured by the amount of oxygen consumed, as oxygen is a critical component of these metabolic processes. This experiment will be measuring the specific metabolic rate of a crayfish and how the rate changes in response to different environmental conditions. Many crustaceans regulate ion concentrations depending on changes in environmental salinity. It has been shown that small changes in salinity (<5ppt) do not result in significent metabolic changes [Meade: 2002]. By measuring the amount of oxygen consumed in fresh water versus water with a high salinity we can determine if more extreme increases in salinity cause a shift in metabolic rate. The crayfish Procambrius sp. is a suitable testing organism because it is a freshwater crayfish and thus it is thought that when placed in a highly saline environment the metabolic rate of the crayfish will shift as it tries to regulate ion concentrations or shift as the crayfish shuts down in these conditions. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if higher, more dramatic increases in salinity result in a change in metabolic rate. It is hypothesized that using higher salinities will result in the shift of the metabolic rate of the freshwater crayfish Procambrius sp.

Materials and Method:
The organism used is a freshwater crayfish Procambrius sp. There were 3 crayfish, and each acted as its own controlll. Each crayfish was weighed and then placed in room temperature water (22°C). Then place the oxygen probe into the screw top jar and secure the lid. After this calibrate the oxygen probe and once calibrated record initial oxygen reading and, begin a timer for 20 minutes. After 5,10,15, and 20 minutes record the level of oxygen remaining in the water. After 20 minutes, remove the crayfish from the freshwater jar. Dump the water from the jar into a large graduated cylinder and record the volume of water. Then place the crayfish in a screw top jar with a salinity concentrated as follows: 6.5% NaCl in 100Ml and places into 900Ml of water. Place the crayfish into the solution and secure oxygen probe by tightening the screw top. Calibrate the oxygen probe and record the initial oxygen level. Then set a timer for 20 minutes. Record the amount of oxygen remaining after 5,10,15 and 20 minutes. After 20 minutes remove the crayfish and dump the water from the screw top jar into a large graduated cylinder and record the volume. Repeat this for all three crayfish. After all data is gathered calculate and compare the specific metabolic rates of each crayfish in each condition. Do this by calculating the amount of oxygen consumed in both freshwater and saltwater, the volume of water the crayfish were in, and then the weight of each crayfish. Plug these values into the following equation for specific metabolic rate: [O2(mg/L)x VH2O(l)]/(Time(hrs)x Weight (g)). 
Once the specific metabolic rate is calculated for each crayfish in each environment, run a paired t_test to determine statistical significance.


Results:
The crayfish seemed slightly more active in the freshwater than the salt water solution. The crayfish in the freshwater were moving more as they tried to escape. In the salt-water solution their movement seemed to decrease. There seemed to be a greater oxygen consumption and thus a greater specific metabolic rate in the freshwater compared to the salt water solution. Data was run through a two-tailed paired t_test, which resulted in a p_value of .0456 and a t-value of 4.521012. The alpha value was .05.

Discussion:
Statistical analysis resulted in a p value less than the alpha value of .05, this allowed for the rejection of the null hypothesis and the support of our alternate hypothesis. The data supports the alternate hypothesis that changing the salinity of the environment would have an effect on the metabolic rate of the Procambrius sp. Our data suggests that the metabolic rate of Procambrius sp. was negatively affected by the change in the salinity of the environment and resulted in a decrease in specific metabolic rate. A possible explanation for this decrease could be that the Procambrius sp. is unable to continue ion regulation in response to the drastic increase in salinity. Instead, the crayfish shuts down its metabolic systems in order to conserve energy and water to increase chances of survival. As shown in previous studies not conducted at the concentration done here; as salinity increased the survival rate of juvenile red-claw crayfish decreased [Meade: 2002]. This observation could explain the results of our experiment as the increased salinity could lead to longer periods of decreased metabolic activity, which results in lower rates of survival. It is possible that in this experiment the Procambrius sp. became less active as its body was unable to regulate ion conditions in this high of a salinity, and thus its metabolic processes began to slow down. The decreased metabolic rate would explain the decrease in oxygen consumption and the perceived lack of movement of the Procambrius sp. when placed in the salt water solution.  The concentration may have been too great for the Procambrius sp. to handle and thus its metabolic processes could not regulate ion concentrations and instead, shut down in response to the increased salinity. To elaborate on these findings further experiments need to be conducted. The next logical step in this study would be to repeat the experiment with a larger sample size, and varying environmental conditions. The experiment will test the effects of a wider range of salinities to potential observe a trend in decreasing specific metabolic rate as salinity increases. This experiment could further support that data found here and attempt to find at what point the Procambrius sp. metabolism can no longer effectively regulate conditions and instead slows all metabolic processes in order to survive.
