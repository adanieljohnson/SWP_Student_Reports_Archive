Title: Tubocurarine’s Effect on the Threshold of Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
With the studies on the effect of tubocurarine on muscles and on human bodies, it can be concluded that tubocurarine has an inhibitory effect on neuromuscular conduction; however, few experiments have been conducted to reveal the mechanism behind this effect, which can possibly be the inhibition on the neuron part and the inhibition on the muscle part. In this study, the latter one will be tested by examining the effect of tubocurarine on the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens, with a null hypothesis that the injection of tubocurarine will not affect the threshold for the muscle to contract. In the experiment, a paired t_test is run after collecting data, with a p_value of 0.203, larger than the critical value 0.05. Thus, there is no sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Introduction:
	In human bodies and other animals, there are two main ways of signaling through organism bodies: nerve systems and hormone-based systems. Nerve systems are different in ways that electric signals are largely involved, and as a result, the speed of the signal transition will be faster than the other systems. An example can be the instant contraction of muscle after stimulated by a nerve. In this study, this neuromuscular controlll will be examined.
A neuromuscular controlll can be briefly explained as 5 steps: 1. An action potential arrives at the end of an axon, reaching the neuromuscular junction. 2. Acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the pre-synapse as a result of depolarization of the neuron. 3. ACh binds to its ligand-gated Na ion channels on the post-synapse to allow Na ion to flow into the postsynaptic cell so that an action potential is fired. 4. This action potential triggers the release of Ca ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the Ca ions enable the contraction of muscles. 
Tubocurarine, which is a kind of a toxin secreted by poison dart frogs and used as arrow poison, has an effect of inhibiting neuromuscular conduction [Paton: 1950]. The studies on tubocurarine are significent in such a way that tubocurarine is presented in tobacco products as an alkaloid. With the effect that smoking is bad for health, the additional effect of tubocurarine should be considered. A comparative study on atracurium and tubocurarine shows that tubocurarine has a significent effect on heart rate and arterial pressure with a comparison to atracurium [Barnes et al.: 1983]. Although those effects do not sound lethal, they can be potential threats, especially to those who have heart diseases or high blood pressure.
	In a previous study on post-tetanic restoration of neuromuscular transmission, it is discovered that tubocurarine can block this process; however, the mechanism behind remains vague [Hutter: 1952]. In this study, one guess on the mechanism is given that the introduction of tubocurarine will increase the threshold of the muscle to contract by blocking the neurotransmitters. The previous studies usually use cat legs, in which the thigh muscle will be monitored. In this experiment, the legs of Rania pipiens, a species of frog, will be tested, and gastrocnemus muscle will be studied. The null hypothesis of this study is that the injection of tubocurarine into the frog legs will result in no significent difference in the threshold of muscle contraction. The alternative hypothesis will be that the injection of tubocurarine will result in a significent difference in the threshold, which is expected.
	In the experiment, the independent variable will be the amount of tubocurarine injection with the dependent variable of the threshold voltage for the muscle to contract. The effect of the injection of tubocurarine will be examined in each frog leg, as they will serve as their own controlll. In other words, the threshold of muscle contraction will be compared before and after the injection of tubocurarine within each frog leg.


Materials and Method:
	Place the frog legs in the dissecting pan. Prepare the legs by pulling the skin off and revealing the gastrocnemus muscle. Label the three frog legs by #1, #2, and #3. Penetrating the gastrocnemus muscle with two pin electrodes and connect the muscle to the force transducer with strings. Make sure the tension on the muscle while hung below the force transducer is neither too big nor too small.
	The software used in this lab is LabScribe Software from iWorx. Connect the recording device to the computer and setup the software. Note that throughout the experiment, the number of pulse should be set to 1, frequency should be set to 1Hz, and pulse width should be set to 5ms in the stimulator controlll panel on the main window inside the LabScribe Software.
	Stimulate the gastrocnemus muscle of leg #1 with voltage from the electrodes. Beginning with an amplitude of 0.1V, record the data from the force transducer. Continue the experiment by increasing amplitude with an increment of 0.1V. After the amplitude reaches 1.0V, increase the amplitude with an increment of 1.0V til the voltage reaches 5.0V.
	Inject 0.2Ml tubocurarine to leg #1 and let it rest for 6 minutes. Then, repeat procedure 4 with leg #1 after the injection of tubocurarine and record the data from the force transducer. Complete the experiment by repeating the procedure from 4 to 6 for leg #2 and #3.
	After data are collected, a paired t_test will be conducted to see if there is a statistical difference between the treatment and the controlll. 


Results:
	The raw data collected during the experiment is the amplitude of stimulus in volts(V) and the force of contraction in newton(N). Those data are summarized because muscle contraction, in this study, is examined as a qualitative variable instead of a quantitative one. In other words, it is a yes-or-no examination rather than studying the change of the force of muscle contraction. Thus, the data of contraction force is used as an indicator to show whether the stimulus reaches the threshold of the muscle, which can be found at the first time when the contraction force changes from 0 to a positive number for each treatment. 
	By observing the summarized data of the threshold for the gastrocnemus muscle to contract, there is a trend in which the injection of tubocurarine does increase the required voltage for the muscle to contract, although the amplitude of change for each leg varies. Thus, a paired t_test should be conducted to examine whether there is a statistical difference between the controlll group and the treatment. 


Discussion:
	The resultant p_value of the t_test is 0.203, and the t-value is 1.866, with a degree of freedom of 2. The p_value of this experiment is much larger than the critical value 0.05; thus, there is no sufficient evidence to say that the injection of tubocurarine to the gastrocnemus muscle in frog legs will increase the threshold for the muscle to contract. In other words, there is no significent difference between the threshold for gastrocnemus muscle before the injection of tubocurarine and that after the injection. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
	Although through rough observation of the data, we can tell that it can be concluded that the injection of tubocurarine has an effect on the threshold of muscle contraction, the result is inconclusive. One reason from the numerical perspective can be that the difference between the threshold before and after injection is relatively small so that the calculation doesn’t favor the alternative hypothesis. This can be caused by the nature of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. From this point of view, the reason why, in previous studies, cat thigh muscles are used instead.
	Other than using muscles of other species to run the experiment, the sample size of the experiment should be increased in order to have a more persuasive result with a smaller error. One reason for a larger sample size is that it can decrease the chance of coincidence. The other reason, which is more important, is that the one of the requirements of running a paired t_test is that the data of the controlll and the treatment are normally distributed. In this case, the sample size of this experiment is too small to tell if the distribution is normal. Therefore, it is critical to have a larger sample size.
	Another potential cause of such a result can be the use of pin electrodes, which penetrate the gastrocnemus muscle and leave holes for the injected tubocurarine to leak out of the muscle. As a result, not all of the 0.2Ml of tubocurarine have been involved. This may explain the result that difference in mean before and after the injection is not significent.
	A possible improvement of this experiment is replacing the pin electrodes with sleeve electrodes. Instead of stimulating the muscle directly, one can choose to stimulate the sciatic nerve near the thigh muscle, which is usually easy to reveal and attach to the electrodes for frog legs. By doing so, the leaking problem of tubocurarine can be solved, and the result of this test conducted by stimulating the sciatic nerve can be compared to the result conducted by directly stimulating the gastrocnemus muscle. In this way, the mechanism of how tubocurarine increases the threshold and how it affects heart rate and blood pressure can be examined more.
	Another change can be choosing legs from a different species rather than Rania pipiens. Using the thigh muscle of cats can be an option, while there are a lot of other choices. The reason that using cats will be more appropriate is that cats are mammals, but frogs are reptiles. Therefore, muscles from cats can better reflect the effect of tubocurarine on human bodies, and thus gives the study more significance.
