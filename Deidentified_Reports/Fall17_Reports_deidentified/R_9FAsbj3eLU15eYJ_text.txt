Title: The Effects of the Presence of Calcium on the Contractions of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The leg of a Rana pipiens is stimulated until its threshold is found. At that threshold both the contractile forces and contractile periods are measured before and after the injection of a calcium channel activator, A23187. The researchers expected no difference in force, but a longer contractile period after the injection. The average force for all three frog legs before the injection was 0.209 V and after the injection it was 0.296 V. The average contractile period for all three frog legs before the injection was 112.533 ms and after the injection it was 101.467 ms. Between the two groups, there were no statistically significant difference between contractile forces as there was a p-value from the two-tailed paired t-test of 0.5738. There was also no statistically significant difference between contractile periods of the two groups as the p-value from the two-tailed paired t-test was 0.4476. The control group was a normal leg of a Rana pipiens and the experimental group was each leg in the control group pipiens injected with A23187.

Introduction:
Calcium causes excitation in nerve cells and muscle cells. In the neuromuscular system, the opening of calcium channels and subsequent release of calcium ions causes the troponin to move the tropomyosin out of the way allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin and results in the power stroke. The thick and thin filaments in each sarcomere slide closer together and overlap more. This occurrence in each sarcomere causes the contraction of the muscle. [Sadava: 2017] Another experiment conducted used caffeine to investigate the effects of calcium on the nervous systems of rabbits. This study found that the contractions were dependent on extracellular calcium. [Daher: 2009] To see the effects of a calcium channel activator on the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens, the researchers are stimulating the sciatic nerve with and without the presence of A23187. The researchers predicted that applying A23187, a calcium channel activator, will result in the same contractile force, but a longer contractile period. This is expected because due to the calcium channel activator the calcium channels will be open at all times rather than just in response to the stimulus. This means calcium is present for a shorter period of time in the control group than once the A23187 is injected. Calcium is what allows for the power stroke and therefore the contraction to occur. Because calcium would be present at all times in the experimental group the researchers expected the contraction would be able to be sustained for a longer period of time and that the muscle would take longer to relax. The independent variables are the presence of or lack thereof of A23187 and the voltage applied to the frog leg. The dependent variables are the contractile time period and contractile force.

Materials and Methods:
Using the IXTA the researchers stimulated three different sciatic nerves and gastrocnemius muscles of the legs of Rana pipiens as the control group and found the threshold voltage of each leg before applying A23187 to each leg. The researchers then used the threshold already found for each leg to stimulate them after the A23187 was applied and comparing the force and duration of the contractions to the force and duration of the contractions of each frog leg before the A23187 was applied. The A23187 was 100mM and 0.1 mL was injected into each frog leg. The researchers are using a two-tailed paired t-test to compare the duration and force of the contractions once the calcium channel activator was applied verses on the same frog leg before the calcium channel activator was applied. 

Results:
In the first frog leg the average force of the A23187 frog leg was slightly greater than the average force of the normal frog leg. In the second frog leg the average force of the A23187 frog leg was almost twice as great as the average force of the normal frog leg. In the third frog leg the average force of the A23187 frog leg was about one sixth of the average force of the normal frog leg. The difference in contractile force was shown not to be statistically significant as the p-value in the two-tailed paired t-test was 0.5738. In the first frog leg the average contractile period of the A23187 frog leg was much greater than the average contractile period of the normal frog leg. In the second frog leg the average contractile period of the A23187 frog leg was somewhat less than the average contractile period of the normal frog leg. In the third frog leg the average contractile period of the A23187 frog leg was much less than the average contractile period of the normal frog leg. The difference in contractile period was shown also not to be statistically significant as the p-value in the two-tailed paired t-test was 0.4476.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that applying A23187, a calcium channel activator, will result in the same contractile force, but a longer contractile period, was not supported by the experiment because between the control frog legs and those same frog legs given A23187 there was no statistical difference in contractile force or contractile period. The contractile force, although not statistically significant, was on average greater in the presence of A23187. The average contractile force in the control group was 0.209 V and the average contractile force once A23187 was injected was 0.296 V.  The researchers believe that the calcium channel activator allowed a greater amount of calcium to go through rather than just allowing calcium to be present for a longer period of time. The researchers think the greater presence of calcium allowed more troponins to move tropomyosins out of the way on sarcomeres. This would allow for more sarcomeres to contract than would under the conditions of the control and would allow the frog leg to produce a stronger contractile force. In the control group, only the typical amount of calcium was allowed through the calcium channels and therefore fewer troponins were able to move tropomyosins out of the way on sarcomeres. Therefore, fewer sarcomeres contract than in the presence of A23187 and the frog leg contractile force is weaker. The contractile period, although also not statistically significant, was on average less in the presence of A23187. The average contractile period in the control group was 122.533 ms and the average contractile period once A23187 was injected was 101.467 ms.  The researchers believe that because there was greater amount of calcium allowed to go through due to the calcium channel activator that the troponin in the sarcomeres moved the tropomyosin out of the way more quickly and allowed for a shorter contraction. [Sadava: 2017] The larger presence of calcium permitted by the A23187 seems to produce stronger contractions, but shorter contractions. However, only three frog legs were used in this experiment and statistical significance is hard to achieve with only three legs and the procedure should be repeated on more frog legs. It would be interesting to see the effects of a calcium channel inhibitor and if it had the exact opposite effect on contractions: weaker, but longer.
