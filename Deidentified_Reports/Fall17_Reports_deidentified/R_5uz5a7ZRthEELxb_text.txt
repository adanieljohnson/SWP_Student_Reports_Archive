Title: The Effects of Darkness on the Specific  Metabolic Rate of the Species Procambris sp. 

Abstract:
The experiment and statistical analysis of this study attempt to examine the effect of darkness on metabolic rate of a heterotroph. We hypothesized that there will be a significent difference between a Procambris sp. metabolic rate with exposure to darkness versus exposure to daylight. This was done by testing the oxygen consumption of three Procambris sp. organisms. We used a dissolved oxygen-meter to measure the amount of oxygen consumed by each organism over a period of twenty minutes. Each Procambris sp. functioned as their own controlll, as prior to exposure to darkness, the oxygen consumed whilst exposed to normal daylight was observed. Heterotrophs exposed to darkness is experimentally observed to decrease organisms’ metabolic rate, compared to metabolic rate with exposure to light. Our results did not support this finding as the Procambris sp. metabolic rates did not consistently decrease with exposure to darkness. The inconsistencies in metabolic rate as an effect of exposure to darkness is accordingly shown by the low statistical significance demonstrated by the P-value of our data being 0.850778, on average, which is above 0.05. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported because there was no significent difference present in the data. 


Introduction:
The term metabolism refers to the entirety of the process of organisms balancing captured energy, conversion of this energy, and transfer of this energy within cells of an organism. Metabolic rate is the quantifiable amount of energy expended by all physiological processes at a specified moment. In terms of measuring metabolic rate, oxygen consumption and, conversely, carbon dioxide production are indirect measures of the amount of energy generated by an organism. While the oxygen utilized in the midst of this process is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended.  With that said, although the process of metabolism is primarily carried out internally within a given organism, the exploration of the external effects on this process are crucial, for an organism utilizes matter within its surroundings in order for the process of metabolism to occur. The specimen Procambris sp. (crayfish) is an ectotherm and is therefore incredibly useful in measuring metabolic rate; for, unlike other organisms, it is very easy for ectotherms to alter their body temperature and, consequently, affect their metabolic rate. The temperature of an organism can be extensively varied due to various different environmental conditions. Therefore, body temperature is correlated to metabolic rate. Warmer temperatures increase energy production, and, consequently, metabolic rate. Accordingly, ectotherms have been observed to operate at higher metabolic rates during the summer, rather than in the spring [Angilletta: 2001]. The findings from this experiment align with the goals of our experiment, as temperature and light exposure varies during different seasons. Thus, it follows that the ectotherms observed in the mentioned experiment had a higher metabolic rate during the summer, when light exposure and temperature are increased.  In order to observe the effects on metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. crayfish under varying environmental circumstances, the effects of a dark environment (the absence of light) on the oxygen consumed by the organism, and therefore metabolic rate, was observed. The darkness and environmental conditions served as the independent variables, while the effects on oxygen consumption and metabolic rate served as the dependent variables. We hypothesized that the absence of light would significently decrease the amount of oxygen consumed by the crayfish, and thus, decrease metabolic rate, in comparison to a Procambris sp. exposed to light.


Materials and Method:
Three Orconectes organisms was obtained and tested on that had previously been kept in a controlllled lab environment. Each Orconectes functioned as their own controlll, as prior to exposure to darkness, the oxygen consumed whilst exposed to normal daylight was observed. Oxygen consumption was monitored by using a dissolved oxygen meter, and metabolic rate was accordingly calculated using an equation that accounts for various conditions: Oxygen consumed (mg/L), volume of oxygenated water (L), time (minutes), and weight (g) of the Orconectes organism used. In order to create a dark environment, we covered the entirety of the dissolved oxygen meter with opaque tinfoil. Both conditions of exposure to darkness and exposure to light was monitored for twenty minutes, while the oxygen consumption was recorded, using the oxygen-meter, every five minutes. This procedure was carried out for all three Orconectes specimens. After all of the values of oxygen consumption at the intended intervals were recorded within the water of the dissolved oxygen-meter, the true amount of oxygen consumed by the Orconectes specimens was determined. In order to calculate the amount of oxygen consumed by each organism during each minute-interval, the change in oxygen concentration (numerical value of final oxygen concentration minus numerical value of initial oxygen concentration) in the water was multiplied by the total volume of water within the screw-top glass testing chamber (in liters). This value was then be divided by the amount of time (in minutes) multiplied by the weight (in grams) of the individual organism. The value calculated from this equation yielded the specific metabolic rate of each individual organism in mg O2 * g-1 * min-1. A paired T-test was used to evaluate the significance in the differences between the controlll and experimental groups.


Results:
Specimen 1 of the Procambris sp. exhibited a specific metabolic rate of 0.00084 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to light, and a specific metabolic rate of 0.00085 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to darkness. Specimen 2 of the Procambris sp. exhibited a specific metabolic rate of 0.00034 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to light, and a specific metabolic rate of 0.00012 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to darkness. Specimen 3 of the Procambris sp. exhibited a specific metabolic rate of 0.00013 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to light, and a specific metabolic rate of 0.00043 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to darkness. The standard deviation for the controlll and experimental groups collectively are 0.000364896 and 0.000363493, respectively.  With a final T-test P-value of 0.850778 being much higher than the P-value of 0.5, our data demonstrates no significent difference between the two environmental conditions. A common trend was not seen across the three Procambris sp. specimens.


Discussion:
With a final T-test P-value of 0.850778 being much higher than the P-value of 0.05, our data demonstrates no significent difference between the two environmental conditions. The standard deviation for the controlll and experimental groups collectively are 0.000364896 and 0.000363493, respectively. A common trend was not seen across the three Procambris sp. specimens. Thus, it can be concluded that exposure to darkness at our specific time-scale has no effect on Specific Metabolic Rate, as there is no significent difference between groups.  A different study that also observed the effects of environmental conditions on metabolic rate of a different heterotroph, much like our experiment. The heterotroph observed in the alternative study were specimens of Oreochromis Niloticus (adult tilapias). The alternative experiment observed the influence of different photoperiod cycles on the metabolic rate and energy loss of adult tilapia Oreochromis Niloticus [Biswas: 2002]. Photoperiodism is the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of day or night [Goldman: 1983]. The photoperiod-mediated cycles observed in this experiment demonstrated metabolic rate to be higher for all adult tilapia Oreochromis Niloticus during the light phases, compared to the metabolic rate during dark phases [Biswas: 2002].   Taking into consideration the scholarly experiments performed on other heterotrophs, published information on the effects of environmental conditions on organisms’ metabolic rates, and the experiment we performed, our data obtained did not align with the results of other studies. We hypothesized that with exposure to darkness, specific metabolic rate would decrease, however we observed no significent effects on specific metabolic rate.  However, this conclusion is puzzling due to other experiments suggesting our hypothesis to be true. For further experimentation, a much larger sample size, longer periods of time, and varying sizes of screw-top glass testing chambers should be employed. Possible sources of error within our experiment could be a probe malfunction, or that the screw-top glass testing chamber was not properly sealed, causing our data to be skewed.
