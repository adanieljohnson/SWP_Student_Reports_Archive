Title: Effect of 2% solution of sevin on the threshold voltage for nerve stimulation

Abstract:
Nerves allow organisms to respond to the internal and external environment. Threshold voltage of nerve can indicate when it responds to the external stimulation. Carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate), the active ingredient in sevin, is a carbamate insecticide that operates as a nerve agent by inhibiting acetylcholine esterase (AChE). Without AChE, the effect of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter which can lead to action potential, cannot be determined. The aim of this study was to find out the effect of 2% solution of sevin on the threshold voltage when the nerve of the frog leg was stimulated with single pulses of constant duration. The frogs were Rania pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog. We first determined the threshold voltage of the 3 given frog legs respectively. Then, 2% solution of sevin was injected into 3 legs. The threshold would be determined again after the injection. The hypothesis is that 2% solution of sevin decreases the threshold voltage for nerve stimulation when the nerve is stimulated with single pulses of constant duration. The results indicated that although the threshold voltage decreased 0.08V on average, the presence of 2% solution of sevin did not significently influence the threshold voltage for nerve stimulation.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to internal and external environments［Johnson: 2017］. In neuromuscular system, acetylcholine (ACh) , an important neurotransmitter, mediates fast excitatory neurotransmission by binding to specific receptors［Olsen: 2014］. Some chemicals have an influence on synaptic transmission. Carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate), the active ingredient in sevin［Mas: 2002］and often sold under the commercial name sevin［Relyea: 2006］, is a carbamate insecticide that can inhibit acetylcholine esterase (AChE). AChE determines synaptic transmission at cholinergic synapses by breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Carbamate insecticides are slowly reversible inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholine esterase (AChE). ACh is a neurotransmitter, which binds with the specific receptor on the membrane and fires an action potential in the muscle fiber［Johnson:2017］. Sevin can interfere with the cholinergic nervous system and may cause death because the effects of the neurotransmitter cannot be determined by AChE. The independent variable is the presence or absence of 2% solution of sevin. The dependent variable is the threshold voltage for nervous stimulation. The hypothesis is that the 2% solution of sevin can decrease the threshold voltage for nerve stimulation when the nerve is stimulated with single pulses of constant duration.

Materials and Method:
The frogs were Rania pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog. The 3 given frog legs were placed in a dissecting pan. The skin at the top of the leg was grasped and was pulled down towards the foot with a pair of forceps. A dissecting probe was used to gently separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. The sciatic nerve was gently freed from its attaching connective tissue with dissecting needles and forceps. The exposed tissues should be moisten (but not drowning) with frog Ringer’s solution［Johnson:2017］. At first, set pulse amplitude (Amp) to 0.000V, number of pulses (#pulses) to 1, frequency (F(Hz)) to 1, and pulse width (W) to 5 milliseconds. The increment of amplitude was 0.1V each time within the range from 0.1V to 1V. The threshold voltage of the nerve was determined without 2% solution of sevin of each 3 legs. After determining the threshold voltage, the frog legs were injected with 1Ml 2% solution of sevin. The threshold voltage of the nerve was again determined after the injection of 2% solution of sevin of each leg.

Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed with paired t_test at a 95% confidence level. The leg injected with 1 Ml 2% solution of sevin was compared with itself when it was not injected with 2% solution of sevin.

Results:
As figure 1 shows, in trial 1 and trial 3, the threshold voltage decreased 0.04V and 0.3V respectively after the injection of 1Ml 2% solution of sevin. In trial 2, the threshold voltage slightly increased after the injection of 1Ml 2% solution of sevin. After running the paired t_test, there is no significent difference between the threshold voltage between controlll group and test group.

Discussion:
After the injection of 2% solution of sevin, the threshold voltage of trial 1 and trial 3 decreased, which supported the hypothesis. While the threshold voltage of trial 2 slightly increased after the injection of 2% solution of sevin, which did not support the hypothesis. Because sevin is a carbamate insecticide that operates as a nerve agent by inhibiting acetylcholine esterase (AChE), the effects of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) cannot be determined. With the injection of 2% solution of sevin, there will be more ACh, so, the action potential will be more easily to fire, which is likely to decrease the threshold voltage. Although the threshold decreased 0.08V on average, there was no significent difference between the threshold voltage of controlll group and test group. For further studies about the influence of sevin on the threshold, various concentration may have different effects on the threshold voltage. Since nerve is more sensitive to the stimulation; an alternative is to determine the threshold voltage for muscle stimulation when the muscle is stimulated with single pulses of constant duration.
