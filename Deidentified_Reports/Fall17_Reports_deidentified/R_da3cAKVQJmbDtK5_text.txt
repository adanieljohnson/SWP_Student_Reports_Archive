Title: Effect of lanthanum chloride on the threshold and amplitude of Gastrocnemius muscle contraction in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of a calcium channel blocker, 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride, on the threshold and amplitude voltage of the Gastrocnemius muscle contraction in Rana pipiens. The release of neurotransmitters caused by the stimulation of a nerve revolves around the entry of calcium cations through voltage-gated ion channels in the plasma membrane. We hypothesized that the injection of the 0.1 mM lanthanum, chloride in the Gastrocnemius muscle will restrict the entry of calcium cations, causing the frog legs to have lower amplitudes of muscle contraction that the control groups and thus, the threshold voltage to trigger a response will be higher in comparison. To test this, we stimulated the sciatic nerve and determined the threshold voltages and average amplitude for each frog legs, with and without the calcium channel blocker. Our experiment resulted in conflicting data, with the experimental frog leg 4 having a higher amplitude and lower threshold compared to its control, and prevents us from making a conclusion. The logical next step in this experiment would be to increase the number of replicates with the existing methods, but make sure the frog legs are of similar condition.

Introduction:
The nervous system, unlike the hormone system, uses electrical impulses through neurons and glial cells to respond to the internal and external environment, within milliseconds. An example, and the one tested in this experiment, is the neuromuscular system, which includes the muscles in the body and the nerves that innervate them. Here, a nerve stimulates muscle contraction through excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. These skeletal muscles, consisting of myofibers bound to form functional groups, are innervated by motor neurons. Nerve impulse and action potentials arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine (ACh) then binds to its receptor on the muscle membrane potential in the muscle fiber. This causes release of calcium cations (Ca2+), causing the muscle to contract [Johnson: 2016]. Research has been done on this topic, and has shown that neurotransmitter release by nerve stimulation is highly dependent on the entry of the calcium cations (Ca2+) through voltage-gate ion channels. And that some calcium channel blockers blocked nerve-elicited muscle action potentials and inhibited synaptic transmission, while others had no effect [Protti: 1996]. To test these findings and whether blocking calcium channels will hinder muscle contraction, we will connect BNC connector electrode to the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens or Northern Leopard Frog. The rana pipiens was a good model organism for this experiment because we are easily able to catch and retrieve the frog legs and access the relatively Gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve that innervates it. We will measure the amplitude of muscle stimulation and contraction and the threshold voltage that elicits a response for the frog legs as the dependent variable with and without the calcium channel blocker, 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride, which is the independent variable. We expect that the 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride treated frog legs will have lower amplitudes of muscle contraction that the control groups and thus, the threshold voltage to trigger a response will be higher in comparison.

Materials and Methods:
1.	Assigned 4 freshly caught Rana pipeins frog legs kept on ice ranging in size, and were skinned, and their Gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve separated and exposed. 
2.	A light load to the Gastrocnemius muscle was applied by raising the force transducer with the tension adjuster. The frog leg was pinned down to a tray to and no metal was near the sciatic nerve or the Gastrocnemius muscle.
3.	The BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes to the BNC-banana adapter was connected to the force transducer and the BNC-banana adapter was attached on both leads to the sciatic nerve.
4.	The force transducer was then connected to a computer with the iWorks LabScribe software installed with these specific variables:
a.	Pulse amplitude (Amp): 0.000 V
b.	Number of pulses (# pulses): 1
c.	Frequency (F(Hz)): 1
d.	Pulse width (W): 5ms
5.	The twitch threshold voltage was determined to two decimal places for each frog leg by nerve stimulation was found by applying increasing amplitude pulses and overserving the presence or absence of a muscle twitch for 5 secs and the results put into a table.
6.	The amplitude of a certain voltage that gave a strong response depending on the size of the gastrocnemius muscle contraction was measured for each frog leg and then the amplitudes were averaged and the results put into a table.
7.	After, finding the threshold voltage and average amplitude for each frog leg muscle contraction, each frog leg was injected with 2mL of 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker, using a 10-mL syringe and were set aside for 10 minutes for the 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride to have time to spread in the muscle and the frog leg.
8.	Steps 5-6 were then repeated for the experimental frog legs that were treated with the 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride and the results put into a table.
9.	After collecting the threshold voltage and average amplitude for each frog leg muscle contraction, paired t-test comparing the control group and the experimental group frog legs treated with the 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride was run.

Results:
Figure 1: 
The threshold voltages for muscle contraction of the Gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens frog for the four control and experiment legs treated with 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride are shown above. The control frog legs 1 and 3 had a lower threshold than the experimental, while control frog legs 2 and 4 had a higher threshold value than the experimental. 

Figure 2:
The average amplitude for certain voltages of muscle contraction of the Gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens frog for the four control and experiment legs treated with 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride are shown above. The control frog legs 1,2,3 had a higher average amplitude than the the experimental group, while control frog leg 4 had a lower average amplitude than the experimental group.

When measuring the threshold voltages of the Gastrocnemius muscle contraction in the Rana pipiens, the control group of frog legs 1 and 3 had a lower threshold voltage value than the experimental group of these frog legs treated with the 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride. Meaning it took these control group frog legs less volts to elicit a contraction. However, the control groups of frog legs 2 and 4, actually had a higher threshold voltage than when they were injected with the 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride. The paired t-test of this measurement resulted in a t-stat = 0.152969, a degree of freedom (df) = 3, and a P-value = 0.888132. When measuring the average amplitude voltage of the Gastrocnemius muscle contraction, the control group of frog legs 1,2,3 had a higher average amplitude than the experimental group of these frog legs treated with the 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride, while control frog leg 4 had a lower average amplitude than its experimental group. The praired t-test of this measurement resulted in a t-stat = 1.602869, a degree of freedom (df) = 3, and a P value = 0.207292. Since both P-values, 0.888 and 0.207, are both greater than 0.05, we can determine that our experimental and control groups are not statistically different from one another.

Discussion:
Our data on threshold voltage and amplitude for the muscle contraction of the Rana pipens legs, neither supported or disproved our hypothesis that the 0.1 mM lanthanum chloride treated frog legs will have lower amplitudes of muscle contraction that the control groups and thus, the threshold voltage to trigger a response will be higher in comparison. We found that two experimental frog legs, 2 and 4, actually had a lower threshold value than the control frog legs, which contradicts our hypothesis as shown in Figure 1. And that the experimental frog leg 4 had a higher average amplitude than the control group, which contradicts our hypothesis as shown in Figure 2. At the same time, however, control frog legs 1 and 3 had a lower threshold than the experimental and control frog legs 1,2,3 had a higher average amplitude than the experimental group, which supports the hypothesis. The results of a study done in 1996 posted in Neurobiology shows that some calcium channel blockers blocked nerve-elicited muscle action potentials and inhibited synaptic transmission [Protti: 1996)], which would lead us to believe that a muscle injected with a calcium channel blocker would result in a higher threshold and lower amplitude voltage in muscle contraction. And as seen above, some of our frog legs supported this result, while other did not, namely frog leg 4. One issue or limitation with our experiment was that two of our frog legs, 3 and 4, were freshly caught and warm and were from the same frog, while frog legs 1 and 2 were slightly older and cold on ice, and from different frogs. Since all of our frog legs, and thus their Gastrocnemius muscle, varied in size and temperature, this may have affected the results. One way to extend or expand this experiment would be to increase the number of replicates with the existing methods. Having more data points will allow us to be able to narrow out the would-be outliers, frog leg 4, that are impossible to single out with only three or four frog legs and such a small sample size.
