Title: The effects of changes in humidity on allocation of resources in Raphanus sativus.

Abstract:
This experiment explores the effects of humidity on the resource allocation of Raphanus sativus, more widely known as radishes. Resource allocation is calculated through measuring the root-to-shoot ratio of the plants. For this lab, we investigated the root-to-shoot ratio in R. sativus plants in high humidity environments versus low humidity environments. To find the root-to shoot ratios, we measured the weight of the total R. sativus plant (in grams), then we measured the length of the shoots and roots (in millimeters) and the weight of the shoots (in grams). From the experiment, we found that the R. sativus plants in the low humidity environment would have a higher root-to-shoot ratio than the high humidity environment. We found that these results could very well be due to the fact that plants in low humidity environments will need a vast system of roots, in order to reach groundwater and fulfill their need for water consumption. 


Introduction:
Within the environment, it is important that a plant adapts and develops an effective form of allocating resources. Resource allocation refers to the idea that a species will develop a model in order to distribute and use its limited resources in the most effective way possible. (Bio 113 Resource Guide; 2017) Some plants may form different phenotypic expressions in order to best fit their environment and receive their resources more effectively. When a plant expends energy, there is considered to be a “trade-off”; therefore, it is important that a plant finds the most successful way to allocate resources. For example, if a plant is exposed to an environment of high humidity, then it may not require an extensive root system. Whereas, if the plant lacked the availability of water, then it may be in need of longer, more complex roots. An effective way to measure resource allocation in plants is through root-to-shoot ratios of the biomass of the plant. This differentiation in phenotype can be distinguished in Raphanus sativus, radishes, when they are set in environments of different levels of humidity.  For our experiment, we placed R. sativus plants in two differing environments: low humidity and high humidity. We predicted that if a R. sativus plant is raised in a high humidity environment, then it will have a lower root-to-shoot ratio than a R. sativus plant raised in a low humidity environment. 

Materials and Method:
For our experiment, we obtained 120 R. sativus seeds and split them up into six pots. We planted 20 R. sativus seeds in 4 rows of 5 in approximately four inches of vermiculite. Of the six pots, three were placed in an air-tight aquarium. The other three pots were placed in another air-tight aquarium, but this aquarium had the pots sitting on stilts, and the base of the aquarium was filled with about two inches of water in order to simulate the high humidity environment. The water level of the aquarium was marked, and kept constant throughout the experiment. The plants were then watered each day for a week. Once the plants were watered in the greenhouse for a week, they were taken out of the vermiculite, washed, and prepared for measurement. We then selected five random plants from each of the three pots in both humidity environments. Each plant was measured as a whole, then the roots and shoots of each plant were measured and weighed. From the measured values, we selected the maximum root and shoot lengths from both the controlll group and experimental group. For the weight of the roots and shoots, we averaged the measured weights. After finding the lengths and averaged weight of each of the plants, we calculated the root-to-shoot ratios for the two differing environments, as well as their standard deviation. For our experiment, we determined that there is a 5% chance that the null hypothesis for this experiment is supported. Then, a two-tailed T-test was performed to find out if the data held statistical significance. 


Results:
Our data revealed that R. sativus plants grown in high humidity environments will have a smaller root-to-shoot ratio than the R. sativus plants grown in a low humidity environment. In the high humidity environment, the average root-to-shoot weight ratio was 0.2183 , the average root weight was 0.1153 g, and the average shoot weight was 0.532 g. The standard deviation of the high humidity environment was found to be 0.0213. Also within the high humidity environment, the maximum root length was 165.833 mm and the maximum shoot length was found to be 161.667 mm; this totaled to a root-to-shoot ratio of 1.0287, and a standard deviation of 0.1225. For the plants in the low humidity environment, the average root weight was 0.146 g, and the average shoot weight of 0.496 g, leading to a root-to-shoot ratio of 0.2983. The standard deviation of the low humidity environment was found to be 0.0716. The low humidity environment had a maximum root length of 183.667 mm, and a maximum shoot length of 140.000 mm, leading to a root-to-shoot ratio of 1.3226. The standard deviation of the low humidity group was found to be 0.2293. The statistical difference between the two groups was found through a T-value that resulted as 9.403392. For this statistical test, the degree of freedom was 10. We found the P-value of our statistical test to be 0.00000279. Our data from this experiment is located in Figure 1. and Table 1. below.


Discussion:
At the conclusion of our experiment and analysis of our statistical tests, we found that our original hypothesis was supported. Raphanus sativus plants in low humidity environments would generate a higher root biomass and length, as opposed to Raphanus sativus plants grown in high humidity environments. This analysis was determined through the comparison of the root-to-shoot ratios between the two groups of experimentation. The low humidity group had a root-to-shoot ratio of 1.3226, and the high humidity group had a root-to-shoot ratio of 0.2983. So, therefore, the radishes of the low humidity group would generate much more biomass towards their roots, in order to receive water, and the radishes of the high humidity group would reveal more biomass in the shoots, because water is readily available in the humid air. 
	In nature, plants are always trying to be efficient when it comes to energy expulsion. Therefore, plants will typically invest more biomass into aboveground or belowground parts, depending on in which part the most limiting resource is located (Rosenvald, K; 2014). In the case of this lab, the water is the limiting resource, and we investigated how the R.sativus plants would react to the presence of high levels of water vapor in its surroundings. We found that the R. sativus plants in the high humidity would overcompensate their aboveground parts, in order to conserve energy and perform at their highest fitness in the environment. 
	Sources of error within our experiment may include failure to fully isolate all of the humidity within the environment, and also the possibility of the radishes growing differently due to their location and access to sunlight within the greenhouse. Another study analyzing the effects of high air humidity on the growth and morphology of temperate forest herbs, found that woodland herbs would require high humidity environments for optimal growth (Lendzion; 2009). These researchers found that if the herb was exposed to drier climates, then it would not produce as many leaf buds; therefore, they would allocate for more resources through their roots. 
	The overall purpose of our lab was to determine how plants can alter their phenotypic expression in order to be most effective when it comes to resource allocation. From this experiment, a future study could incorporate the idea of resource allocation into understanding why some plants are more effectively grown in certain environments, versus others. Also, these results can serve help to understand the effects of humidity on the growth of plants.
