Title: The effect of the environment on the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish

Abstract:
The specific metabolic rate is the balancing of energy capture, conversion and transfer within cells of an organism. We hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish would decrease in darker environment and increase in lighter environments. We measured the oxygen consumption of three crayfish when left in dark and light water environment for a certain amount of time, we then calculated their metabolic rate. The t-value of our results was 0.4591, lower than 0.05, so not significent. The crayfish left in the dark did not have a lower metabolic rate, theirs was actually higher compared to the ones left in the lighter water environment.

Introduction:
The specific metabolic rate includes the balancing of energy capture, conversion and transfer within cells of an organism. The objective of this experiment is to measure the metabolic rate of the Procambris, Crayfish in different environments; light and darkness. The Procambris are ectotherm which means that they can alter their body temperature much more easily according to their environments temperature. The fact that they are ectotherms affect their specific metabolic rate (Johnson, 2017). We will be measuring the crayfishâ€™s metabolic rate by measuring the oxygen concentration in the water which determines the oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide produced consumed by the crayfish. The oxygen we inhale gains electrons and is converted into water and the exhaled carbon dioxide is the remainder of the glucose molecules that were broken down for the ATP production. The independent variable in this experiment is the darkness of the environment and the dependent variable is the oxygen concentration of the water. We predicted that, the crayfish would consume more oxygen in the light than in the dark due to the lowered levels of stress which coincide with the placement of the crayfish in the dark environment. We hypothesized that darker environments will cause a decrease in the crayfish metabolic rate and that the lighter environment will cause a decrease in the crayfish metabolic rate. 

Materials and Method:
First, we gathered three crayfish, and measured and recorded their weight. We measured and pored 890 Ml of fresh water into a jar every time we used a new crayfish. We then used a net each time we scooped a crayfish to place it into the water in the jar. The jar is the test chamber which we placed into a dishpan filled with water. For each crayfish, we screw the lid of the jar they were in and turned on the instrument that measures the oxygen concentration in the water. We recorder the original oxygen level, then recorded every 5 minutes up to 20 minutes. we recorded the data for the three crayfish in the light then in the dark. In order to make the environment of the crayfish dark, we wrapped the test chamber in tinfoil, keeping the light from entering the jar. Once all of the data was recorded, we clean everything up and scooped the crayfish with nets to put them back into their respective tanks. The statistical test we used was a paired t_test. 

Results:
The figures show that, the crayfish consumed more oxygen in the dark water than in the light water, they also show that metabolic rates of the crayfish left in the dark are higher than the metabolic rates of the ones left in the light water. The P-value is 0.69123, the t-value is 0.4591 and the degrees of freedom is 2. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment seem to show that the crayfish placed in the dark show an increase in specific metabolic rate compared to the ones placed in the light. We would need more data on this in order to determine whether the results fully reject our hypothesis (as we only used 3 crayfish). The first two crayfish we experimented on where both going against the hypothesis as their metabolic rates were higher in the dark whereas with the third crayfish, we measured opposite results. I included table 2 to show the two first crayfish we manipulated more specifically. Possible reasons why the metabolic rates were, overall unexpectedly higher in the dark environment could be the stress induced by the sudden change in environment and the manipulation the crayfish had to go through. Another study on the relationship between growth and energy consumption of another kind of crustacean species, the Cod (Gadus Morhua L.) finds that the metabolic rate is dependent on the rate of growth food intake. The discussion of this experiment also mentions that the energy requirement for activity was low as the organism would stay hidden during the daytime and be more active at night (R. R. C. Edwards, 1972). This is interesting and could be an explanation to our unexpected results. Then again, our results are not significent as the p value is not less than 0.05.
