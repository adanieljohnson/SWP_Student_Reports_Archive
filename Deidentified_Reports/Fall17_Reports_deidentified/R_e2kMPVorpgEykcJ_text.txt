Title: The Effect of Salinity on Procambris sp.

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to discover the effect of salinity on the specific metabolic rate in Procambris sp. When the salinity of water is increased this causes an organism to work harder in maintaining their concentration gradient. If the salinity concentration of the water that the crawfish are placed in is increased, then the specific metabolic rate of the crawfish should increase too. To measure this, the crawfish were placed in a jar which had an attached oxygen probe to record the dissolved oxygen concentration. There was seen to be few trends in the effects of the salinity on the metabolic rate. The rate was lower after an increase in salinity in two of the crawfish but rose in the other. Once a paired t_test was run, a p_value of 0.754 indicated the lack of statistical difference as it was higher than the significance level (a = 0.05). Therefore, it can not be concluded that an increase in salinity increase the specific metabolic rate in Procambris sp.



Introduction:
Metabolism is the process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells or an organism. Regardless of the type of organism, autotroph or heterotroph, both use a similar mechanism to convert high energy molecules into low energy ones and capture the energy released during conversion of ATP.
	The metabolic process is a way to measure energy transfer directly. An efficient way to measure this is through the consumption of oxygen and carbon dioxide production. Many things can affect the metabolic process, including temperature and the environment of the organism. 
	In this experiment, the effect of salinity on the metabolic rate of Procambris sp., crawfish will be analyzed. Since crawfish are ectotherms, an animal dependent on external body heat, this makes them a good species to test because it is easy to alter their body temperature and metabolism. In an experiment done by Swanson, the effect of salinity on the metabolic rate of Chanos chanos, euryhaline milkfish, was observed. It was found that as the salinity of the water increased the oxygen consumption rates increased as well (Swanson 1998). Since the oxygen consumption rate is directly proportional to the amount of energy released, it can be inferred that the metabolic rates increased in higher salinities. 
	In this experiment, the specific metabolic rate will be observed before and after an increase in salinity of the water. The increase in salinity should cause the metabolic should cause the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. to increase due to the increased ions in the water. The increased ions will cause the crawfish to work harder to balance their ions, which in turn will cause a rise in the metabolic rate. Therefore, if the salinity of the water increases the specific metabolic rate of the crawfish should increase as well. 




Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, fill a mason jar with fresh water and set it in a dishpan filled with water of a similar temperature; this will controlll the temperature of the water throughout the experiment. Once the crawfish is weighed, place it in the mason jar and screw the oxygen probe on top of the jar. When the probe is inserted into the jar some water should overflow out of the jar if this does not happen put more water in the jar. Once the instrument is stabilized, check the initial oxygen consumption, then record the oxygen consumption every five minutes for 20 minutes. Repeat this entire process, but instead of using freshwater use water with a 6.5% salinity concentration. To test the significance of the findings run a paired t_test. 


Results:
A paired t_test was run since the crawfish are both the controlll and the treatment group. It was one-tailed since the alternate hypothesis stated a specific increase in metabolic rate instead of a change, either positive or negative. When analyzing the data there are not many general trends. It can be observed that there was a decrease in specific metabolic rate after an increase in salinity in the first two crawfish. However, in the third crawfish, the metabolic rate increased after an increase in salinity. The mean of the metabolic rate of Procambris sp. before and after an increase in salinity is not statistically different (t_stat = 0.359, d.f. = 2, p = 0.754). 


Discussion:
After analyzing the data, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected since there was not a significent difference in the metabolic rate of the crawfish in water with different salinities. When analyzing the paired t_test, the p_value (0.754), is considerably higher than the accepted alpha value (a = 0.05). The alpha value is an accepted significance level that indicates there was a 5% chance that the results occurred due to random chance. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that salinity has an increasing effect on specific metabolic rate because there is a greater than 5% risk that these results were due to random error or luck. Although the p_value is high, it could potentially be lowered by using a larger sample size of Procambris sp. These findings contradict the previously mentioned experiment by Swanson. This biologically opposes her findings that salinity increases the oxygen consumption rates in organisms like Chanos chanos. It is possible that the low concentration of salinity could actually be more tolerable to the crawfish since there are more ions present in the water. This would make it easier for the crawfish since it does not have to compensate for the lower level of ions in the freshwater. It is important to note that in crawfish number three contradicts this idea since the metabolic rate rose. If this experiment was conducted similarly with a larger sample of Procambris sp., crawfish number 3 could possibly be found as an outlier. To expand this experiment, the effects of salinity could be tested on a different species and have more varying levels of salinity concentration. This is useful as it could help determine the effects of the increasing salinity, due to climate change, on different organisms.
