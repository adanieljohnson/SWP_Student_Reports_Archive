Title: Effect of light exposure on specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. crayfish.

Abstract:
This experiment examines the relationship between light exposure and the metabolic rates, measured in terms of oxygen consumption, of Procambris sp. crayfish.  We predicted that metabolic rate would decrease in response to dark conditions versus the baseline rate established under light conditions.  The respiration rates of three Procambris sp. crayfish were monitored under both light and dark conditions by monitoring the amount of oxygen in their water.  This data was used in a formula to calculate specific metabolic rate for each crayfish under both conditions.  Although one of the three crayfish exhibited a lower metabolic rate under dark conditions, metabolic rate increased under dark conditions for the other two, so there was no significent decrease in the metabolic rate of the crayfish between the light and dark conditions. 

Introduction:
Metabolic rate is the amount of energy an organism uses for its physiological processes at a given time.  Because oxygen powers metabolism, oxygen consumption may be used as a metric for calculating metabolic rate [Johnson: 2017].  The model organism we use in this study is a Procambris sp. crayfish.  These crayfish are ectotherms, and usually inhabit burrows they make in either subterranean or temporary bodies of water [Hobbs: 1884].  Other studies have found that respiration rate in ants (also ectotherms) increases with increasing temperatures [Kadochová et al.: 2017]. Because the water temperature inside the testing chamber would be cooler in the absence of light, and because Procambris sp. crayfish are accustomed to dim environments in their natural habitat, we hypothesized that the metabolic rates, measured in terms of oxygen consumption, of the crayfish under dark conditions would be lower than the metabolic rates of crayfish under light conditions.  

Materials and Method:
3 Procambris sp. crayfish were obtained.  Each was weighed and placed into a jar that served as a test chamber.  The jar was filled with water and placed into a pan.  A dissolved-oxygen meter was inserted into the jar and a baseline oxygen reading was taken.  Oxygen levels were recorded at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes.  Once all the oxygen readings had been taken, the volume of water inside the jar was measured. This process was repeated for the same crayfish, this time with a sheet of aluminum foil wrapped around the jar to achieve the dark condition.  The entire process was then repeated with the other two crayfish.
The data were treated with a one-tailed paired t_test comparing the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish under normal conditions versus dark conditions.  


Results:
In 2 of the 3 crayfish tested, specific metabolic rate under dark conditions was higher than under light conditions (Figure 3).  Crayfish 3 was more active than the other two crayfish under light conditions, which is reflected in its oxygen consumption (Figure 1).  All three crayfish consumed oxygen at a comparable rate under dark conditions (Figure 2).  (t_stat = 1.28, d.f. = 2,   P = 0.33).  

Discussion:
There was not a statistically significent difference in specific metabolic rate of the crayfish under light conditions versus under dark conditions, so our experiment outcomes did not support our hypothesis.  In fact, the data reflected a general increase in metabolic rate under the dark conditions, rather than a decrease.  A possible explanation for this increase is that the crayfish became agitated (and so began to respire more rapidly) under the dark conditions because the condition was unfamiliar and sudden.  This explanation is not verifiable, because the crayfish could not be seen underneath the aluminum foil cover.  However, the experiment could be repeated, this time allowing the crayfish time to acclimate to the dark condition before taking measurements, to try to determine whether agitation in a new environment was indeed the cause of the higher respiration rates we observed.  Furthermore, the crayfish we tested were accustomed to living in the lab under mostly light conditions.  If we had tested wild crayfish, our results may have been different.  It was noted that crayfish 3 was highly active under the light conditions, perhaps causing its metabolic rate to be higher in the light than in the dark.  In future experiments, the individual differences in activity level between the crayfish being tested could be minimized by increasing the number of crayfish in the study.  Studying the effect of light exposure on metabolic rate is relevant because circadian rhythms, which are governed in part by light, play a role in metabolism [Eckel-Mahan and Sassone-Corsi: 2013]. Understanding how light exposure influences circadian rhythm, and in turn, metabolism, in other animals (such as humans) could lead to a greater understanding of how the amount of light in the environment impacts health.
