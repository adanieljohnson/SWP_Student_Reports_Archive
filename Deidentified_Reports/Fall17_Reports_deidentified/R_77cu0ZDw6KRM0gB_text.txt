Title: Investigating the Influence of Extra Calcium on the Twitch Threshold of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog 

Abstract:
This experiment sought to determine the impact that the addition of A23187, a calcium ion channel activator, would have on the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog, through both direct stimulation of the muscle and through the sciatic nerve. Because of the fact that the release of calcium ions controls both the release of acetylcholine from the pre-synaptic membrane of neuromuscular junctions and the contraction of the muscle itself through changing the conformation of troponin, it was hypothesized that an increase in the amount of sarcoplasmic calcium ions would lower the threshold of stimulus required to cause the muscle to twitch. This was investigated through isolating the muscle and the nerve and attaching them to a myogram to control the magnitude of stimulation and see whenever a force was recorded. The thresholds of all three legs were recorded before and after the addition of A23187. The results showed no statistically significant difference between the control groups and the experimental groups, and thus the hypothesis was proven wrong and the null hypothesis was confirmed.


Introduction:
This experiment involved the exploration of the function of calcium ions in the process of muscle contraction. In muscle contraction, a twitch is considered the smallest possible unit, and is generated by a single action potential firing from a motor neuron, which causes all the muscle fibers with which it synapses, known as a motor unit, to contract, generating a twitch. Calcium plays several essential roles in the processes that lie between the generation of an action potential and muscle contraction, the first of which being the role it plays in neurotransmitter release. When an action potential reaches the axon terminal of a motor neuron at a neuromuscular junction, the depolarization carried by the action potential opens voltage gated calcium channels on the axon terminal, causing calcium to flood inward, initializing the sequence of events which leads to vesicles containing acetylcholine fusing with the pre-synaptic membrane and releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. When acetylcholine reaches the motor end plate, the modified muscle fiber membrane which serves as the post-synaptic membrane, it causes the opening of sodium ion channels in the end plate, which will cause the firing of an action potential that will spread through the muscle fibers if depolarized to threshold. Once the action potential is fired, it travels through the system of T-tubules within the muscle fiber, where the change in voltage causes the DHP receptor on the T-tubule to change conformation. This change in conformation causes the ryanodine receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions, which bind to troponin in sarcomeres, causing a change in the conformation of tropomyosin that reveals the regions on the actin filament to which the myosin heads bind, beginning the cycle of contraction. Knowing the central role that calcium plays in the initiation of muscle contraction begs the question as to whether simply adding a chemical which opens calcium ion channels directly to the muscle could cause a muscle to twitch without all the interim steps, or if it would at least lessen the magnitude of the stimuli required to cause a twitch. In order to answer this question, the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle of a frog were isolated and exposed to increasingly powerful levels of stimulation in order to observe what lowest possible magnitude was required to produce the twitch, first with, and then without the addition of the chemical which opens calcium channels to the muscle. The level of stimulation and the occurrence of twitches was tracked by recording a myogram. The experiment was structured so that the magnitude of the stimulus applied to the muscle constituted the independent variable, while the threshold of the muscle was the dependent. We hypothesized that the addition of the chemical would result in a lowered threshold required to cause a twitch, through encouraging the release of acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction and increasing levels of calcium available for binding to troponin in the sarcoplasm.  


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were prepared by skinning them and isolating the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve, just as was done in the previous week in lab. Each individual frog leg was then hooked up to the myogram, where baseline thresholds were collected for causing a twitch through gradually increasing the strength of a direct electrical stimulus applied to both the muscle and nerve, starting .1 amps, and increasing by .1 every trial until data from .1 amps over the threshold was collected. After the baseline was collected, the frog leg was injected with 100 mM solution of a calcium ion channel activator known as A23187. Afterwards, the thresholds of the muscle and nerve under the influence of the activator were collected using the same methods as were used to collect the baseline thresholds. After the data was collected, T-tests were used in order to compare between the thresholds of the same frog muscle with and without the calcium channel activator in order to verify whether any statistically significant difference between them existed. 


Results:
Figure 1. As can be observed in frog 1, the addition of the calcium ion channel activator did not have any impact on the threshold of contraction for stimulation of either the nerve or the muscle, however an interesting trend emerges in which the force outputs for the twitches of the experimental group for both muscle and nerve stimulation are noticeably lower than the control group. 
Figure 2. In frog 2, the thresholds for the stimulation of the nerve remained the same for both the control and experimental groups, but the threshold for the twitch caused by muscle stimulation actually increased by .1 amps in the experimental group. 
Figure 3. In frog 3, the thresholds remained the same once again between the experimental and control groups for the direct stimulation of the nerve, but just as in frog 2, an increase, in this case a dramatic increase, is observed between the threshold for the control group and experimental group in response to the direct stimulation of the muscle. 
Statistical Tests- 
The average threshold for the controlled and experimental trials for all three frogs was determined separately for both muscle and nerve stimulation. The average threshold for nerve stimulation among the control trials was .167 amps, the same as the average threshold for the experimental group, .167 amps. The threshold was also always identical throughout trials. It was therefore not necessary to perform a T-test on the thresholds for nerve stimulation, as identical numbers clearly indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in the thresholds between the experimental and control groups. For muscle stimulation, the average threshold for the control group was .267 amps, and .4 amps for the experimental group. When a paired T-test was performed on the data, it yielded a p value of .2697, which implies a lack of statistically significant difference between the groups. 


Discussion:
The results of the experiment did not support our hypothesis. Not only did the threshold for twitching not decrease in any of the experimental trials, it actually increased in several of them. However, these increases were determined by the paired T-test to not be statistically significant, so there was essentially no actual impact on the threshold of muscle contraction by the addition of A23187. The hypothesis was formed with the assumption that an increase in membrane permeability to calcium ions would accelerate both the generation of action potentials in the muscle, as more calcium would be able to enter the pre-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction to release acetylcholine, as well as the process of muscle contraction, as there would be more sarcoplasmic calcium available to bind to troponin. While our hypothesis was rejected, other similar experiments have reached the same conclusions that our experiment did. An experiment conducted in 1975 at the University of Brussels concluded that A23187 had no significant impact on the threshold for the contraction of barnacle muscles [Physiol : 75]. The book Structural Elements of the Nervous System provides a plausible explanation for these results, as it explains that experiments have shown that high levels of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ induced by the addition of A23187 have been shown to have a degrading effect on muscle proteins [Lajtha : 84]. Therefore, despite the increase in calcium intuitively having an impact which would benefit muscle contraction, it may have been simply damaging the contractile proteins, rather than facilitating them. This also provides a possible explanation for why the control groups almost always exerted more force on their twitches, which, although the magnitude of the forces was not directly applicable to the goals of our experiment, is a clear pattern that emerged as data was collected. This impact of A23187 is a possible area of future study, as experiments conducted over a longer period of time could test whether or not the addition of A23187 shows clear signs of muscle degradation through dramatically decreasing the force output by contractions over time.
