Title: Nicotine Injection in Sciatic Nerve of Rana pipiens Causing Long Contractions 

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to compare gastrocnemius contractions in the Rana pipiens with contractions after nicotine was directly injected into the muscle. We hypothesized that the gastrocnemius would experience further contraction after the nicotine injection. It is important to understand how the skeletal neuromuscular junction works. The sciatic nerve sends signals to the muscle, causing it to contract. Nicotine is an agonist so it has a similar effect to acetylcholine in aiding the contraction. The gastrocnemius muscle was isolated and pin electrodes were stuck directly into the muscle to measure amplitudes of contractions. The results showed that the amplitudes were higher for the experimental muscles, which had the nicotine injection, than the amplitudes of the control muscles. Our hypothesis was supported because the t-tests showed we have strong evidence against the null so we reject the null hypothesis. 

Introduction:
In this study, Rana pipiens was the organism that was studied in order to understand how the skeletal neuromuscular junction operates. Rana pipiens is an ideal organism to use because it has skin that is soft so it slides off easily and it is easy to find and isolate the sciatic nerve. In addition, the gastrocnemius muscle was able to be cut away from the rest of the leg quite easily. The sciatic nerve was focused on for the purpose of this lab. Nerves give off electrical signals which communicate messages to parts of the body. The sciatic nerve is connected to the gastrocnemius muscle, which is a muscle in the frog leg. Therefore, this nerve gives electrical signals to the muscle, controlling its movements. With this information, the biological null hypothesis that needs to be tested is: Nicotine will have no effect on muscle contraction. The biological alternate hypothesis is: Nicotine will force the muscle to contract for a longer amount of time. The statistical alternate hypothesis is Nicotine will have a statistical effect on muscle contractions. Nicotine is similar to acetylcholine and it is also an agonist. Acetylcholine is important to understand because when it binds to the presynaptic membrane, it allows for sodium channels to open which in turn triggers an action potential. Next, calcium is released and this causes the contraction in muscle fibers. Nicotine also activates these receptors so it is predicted that injecting it into the gastrocnemius will cause it to shorten. In the article “Nicotine in High Concentration Causes Contraction of Isolated Strips of Rabbit Corpus Cavernosum,” scientists wanted to figure out if nicotine causes relaxation or contraction of the corpus cavernosum. It was found that, high nicotine concentrations led to, “the contraction of  isolated rabbit corpus cavernosal strips” [Nguyen et al: 2015]. The control for the experiment were the three frog legs before nicotine was injected gastrocnemius muscle and the experimental were the same three frog legs after nicotine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. This way, the frog legs could be compared before and after individually because there can be a large amount of variance when different legs from different frogs are compared.  The dependent variable is the length of the contraction and the independent variable is the amount of nicotine used. The control, which is the frog leg, is not a measurable variable, the length of contraction is discrete, and the amount of nicotine is also a discrete variable. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, iWorx was the computer program was used to measure contractions. First, three frog legs should be placed on a tray. Next, the skin must be pulled off of the legs, revealing the muscles. Then, the sciatic nerve should be retrieved and pulled away from the other muscle tissue surrounding it. Parts of the leg must be pinned down to the tray (as shown in the image to the right) so that their movements are not recorded as contractions on iWorx. The gastrocnemius should be isolated, tied, and lifted at a ninety degree angle. We used pin electrodes to determine amplitudes. Place the pins in the gastrocnemius muscle, careful not to let them touch each other or other metal.
Follow exercise three in the lab manual to get control. The pulse amplitude should be set to 0 volts, set the pulses to 1 Hz, and pulse width to 5 ms. Next, increase the volts to .1 in order to find the individual threshold for each muscle. The size of the muscles in the frog leg varied drastically, and therefore our average amplitudes for the frog legs varied so we had to perform three separate t-tests. We set the iWorx for the control so amplitude was .5 (use optimal threshold for specific muscle) pulses to 5,  width to 5, frequency to 1. Next, we let the frog leg go for 5 pulses. Then, we injected the nicotine, turned iWorx off for for ten seconds, then turned it back on and let it run for five pulses again. The syringe contained 1 mg/ml nicotine for each injection. Be careful to hold the muscle while injecting as shown in the image to the right, for maximal control and safety. Finally, measure the amplitude of the control to that of the treatment. The final amplitude should be the control amplitudes with the experimental amplitudes added on afterwards. 


Results:
A paired t-test was used, comparing the control gastrocnemius and the treatment gastrocnemius. After the t-tests, we got p-values that show we have strong evidence against the null so we reject the null hypothesis. The p-values were all very small which means they were all ≤ 0.05. This supports the hypothesis that long contractions are caused by nicotine. 

Discussion:
For this experiment, it was possible to see the frog’s muscle physically contract and the results show a contraction occurring on the mYogram as well. In addition, the data from iWorx supports our hypothesis that nicotine causes long contractions in the muscle. As shown in the graph under the results section, the three muscle contractions that occurred after the nicotine injection had a much higher amplitude than the contractions of the control muscle. This is because the contraction was made possible by the activation of nicotinic receptors. Sodium channels were opened and this caused an action potential which signaled to the gastrocnemius muscle to contract. As seen in the article, “Nicotine in High Concentrations Causes Contraction of Isolated Strips of Rabbit Corpus Cavernosum,” the muscles contracted. However, the article also states that, “Nicotine has been reported to cause relaxation of the corpus cavernosum” [Nguyen et al: 2015]. It is noted that large amounts of nicotine are what cause the contraction. It would be interesting to further study the sciatic nerve in Rana pipiens by injecting less nicotine and recording the results. Instead of injecting 1 mg/ml nicotine, we would inject 0.5 mg/ml nicotine. The impacts of nicotine are often studied due to the widespread use of tobacco products. For example, the relationship between erectile dysfunction and nicotine is often studied. There is strong evidence that smoking impairs, “penile erections by impairing endothelium dependent smooth muscle relaxation” [Nguyen et al: 2015]. There is also a strong correlation between erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular risks and diseases.
