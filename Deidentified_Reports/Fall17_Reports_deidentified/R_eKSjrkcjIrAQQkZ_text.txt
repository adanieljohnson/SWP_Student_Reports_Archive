Title: Aggression of Betta splendins decreases with shelter present in tank

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to test how the presence of a shelter would affect betta splenden aggressiveness. The shelter was meant to simulate having a “nest’ or a “home.” My hypothesis was that having a form of shelter in the tank with the two male betta fish will reduce the aggressive behaviors of the fish, and this hypothesis was supported by the results of the experiment. We observed and recorded the number of seconds that the betta fish participated in aggressive behaviors and quantified the behaviors. We found that there was decreased behavior when the shelter was present but we were not sure whether that was due to the presence of the shelter or another circumstance like habituation and tiredness towards the end of the trials. 

Introduction:
Betta Splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are native to Thailand. These fish are commonly kept in homes due to their bright colors, but are usually kept solo in tanks due to their propensity towards more aggressive behaviors. Intraspecific competition, or competition within a species, is a common occurrence for betta splendins. The two general categories of aggression for bettas are broadside and facing movements and bettas display a variety of combinations of behaviors when in an aggressive encounter. Different behaviors have different levels of aggression and males tend to be more aggressive than females, overall. Observing these aggressive behaviors allows us to gather information about the costs and benefits of aggression and learn more about the energy allocation process for bettas. Having a form of shelter in the tank with the two male betta fish will reduce the aggressive behaviors of the fish. 

Materials and Method:
In order to quantify the bettas’ aggressive behaviors, we ranked their behaviors with different multipliers, either a one or a two, depending on the level of aggressiveness of the behavior. The less aggressive behaviors were behaviors that were quantified by a one multiplier were pelvic fin flickering and erect pectoral fins. The more aggressive behaviors were quantified with a multiple of two and were tail flashing and presence of the red mane. For the trials, we observed the recorded the number of seconds in each behavior for one of the betta splendins in our tank without the shelter three times at five minute intervals with five minutes of rest in between each trial. And repeated the same process but with the shelter in the tank for another three trials. At the end of the trials, the behaviors that were identified as more aggressive were multiplied by two in order to exhibit increased aggression in our data. We used a paired t_test to measure the statistical significance of our data.

Results:
Our results showed that the betta splenden did have decreased aggression when there was shelter present. The data from our controlll group, where there was not shelter in the tank, was 450 seconds of more aggressive behavior and 241.3333 seconds of less aggressive behavior [Figure 1]. The data from our experimental group, where there was shelter present in the tank, was 218 seconds of less aggressive behavior and 269 seconds of more aggressive behavior [Figure 2]. There was 1 degree of freedom, a t-value of 1.295983, and a p_value of 0.418381. Because the p_value was greater than 0.05, my results were not statistically significent.

Discussion:
In our experiment, the aggressiveness of the betta fish that we observed did decrease when the shelter was present in the tank, therefore, my hypothesis was supported by the experiment’s results. Although my hypothesis was supported, I do not necessarily think that this decrease in aggressive behavior was due to the presence of the shelter. Because the betta did a total of six trials, I think that the decrease in aggressiveness during the last three trials was due to tiredness and some degree of habituation. The first three trials quantified the controlll group and the last three trials quantified the experimental group, making me believe this to be true. In a similar study, which aimed the show the effect of betta habituation, aggressive behaviors became almost non-existent after 4 days with mirror exposure [Clayton et. al]. This helps support the idea that the betta that we studied could have experienced some degree of habituation after so many repeated trials with the same fish. Another related study found that the metabolic costs of aggressive behavior in betta splendins was increased in the “winner” of the fight [Castro et.al]. This tells us that there our betta could have decreased its aggressive behavior because our betta had used up a lot of energy in the first three trials. Because there was no female present in our experiment, I believe that the aggressive behavior was due to territorial boundaries. This is supported by a study that found that the presence of another male resulted in aggressive behaviors and more building of the nest [Bronstein]. If we were to conduct our experiment again, using multiple fish instead of one fish would have allowed for more reliable results, as the tiredness and habituation of the betta could have factored into the results.
