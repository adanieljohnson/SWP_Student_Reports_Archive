Title: Light Intensity and Its Effects on Photosynthesis 

Abstract:
The objective was to determine the effects of light intensity on photosynthesis. The chloroplasts of spinach leaves were isolated and used for a hill reaction. During the experiment five different hill reactions were run, each at different level of light intensity. There were two control reactions, one reaction was performed under the normal light conditions of the lab and the other was performed in total darkness. The three experimental groups were run under the light intensities of 1630 lumens, 890 lumens, and 600 lumens. The hill reaction uses DCPIP in place of NADPH as a source of electrons. The photosynthetic rate was measured by measuring the color change in the DCPIP. At 1630 lumens the greatest color change was observed. At the conclusion of the experiment it was determined that a higher light intensity led to a greater photosynthetic rate.   


Introduction:
Plants are photoautotrophs, meaning they are capable of harnessing energy from light and using that energy to produce their own food. This process is known as photosynthesis. There are two main aspects to photosynthesis, the light reactions and the dark reactions. In this particular case, only the light reactions were manipulated. During the light reactions, the energy from light excites the electrons in the chlorophyll from photosystem II to photosystem I through an electron transport chain via reduced NADPH. The light reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts.
Light intensity and its effects on photosynthesis have been studied on multiple occasions in different organisms ranging from phytoplankton to forest plants. In previous experiments, it was determined that the amount of light that a photosynthetic organism is exposed to affects the rate of photosynthesis within that organism. One experiment in particular used phytoplankton and manipulated the number of photons that the phytoplankton received. As a result, they were able to create a standard curve demonstrating the relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis. Ultimately discovering that between extreme darkness and extreme light there is an optimum amount of light at which photosynthesis best occurs (Eilers & Peters 2003). In another study which observed forest trees. It was determined that different types of plant reach their optimum light intensity at different points. This optimum intensity is what causes certain plants to grow at various locations in forests as some forest plants reached there optimum at full sun and others reached their optimum in a shaded environment (Kramer & Decker 1944).
Light intensity is manipulated in order to observe its effects on photosynthesis. Lumens are used to measure light intensity and they are a particular measure of light intensity that refers to the amount of light emitted per second. The rate of photosynthesis is observed by using the hill reaction. The organism being studied is spinach. Spinach is an excellent choice due to the abundant number of chloroplasts found in each cell as well as its availability. Spinach, like the forest plants, should have a specific light intensity at which photosynthesis occurs at its highest rate. If the light intensity on the chloroplasts is manipulated, then chloroplasts will have an optimum at which the rate of photosynthesis is the highest, this optimum not being found in extreme light or in the absence of light. 


Materials and Methods:
Spinach was purchased from a local grocery store. This spinach was then refrigerated until the experiment was performed. Once the experiment began, four spinach leaves were chosen at random and they were deveined. The leaves were then crushed with a mortar and pestle and grinding buffer was added. The grinding buffer was 20 mL of 400mM sucrose in tricine buffer at a pH of 8.0. Once the leaves were a homogenous mixture, they were strained through a cheesecloth. The strained mixture was then placed in a falcon tube and was sealed before it was placed in a centrifuge. The mixture was centrifuged twice in order to isolate the chloroplasts. The first centrifugation lasted 3 minutes and was spun at 200˛ G at 4°C and the second centrifugation lasted 10 minutes at 1000  G at 4°C.
	Following the chloroplast extraction, was the preparation of the Hill reaction. 16 test tubes and cuvettes were labeled 1-15 and blank; blank, 3 for normal conditions, 3 for darkness, 3 for 1630 lumens, 3 for 890 lumens, and 3 for 600 lumens. The blank test tube received 8mL of water and 2mL of reaction buffer. The reaction buffer was 100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5. The fifteen other tubes received 6mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL of the reaction buffer. Then using a micro pipette, 100 µL of spinach chloroplast were added to each of the test tubes. DCPIP is a blue liquid with a max absorbance at 600nm and turns clear once it has been completely oxidized, thus it was used to track the rate of photosynthesis as it was used in place of NADP+. Once the chloroplasts had been added to each tube, the tubes were inverted and the reactions were transferred to cuvettes so absorbance readings could be taken. The absorbance readings were taken in spectrophotometer at 600nm. Once absorbance measures were taken, the tubes were each placed in their appropriate conditions for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes, final absorbance values were taken and percent changes were calculated. Finally, three two tailed unpaired t-test were run on the data comparing the manipulated intensities to the normal light conditions. 


Results:
Figure I is a bar graph depicting the average percent change in each of the reactions over the ten minutes in which the experiment took place. It also shows the standard error that was calculated for each experiment. The bars represent ± 1 standard deviation from the mean 

When compared to the natural light, the reaction run at 1630 lumens the results were statistically significant, t(4)= 3.99, p= 0.016. The reaction run at 890 lumens the results were marginally insignificant, t(4)= 2.65 , p= 0.057. The results of the reaction run at 600 lumens were statistically significant, t(4)= 6.96, p= 0.0022.


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that the chloroplasts of spinach would have an optimum light intensity at which photosynthesis occurs at its greatest rate. It was believed that this optimum light intensity would not be found in an extreme light intensity nor in complete darkness. This relationship has been studied by many different researchers and there are mathematical models explaining this relationship. In an experiment with phytoplankton, the ability to generate a standard curve displaying the relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis was confirmed (Eilers & Peeters 2003) However, it was concluded that photosynthesis occurred at its highest rate 1630 lumens which was the extreme light intensity. As a result, the biological hypothesis must be rejected. Furthermore, not all of the data that was collected proved to be statistically significant. 
There are multiple explanations as to why these errors occurred. First, the 1630 lumens light bulb was not an intensity high enough to photobleach the chloroplasts. If the chloroplasts were exposed to a photobleaching intensity, it is more likely that rate of photosynthesis would have decreased. Also, the cuvettes were not all positioned the same distance away from the light. In a previous experiment, the researchers made sure the organisms were specific distances away from the light as distance can affect the number of photons that each chloroplast receives (Kramer & Decker 1944). The final explanation for these errors stems from the number of chloroplasts in each reaction. As it was not checked to make sure that each reaction contained the same amount. If one test tube had more chloroplasts than another then the hill reaction would precede differently, this could explain the high standard deviation in some of the reactions. 
	In an experiment performed on phytoplankton, the light intensity that the organisms were exposed to was varied throughout the day. The variation in light intensity over the course of the day allowed the researches to observe how the light intensity in the morning affected the rate of photosynthesis in the afternoon. The organism reached its peak photosynthetic rate in the morning but then the rate continually dropped in the afternoon until it reached is minimum and began to rise again. The researchers were able to conclude that slight structural changes were made to the chloroplast during the period of high light intensity which then hindered the photosynthetic rate later on in the day (Marra 1978). In this experiment, the photosynthetic rate was only observed over the course of 10 minutes and the light intensity never varied. In a future study, the intensity could be varied at different intervals in time to see if the rate of photosynthesis is slower when the chloroplasts begin in a high light intensity compared to when they begin in a lower light intensity. 
	While working with different forest plants, Kramer and Decker were able to explain the need for an optimal light intensity for photosynthesis within plants. The explanation is fairly simple as certain plants live in conditions that have them exposed to a lot of sunlight and others in conditions that have them exposed to minimal sunlight. In their work, they discovered that the forest plants that received more light in natural conditions were able to handle higher light intensities in a laboratory setting than the plants that were found in the shade (Kramer & Decker 1944). In the case of spinach, spinach plants are grown during the summer months and are placed in direct sunlight. If they were not able to handle the high light intensity in the lab then it would be extremely difficult for them to be grown in direct sunlight given that the sun emits 10,000 lumens per square foot.
