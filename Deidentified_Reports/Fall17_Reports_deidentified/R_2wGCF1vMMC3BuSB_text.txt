Title: The Effect of Salinity on Photosynthetic Rate

Abstract:
Condensed chlorophyll from spinach leaves was used in this lab to determine how salinity affects the rate of photosynthesis. It was hypothesized that the rate of photosynthesis would be slowed in the presence of high salinity. The independent variable measured was salinity, with the dependent variable of absorbance. Three solutions were tested: one with only the condensed chlorophyll, one with 0.25M NaCl, and a third with 0.5M NaCl. The solutions were allowed to sit and react for three increments of 10 minutes, after each of which the absorbance was measured in a spectrometer. The data was compiled after each measurement, and a total percentage of change of absorbance was calculated for each solution. The control solution showed a change percentage of 20.23%, the 0.25M NaCl solution had a change of 27.32, and the 0.5M NaCl solution had a change of 28.58%. These values were run through an ANONA t-test to determine if the results were statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.922. This result indicated that the results were of no significance. 

Introduction:
This lab was used to determine the effect of various levels of salinity on the rate of photosynthetic reduction of prepared enriched chloroplast solution from spinach leaves. The Hill reaction will be used to measure this effect, and is written as follows: 
2 H2O + 2A (+light)  2AH2 + O2
where A represents the electron acceptor, in this case DCPIP [1]. Plants use photosynthesis to capture energy from light and convert it into chemical energy that can be used to do work within the systems of the organism. Photons of light hit the chlorophyll pigments in photosystem 2, exciting their electrons. The electron excitation is passed from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until they reach the reaction center, where an electron on a special pair of chlorophyll pigments is excited. This electron is passed to a neighboring atom, NADH, and it enters the electron transport chain. It travels down the chain through the three complexes, its movement providing energy used to export protons out of the cell membrane. This generates a proton gradient, which is harnessed by ATP synthase to synthesize ATP. [2] The Hill reaction will measure the rate of this electron transfer, representative of the efficiency of the reaction. An experiment was done by Waldon and Terry similarly studied the effects of salinity on plant leaf growth, and how plants evolve to be salt resistant. In their experiment, it was determined that increasing levels of salinity impede and even halt plant growth. [3] Photosynthesis is a delicate process completely dependent on charge gradients and water cleavage. The presence of salt in this system would disrupt the ability of the chloroplast to maintain the desired proton gradient across its membrane, and would also lower the amount of water available. This effect was demonstrated in a study done by Pinheiro and Chaves in 2009. [4] It is hypothesized for the experiment to be conducted that the rate of photosynthesis will be less efficient (slower), or be comparatively similar with a sudden drop in rate, in the presence of high salinity. 


Materials and Methods:
Three centrifuge vials, and a mortar and pestle are placed on ice to cool. The veins from 4-5 large spinach leaves are removed and discarded, and the leaves are placed in the mortar to be ground into a paste with 10 mL grinding solution. Using a cheesecloth, the ground solution is strained into a large beaker to be centrifuged at 200x6: 1200 RPM for 3 minutes. The pellet of debris is removed from the bottom of the vial, and the solution is moved to a new container to be centrifuged again at 1000x6: 2800 RPM for 10 minutes. [1] The liquid from this solution is removed and placed on ice, and is used to complete the rest of the experiment. Three solutions are then prepared to test in the spectrometer: one with 100 microliters of condensed chloroplast solution and 0.5 M aqueous NaCl, a second with 100 microliters of condensed chloroplast solution and 0.25 M aqueous NaCl, and a third with only 100 microliters of condensed chloroplast solution. The solutions are allowed to sit for 10 minutes before a small amount from each is transferred to a cubette and measured in the spectrometer. This process is repeated twice, letting the solutions sit for another 10 minutes each time. The date from the measurements is recorded in a table, and an ANONA test is performed to determine statistical significance. 

Results:
 The p value for the data when tested with an ANONA test came out to be 0.922. The final percent change of absorbances for the control group was 11.39%, for the solution with 0.25M NaCl was 21.24%, and for the solution with 0.5M NaCl was 28.58%. 

Discussion:
When an ANONA test was performed on the data collected from the spectrometer, the results were found to be not statistically significant. The results seem to support the first proposition of the alternate hypothesis, that the highest concentration of NaCl in the solution would slow the rate of photosynthesis in the chlorophyll pigments the most. However, these values do not vary enough to report a conclusive result. To improve this experiment, a higher concentration of NaCl solution may be used, and possibly in a greater amount. A study of cotton plant growth when stressed with salinity was done to determine its capacity for survival in varied conditions. [5] The results of this lab were conclusive, and produced a broader spectrum of results. It may be beneficial in future experiments to also span a greater length of time when measuring absorbances, to acquire more data to be compared.
