Title: Effect of Increased Concentration of Carbon Dioxide on Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambris spp.

Abstract:
The amount of oxygen used over time is directly proportional to the energy created through respiration, so changes of oxygen concentration in a static environment would be representative of the metabolic rate of the organism. We hypothesized that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the aqueous environment would decrease the metabolic rate of Procambris spp. by decreasing the amount of available oxygen. This was tested on 3 crayfish in 2 different environments, a controlll solution saturated with air and another with a 10% seltzer solution. Oxygen concentration was taken over 20 minutes and the metabolic rate was calculated using the weight of the crayfish, the change in oxygen concentration, the volume of water in the testing chamber, and the amount of time. After removal of an outlier, the data did not produce significent results (t-value = 4.716, p_value =  0.1330, degrees of freedom = 1, experimental mean = 0.003073 mg O2/g*min ± 0.001386, controlll mean = 0.003618 mg O2/g*min ± 0.001223). While there were slight decreases in the metabolic rates, we propose that flaws in the design attributed to insignificent results. Moving forward we would like to retest this hypothesis with a higher concentration of carbon dioxide, and a reinforced seal on the testing chamber. 

Introduction:
Due to Earth’s growing problem with fossil fuels, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased, causing a subsequent increase in the dissolved carbon dioxide in the oceans. Specific effects of this environmental change on aquatic life forms are unknown, but eventually the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide will increase to a point where habitats within the ocean will no longer be habitable [Lantz: 2013].  All types of organisms must find a way to harness energy from the environment. For heterotrophs, energy is harvested by converting ingested glucose to adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, through cellular respiration. ATP can be formed through multiple metabolic pathways, but oxidative phosphorylation produces the highest energy payoff. However, oxygen must be present in order to complete this portion of respiration [Johnson: 2017]. The electrochemical gradient present during chemiosmosis could not continue to provide energy for the formation of ATP without oxygen combining with free protons to create water that is used in other portions of the body. The energy that is created through this process is essential to all bodily functions. Because the amount of consumed oxygen is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended, it can be used to objectively determine the specific metabolic rate of the organism [Johnson: 2017]. This process is the same in an aquatic environment, except organisms must find ways to gather oxygen from water. In the context of rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the ocean, what effect would increased concentration of carbon dioxide have on the specific metabolic rate of aquatic life? This specific effect will become increasingly important as concentrations continue to increase, allowing scientists to determine the concentration at which life is no longer sustainable in the Earth’s oceans based on specific metabolic rates. Procambris spp., commonly known as crayfish, were chosen as a model life form for this study based on their status as an ectotherm. This means that their external environment determines their metabolic rate. For this reason, the metabolic rate of the crayfish can be controlllled by controlllling factors in the external environment [Johnson: 2017]. Furthermore, it is much easier to measure dissolved oxygen concentration in an aquatic environment, making an aquatic life form more suitable for this study. Because carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than oxygen, we hypothesized that increasing the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide in the aquatic environment would decrease the specific metabolic rate of Procambris spp. due to the decreased amount of available oxygen.

Materials and Method:
A testing chamber was assembled using a glass jar and a dissolved oxygen probe, which was then placed in a room temperature water bath. For controlll conditions, the glass jar was filled with room temperature water that was saturated with air. Each crayfish was weighed and placed in the filled glass jar, screwing on the dissolved oxygen probe. A preliminary reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration was recorded, and subsequent readings were taken every 5 minutes, up to 20 minutes. After removing the crayfish, the volume of water was determined, and the process was repeated for the other two crayfish. For experimental conditions, water saturated with air was substituted with a room temperature 10% seltzer solution to increase dissolved carbon dioxide concentrations in the environment, and the same procedure was followed. The following equation used to calculate specific metabolic rate was: Specific Metabolic Rate = {[O2(mg/L)] x [Volume H2O (L)]}/{[Time (min)] x [Weight (g)]}  A paired two-sample T-test was used to determine significance, using a p_value of 0.05 as the threshold.

Results:
In general, crayfish that were submerged in a 10% seltzer solution displayed a lower specific metabolic rate than those that were submerged in water that was saturated with air. However, there was also an outlier that was struck from the data, crayfish 3. During the controlll trial, this crayfish produced a metabolic rate of zero, which would indicate death, even though that was not the case upon extraction. Furthermore, the specific metabolic rates of each crayfish varied widely, as indicated by large standard deviations in both the experimental and controlll groups (see Figure 1). Statistical analysis, including a paired two-sample T-test, produced the following results: t-value = 4.716, p_value = 0.1330, degrees of freedom = 1, experimental mean = 0.003073 mg O2/g*min ± 0.001386, controlll mean = 0.003618 mg O2/g*min ± 0.001223.

Discussion:
The amended data set did not produce significent results, so the data did not support our hypothesis. Crayfish in an aqueous environment with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide did not produce statistically different metabolic rates from crayfish in an environment saturated with oxygen. While there was a slight decrease in the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish, the difference was not large enough to constitute significance.  The consensus from the literature [Baez: 2009, Catarino: 2012] states that observed decreases in metabolic rate are a result of a decreased ability to gather oxygen from the environment due to decreased solubility of oxygen in water when the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased. A decreased concentration of oxygen in the aqueous environment would mean that less oxygen is able to diffuse into the bloodstream by way of the gills, or less oxygen is available for the organism to use in oxidative phosphorylation. In response, the organism is not able to produce as much energy as when oxygen concentrations are high, so they are unable to carry out the maximum amount of metabolic activity based on energy constraints [Baez: 2009]. In short, the organism must conserve energy for more vital processes.  The Baez experiment [2009] supports our original hypothesis, stating that metabolic rates of E. coli specimen decreased while subjected to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide. However, their study differed in key ways from ours, which could explain the discord in results. First, Baez et al used population growth in order to approximate metabolic rate and the effects on each individual’s metabolic rate. Furthermore, E. coli do not require oxygen to sustain life; they simply grow faster in oxygenated environments [Baez: 2009]. Crayfish do require oxygen to live. Lastly, Baez et al also used higher concentrations of carbon dioxide than our experiment, meaning that the concentration differences between experimental and test group conditions were more likely to produce results that were statistically significent.  Based on the general agreement amongst the literature, we believe that there was a design flaw in our experiment. After crayfish 3 produced a metabolic rate of 0.00 in the controlll group, we were concerned about the seal between the testing chamber and the outside environment. Theoretically, there are only two ways for the amount of oxygen to have stayed equal in the aqueous environment throughout the experiment. Either the crayfish was not breathing in order to decrease the amount of oxygen in the water, or oxygen was being added to the aqueous environment from outside of the testing chamber by way of a leaky seal. Since the crayfish was alive upon extraction, the latter is more likely to be the cause of a false metabolic rate. Furthermore, this calls the rest of our data into question, for inaccurate dissolved oxygen readings due to a faulty seal would produce false metabolic rates for each trial, not just one.  Moving forward, this study should be repeated after reinforcing the seal on the testing chamber and increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in solution. The latter amendment is proposed because, even with the outlier removed, the data were not statistically significent. As stated earlier, there was a slight decrease in the metabolic rate of crayfish 1 and 2, so it would be of interest to see if the metabolic rate would decrease further with subsequent increases in concentration of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, increasing the amount of testing replicates would decrease the effect of an outlier, like crayfish 3. Other variations on this experiment will become increasingly applicable to studies in climate science as the ocean continues to acidify. Dissolved carbon dioxide lowers the pH of aqueous environments, causing further habitat disruption of the oceans, and threatening the lives of many oceanic organisms. In order to come up with complex solutions, we need to understand the underlying question: how does rising carbon dioxide concentrations in oceans affect the metabolic rate of the organisms that live in them?
