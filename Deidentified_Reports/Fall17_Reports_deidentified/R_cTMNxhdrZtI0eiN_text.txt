Title: The effect of temperature on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris spp.

Abstract:
In this lab we tested the effect of cold water on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris crayfish. There are higher levels of dissolved oxygen in colder water, so we hypothesized that the specific metabolic rate would decrease in the colder water. We measured the oxygen consumption of three different crayfish in room temperature water and water cooled to about 10˚C. Metabolic rate decreased in the colder water for two crayfish, which was in line with out hypothesis. However, our data was not statistically significent as seen by the paired t_test, which gave a p_value of 0.857. The decrease in metabolic rate was likely a result of the higher levels of dissolved oxygen, which allowed the crayfish to not work as hard to get oxygen. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effect of temperature on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris crayfish. Specific metabolic rate is the energy expenditure per unit body mass per unit time. This organism was useful in our experiment because it is an ectotherm and we were therefore easily able to alter its body temperature and affect their metabolism by changing the temperature of the environment. It is also useful because of its size it is easy to measure and work with. As temperature increases the amount of dissolved oxygen in water decreases, and therefore metabolism is expected to increase. There is more dissolved oxygen in colder water because the water molecules are more tightly packed due to lower kinetic energy, which makes it harder for oxygen to escape from the water. Studies have shown that as the temperature of the environment increases, so does the specific metabolic rate of the organism in that environment [Clarke: 1999]. We will be varying the temperature of the water that the crayfish is in, and monitoring its oxygen usage to determine its specific metabolic rate. We hypothesized that when the temperature of the water decreases, the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish will also decrease. 

Materials and Method:
We were given three different crayfish, which we weighed and recorded their mass. We filled a glass testing chamber with room temperature water, about 22˚C, and placed it in a pan filled with room temperature water. We placed the crayfish in the testing chamber and then inserted a dissolved oxygen probe, making sure the chamber was completely full. We then turned on the probe on and allowed it to stabilize to get a baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen in the water. We measured the oxygen every five minutes for twenty minutes. The volume of water in the chamber was recorded by measuring it in a graduated cylinder. The chamber was then refilled with oxygenated room temperature water and placed in cold water, approximately 10˚C. The container was allowed to sit in the cold water for about five minutes to cool down. The crayfish was then put into the chamber, the oxygen probe was inserted, and readings were taken every five minutes for twenty minutes. The volume of water was once again recorded. The same procedure was repeated for the next two crayfish. A paired t_test was used in the analysis of the data. 

Results:
All of the crayfish had specific metabolic rates of slightly greater than .001 mgO2(g*min)-1 in the room temperature water. The specific metabolic rate in crayfish 1 and 3 both decreased when put in cold water. However, the specific metabolic rate for the 2nd crayfish increased when put into cold water. This is seen in figure 1. The paired T-test revealed that the P-value is 0.857, the t-value is 0.205 and there are 2 degrees of freedom. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish would decrease when the temperature of the water was decreased was not statistically supported by our experiment, as seen by our P-value of .857. Crayfish 1 and 3 both had lower specific metabolic rates after being in cold water, which is what we expected to happen. This is likely because there is a higher concentration of dissolved oxygen in the cold water, so they do not need to work as hard to extract as much oxygen from the water. When there is more dissolved oxygen present, they do not need as much water to pass through their gills to get the same amount of oxygen, so they don’t have to expend as much energy on respiration. Previous studies have shown that cooler bodies of water have a higher level of dissolved oxygen for aquatic organisms to take in, and that the organisms therefore prefer to be in the cooler water [Matthews: 1997]. However, the specific metabolic rate of crayfish 2 increased in the cold water. The reason for this could be that the crayfish was stressed when put into a colder environment and therefore consumed more oxygen. A possible future experiment could involve leaving the crayfish in cold water for a longer period of time before measuring their oxygen consumption, which would allow them to acclimate to the temperature and therefore not exhibit a stress response. Our experiment could not statistically prove the effect of temperature on the specific metabolic rate of a crayfish, but the trends in this experiment did show that we could possibly prove our hypothesis with some improvements to our experiment.

Figure Legends: 
Figure1- This shows the specific metabolic rate of each crayfish in warm water and cold water. Crayfish 1 and 3 showed a decrease in metabolic rate when placed into the cold water, whereas crayfish 2 showed an increase. The paired T-test revealed that the P-value is 0.857, the t-value is 0.205 and there are 2 degrees of freedom.
