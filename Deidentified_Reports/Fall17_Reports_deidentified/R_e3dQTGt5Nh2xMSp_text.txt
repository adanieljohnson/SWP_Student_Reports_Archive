Title: The effects of exercise on the specific metabolic rate in crayfish (Procambris sp.)

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of exercise on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish (Procambris sp.). The amount of oxygen consumed is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended. As the crayfish exercises, it will use more ATP energy and consume more oxygen, so its specific metabolic will increase. We predict that forcing the crayfish to exercise will cause its specific metabolic rate to increase. To test this, we forced crayfish to run for two minutes, before measuring their oxygen consumption over 20 minutes. Our results did not support our hypothesis, as the controlll experiment on average had a higher specific metabolic rate than the treatment experiment, but the difference was not statistically different (t_stat=2.662409, d.f.=2, P=0.116858). We therefore cannot say that forcing the crayfish to exercise will cause its specific metabolic rate to increase. Our experiment could have caused the crayfish to become stressed, and as a result it may have begun to breathe anaerobically, this causing its specific metabolic rate to decrease. Next time we could test the effects of fighting on specific metabolic rate, to test if increased stress causes their specific metabolic rate decrease even further than the crayfish in our experiment. 

Introduction:
Metabolic rate refers to the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiologic processes at any given time. We will be monitoring the specific metabolic rate in crayfish (Procambris sp.), in response to exercise. We are using crayfish because they are ectotherms, meaning that their specific metabolic rate is much more easily affected by external factors such as exercise. When an organism converts glucose to energy, the carbon and oxygen atoms that are present in the glucose molecules are converted into carbon dioxide gas. These reactions release high energy electrons that are captured by NAD+ and FAD molecules, these two molecules transfer the electrons to the electron transport system. This transport causes the electrons to give up energy, which converts ADP to high energy ATP. This system can generate considerable ATP, but will stop if the electrons at the end of the chain are not removed from the mitochondria. These electrons are removed by transferring them to molecular oxygen, which is transported to the cells by the respiratory organs. Adding electrons converts this oxygen into water [Johnson: 2017]. In this experiment with crayfish, the amount of oxygen used is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended. 

In this experiment we will be determining the relationship between exercise and the specific metabolic rate in crayfish (Procambris sp.). We measured the specific metabolic rate of a crayfish in room temperature 22ºC water, we then forced the crayfish to exercise for two minutes, before re measuring its specific metabolic rate. As the crayfish exercises, it will expend more ATP energy, this which will cause it to use more oxygen, and therefore its specific metabolic rate will increase. In an experiment involving the Red Crab it was found that the rate of oxygen consumption increased significently at the onset of exercise [Adamczewska: 1994]. A separate study by Head and Baldwin revealed that recovery following exercise involves the regeneration of ATP, which causes the oxygen consumption rate of freshwater crayfish to increase [Head: 1986]. We therefore predict that forcing the crayfish to exercise will increase its specific metabolic rate, compared to the controlll experiment. 

Materials and Method:
Control Experiment:
Fill the test chamber with 22ºC water and set it inside a plastic dishpan filled with water. Weigh and place crayfish into chamber. Record the baseline dissolved oxygen reading, then take readings at 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. Remove the crayfish and measure the volume inside the test chamber. 

Treatment Experiment:
Weigh and place crayfish inside dishpan filled with 22ºC water. For two minutes force the crayfish to run around the dishpan by probing it. After two minutes, place the crayfish into the prepared test chamber and record dissolved oxygen concentration (Following the same method as the controlll experiment). 

Repeat these method for the second and third crayfish. 

Statistical Test:
Once results were recorded for all three crayfish, we used a paired t_test to compare the observations taken from the controlll experiment and the treatment experiment. We used a paired t_test because our hypothesis predicts that specific metabolic rate of the treatment experiment will be statistically greater than the specific metabolic rate of the controlll experiment. 

Results:
Looking at Figure #1 we can see that the average specific metabolic rate is higher for the controlll experiment than the treatment experiment. In the first crayfish we can see the largest margin between the specific metabolic rate of the controlll and treatment experiments, with the controlll experiment having a higher specific metabolic rate than that of the treatment experiment (Table #1). The initial specific metabolic rates of the controlll crayfish were all similar, but the specific metabolic rates of the treatment crayfish were varied (Table #1). Our P value was 0.116858, our t_stat was 2.662409, and the degrees of freedom was 2. 

Discussion:
Our statistical results do not show a higher specific metabolic rate for the treatment experiment, compared to the controlll experiment, and therefore our hypothesis is not supported. Although we hypothesized that forcing the crayfish to exercise would cause an increase in its specific metabolic rate, the controlll experiment had a higher specific metabolic rate. During exercise, the crayfish are using more energy and are therefore using more oxygen. This means that following exercise, regeneration of ATP should cause the oxygen consumption of the crayfish to increase [Head: 1986]. 

However, in our experiment the way in which we forced the crayfish to exercise could have caused them to become stressed. Under these circumstances, when the crayfish was progressively depleting its available oxygen, it may have switched to anaerobic breathing [Wheatly: 1981]. This switch means that the crayfish is no longer using oxygen as it is breathing anaerobically. Due to this switch, the level of oxygen being consumed decreases, and therefore the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish decreases. 

If we were to do this experiment again, we would need to try and find a way to make the crayfish exercise without forcing them, because using force causes the stress levels of the crayfish to rise. We could try recording the specific activity to determine a base level of exercise for the crayfish. For example the number of steps that it takes, or the number of times it flaps its tail in a specific time frame. We could maybe then use this specific level of exercise to account for the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish, to see if those crayfish that took more steps, or flapped their tail more times, consumed more oxygen than the crayfish who remained still. 

If we were to conduct another experiment, it would be interesting to test the effects of fighting on the metabolism of crayfish. The decrease in metabolism that we saw in our experiment could be due to stress, so it would be interesting to see if forcing the crayfish to fight causes their metabolism to decrease even further. We predict that the crayfish will be even more stressed during an experiment where they are forced to fight, compared to our experiment, where they were forced to exercise. The increase in the crayfish stress levels due to being forced to fight may cause them to start breathing anaerobically, therefore consuming less oxygen, this which would cause their specific metabolic rate to decrease. 

Ultimately our results did not support our hypothesis, as our results were not significent. This means that we cannot say that forcing a crayfish to exercise causes its specific metabolic rate to increase.
