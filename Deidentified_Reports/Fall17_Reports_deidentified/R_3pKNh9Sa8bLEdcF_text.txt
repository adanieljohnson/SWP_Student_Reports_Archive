Title: Root-Shoot Allocation Pattern of Radishes (Raphanus sativus) Under Different Humidity Level

Abstract:
Plants need to allocate their limited accessible resources efficiently for the optimal survival strategy. We wondered if the plant resource allocation pattern would be different under different humidity level. We planted two groups of radishes (Raphanus sativus) under different humidity levels and calculated their root:shoot ratio to see their allocation pattern. We hypothesized that plants growing up in higher humidity environment would have lower r:s ratio comparing to plants growing up in lower humidity environment. We don’t have the confidence to claim that our result is correct because it fails the statistical test. However, the future study on humidity influence on root:shoot allocation can be done to test the hypothesis by providing different set of humidity controlll.

Introduction:
All organisms need resources to grow and reproduce. Because the resources are limited, it is essential for organisms to allocate limited resources efficiently to achieve the optimal survival strategy. The optimal survival strategy varies under different environmental conditions. There is evidence shown that plants can adapt to the environment and find their optimal allocation pattern for reproduction [Tonnabel: 2012]. The choice of allocation pattern is not only crucial for reproduction, but it is also critical when plants are growing. In research studies, the biomass of different parts of the plant is used to indicate the allocation pattern. Calculation of the root:shoot ratio is the method always used to determine biomass distribution [Mokany: 2005]. Therefore, we decided to use root : shoot ratio as the indicator to look for resource allocation pattern of plants under the influence of humidity. We chose radish (Raphanus sativus) as our research subject because it is easy to grow. We hypothesized that the radishes growing up at lower humidity level would spend more resources on developing roots than radishes growing up at higher humidity level. When the humidity level is low, the radishes need to develop more roots to extract water from the soil. When the humidity level is high, the radishes do not need excessive roots but need more shoots to respirate to release excessive water.

Materials and Method:
We planted our radishes in two different settings. The radishes in treatment group grow up in a sealed box with water in it. The water is used to create the higher humidity environment, without the direct contact with the soil. The radishes in controlll group grow up in a sealed box without water in it; thus, create a lower humidity environment. After three weeks, we measured the total mass of the whole plants, the total mass of the roots, and the total mass of the shoots of the radishes in each group. We also measured the longest root and shoot samples in each group. Then, we calculated the average root-shoot weight ratio and length ratio. For statistical analysis, we used the one tail two samples t_test to see if the difference between root-shoot weight ratio and the difference between root-shoot length ratio of two groups are statistically significent. We used 0.05 for our p_value. 

Results:
The result is shown in figure 1. For both root-shoot weight and length ratio, the radishes growing up at low humidity level have the greater r:s values comparing to radishes growing up at high humidity level.  The two samples t_test examines the statistical significance of the difference between two sets of data. With a 0.05 p_value, our result is not statistically significent (root-shoot weight ratio: t=1.8532, p=0.1375; root-shoot length ratio: t=1.9581, p=0.1218). Thus, we fail to reject our null hypothesis and to accept our alternative hypothesis.

Discussion:
We cannot confidently say that the humidity level is a factor affecting resource allocation pattern of plants. Failing the statistical test means that our result is likely to happen by chance, or it is caused by other confounding variables. However, the research done by Robakowski and his colleagues of root prunasin concentration in the root of Prunus serotina did demonstrate the humidity influence on plant allocation pattern [2016]. Prunasin is a kind of protein that can decompose to form hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The HCN level is an indicator of resource allocation: developing leaves shows a high level of HCN; developing shoots shows a low level of HCN. The plant allocation pattern can be inferred by examining the root prunasin concentration, which turns out being affected primarily by air temperature and humidity [Robakowski: 2016]. Therefore, further study is needed to examine if humidity is a factor that affects the allocation pattern of plants. Difference in allocation pattern of plants reflect to the idea of physiological plasticity which plants can find their optimal solution for survival through morphological changes. Having plasticity for morphological change is critical not only in finding optimal survival strategy, but it also illustrates the ability of adaption, which plays an important role in the interspecific competition. Metrosideros polymorpha became the dominant tree species in Hawaii because it can have large number of phenotypic variations depending on the environment it is in. Being able to adapt to different environmental conditions help M. polymorph to occupy large niches for survival and win the species competition in Hawaii [Cordell: 1998]. Thus, understanding if the plant allocation pattern is affected by humidity level in the environment is essential for predicting whether a plant will become a dominant species in one area or not. If a foreign plant is highly adaptive, it is very likely to be the invasive species and to jeopardize other native plants.
