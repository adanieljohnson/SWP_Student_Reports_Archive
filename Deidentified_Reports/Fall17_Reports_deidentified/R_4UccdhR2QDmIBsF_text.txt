Title: Effects of Increased Salinity on Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp. 

Abstract:
In previous studies, increase in salinity levels of water resulted in increased oxygen consumption, and, therefore, increased metabolic rate, but significantly low salinity levels resulted in the death of the organism due to a lack of necessary salts for physiological function. In our experiment, we hypothesized that, if salinity levels Procambarus sp. are placed in is increased, then their specific metabolic rate will also increase. The salinity of the water was increased from 0‰ to 0.0065‰, oxygen consumption was measured using an oxygen probe every 5 minutes for 20 minutes, and the results were analyzed using one-tailed paired t-test. There was an increase in mean metabolic rate of 0.000373 mg O2/(g*min.) after the increase in salinity, but was an increase not significant enough to state that there is a difference in mean specific metabolic rates (one-tailed paired t-test: t-stat=3.00, SD(control)=0.000770, SD(experimental)=0.000949, df=2, P=0.0954). These results may be due to the weak concentration of the salt solution, salinity levels close to those of Procambarus sp. natural environment, or lack of movement. These factors all contribute to decreased expended energy, oxygen consumption, and specific metabolic rate. 


Introduction:
Metabolism is the process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer within cells. Metabolic rate is the amount of energy used by physiological processes at any given time. Oxygen consumption is an indirect indicator of energy expended and is directly proportional to metabolic rate. Therefore, as more energy is expended, more oxygen is consumed, and metabolic rate increases. Conversely, when less energy is expended, less oxygen is consumed, and metabolic rate decreases.  
For aquatic organisms to maintain homeostasis, diffusion of salts is required. Because energy is expended in order to expel excess salts, metabolic rate increases as salinity increases. 
In a previous experiment, Palaemon peringueyi were placed in water of 5 different salinities, 5‰, 15‰, 25‰, and 35‰, at a constant temperature of 15°C. It was found that oxygen consumption rate of the organism increased as the salinity of the water increased. Although Palaemon peringueyi were able to tolerate high salinity levels above 35‰, there was a 100% mortality rate at low salinity levels below 5‰. This was due to the fact that these organisms are usually found in saltwater environments with salinity levels within the range of 5‰ to 35‰, but rarely ever found in freshwater environments with salinity levels below 5‰, which are levels potentially detrimental to physiology of the organism [Allan: 2006]. 
Procambarus sp. is a species of crayfish that can be found in saltwater or freshwater environments. They are relatively small in size, easy to observe, and not difficult to handle making them a suitable organism for this experiment.  
Because of the relationship between the amount of energy expended, oxygen consumed, and metabolic rate, we hypothesize that, if the salinity of the water the Procambarus sp. are in is increased to 0.0065‰, then the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. will increase. 


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, three Procambarus sp. were used and kept in a tank filled with water. A screw-top glass testing chamber was filled with room temperature water saturated with air and placed in a dishpan also filled with room temperature water. One Procambarus sp. was placed inside the testing chamber and the cap of the testing chamber with an attached oxygen probe was screwed into place. The initial dissolved oxygen concentration was measured as the baseline reading at time 0 and recorded. The dissolved oxygen concentration was measured every 5 minutes after the baseline reading at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. After the final reading 20 minutes after the baseline reading, the water in the testing chamber was replaced with water with a 0.0065‰ salinity made with a 1 to 9 ratio of 0.5% NaCl to room temperature water saturated with air. The testing chamber was placed back in the dishpan filled with room temperature water. The same Procambarus sp. was placed inside the testing chamber and the top of the testing chamber with the attached oxygen probe was screwed into place. The initial dissolved oxygen concentration was measured as the baseline reading at time 0 and recorded. The dissolved oxygen concentration was measured, again, every 5 minutes after the baseline reading at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. The same procedure was used for all three Procambarus sp. 
The results were analyzed using a one-tailed paired t-test. 


Results:
There was an increase in mean specific metabolic rate by 0.000373 mg O2/(g*min.) after the Procambarus sp. was placed in the 0.0065‰ salinity water (Figure 1, t-stat=3.00, SD(control)=0.000770, SD(experimental)=0.000949, df=2, P=0.0954). As time increased, the dissolved oxygen concentration decreased for all the Procambarus sp. in both the control and experimental groups. All three Procambarus sp. had very little movement in the testing chamber for both the control and experimental groups. 


Discussion:
According to our results and statistical testing, we cannot support our hypothesis stating that, if the salinity of the water the Procambarus sp. are in is increased to 0.0065‰, then the specific metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. will increase. Therefore, we cannot reject our null hypothesis stating that, if the salinity of the water the Procambarus sp. are in is increased to 0.0065‰, then there will not be a significant difference in the mean specific metabolic rate of the control and experimental Procambarus sp. groups. 
Salts diffuse down a gradient from high to low concentrations causing excess salts to constantly enter the body of the Procambarus sp. from the environment. In order to maintain homeostasis, Procambarus sp. must get rid of the excess salt that enters its body which requires energy. When the salinity of the water the Procambarus sp. was in was increased to 0.0065‰, it had to expend more energy to get rid of these excess salts. An increase in the amount of energy expended to maintain homeostasis causes an increase in oxygen consumptions leading to the increase in specific metabolic rate. This explanation accounts for the fact that there was a slight increase in the specific metabolic rates of the control and experimental groups, although it was not great enough to be considered a statistically significant difference. 
This lack of significance may have been due to the fact that 0.0065‰ salinity water was not concentrated enough to have a large enough impact on oxygen consumption, and, therefore, specific metabolic rate, of the Procambarus sp. Their natural environment having similar salinity levels to those tested may have had an impact on the insignificant increase in oxygen consumption and metabolic rate.  In the experiment performed on Palaemon peringueyi, there was also little difference in oxygen consumption rate tested because salinity levels were close to the those of their natural environment [Allan: 2006]. We also observed little movement of Procambarus sp. in the testing chamber which could have decreased energy expended, oxygen consumption, and metabolic rate. Varying amounts of movement of different organisms tested were also thought to be a reason for differing results in previous experiments [Allan: 2006]. 
In a future experiment, we would like to observe what effect a higher concentration of salt will have on the Procambarus sp.
