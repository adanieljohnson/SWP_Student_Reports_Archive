Title: The effects of dissolved CO2 on the metabolic rate of Procambris spp.

Abstract:
Metabolism is the process in which chemical reactions take place in all living organisms, allowing the maintenance of life. An organism’s metabolic rate can be measured through tracking the amount of oxygen consumption in an organism’s environment. To determine the effect CO2 concentration has on metabolic rates, we placed crayfish in a controlllled aquatic environment and compared the metabolic rates of these organisms before and after increasing the CO2 concentration of the water. We hypothesized that these actions would lead to an overall decrease in the crayfishes’ metabolic rates. Through comparing the results, it’s seen that higher concentrations of CO2 lead to lower metabolic rates as a result of less available oxygen and a high pH. It was also determined that our p_value was not significent at the value of 0.133034 when excluding crayfish 3, or at 0.520712 when including crayfish 3. 



Introduction:
A metabolic rate is defined as the amount of energy that is expended by the body to sustain life. The metabolic rate is composed of many different factors that are dependent upon the numerous reactions that sum to make metabolism. The bases of these reactions stem from exergonic and endergonic chemical reactions at the cellular level. Metabolic rates are known to vary due to body mass and higher-level taxonomic affiliation (Mueller, 2001). The most efficient way to measure a specific metabolic rate of an organism, in specific conditions, is by tracking and recording the concentration of dissolved oxygen in its environment. This allows us to determine the amount of oxygen that was used. Because oxygen consumption is directly proportionate to an organism’s expended energy, it acts as a good measurement for metabolic rate. Procambris spp., a crayfish, were chosen for their ability to be handled without causing any effect to the data results. They may be removed from water with no harm done to the organism, making the experiment more accurate. After measuring the oxygen intake levels of the crayfish in its unaltered surroundings, we will be increasing the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the environment and proceed to measure its oxygen intake levels. 
A suitable aqueous environment for aquatic animals holds a pH between 6.5 and 9.0. Through increasing levels of dissolved CO2 in an organism’s, the pH would become more acidic; therefore dropping the pH level below the lower bound of what is considered healthy(“Water Quality Improvement Project”). In addition to affecting the pH levels of the environment, the additional dissolved CO2 causes a drop in dissolved O2 level concentrations, making the environment non-conducive. The transfer of oxygen from water to blood is a more strenuous process than the transfer of oxygen from air to blood. Because of these differences, the lower oxygen levels in the water makes the process of transferring oxygen from water to blood that much more difficult(Water Quality Improvement Project, 2015). Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that by increasing the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the environment, the metabolic rate of crayfish will decrease because there is less oxygen available. 


Materials and Method:
We began by obtaining three crayfish. Crayfish one was weighed and placed in glass filled with 22C water which sat in an empty dishpan. The glass chamber was then sealed off and an oxygen probe was placed through the top and into the water. After turning on the machine and letting the readings stabilize, we took the baseline reading. We then proceeded to take readings every 5 minutes for a 20 minute time span. After this portion of the experiment, we measured the volume of the water inside the crayfish’s chamber by using a 100Ml graduated cylinder. Next, we removed the crayfish and repeated this with the next two crayfish. 
Following the controlll portion of the experiment, we increased the concentration of CO2 in the water environment. This was done by combining 20Ml of concentrated CO2 with approximately 70Ml of water to be placed in the glass chamber. Crayfish one was then placed in glass and over a 20 minute interval we took readings every 5 minutes. Afterwards we measured the volume of the water. By using the recorded information and the equation for specific metabolic rate, we calculated the metabolic rates of the crayfish before and after the CO2 concentration was increased. 



Results:
When reviewing the metabolic rates of the crayfish before the CO2 concentration was increased, we see a decrease in oxygen consumption as time proceeds. But, when comparing these rates with the metabolic rates of the crayfish after the CO2 concentration was increased, we see that the oxygen intake begins at a lower level, in addition to having a faster decrease in oxygen consumption over the 20 minute interval. Seeing, as the oxygen consumption lowered after the CO2 concentration was increased, it’s observed that the metabolic rate decreased as well. When referring to Figure 1, we are able to see there is a general decrease in metabolic rates from the controlll group to the experimental group, when excluding crayfish 3.
Without Including Crawfish 3:
Avg. Difference: -0.000545115
N:2
Average before: 0.003617678
Average After: 0.003072563
Standard Deviation Before: 0.001222872351
Standard Deviation After: 0.001386354638
Degrees of Freedom: 1

p-Value: 0.133034
The reason for excluding crayfish 3 in these results is because it produced no overall change in oxygen levels, leading its metabolic rate to be 0.

Discussion:
From comparing the results from the controlll group and the experimental group, we can see the increased CO2 concentration caused a decrease in oxygen consumption from the original controlll group. This lead to the decrease in metabolic rates as well. As a side effect of increasing the CO2 concentration, the O2 concentration was lowered, leading to the decrease in metabolic rates. Despite the decrease in metabolic rates, our hypothesis was not fully supported because our p_value was not significent. A similar experiment was conducted using crayfish. In a study done by Jean-Charles Massabuau(1983) movement of the crayfish exposed to different concentration levels of CO2 during induced hyperventilation was used to retrieve data on the metabolic rates of crayfish. The results were similar to ours; being that the higher the water oxygenation, the less CO2 induced hyperventilation in CO2 responsive crayfish. In other words, the higher O2 concentration levels in the water, the higher the metabolic rates. 
Possible improvements could be found in crayfish 3. Before the CO2 concentration was increased, the oxygen intake varied throughout the 20 minute interval causing the total change in O2 to be 0. By running the 20 minute interval again, after giving the crayfish time to adjust to the water temperature and new environment could produce more consistent results. In addition, using distilled water would give more accurate results as well. The higher pH causes any metal in the water to become more soluble(“Water Quality Improvement”), which can cause the crayfish to absorb a larger amount of them; in turn affecting our results.
