Title: The effect of a sevin solution injected into the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens on the stimulus frequency at which tetany occurs

Abstract:
In this lab, 2% Sevin solution, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was injected into the gastrocnemus to measure the effects on the frequency at which tetany occurs in Rania pipiens, or the Northern Leopard Frog. The experiment was conducted by measuring tetany of a frog leg before the solution was injected, and after 0.2Ml of the Sevin solution was injected into the gastrocnemus. The data was measured using the software LabScribe. The original hypothesis was that the addition of the Sevin solution would lower the frequency in hertz at which tetany occurs. To measure the significance of the results, a paired t_test was used. The calculated P-value was 0.015, indicating that the results were significent and the hypothesis was accepted. The frog legs reached tetany at a lower frequency after the injection of Sevin into the muscle. This lab is significent because the effect of Sevin on the neuromuscular synapse could potentially be used for management of diseases that impair the functioning of the neuromuscular junction.

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab was to measure the effect of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Sevin, on the frequency at which tetany occurs in the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens. Rania pipiens, or the Northern Leopard Frog, is a fairly large frog species that grows to three to five inches at maturity. It is mainly found in North America. This species is commonly used in labs because of its accessibility and because these frogs have well defined leg muscles from jumping around [Lannoo: 2005]. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used by all neuromuscular systems in vertebrates. Acetylcholine is released when an action potential arrives at the axon terminal. This causes calcium channels to open, allowing calcium to enter the cell. Calcium causes the vesicles containing acetylcholine to bind to the presynaptic membrane, emptying acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Some acetylcholine will then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. IF enough receptors are activated, the depolarization will spread to the ends of the motor end plate and to the surrounding muscle cell membranes. When the action potential reaches a muscle cell’s system of membranes, it causes the muscle to contract. In this experiment, the motor neuron is the sciatic nerve, and the muscle cell is the gastrocnemus. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that functions to break down acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction after an action potential has been fired. [Sadava, et al: 2016]. The solution of Sevin is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which prevents the breaking down of the acetylcholine after an action potential has been fired. This would leave acetylcholine sitting in the neuromuscular junction. With acetylcholine already in the neuromuscular junction before the firing of an action potential, questions arose on what effect this would have on the firing of the action potential, specifically how this would affect the frequency needed to reach tetany. Tetany is reached through temporal summation, or when the axons are repeatedly stimulated. This will eventually lead the muscle to generate the maximum possible force, tetany. Our hypothesis was that when the solution of Sevin was injected into the gastrocnemus of the frog leg, the frequency in hertz needed to induce tetany would be lower. 

Materials and Method:
Before the start of the lab, download LabScribe, a computer software program that allow us to visualize and process myogram data. Obtain three frog legs of recently euthanized frogs. Each of these legs will serve as both a controlll and experimental group. Place each leg in a dissecting pan and using a pair of forceps, remove the skin from the leg. Moisten the leg with Frog Ringers solution periodically throughout the experiment to prevent the exposed leg from drying out. Separate the inner thigh muscles starting at the top of the frog leg to expose the sciatic nerve. The next step is to detach the gastrocnemus muscle at the Achilles tendon. Use string to tie a knot at the edge of the gastrocnemus. Using the string attached to the gastrocnemus, suspend the gastrocnemus using a force transducer. Place two pins at diagonals going across the tibia and tibialis anterior. Use the next two pins at diagonals going across the femur. The next step is to attach the sleeve probes, cuffing the nerve. 
Set the LabScribe as follows: the pulse amplitude at 2.0, the number of pulses at 0, the pulse width at 5, and the frequency, our variable, starting at 4 Hz. 
Using the sleeve electrodes in the sciatic nerve, stimulate the nerve for five seconds. Change the frequency to 8 Hz and once again, stimulate the muscle for five seconds. Keep repeating this procedure for 10 Hz, 12 Hz, 15 Hz, and 18 Hz. Once this data has been collected, pour 2% solution of Sevin into a tiny bowl. Using a syringe, inject 0.2 Ml of the solution into the gastrocnemus of the frog. Let the frog leg sit for one minute before stimulating again. Reset the frequency back to 4 Hz and repeat the experiment using the same frequencies. Repeat the entire experiment for the other two frog legs.
After all data has been collected, properly dispose of the frog legs, and wash all supplies used in this experiment in the sink. To interpret the data, a paired two-sample T-test is used.


Results:
Based on the data collected, each of the frog legs reached tetany at a lower frequency when the Sevin solution was injected into the muscle than when not exposed to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In the first frog leg, the leg naturally reached tetany at 12 Hz, and then reached tetany at 10 Hz when the solution was injected into the gastrocnemus. Similarly, the second frog leg reached tetany at 15 Hz without Sevin, and 12 Hz with Sevin. The last leg also showed a similar trend with 18 Hz and 15 Hz respectively. To measure the significance of this experiment, a paired t_test was used. The t_statistic was 8.0, the degrees of freedom was 2, and the P-value was 0.015. This led to the conclusion that the results are significent.

Discussion:
Based on the results of the paired t_test and the outcome of the experiment, the hypothesis was accepted, and the data collected was significent. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor did have the expected effect of inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction. The pre-existing acetylcholine enabled the gastrocnemus to contract more rapidly and reach tetany sooner than the leg would without the esterase inhibitor. The differences in the original frequencies that tetany was obtained at can be contributed to the different sizes of the frog legs. Some of the legs were larger than others, and those legs needed a higher frequency to reach the original tetany. Although the pulse amplitude would usually be set around one in this experiment, the pulse amplitude was set at two because the first frog leg used needed a higher pulse amplitude to enable the graph to show contraction. This should not have had any effect on the data collected though, because the pulse amplitude was kept consistent throughout the experiment. While the results were significent, the experiment was done with a small number of test subjects. To expand the study in the future, a larger experiment could be done with the frog legs. If the data is once again significent, possible future studies could be done on other vertebrates to see if the same results are shown. This results of this study correlate with an experiment that recently concluded in September of 2017. In this experiment, pyridostigmine, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, was used to increase muscle contraction in the respiratory muscle function in mice. The purpose of this study was to look at the effects of problems with neuromuscular junctions in relation to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Similar to the experiment above, the inhibitor, pyridostigmine, was hypothesized to increase muscle contraction. The conclusion of this experiment was insignificent in terms of effect on the mice [Amancio: 2017]. Part of the problem with this experiment was that the solution injected into the mice was toxic in certain concentrations. While the results of the muscular dystrophy experiment were not significent, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are still being explored as a way to improve muscle contraction throughout the body. With more experiments and a greater understanding of their effects, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor chemicals such as Sevin and pyridostigmine could become widely used in medicine.
