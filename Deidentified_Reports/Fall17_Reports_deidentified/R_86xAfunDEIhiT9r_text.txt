Title: The effects of temperature on the metabolism and gas exchange of the Orconetces sp.

Abstract:
In this experiment, we looked at the effects of temperature on three different, similar-sized crayfish, Orconetces (also known as Crayfish) and how their metabolism changes the rate of gas exchange accordingly. Crayfish are ectotherms, animals whose body temperature regulation depends on external sources (Johnson AD). We tested the specific metabolic rate of each crayfish at 18C and then once more at 7C by using the O2 concentrations over a span of fifteen minutes. We found that the crayfish of 7C had higher specific metabolic rates on all accounts. We hypothesized that temperature was directly proportional to the rate of metabolism; as temperature decreases, so will the rate of metabolism. However, our data showed that the lower temperature had a higher metabolism rate. Even so, we received a small deviation of metabolism rates and a P-value of 0.1541. Despite our data, we concluded that a lower temperature lowers metabolic rates, supporting our hypothesis. Our statistical data shows that the difference is not significant, raising the question of confounding variables in this particular lab. The data we received could have been due to chance.


Introduction:
Different organisms have different methods for obtaining energy and producing ATP. Metabolic rates refer to the amount of energy being used by an organism and therefore, the amount of O2 levels used in the production of ATP. During this ATP production process, glucose is converted to energy. Carbon and oxygen are converted to CO2 gas through a series of reactions (Johnson AD). At the same time, high energy electrons are released and bind to NAD+ and FAD which transfer the electrons to the electron transport chain. The electrons give up energy in the chain and convert ADP to ATP. Electrons at the end of the chain are removed by attaching to molecular O2, creating water. In this experiment, we looked at the relationship between environmental temperatures and the rate of metabolism in Orconecetes (crayfish). As ectotherms, crayfish can not regulate their body temperature. Instead, their metabolism depends of the external environment. This means, that a lower external temperature should also lower the body temperature. A lower body temperature will also slow down the rate of metabolism, because cells have lower thermal energy and do not need to try to regulate the body temperature (Johnson AD). Crayfish can survive in a wide range of environmental conditions. There are more than 300 crayfish species in North America. Many species have adapted in order for them to tolerate both high and low temperatures (Powell). Their survival and relative success implies that either through behavior or physiological mechanisms, they are able to use their environments to their benefit. By measuring the O2 consumption, we were able to calculate the amount of ATP produced during metabolism of each Crayfish, also known as their physiological response. Measuring energy-transfer directly, can explain the metabolic process. We hypothesized that as temperature decreases, so will the rate of metabolism comparatively to the 18C water.


Materials and Methods:
We obtained three similar sized living Orconecetes (crayfish). We weighed and recorded each of the crayfish. Starting with the smallest, we placed it into an 18C O2 saturated beaker of water. We inserted an O2 reading probe over the opening and sealed it shut tightly. We measured the O2 concentration immediately, at 5 minutes, and at 10 minutes. We then removed the probe and crayfish and measured the remaining amount of water in the beaker. We repeated this process for the other two crayfish. We calculated the specific metabolic rate from the recorded information. Then, we repeated the entire sequence, only with 7C O2 saturated water instead of 18C. 

Results:
As one can see, the general trends show that the metabolic rate for the crayfish in the 7 degree Celsius water had a higher average metabolic rate than the crayfish in the 18 degree Celsius water. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our data. Despite the many Literature sources supporting our original hypothesis that a colder temperature lowers the metabolic rate of ectotherms, our data supported otherwise. However, in a research article from the Department of Biology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Sokolova and her partner Lannig found that higher temperatures can result in “elevated maintenance cost” and “impair oxygen uptake.” This is because crustaceans elevate ventilation when temperatures are warmer, and makes the animal more susceptible to the uptake of pollution or toxic metals (Sokolova). In other words, as temperature increases, any residual metals that are in the water could contaminate the experiment solution and cause a decrease in metabolic rates in the ectotherms. Therefore, a decrease in temperature may seem to be higher when in fact, the crayfish is not ventilating as many toxins. At the same time, the crayfish may have increased its metabolism rate in the colder water because they were shocked by the immediate cold temperature. Between the raw data, averaged data, and statistical test it appears that our crayfish were exposed to some sort of pollution or malnourishment in their storage tanks. Our hypothesis was not supported in this experiment. After running a paired T test, we found a P-value of 0.1541which means the difference is not considered to be statistically significant and the null hypothesis is accepted. In the future, we would run each test for a longer amount of time and keep the crayfish in a more healthy environment.
