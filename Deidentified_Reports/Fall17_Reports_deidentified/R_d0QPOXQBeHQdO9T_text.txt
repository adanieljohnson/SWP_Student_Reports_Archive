Title: The Inconclusive Effects of Darkness on the Metabolic Rate of the Species Orconectes 

Abstract:
The experiment and statistical analysis of this study attempt to examine the effect of darkness on metabolic rate of a heterotroph. We hypothesized that there will be a significant difference between an Orconectes’ metabolic rate with exposure to darkness versus exposure to daylight. This was done by testing the oxygen consumption of three Orconectes organisms. We used a dissolved oxygen-meter to measure the amount of oxygen consumed by each organism over a period of twenty minutes. Each Orconectes functioned as their own control, as prior to exposure to darkness, the oxygen consumed whilst exposed to normal daylight was observed. Heterotrophs exposed to darkness is experimentally observed to decrease organisms’ metabolic rate, compared to metabolic rate with exposure to light. Our results did not support this finding as the Orconectes’ metabolic rates did not consistently decrease with exposure to darkness. The inconsistencies in metabolic rate as an effect of exposure to darkness is accordingly shown by the low statistical significance demonstrated by the P-value of our data being 0.850778, on average, which is above 0.5. Our data obtained is therefore deemed relatively inconclusive, for our hypothesis was not entirely supported. 


Introduction:
Heterotrophs acquire high-energy molecules and raw materials by consuming autotrophs or other heterotrophs for the purpose of carrying out necessary physiological life functions. The term metabolism refers to the entirety of the process of organisms balancing captured energy, conversion of this energy, and transfer of this energy within cells of an organism. Metabolic rate is the quantifiable amount of energy expended by all physiological processes at a specified moment. In terms of measuring metabolic rate, oxygen consumption and, conversely, carbon dioxide production are indirect measures of the amount of energy generated by an organism. While the oxygen utilized in the midst of this process is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended. During the process of metabolism, organisms transform attained glucose into energy, due to the carbon and oxygen atoms present within the glucose molecules being converted into carbon dioxide gas. NAD+ and FAD molecules obtain high-energy electrons that are then transmitted accordingly. This release of electrons is then transferred to the electron transport system. The energy produced from this transmission is used to redevelop low-energy ADP into high-energy ATP for the purpose of organisms carrying out all physiological life-functions. With that said, although the process of metabolism is primarily carried out internally within a given organism, the exploration of the external effects on this process are crucial, for an organism utilizes matter within its surroundings in order for the process of metabolism to occur. The specimen Orconectes sp. (crayfish) is an ectotherm and is therefore incredibly useful in measuring metabolic rate; for, unlike other organisms, it is very easy for ectotherms to alter their body temperature and, consequently, affect their metabolic rate. The temperature of an organism can be extensively varied due to various different environmental conditions. Therefore, body temperature is correlated to metabolic rate. Warmer temperatures increase energy production, and, consequently, metabolic rate. Accordingly, ectotherms have been observed to operate at higher metabolic rates during the summer, rather than in the spring [Angilletta: 2001]. In order to observe the effects on metabolic rate of the Orconectes crayfish under varying environmental circumstances, the effects of a dark environment (the absence of light) on the oxygen consumed by the organism, and therefore metabolic rate, was observed. The darkness and environmental conditions served as the independent variables, while the effects on oxygen consumption and metabolic rate served as the dependent variables. We hypothesized that the absence of light would significantly decrease the amount of oxygen consumed by the crayfish, and thus, decrease metabolic rate, in comparison to an Orconectes exposed to light. 


Materials and Methods:
Three Orconectes organisms was obtained and tested on that had previously been kept in a controlled lab environment. Each Orconectes functioned as their own control, as prior to exposure to darkness, the oxygen consumed whilst exposed to normal daylight was observed. Oxygen consumption was monitored by using a dissolved oxygen meter, and metabolic rate was accordingly calculated using an equation that accounts for various conditions: Oxygen consumed (mg/L), volume of water (L), time (minutes), and weight (g) of the Orconectes organism used. In order to create a dark environment, we covered the entirety of the dissolved oxygen meter with opaque tinfoil. Both conditions of exposure to darkness and exposure to light was monitored for twenty minutes, while the oxygen consumption was recorded, using the oxygen-meter, every five minutes. This procedure was carried out for all three Orconectes specimens. After all of the values of oxygen consumption at the intended intervals were recorded within the water of the dissolved oxygen-meter, the true amount of oxygen consumed by the Orconectes specimens was determined. In order to calculate the amount of oxygen consumed by each organism during each minute-interval, the change in oxygen concentration (numerical value of final oxygen concentration minus numerical value of initial oxygen concentration) in the water was multiplied by the total volume of water within the screw-top glass testing chamber (in liters). This value was then be divided by the amount of time (in minutes) multiplied by the weight (in grams) of the individual organism. The value calculated from this equation yielded the specific metabolic rate of each individual organism in mg O2 * g-1 * min-1. A paired T-test was used to evaluate the significance in the differences between the control and experimental groups. 



Results:
Specimen 1 of the Orconectes exhibited a specific metabolic rate of 0.00084 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to light, and a specific metabolic rate of 0.00085 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to darkness. The difference (dark condition minus light condition) between these two conditions for specimen 1 is 0.00001 O2 * g-1 * min-1. Specimen 2 of the Orconectes exhibited a specific metabolic rate of 0.00034 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to light, and a specific metabolic rate of 0.00012 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to darkness. The difference (dark condition minus light condition) between these two conditions for specimen 2 is -0.000216 O2 * g-1 * min-1. Specimen 3 of the Orconectes exhibited a specific metabolic rate of 0.00013 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to light, and a specific metabolic rate of 0.00043 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1 when exposed to darkness. The average difference between these two conditions for specimen 3 is 0.000302 O2 * g-1 * min-1. The standard deviation for the control and experimental groups collectively are 0.000364896 and 0.000363493, respectively.  With an average difference between dark and light conditions being 0.000032 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1, and a final T-test P-value of 0.850778 being much higher than the P-value of 0.5, our data demonstrates no significant difference between the two environmental conditions, and is, consequently, inconclusive. A common trend was not seen across the three Orconectes specimens. 


Discussion:
As for specimen 1 of the Orconectes observed, the specific metabolic rate of the organism when exposed to daylight was, in fact, a lower value than that of the value of specific metabolic rate when the organism was exposed to darkness. The observations made from Orconectes specimen 1 therefore do not support our hypothesis that metabolic rate would decrease in the absence of light. This discrepancy could possibly be due to the fact that when we placed Orconectes specimen 1 into the screw-top glass testing chamber, due to the its relatively large size, we observed the organism to constantly be moving around and squirming whilst in the container.  As for specimen 2 of the Orconectes observed, the specific metabolic rate was lower when exposed to darkness, in comparison to when this organism was exposed to daylight. The observations made from Orconectes specimen 2 therefore does support our hypothesis that metabolic rate is lower when the organism is exposed to darkness, in comparison to when the organism is exposed to daylight.  As for specimen 3 of the Orconectes observed, again, the specific metabolic rate of the organism when exposed to daylight was, in fact, a lower value than that of the value of specific metabolic rate when the organism was exposed to darkness. The observations made from Orconectes specimen 3 therefore do not support our hypothesis that metabolic rate would decrease when exposed to darkness, in comparison to the metabolic rate when exposed to daylight. With an average difference between dark and light conditions being 0.000032 mg O2 * g-1 * min-1, and a final T-test P-value of 0.850778 being much higher than the P-value of 0.5, our data demonstrates no significant difference between the two environmental conditions, and is, consequently, inconclusive. The standard deviation for the control and experimental groups collectively are 0.000364896 and 0.000363493, respectively. A common trend was not seen across the three Orconectes specimens. 

In a different study that also observed the effects of environmental conditions on metabolic rate of a different heterotroph, much like our experiment. The heterotroph observed in the alternative study were specimens of Oreochromis Niloticus (adult tilapias). The alternative experiment observed the influence of different photoperiod cycles on the metabolic rate and energy loss of adult tilapia Oreochromis Niloticus [Biswas: 2002]. Photoperiodism is the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of day or night [Goldman: 1983]. The photoperiod-mediated cycles observed in this experiment demonstrated metabolic rate to be higher for all adult tilapia Oreochromis Niloticus during the light phases, compared to the metabolic rate during dark phases [Biswas: 2002]. 

Taking into consideration the scholarly experiments performed on other heterotrophs, published information on the effects of environmental conditions on organisms’ metabolic rates, and the experiment we performed, our data obtained can be deemed relatively inconclusive, for our hypothesis was not entirely supported. However, this conclusion is puzzling due to other experiments suggesting our hypothesis to be true. For further experimentation, a much larger sample size, longer periods of time, and varying sizes of screw-top glass testing chambers should be employed. Possible sources of error within our experiment could be a probe malfunction, or that the screw-top glass testing chamber was not properly sealed, causing our data to be skewed.
