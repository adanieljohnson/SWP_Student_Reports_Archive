Title: The effects of temperature on the photosynthetic rate of Fragaria x ananassa

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is one of the major processes that plants use to harvest energy from sunlight. The main objective of this experiment is to test the effect temperature has on the photosynthetic rate of Fragaria x ananassa. This experiment is important to the agricultural field because it allows farmers to understand which crops may be more successful in their climate region; therefore, affecting food production in a country. It was hypothesized if the strawberry leaves are exposed to room temperature, then the photosynthetic rate of the strawberry leaves will be higher than the photosynthetic rates of temperatures in hot or cold conditions. In this experiment, three samples of strawberry chloroplasts in solution were made with one set in 35⁰ C conditions, one set in room temperature (22⁰ C) conditions and the last set exposed to 0⁰ C conditions. The photosynthetic rate was measured using absorbance values at 600 nm. There was not a significant difference in photosynthetic rates between room temperature and warm temperatures as well as room temperature and cold temperatures. There was a significant difference between hot and cold temperatures in strawberry leaves. These results show that extreme temperatures have an effect on the photosynthetic rates of plants.  

Introduction:
Most organisms depend directly or indirectly upon a process to fix energy in a usable form such as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and some other organisms, such as protists and certain bacteria, use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll molecules. This stored energy can be released later by glycolysis and respiration. The amount of energy converted into usable forms by photosynthetic organisms in an ecosystem is defined as primary productivity. Environmental changes that affect photosynthesis rates, such as temperature and amount of rainfall, are going to change primary productivity, and ultimately the ecosystems that depend on it. This experiment will focus on how temperature affects the photosynthetic rate of Fragaria x ananassa. According to a study conducted by Davison, photosynthesis usually increases with increasing temperature until the plant reaches its optimum temperature range in which if the temperature goes beyond or way below the range, then the rate of photosynthesis will decrease rapidly [Davison: 1991]. Therefore, it can be hypothesized the rate of photosynthesis in strawberry leaves should be the best at room temperature compared to either extreme, hot or cold, because either extreme would result in a decrease rate of photosynthesis. This experiment is important to study because if affects agricultural productivity. More specific to this experiment is heat stress is one of the biggest challenges that faces strawberry production because it stunts their growth. The reason it reduces plant growth is high temperatures inhibit thylakoid activities, especially near the photosystem II reaction center. According to a study performed by Kadir, strawberry cells subjected to 30⁰ C  grew slowly and did not proliferate normally in suspension cultures. In addition, strawberry vegetative growth, root growth, fruit set, and fruit quality were negatively affected by high temperatures. However, he found that strawberry plants resistant to high temperatures had the ability to maintain high rates of photosynthesis [Kadir: 2006]. Therefore, if the optimal temperature for each plant can be determined, specifically in strawberry plants, then different agricultural techniques can be developed to insure optimal growth and maximization of photosynthetic rates in plants.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, three replicates of three, one control, and one blank were used in this experiment all containing 100 uL of chloroplasts from strawberry leaves, water and 2 mL of reaction buffer solution. All, but the blank, contained 2 mL of DCPIP. The importance of DCPIP is it acts as an electron acceptor making it easier to measure the affect temperature has on the photosynthetic rate of Fragaria x ananassa. The DCPIP assay can be used to determine if environmental conditions, chemicals, and other factors affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. Three replicates were made with one set of three test tubes in 35⁰ C conditions, one set in room temperature (22⁰ C) conditions and the last set exposed to 0⁰ C conditions. The blank and control were in room temperature conditions. The photosynthetic rate was measured using the absorbance value set at 600 nm in 10-minute intervals for 30 minutes. An ANOVA test was used to compare the mean for the three groups to each other and their variabilities.

Results:
Some qualitative observations of the solutions in their respective temperature settings were the test tubes in the 35⁰ C bath over time had a lighter blue appearance. The room temperature test tubes remained relatively the same hue of blue from the DCPIP. Lastly the test tubes in 0⁰ C conditions had a darker blue appearance over time. There was not a significant difference in photosynthetic rates between the room temperature and hot conditions as well as the room temperature and cold conditions for the strawberry leaves. However, there was a significant difference in photosynthetic rates between the hot and cold conditions. An ANOVA test was used to compare the different temperatures to one another and their variabilities. Our hypothesis was supported as seen in Figure 1.

Discussion:
In this experiment, it was concluded that there was a significant difference between the photosynthetic rates between the hot bath and the ice bath in strawberry leaves. However, there was no significant difference in photosynthetic rates between hot bath and room temperature nor ice bath and room temperature in strawberry leaves. The purpose of this experiment was to observe the rate of photosynthesis of varying temperatures. A study conducted by Berry showed plants will exhibit photosynthetic thermal responses based on its native environment. For example, plants that usually grow in cool environments will generally exhibit higher photosynthetic rates at lower temperatures, and its optimum photosynthetic rate will occur at low temperatures compared to plants that are grown in warm environments. The plants that usually grow in warmer climates will have higher photosynthetic rates in higher temperatures [Berry: 1980]. A potential error of why we did not produce significant results between hot bath and room temperature and ice bath and room temperature could have been not having a significant difference in temperatures. For instance, instead of placing test tubes in 35⁰ C water perhaps 60⁰ C would have produced more significant results. Further experimentation of longer time intervals such as increasing the time to 20 minutes per measured absorbance or more extreme temperatures such as 60⁰ C could suggest a significant difference between rates of photosynthesis. Nonetheless, experiments like the one conducted are important to the agricultural field because it allows farmers to understand how temperature and the climate in which they grow their crops in affects the rate of photosynthesis.
