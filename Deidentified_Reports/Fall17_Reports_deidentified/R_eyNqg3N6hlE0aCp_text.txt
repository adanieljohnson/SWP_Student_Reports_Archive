Title: Comparing Photosynthetic activity in C3 and C4 Plants

Abstract:
This experiment was designed to test if C3 and C4 chloroplast would function better or worse in saline solutions. In this experiment, we used spinach (Spinacia oleraca) as our C3 plant and corn (Zea mays) as our C4 plant. To do this we extracted each sort of chloroplast and left them in salt or distilled water solutions and measured their photosynthetic activity over time. We measured photosynthetic activity with DCPIP, a molecule that appears blue but turns clear as photosynthesis occurs, and this allowed us to quantify the photosynthesis by measuring the absorbance of the solutions. We then ran a paired t_test on the collected data to determine if there was a significent difference between our different test solutions. The statistical tests told us that there was no significent difference between any of groups except when comparing our C3 chloroplast solutions to the controlll.

Introduction:
There are three distinct photosynthetic pathways that plants can exhibit. The two more common pathways are known as the C3 pathway and the C4 pathway. The C3 pathway is what most plants follow and some claim that C3 plants make up 95% of plants [Furbank, R.T., Taylor, W.C.; 1995]. The primary difference between the two pathways is that C4 plants have two specialized types of chloroplast that are specifically organized and much of their photosynthetic process relies heavily on compartmentalization of activities [Furbank, R.T., Taylor, W.C.; 1995]. C4 plants also frequently exhibit a partial closure of their stomata which allow for them to better controlll their water loss. This means that C4 plants can more easily be successful in hot, open and dry or saline environments [Osborne, C.P., Sack, L.; 2012]. Another relevant difference between C3 and C4 plants is that on average, C4 plants have a lower density of chloroplast in their cells [Stata, M. et al.; 2016].
	The purpose of this lab was to isolate chloroplasts from each type of plant using centrifugal separation and then analyze how each type performed under moderately saline environments. Prior research has shown that single celled Bienertia sinuspersici, which undergo C4 photosynthesis, perform photosynthesis better under saline environments [Leisner, C.P. et al.; 2010]. Understanding the functionality of different plants in saline environments is becoming increasingly important as sea levels rise and freshwater becomes more of a scarce resource. We predict that if we expose individual chloroplast of a C4 plant to a saline environment, we will see similar success, and we will not see this level of improvement in C3 plants. If our results end up supporting our hypothesis, this study could really be significent because corn, our C4 plant, is easily one of the most important crops in the world and diversifying the conditions it is grown in would allow for wider spread cultivation.

Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, we first ground up each type of leaf with a mortar and pestle after removing major veins. We then filtered out major leaf chunks left and put the liquids in a centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes. Afterwards, we poured out the supernatants and put the solutions back in the centrifuge at 2800 rmp for 10 minutes. After finishing this, we collected the pellets (high chloroplast density) and diluted them with 20Ml of grinding buffer. We then set up and array of test tubes which included one controlll test tube of 6Ml of water and 2Ml of DCPIP and we also set up twelve other test tubes all with 2Ml of reaction buffer and DCPIP and then had two groups with 100 μl C4 or C3 plant chloroplast and within those groups we varied if they had 6Ml of water or 5% NaCl solution. The DCPIP we added starts out blue, but as photosynthesis occurs it becomes clear. This allowed us to use a spectrophotometer set to 600nm to measure the absorbance of our solutions and quantify the rate of photosynthesis. We then used a paired t_test to determine if there was a significent difference between our salt and no salt groups with the same type of chloroplast.

Results:
To start with, a very important finding we had early in this lab came from measuring the chloroplast density of each chloroplast solution. Our C3 chloroplast solution had a chloroplast density about three times that of our C4 chloroplast solution. After recording this and then running the absorbance part of the experiment, to determine if there was in fact a significent difference between our C3 plants in salt and in water and with our C4 plants in salt and in water, we used a paired t test. After running the test to compare the percent change in absorbance of the solutions with C3 chloroplast in salt versus those in water, a P-value of 0.1315 was given. The same was done for the C4 plants and a P-value of 0.7774 was given. Additionally, a paired t_test was done to compare the average percent change in absorbance of the C4 chloroplast against the percent change in absorbance of the chloroplast free solution and a P-value greater than 0.05 was given. A final paired t_test compared the C3 plants to our controlll and P-value of 0.0003 was given.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment leave it very difficult to make any conclusions about the effect of salt solutions on chloroplast activity. To start with, the paired t_test that compares our solutions with C4 chloroplast and the solution with no chloroplast tells us that there is no significent difference between the groups. This means that salt or no salt, the C4 chloroplasts were not photosynthesizing sufficiently to register any sort of significance. Additionally, the paired t_test that compared the solutions with C4 plants in salt and water also had a P-value that signified insignificent change. Because of these facts, it is impossible to extract any sort of significent information from the effect of saline solutions on C4 plants. However, while it may seem counterintuitive, the fact that there was no significent difference in the C3 chloroplast solutions helps explain the results. The salt solution should have caused reduced photosynthetic activity in the C3 plants, but that was not seen. This means that the most likely explanations for the inconclusive results is that the salt solution was not strong enough to cause a disturbance in photosynthetic activity.
	However, this leaves the question of the “non-functioning” C4 chloroplast unanswered. Like the salt problem there is a relatively simple explanation that relies on the nature on the C4 plants themselves. Remember that C4 plants have two types of chloroplast that are organized in a specific manor and that they in general have lower chloroplast density [Stata, M. et al.; 2016] [Furbank, R.T., Taylor, W.C.; 1995]. To prepare the samples, we took roughly equal masses of leaves for each type of plant and then ground them up. This means that from the start there was significently less C4 chloroplast and by disrupting the specialized organization, it only seems logical that we would see significently impaired photosynthetic levels when compared to the C3 plants.
	This study provides many outlets for possible future study. One good route to follow is to see just how high the salt level would need to be risen to really negatively affect photosynthesis. Results from that study would be extremely useful to the agricultural community because of how importance of C4 plants, like corn and soy beans. Additionally, it would be interesting to analyze the effects of CAM plants that follow an altogether different photosynthetic pathway.
