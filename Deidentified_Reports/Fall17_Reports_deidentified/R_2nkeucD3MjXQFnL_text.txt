Title: Temperature decreases rate of photosynthesis in *Brassica oleracea* kale 

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to understand the effects of varying temperature on the photosynthetic activity of *Brassica oleracea* kale chloroplasts.  Plants exposed to various temperatures other than their optimal operating level have shown decreased photosynthetic activity.  In order to test temperature effects on *Brassica oleracea* kale, the chloroplasts were enriched and then exposed to room temperature, cold temperature, and hot temperature for 30 minutes.  2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) was used as an electron acceptor to help monitor the photosynthetic rates.  It was hypothesized that the chloroplasts exposed to extreme temperatures would exhibit lower rates of photosynthesis when compared to the chloroplasts left at room temperature. The results of the experiment do support this hypothesis because the chloroplasts left at room temperature showed the steadiest decrease of absorbance which indicated more of the DCPIP was readily reduced over 30 minutes.  This shows that photosynthesis was highest in the room temperature chloroplasts.  However, an ANOVA test was run that found a p-value of 0.483 and Fs of 0.773 which explains how the results of the experiment were not statistically significant.


Introduction:
¬†Photosynthesis is understood to be an essential process that relies on external cofactors and is needed for plants, protists, and bacteria because it is the process by which these organisms store sun energy. This energy that is captured can then be used in other critical processes like glycolysis and respiration.
	Both respiration and photosynthesis rely on reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions. A redox reaction will ultimately lead to the transfer of electrons to an electron acceptor, thereby reducing the acceptor. An important electron acceptor in photosynthesis is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD+), but measuring the reduction of NAD+ is difficult. There are other electron acceptors used to observe photosynthesis. The Hill reaction is used to explain the general transfer of electrons to a chosen electron acceptor with the presence of active chloroplasts and light.
The chemical 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) is a known electron acceptor and has been utilized in various experiments that evaluate the system of photosynthesis. (Noorudeen, 1982)¬†Oxidized DCPIP absorbs light maximally at 600 nm. When DCPIP receives an electron, and is reduced, it changes from a dark blue color to colorless. Reduction of DCPIP can be evaluated by a decreased absorbance at 600 nm, and it can be modeled using the Hill reaction.  DCPIP was chosen to act as an electron acceptor in this lab so that photosynthetic rates could be evaluated for *Brassica oleracea* kale. Measuring absorbance over time intervals at different temperatures gives an idea of the reduction that occurred, which then communicates the amount of photosynthetic activity.
Evaluating the effects of different temperatures on photosynthesis in kale leaves is an important idea to explore because of the varying temperatures that is experienced due to the effects of global climate change.  Performing this experiment will widen the knowledge of effects of volatile temperature on plants.  Previous experiments involving other plants, like tomatoes, showed that unusually hot and cold temperatures decreased the level of photosynthetic activity. (Camejo, 2005) It was expected that in this experiment that focused on *Brassica oleracea* kale that if the chloroplasts were exposed to temperatures higher or lower than room temperature then the rate of photosynthesis would be lower than in the chloroplasts left at room temperature because the optimal working levels were not met.

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, the chloroplasts from the kale leaves were enriched. ¬†This was started by grounding clean kale leaves with a cold mortar and pestle and 10 mL of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine, which was denoted the grinding buffer. ¬†Once the kale leaves were ground and there were no large chunks, an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer was mixed into the kale that was ground. ¬†This mixture was then strained through a thick layer of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. ¬†
	The strained green liquid was spun at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm) in a centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4‚ÑÉ. ¬†The supernatant from this tube was poured into a different chilled tube carefully so that no debris was transferred.  This new tube was centrifuged at the same conditions for 10 minutes, and the liquid from the second tube was then used throughout the experiment. ¬†
	To induce both the cold and hot temperatures, five tubes were placed on an ice bath that was about 0‚ÑÉ and five tubes were placed in a hot water bath that was about 50‚ÑÉ. ¬†The control tubes and blank were kept out on the lab bench and exposed to room temperature.  The blank was prepared so that it contained 8 mL of water, 2 mL of 100 mM phosphate, which was denoted as the reaction buffer reaction buffer, and 100 mL of enriched chloroplasts. The remaining 15 tubes were prepared so that they contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 ùùÅM DCPIP solution, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 100 mL of enriched chloroplasts. The absorbance of each tube at 600 nm was found at the beginning using a spectrophotometer.
The blank and control tubes were placed in a rack on the lab bench, the cold temperature tubes were placed on an ice bath, and the warm temperature tubes were placed in a rack in a hot water bath. ¬†The absorbance for all tubes was found and recorded after 10 minute intervals for the next 30 minutes. 
A one-way ANOVA test was used to analyze if there was statistical significance between our groups exposed to differing temperatures. ¬†Specifically, it was a 1x3 test because it examined one factor over three varying levels.  A Tukey-Kramer test was also used to determine significance of results between the groups at different temperatures.


Results:
The data from this experiment shows that there was a fairly steady decrease in absorbance for the control and cold tubes. (Table 1) The percent change of absorbance over 30 minutes was high and positive for the control tubes, while the cold and hot tubes showed negative percent changes. (Table 2) Results were graphed along with their standard error for further analysis of the data. (Figures 1-3) Once an ANOVA test was run, the p-value of the results was found to be 0.483 with an Fs of 0.773. (Table 3) Additional results from a Tukey-Kramer test showed that the results between experimental groups were not significant. (Table 4)

Discussion:
The results from this experiment support the hypothesis that extreme temperatures would lead to a lower rate of photosynthesis in *Brassica oleracea* kale chloroplasts than those left at room temperature. ¬†This could be explained by the fact that the chloroplasts were not operating in their typical environment and photosynthesis was hindered by the new and stressful temperature.  Though photosynthesis needs cofactors like sunlight, it could also be hurt by random conditions and factors around it. Similar experiments that examine other plant species have had almost identical results, which might suggest this is a common phenomenon across various plants. (Camejo, 2005)
	This particular experiment showed that during the 30 minutes of experimentation, there was an overall high, positive average rate of change of absorbance for the chloroplasts kept at room temperature. (Table 2)¬†Since the rate of change was determined by subtracting the new absorbance from the previous absorbance measured and dividing this value by the previous absorbance, these results show that the absorbance was generally decreasing a consistent amount between time intervals. (Table 1) This aligns with the predicted outcome that more DCPIP would be reduced at room temperature and the absorbance would consistently decrease when compared to the absorbance at cold and hot temperatures.  There was one test tube placed in the ice bath that showed relatively high absorbance, so this tube was not considered in later calculations.
	The standard error was observed to be lowest for the control tubes while the hot tubes had significantly higher standard error. (Figures 1-3) This shows that the error of the results was fairly low for the control tubes and the error of the results for the hot tubes was fairly high.  The standard deviation, however, was lowest between the hot tubes (Table 1), which shows there was the least amount of deviation among the absorbance read for the hot tubes.
	The ANOVA test evaluated the data as being not statistically significant because of the high p-value of 0.483.  (Table 3) A p-value higher than 0.05 is accepted to be insignificant.  Also, a Tukey-Kramer test showed that when the 3 temperature groups were compared, they were not significant. 
	Modification of this procedure could lead to more accurate results. ¬†For instance, testing with the same hypothesis but increasing the number of replicates could yield extremely reliable data. ¬†Additionally, testing with a greater array of temperatures would allow stronger conclusions to be made from the results. A future experiment might test the same hypothesis, but include 10 replicates per temperature and include 7 different temperatures instead of 3.
	This is a useful experiment to perform because it can help farmers understand the optimal growing conditions for crops, and it also serves as a model for the effects of global climate change on the environment. Global climate change is an important issue that requires further studying in order to fully understand its effects. (Davison, 1991)¬†Experiments such as this one contribute to a better conceptualization of the harm of global climate change on photosynthetic rate of plants, as well as other studies which focus on other factors effected by varying temperatures of plant chloroplasts.
