Title: Studying Pisum sativum: The Effect of Herbivory on Field Peas

Abstract:
Herbivory is important to research for conservation efforts. A hole punch was used to simulate herbivory acting on the plant Pisum sativum (field peas). One hole was placed in each of the leaves. Variables included the length and weight of the roots and shoots. The root to shoot ratio for length and weight was calculated. If field peas are hole punched to simulate herbivory, then the root to shoot ratio for height and weight will decrease as a result. The results demonstrated that there was a decrease in the root to shoot ratio for height and weight. This study reveals insights about the co-evolution of plants and animals and is important for the conservation of the field pea, an important agricultural resource. 


Introduction:
The co-evolution of plants and animals have been occurring for more than 350 million years and studying their defense mechanisms are crucial to understanding our world (War et al 2012). Herbivory, the consumption of plants by animals, is a key component to understanding how energy and resources are allocated in plant species (Stevens 2010). Herbivory compromises plants’ ability to produce offspring from lack of energy; therefore, natural selection has favored tolerance and/or defense mechanisms to combat herbivory. Over time natural selection has favored animals to overcome plants’ resistance and in return plants continue to develop new forms of defense (Mortensen 2013). The herbivory of plants is crucial to understanding the coevolution of plants and animals. Not only does this relationship reveal patterns about animal behavior, it also shows how plants respond to stressful situations.

Field peas are frequently used for consumption and are often used as a livestock feed since they contain high levels of protein and carbohydrates (North Dakota State University 2009). The herbivory of field peas was simulated using a hole punch. The question, “how does herbivory behavior affect the root to shoot ratio for length and weight among field peas” was asked to prompt this experiment. The goal of this experiment is to measure the root shoot ratio of weight and length after the herbivore interacts with the field peas. If field peas are hole punched to simulate herbivory, then the root to shoot ratio for height and weight will decrease as a result. 


Materials and Methods:
Field pea seeds were gathered from the Wake Forest Science Department and planted in six different bins containing soil and Miracle Gro nutrients to help growth. About 50 seeds were placed in each bin to ensure variety when choosing plants to measure after the experiment. The planted seeds were Three bins were allocated to the experimental treatment of herbivory and the other three were allocated as the control group and had no herbivory. The field peas grew for 12 days before hole punching to simulate herbivory. The three experimental bins of field peas had a hole punch placed in each leaf. The three control bins of field peas were left alone. All of the plants were watered every other day leading up to data collection day. On the 14th day of growth, giving the field peas 2 days of growth with the hole punches, the root to shoot ratio was recorded. Fig. 3. shows the field peas before herbivory.  

The root to shoot ratio for length and weight were calculated. Three individual field pea plants with two leaves were chosen from each bin. There was a total of 18 replicates recorded - 9 from the experimental group and 9 from the control group. Each replicate was rinsed with water and dried to ensure accurate weight recordings. To calculate the root to shoot ratio for length, a ruler was used to measure the distance from the end of the root to the beginning of the shoot. The distance between the beginning of the shoot to the end of the leaves was also calculated. 

To calculate the root to shoot ratio for weight, a digital scale was used to measure the weight of the entire plant. After this measurement was taken, a pair of scissors was used to cut the root from the shoot. The replicate was cut right when the shoot began to form the root. This was held constant for each individual plant. 

A one-tailed, two-sample t-test was used to analyze the data since we are comparing the means from the control and experimental groups of field peas. 


Results:
The root to shoot weight ratio of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group’s root to shoot weight ratio (t-stat = 2.05, df = 16, P = 0.0283). The average root to shoot weight ratio for the control group was 0.229 and the average root to shoot weight ratio for the experimental group was 0.141. 

The root to shoot length ratio of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group’s root to shoot length ratio (t-stat = 2.54, df - 16, P = 0.0108). The average root to shoot length ratio for the control group was 0.441 and the average root to shoot length ratio for the experimental group was 0.270. 


Discussion:
Since both of the P values were less than 0.05 for both groups of data, we can reject the null hypothesis that there would be an increase in the root to shoot height/weight ratio. As represented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, there is an overall decrease in the root to shoot ratios for height and weight from the control to the experimental groups; therefore, our results support our hypothesis that herbivory would decrease the root to shoot ratio for height and weight among field peas. 

These results are most likely due to the negative effects of herbivory on the plant. In response to herbivores, it is common for plants to decrease their apparency and decrease growth and surface area (Mortensen 2013). This could explain the root to shoot ratio decrease in length. 

The root to shoot decrease in weight can be described by an obvious phenomenon: we hole punched the field pea leaves, so it makes sense that the root to shoot weight ratio decreased since the replicates are losing mass. On the other hand, this could also be due to the fact that it is common for field peas to have shallow roots. This is true since through history, field peas have been selected to be a rotational crop and as such, need to have more shallow roots (North Dakota State University 2009). 

A potential source of error in this experiment could have been that we watered the plants at different times or watered each time with different amount of waters. Another source of error could have been that there was leftover soil on the replicates. This could have delivered inaccurate data. A way to make this experiment better would be to hole punch the leaves earlier than 2 days before measuring the root to shoot ratios. This could give us even more accurate results. In addition, it would have been beneficial to use a plant with perhaps a larger leaf surface area so that we could add more hole punches. 

To take our research to the next level, we can study the chemical compounds released when a herbivore attacks that a plant uses to deter attackers. It is common for plants to have defense mechanisms and induced resistance to deter predators. In a study conducted by War et al., they research the defense mechanisms of herbivores and they illustrate the common chemical compounds released when a plant is being eaten (War et al. 2012). This study would be beneficial to consult if conducting another experiment concerning the chemical makeup of plants and how that impacts the co-evolution of plants and animals.

Field peas are a major source of consumption for livestock and must be learned about to maximize their potential benefits. Ultimately, studying plants is critical to global conservation efforts. When scientists can understand the basic functions and relationships of plants and their environment, we can make well-informed decisions about how we are impacting the future generations of plants and animals.
