Title: Specific metabolic rate of freshwater crayfish (Procambris spp.) in salt water versus fresh water

Abstract:
Specific metabolic rate refers to the amount of energy consumed by an organism at a given time, and can be determined in heterotrophs by measuring oxygen consumption, as oxygen is crucial to energy production within the body. 

Crayfish are freshwater heterotrophs that must constantly excrete ions from their internal environments, to maintain homeostasis. This process requires energy and is therefore linked to metabolism. We hypothesized that a crayfish’s specific metabolic rate will increase when salt is added to their environment. 

We tested this hypothesis using the crayfish species Procambris spp., and our hypothesis was not supported, as our results were not statistically significent (p_value = 0.15). It is suggested that more studies on this topic be done using other sizes and species of crayfish, along with higher salinity levels and other freshwater-dwelling animals. Hopefully, with further experimenting, we will better understand how pollution of our waters affects the organisms that live in them.


Introduction:
Metabolism refers to the process of energy consumption within an organism, and is crucial for carrying out functions that keep an organism alive and thriving. Specific metabolic rate refers to the amount of energy used by an organism at a given point in time, and can be determined in heterotrophs by measuring oxygen consumption, since oxygen is needed for metabolism [Johnson: 2017]. 

In eukaryotic animals, individual cells use oxygen to create and expend energy via cellular respiration. Oxygen is required to oxidize the pyruvate molecules made from the initial step of glycolysis (which is the breakdown of ingested glucose into pyruvate). After pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle follows, completing the oxidation of pyruvate. Then finally ATP synthesis takes place. ATP synthesis uses the process of oxidative phosphorylation, which is the addition of a phosphate to ADP to make ATP in the presence of oxygen. These ATP molecules are used as energy sources for important processes throughout the body, and thus drive the metabolism of an organism. Without oxygen, fermentation occurs in place of cellular respiration, which is not as efficient at making ATP molecules and therefore is cannot sustain the organism to the extent of respiration. Therefore, oxygen is a key component to ensuring that an organism has enough energy for consumption to function properly [Sadava: 2016].

Crayfish, or Procambris spp., are freshwater, heterotrophs. They are also ectotherms, which makes them good for testing effects on metabolism because it is easier to manipulate their internal environments [Johnson: 2017]. An important metabolic process for these animals is the excretion of ions, which maintains an ion concentration balance between their internal and external environments. The need for ion excretion arises from the inevitable flow of surrounding water containing dissolved ions into the organism. Therefore, a higher concentration of ions in the surrounding environment will increase a crayfish’s need for ion excretion.  

Energy consumption and oxygen consumption are both directly proportional to specific metabolic rate, which is directly proportional to the level of ion excretion [Johnson: 2017]. We hypothesize that the oxygen consumption, and therefore specific metabolic rate, of crayfish will increase in water containing dissolved salt, when compared to the specific metabolic rate of crayfish in fresh water. 


Materials and Method:
Materials

3 crayfish of roughly the same size were chosen; all of which were small enough to easily fit into the testing chamber. For testing, a large, jar-like chamber was used with an oxygen meter probe attached to a screw top. 100 milliliters of a 6.5% sodium chloride solution was added to 900 milliliters of oxygenated water for the treatment section, and fresh, oxygenated water was used for the controlll section. The testing chamber was placed in a larger, open container to prevent spills. A net was also used for easier handling of the crayfish. 

Method

Each crayfish was weighed before any testing began, and the testing chamber was filled completely to the top with fresh oxygenated water. Each crayfish was tested one at a time in the chamber, which was completely closed, and the oxygen levels in the chamber were recorded every 5 minutes (including the start and end times) for 20 minutes. Then, this same procedure was repeated with each crayfish from the same sample in salt water. The water temperature was maintained at 22 Celsius. 

A paired, two-sample t_test was used to interpret the data. 


Results:
The p_value for the data is roughly 0.15, the degree of freedom is 4, and the t-value is roughly 1.76. The average specific metabolic rates for the controlll and treatment groups are roughly 0.0018 mgO2 / gmin and 0.0025 mgO2 / gmin respectively (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the controlll group is approximately 0.00064, and the standard deviation for the treatment group is approximately 0.00025. 

Generally, the specific metabolic rate of the treatment group was higher than that of the controlll group, with the exception of crayfish 1 (Figure 2).  


Discussion:
Based on the p_value of approximately 0.15, our results were not statistically significent and therefore do not support our hypothesis that the specific metabolic rate of a crayfish increases with higher salinity. In fact, crayfish 1 experienced a slight decrease in specific metabolic rate when salt was added. Other studies, such as one done by scientists at the University of Puget Sound on the osmoregulatory abilities of crayfish, suggest that certain species of crayfish may have a tolerance to lower levels of salinity [Melton: 2014], which could have been the case for crayfish 1 of our study. Perhaps we should have used a higher concentration of salinity in order to see more drastic results. 

On the other hand, crayfish 2 and 3 experienced a slight increase in specific metabolic rate in the salt environment. This occurrence is likely due to what was predicted in our hypothesis: that their metabolic processes had to increase in activity in order to allow for excretion of more ions. It would be appropriate to see only a slight increase in specific metabolic rate in these crayfish since we used a rather low concentration of saline solution [Johnson: 2017]. 

Further investigation into this concept is needed to determine whether or not ion concentration in water significently changes the specific metabolic rate in fish. If another study were to be done with crayfish, a larger sample would be needed to ensure stronger trends, along with more variation in crayfish size and species, to see if this phenomenon can be generalized to all crayfish. Furthermore, studies will need to be done on other fish as well, as it is important to see how ion concentration in water affects water-dwelling organisms as a whole. 

Studies such as the one conducted for this report could be important for understanding how pollution affects the inhabitants of bodies of water. If we have greater knowledge of how introducing certain substances to underwater animals’ environments affects their bodies, we can take more specific initiatives to prevent further pollution of the oceans, rivers and so on. We can also develop a better understanding of how certain water-dwelling animals may have evolved over time to adapt to the high levels of pollution. Overall, it is crucial that we take the steps necessary to prevent further damage of our world.
