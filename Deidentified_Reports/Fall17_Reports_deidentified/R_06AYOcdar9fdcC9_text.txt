Title: The Effect Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi has on the Root-to-shoot ratio of Mung beans

Abstract:
Plants have a way of allocating resources to certain parts of its anatomy that need the resources the most. In this experiment we will plant Vigna radiate (mungbeans) in six separate pots and half of the pots will contain arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and the other half will not. We will measure the masses and lengths of the roots and shoots to calculate the root to shoot ratio. Our studies found that the mungbeans with the fungi in the soil has a lower root to shoot ratio because they were able to allocate more resources to the shoots because the fungi helped them obtain nutrients more easily in the soil. The symbiotic relationship between the fungi and the mungbean plants helped the plants allocate their resources. 


Introduction:
Plants respond to their environment through resource allocation. Depending on the nutrient content in the soil plants will often either allocate more biomass to their root or shoot. If the soil is very nutrient rich then the plant allocates lass of its biomass to its roots, whereas if the soil is not as nutrient rich then it allocates more biomass to the roots so that it can reach as many nutrients as possible.  [Shujuan 2015] In the realm of plants, microbes often function symbiotically to provide nutrients to the plant. [Hashem 2016] These symbiotic relationships stem from the co-evolution between fungi and plants, as well as, how plants handle stress conditions. [Kumar 2015] There are many types of microbes living in the soil such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. These microbes function by helping the plant obtain essential nutrients and tolerate stress that might be in the soil or environment. [Hashem 2016] Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are very abundant and represent 5-10% of the soil biomass in the world. [Kumar 2015] Mycorrhizal fungi, specifically aids plant growth by changing the root system and helping with the acquisition of essential nutrients. Studies have shown that the presence of mycorrhizal bacteria increases the root and shoot growth therefore increasing the overall mass of the plant. [Hashem 2016] With the addition of mycorrhizal fungi to the soil the plants showed a significent increase in growth particularly in a longer shoot length than root length. This might have to do with how the plants allocates carbohydrates more to the shoot than the roots. Even with salinity stress in the soil the plants showed increase root and shoot mass with the introduction of the mycorrhizal fungi. [Kumar 2015] We used Vigna radiate commonly known as mungbeans in this experiment because they grew properly in the amount of time allotted and they are easy to measure and weigh. The presence of arbuscular fungi will affect the absorption of nutrients by the mung bean roots, and therefore the resource allocation to the roots will be affected and there will be a difference in the root:shoot ratio for those exposed to the fungi versus those not exposed to the fungi.

Materials and Method:
In order to test this hypothesis, we planted 50 mungbean seeds in six separate pots where three pots had 40 Ml concentration of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi while the other three pots just had normal soil. All six of the pots also had 50 Ml of miracle grow. All other variables remain constant such as the amount of water and sunlight. Once planted, the plants will grow for twenty-one days. After twenty-one days we separated the mungbeans plants and take the mass of five of the mungbean plants from each pot. We cut each plant where the root and shoot meet, then weight the mass of the shoot of each mungbean plant. Then we subtracted the each shoot mass from each of the respective total plant masses to calculate the root masses. We divided the root mass by the shoot mass to calculate the root to shoot ratio. We measured the length (mm) of each root and shoot with a ruler. Then we divided the root length by the shoot length. A two-sample t_test was used to compare the mean of the controlll group to the mean of the experimental group. The alternative hypothesis tested is two-tailed. 


Results:
The results of this experiment show a significent difference between the root to shoot rarios for mass and length. P=0.00016 for mass and p=0.02989 for length


Discussion:
The results did support our hypothesis. There is a clear difference between the root to shoot ratios of the plants with fungi versus the plants without it. This demonstrates that plants are able to allocate resources to where they are necessary depending on their environment. The  mungbean plants with fungi in the soil allowed more growth in their shoots than roots because the fungi helped them obtain nutrients from the soil so the plants did not need long and large roots. Whereas the plants with no fungi in the soil needed their roots to be longer so they could reach and obtain more nutrients in the soil. These findings show that the same plant in different environmental condition could have different morphological sizes. These results lead to the question of what other elements affect resource allocation in plants and to what extent. Root to shoot ratios seem like minor differences, but could this type of resource allocation lead to other findings of greater morphological change to the point where the species diverge and evolve.
