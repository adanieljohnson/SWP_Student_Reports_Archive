Title:  The Effect of Salinity on the Specific Metabolic Rate of the Procambarus spp.  

Abstract:
In this experiment, we wanted to find the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus spp.  under different treatments. We used salinity as our treatment and we wanted to know if the salt would cause an increase in the specific metabolic rate or not. We hypothesized that with a increased amount of salinity the specific metabolic rate would increase. We measured the oxygen concentrations over 20 minute periods and then calculated the specific metabolic rate from our findings.  The results showed that the presence of a salt caused an increase in specific metabolic rate but our results weren’t significant based on our p-value(0.168464). We concluded that salinity caused an increase in the crayfish’s specific metabolic rate. We also compared our experiment with a similar one studying the effects of the specific metabolic rate of euryhaline milkfish with increased concentrations of salt in the water. 


Introduction:
We used Procambarus spp.  because they are ectotherms which means the depend on external heat sources and their body temperature changes with environment. Crayfish regularly excrete ions from their systems into the water to maintain an ion concentration balance between their bodies and the water. This process of excretion is directly dependent on metabolic processes, so if the metabolic rate is lower, that means ions are being secreted in relatively small quantities.  The metabolic rate refers to the actual amount of energy being expended by all physiologic processes at any given time.  There is a constant flow of water and dissolved ions into a crayfish’s system, meaning that the crayfish is constantly having to release ions based directly on how much water ions in order to maintain equilibrium (Johnson:2017). One can measure metabolic rate by monitoring oxygen consumption, oxygen consumption is directly proportional to the energy expended. In a similar study of the euryhaline milkfish (Chanos chanos) they measured the oxygen consumption at different levels of salinity. Increased exposure to salinity can cause an increase in a freshwater fish’s metabolic rate and cause future adaption to the salinity in water (Swanson:1998) .We want to know how the increase of salinity will affect the metabolic rate in the crayfish. Increasing the salinity of the water will increase the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish compared to normal water.


Materials and Methods:
We used three small sized crayfish to measure the oxygen consumption at 18° C without and with a salt solution added.  First we weighed each crayfish individually. We began the measurements with the 18 °C with regular water. We placed the crayfish in the container filled with overflowing room temperature water and inserted the oxygen probe and closed the container. For 18°C temperature measurements, we placed the container with the crayfish in a tub with room temperature water. We took the baseline reading of the oxygen concentration and we recorded the oxygen concentration for 5 minute intervals. We removed the water from the container with the crayfish and measured the volume. We repeated these steps for our other two crayfish. We then used the same steps to measure our experimental group but we added a salt solution into the water container. We measured again using the 5 minute interval to collect data on oxygen consumption. We used our data to figure out the specific metabolic rate of each crayfish for the control and experimental group. 

Results:
	Our control group had specific metabolic rates at 0.00252486 for Control A, 0.0151386 for Control B, and 0.00132461 for Control C. The average of the control group was 0.001787777. Our experimental group’s specific metabolic rate averaged at 0.00245805. Experimental A’s metabolic rate was 0.00220925, Experimental B was 0.002706 , and Experimental C was 0.0024588. Our experimental group had higher metabolic rate than the control group.  Crayfish A was the only crayfish without an increase from the increase in salt in the water. Our p-value was 0.168464 and the t-value was 1.678943  with 4 degrees of freedom. The graph shows the average specific metabolic rates of the control and experimental groups. The graph shows an increase in the specific metabolic rate from the experimental group compared to the control group.


Discussion:
Based on the results in the paired t-test our results would be significant because our p-value was significant enough to prove our hypothesis The results did however prove that the specific metabolic rate would increase with an increase of salinity in the water. Our hypothesis was correct because salinity caused an increase in the specific metabolic rate in the crayfish. Crayfish A was the only one whose specific metabolic rate didn’t increase after the salt solution was added. All of our other experimental group crayfish experience an increase in metabolic rate after the salt solution was added in the water. The metabolic rate increased in the experimental group because adding a salt solution caused new salt ions to be presence and cause a change in the energy the crayfish would use under normal conditions. Stress created by the crayfish could’ve caused the specific metabolic rate to increase as well. In a similar experiment done by the Department of Biology at the University of California,the salinity in the water like experienced by the Chanos chanos whose metabolic rate increased because of energetic responses and physiological changes caused by the increased of salinity in their normal environment [Swanson:1998]. In our experiment we could’ve added different concentrations of salt into the water like they used for the Chanos chanos experiment. They used concentrations of 15% ], 35% , and 55% which seemed to produced more accurate measurements for their fish in the experimental groups. We could’ve experienced a possible error with our software or on the amount of the salt solution we added.

Graph #1 The graph shows the average specific metabolic rate of the control and experimental group with 3 crayfish. The control group is represented with the blue bar and the experimental group is represented with the red bar. The smaller line represents the standard deviation of both the control and experimental group. Our p-value was 0.168464 and the t-value was 1.678943  with 4 degrees of freedom.The experimental group had the largest increase based on the increase of salinity in the water.
