Title: How Salinity Affects the Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambarus Sp.

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to determine if 100ml of NaCl/900ml H2O salinity water causes a significant difference in the specific metabolic rate of Procambarus Sp. a freshwater crayfish. We hypothesized that the 100ml of NaCl/900ml H2O would cause a significant difference in the specific metabolic rate of the treatment groups of the crayfish. After performing a two-tailed paired statistical t-test, we determined that the difference was significant in the treatment and control groups of the crayfish because the p-value was 0.044699 which is lower than our alpha value 0.05, supporting our initial statistical alternate hypothesis. We believe that this may have occurred because it was easier for the crayfish to breathe in higher salinity water because it is more similar to the salinity of the environment it resides in, in its natural habitat.


Introduction:
An ectotherms’ metabolism is easily altered by their environment, in turn affecting their metabolic rates. For this experiment, we determined the relationship between salinity and metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. This crayfish was a useful model organism because they are small and easily handled in the lab. Also, because the crayfish are ectotherms, their metabolisms and metabolic rate are easily manipulated. In a study conducted by, Meade et al. (2002) there was no significant difference between metabolic rate and salinity when salinity was 0-30 ppm. When we developed our own experiment we used 100ml of NaCl/900ml H2O. We believe that because we will use a higher salinity there will be a difference in metabolic rate for Procambarus sp.

Materials and Methods:
To conduct this experiment, we began by preparing our control test of room temperature water. We began by filling our testing jar with room temperature water, then we scooped out Procambarus sp with a net, and weighed it on a scale. After taking note of the crayfish’s weight, we put the crayfish in the testing jar, screwed the cap on tightly and began testing the oxygen concentration. We tested the oxygen concentration every 5 minutes for 20 minutes and recorded the results. Next, we measured the volume of the water in the testing container by putting it into a 1000mL beaker. After emptying out the beaker, we started testing our treatment group. We did this by adding 900mL of room temperature water to the beaker and then 100mL of NaCl making a 6.5% concentration of NaCl. Next, we added the water to the jar that contained the crayfish, screwed the cap with the oxygen probe and began testing the oxygen concentration for every 5 minutes. We then recorded this data and repeated these same steps using two different crayfish that we nearly the same size as the first crayfish. After the experiment was over, we conducted a two-tailed paired t-test.


Results:
While conducting the experiment the crayfish didn’t seem to behave differently between treatment and control groups. In both cases, the crayfish were active and moving about at the same pace. Our results are displayed in figure 1, the three trials experimented were averaged for the treatment and control groups. The mean of the control group was 0.001508 with a standard deviation of =0.0000798011, and mean of the treatment was 0.00079 with a standard deviation of 0.00028363. The results from the two-tailed paired t statistical test were (t-stat= 4.569818, degrees of freedom=2, P-value= 0.044699).


Discussion:
Our alternate hypothesis was supported because there was a change in the specific metabolic rate in the control groups and treatment groups. Our statistical alternate hypothesis was also supported because our p-value was 0.044699 was less than our alpha value of 0.05 this means that our data had a great statistical difference. In the data, there was also a general trend that higher salinity resulted in a smaller metabolic rate.  We think that there is a decrease in metabolic rate as a result of salinity, because the crayfish may find it easier to breathe in higher salinity water because it is more similar to their natural environment. We also think that our study had different results than the one conducted by Meade et al. in 2002 because we used a higher salinity water than they used in their study. Overall, if I were to further this study I would test to see if there was a threshold to how much salinity is helpful in lowering the crayfish's specific metabolic rate. I also would test larger crayfish to observe if that would result in any differences in results.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 Displays the average Specific Metabolic Rate for the 3 control group Procambarus Sp. (before using NaCl water) and 3 treatment group Procambarus Sp. (after using NaCl water). The data represents the Specific Metabolic Rate of each crayfish and the error bars represent the standard deviations of the control and treatment groups, control=0.001508 with a standard deviation of =0.0000798011, and Treatment=0.00079 with a standard deviation of 0.00028363. The averaged specific metabolic rate has been rounded in order to be more easily read. The results from the two-tailed paired t statistical test were (t-stat= 4.569818, degrees of freedom=2, P-value= 0.044699.)
