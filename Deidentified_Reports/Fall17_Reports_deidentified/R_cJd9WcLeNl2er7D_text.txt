Title: Increased Rates of Photosynthesis in Low pH in Spinacia Oleracea Chloroplast Solutions

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of pH levels on the rate of photosynthesis in 
Spinacia oleraca (Spinach) leaves in acid rain using pH buffers of 4, 5.5 and 7. It was hypothesized that photosynthetic activity would decrease as the pH decreased due to a lack of functioning enzymes as the pH dropped. After creating spinach chloroplast and buffer solutions of different pH’s using a centrifuge, the solutions were allowed to incubate under light for thirty minutes, with the absorbance of the solutions being taken every ten minutes. The absorbances over time were assessed to evaluate the difference in rates of photosynthesis between test groups of different pH’s. Our initial hypothesis was rejected by the results, as the difference between the groups of pH 4 (strongly acidic) and 5.5 (acid rain) was found to have a p_value of 0.077, and therefore was not statistically significent.


Introduction:
In every biological system, there are specific environmental conditions under which different processes and functions carry out best. Nature however does not always allow conditions that maximize the function of these systems, and for this reason there is constant fluctuation in how organisms operate and respond to their environment. Rain acidification is a current threat to many ecosystems around the world, as rain at pH 5.5 threatens to acidify various systems and destroy habitats (Kumaravelu and Ramanujam, pg 71.) Regarding photosynthesis in environments with lower pH rain, there are specific elements plants require from their surroundings, such as sunlight, water and carbon dioxide. The process of photosynthesis, run through light dependent and independent reactions, relies on the concentration of H+ protons to generate gradients from which energy can be derived. The proton concentration of a system is reflected in its pH, so a change in pH should have a direct effect on the process of photosynthesis. This experiment focuses on determining the relationship between photosynthesis and pH through measuring the absorbance levels over a thirty-minute period of three different spinach chloroplast solutions with three different pH buffers at pH 4, 5.5, and 7. Spinach leaves were used because they have a large surface area and amount of chloroplasts. It is predicted that if the pH drops too low, the rate of photosynthesis will decrease. Through measuring our dependent variable, absorbance, using our independent variables of time and pH level, the rate of photosynthesis can be assessed. It was found that the rate of photosynthesis increased as the pH level dropped. 


Materials and Method:
To make a chloroplast solution, six spinach leaves were ground using a mortar and pestle and 20Ml of cold grinding buffer. The mixture was then filtered through a cheesecloth, and 200 µL of the solution was transferred to a microtubule labeled “Sample A” and placed on ice. The rest of the solution was centrifuged at a spin of 200xG for 3 minutes at 4°C, in order to separate the chloroplasts within the solution. After being centrifuged, the mixture was placed into three separate centrifuge tubes, and 10 Ml of different pH buffers were added. A pH 4 buffer was added to tube A, a pH 5.5 buffer was added to tube B and a pH 7 buffer was added to tube C. The tubes were incubated for ten minutes and then centrifuged again at 1000xG for 10 minutes at 4°C. For the second exercise in which the absorbance of the solutions were measured, 13 tubes were prepared, with a tube to blank the spectrometer, a negative controlll that contained no chloroplasts, a positive controlll at pH 5.5, and then three tubes for each pH 4, 5.5, and 7. The three tubes for the three different pHs included the chloroplasts gained from centrifuging solutions A, B and C, a pH buffer, DCPIP, and water. They were added to cuvettes labeled #1-13 and their absorbances were measured. All tubes were placed under a light for ten minutes to incubate. Their absorbances were taken again, and this was repeated twice more for a total of thirty minutes of incubation time with absorbances taken every ten minutes.


Results:
Table 1. This table lists the values calculated from the paired t_tests for each set of data. This value compares the initial values of a set of data with the final values to see how they change over time. A P-value of 0.05 or less is considered statistically significent, so all three of these data sets are considered statistically significent. 

Figure 1. This data shows the change in absorbance over time in three different data sets, one set for each pH group (pH 4, 5.5, and 7). Each pH level, 4, 5.5, and 7, are shown in the blue, orange, and grey points and lines, respectively. The standard deviations for each data set are shown through the error bars. 

Figure 2. This graph shows the percent change of each of the pH groups over the entire thirty minute incubation period. It compares their original absorbance values to their absorbance values after thirty minutes, and the resulting percent change in absorbance is displayed above the bars of each pH group. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support our hypothesis. We hypothesized that a lower pH would decrease photosynthetic activity, but the pH 4 test group had the largest percent change in absorbance and had the lowest final absorbance. The more photosynthetically active a solution is, the lower its absorbance will be, so the test group with a pH of 4 had the highest photosynthetic rates (Figure 1). The test group with pH 5.5 had the next highest rate of photosynthetic activity, then the group with pH of 7. The p_value evaluated between groups of pH 4 and pH 5.5 was found to be 0.077, and therefore not statistically significent (Table 1). A similar study conducted by Dr. Dodd and Bidwell in 1971 which measured the number of carbons entering the glycolate pathway at different pH’s found results that supported our hypothesis, as more carbons entered the pathway at higher pH’s, generating higher levels of photosynthesis (Dodd and Bidwell, pg. 779). This shows that there is another factor our results did not consider, or there was an error in experimental design. Another study conducted by Dr. An Long, however, explains our results in context of the pH scale. This study focused on the effects of pH on photosynthesis in citrus leaves, and it found that pH 4 had almost no effect on seed growth, while pH 2.5 inhibited seed growth (Long, pg 185). This finding shows that only incredibly low pH might have a drastic effect on photosynthetic rates, and that our experiment might have used pH levels that were too close to neutral to have an effect. Due to this, in the future this experiment would be improved if lower pH buffers were used to create a more drastic change in photosynthetic rates. This is supported by the fact that all of our rates between pH 4, 5.5, and 7 were very close, showing a small amount of difference between them (Figure 2). In terms of the outside world, a study conducted on the effects of acid rain on photosynthesis rates found that only at pH 2.5 were rates drastically changed—other pH levels gave inconsistent photosynthesis rates (Kumaravelu and Ramanujam, pg 71). Natural rain is usually around a pH of 5.5- 6 for comparison. This shows that while acid rain has the potential to damage various ecosystems, the level of damage can be inconsistent until it drops to an incredibly low pH. All in all, our hypothesis being proven wrong can be attributed to the fact that the pHs chosen were not low enough to give significent results, and instead allowed the chloroplasts in the spinach leaves to continue photosynthetic rates as normal. Our experiment still yielded data that proved to be important towards our understanding of how different pH levels affect photosynthesis.
