Title: The Effect of Lidocaine on Muscle Twitch Threshold in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker that can affect the muscle contraction of Rania pipiens. The gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve can be easily dissected to study the neuromuscular system. In addition, Rania pipiens do not yield to rigor mortis immediately following death, so the stimulation of a muscle contraction can still occur. The main objective of this study was to learn more about the neuromuscular system and explore how lidocaine affects muscle twitch threshold through direct stimulation to the sciatic nerve. If a frog leg is injected with lidocaine, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold will be higher compared to a frog leg that is not injected with lidocaine. First, muscle twitch threshold was determined, and then the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg was injected with roughly 0.2 Ml of lidocaine. Five minutes later, muscle twitch threshold was determined with the presence of lidocaine. Results showed that the mean voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold was not statistically, significently greater after the injection of lidocaine. While lidocaine did not have a significent effect on muscle twitch threshold, it does significently weaken the strength of contraction.


Introduction:
The following experiment examines the neuromuscular system of Rania pipiens. Known as the Northern Leopard Frog, this organism ranges from 5 to 11 centimeters and can be found across the United States (Dodd: 2013). Rania pipiens are an example of Krogh’s principle for studying the neuromuscular system because of the relationship between its gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve. Unlike other organisms, the frog’s muscle does not yield to rigor mortis immediately following death. This is important for studying the neuromuscular system of Rania pipiens because it allows the muscle to contract after death if a stimulus is applied (Sadava: 2016). The gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens is a skeletal muscle responsible for all voluntary movements (Sadava: 2016). The muscle is made up of hundreds to thousands of multinucleate muscle fibers (Johnson: 2017). Within each muscle fiber, there are bundles of myofibrils containing highly ordered groupings of thin actin and thick myosin filaments (Sadava: 2016). The sciatic nerve in Rania pipiens is a motor neuron that innervates the gastrocnemus muscle (Johnson: 2017). The sciatic nerve stimulates muscle contraction in a process called excitation-contraction coupling (Johnson: 2017). 
	
To begin, an action potential travels down the motor neuron where it eventually arrives at the neuromuscular junction (Sadava: 2016). The depolarization of the neuron stimulates the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve membrane (Sadava: 2016). Then, ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft where it binds to receptors on the membrane of the muscle fiber (Sadava: 2016). The opening of sodium channels produces an action potential in the muscle fiber, and the spreading of the action potential down the T-tubule system results in the conformational change in the DHP and ryanodine receptor (Sadava: 2016). This releases Ca²⁺ into the sarcoplasm where it binds to troponin, exposing the myosin-actin binding sites (Sadava: 2016). The binding leads to a chain of reactions that stimulates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber (Sadava: 2016). If Ca²⁺ is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle will relax (Sadava: 2016). 
	
A myogram is a graphic representation that monitors the different stages of a single muscle contraction, also known as a twitch (Johnson: 2017). There are three phases of the muscle twitch that display on the myogram: a latent period, the contraction phase, and the relaxation phase (Johnson: 2017). The latent period is the time between stimulation and the start of the muscle contraction (Johnson: 2017). Following, the contraction phase is the actual contraction of the muscle (Johnson: 2017). The relaxation phase begins when the muscle contraction has peaked, signifying the muscle is returning to its relaxed state (Johnson: 2017). 
	
Muscle contractions are affected by many physical and chemical factors. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals in your body (Lin: 2016). It is most commonly used to reduce pain or discomfort caused by skin irritations (Lin: 2016). More specifically, in frog legs it acts as a sodium channel blocker. This experiment explores how lidocaine affects muscle twitch threshold through direct stimulation to the sciatic nerve. The presence of lidocaine is the independent variable while the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold is the dependent variable. If a frog leg is injected with lidocaine, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold will be higher compared to a frog leg that is not injected with lidocaine. 

Materials and Method:
Obtain three, fresh Rania pipiens frog legs and place in a dissecting pan. Ensure to wear gloves at all times when handling the frog legs. Remove the skin by grasping it at the top of the leg and pulling it down towards the foot. Occasionally moisten the frog leg with frog Ringer’s solution to prevent it from drying. Separate the inner thigh muscles to reveal the white sciatic nerve. A dissecting probe can be used, but do not allow the metal to touch the nerve. Carefully free the nerve from its connective tissue and moisten the exposed tissue with frog Ringer’s solution. Detach the gastrocnemus muscle and tie a piece of string to the muscle. The string should be long enough so the muscle can suspend from the force transducer, but there should also be tension. Attach the proper probes to the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle.

In Labscribe, set the following stimulus parameters: pulse amplitude to 0.000 V, the number of pulses to 1, the frequency to 1, and the pulse width to 5 ms. Connect the sleeve electrodes of the BNC connector to the BNC-banana adapter on the stimulator output. Type and apply 0.000 V in the box labelled “Mark” and click record to stimulate the gastrocnemus muscle. Apply a light load to the muscle by raising the force transducer with the tension adjuster until the trace moves a few mV above the baseline. Once a light load is applied to the muscle, click “Stop”. Change the stimulus amplitude to 0.1 V and type 0.1 V in the box labeled “Mark”. Press “Apply” and record to stimulate the muscle through stimulation to the sciatic nerve. Stop the recording as soon as the muscle twitch is finished, or a couple of seconds if no twitch is detected. Determine the muscle twitch threshold through nerve stimulation by increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1 V increments. When threshold voltage is determined, change the stimulus amplitude to the threshold voltage and the number of pules to 5. In the “Mark” box type the threshold voltage and 5 P and click “Apply”. Start recording and stop after the fifth muscle twitch. 

Create a solution of 25mM lidocaine by dissolving 0.6 g of lidocaine in 100Ml of Ringer’s solution. With a syringe, inject roughly 0.2 Ml of lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle. Wait 5 minutes and repeat the exact steps in the paragraph above to determine twitch threshold voltage. Repeat the experiment with the other Rania pipiens frog legs. Dispose of the syringes in the specified containers, not in the general trash. Clean and sanitize the working station and properly dispose of the frog legs. 

The results were analyzed with a two-sample t_test. The statistical test will be paired. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean.


Results:
In Frog Leg 1 and Frog Leg 3, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold was higher after the injection of lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle. For Frog Leg 2, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold was the same. On average the muscle twitch threshold was higher after the injection of lidocaine (Figure 1). However, there was not a statistically significent difference. The paired, two-sample t_test showed a corresponding P-value of 0.183503, a resulting t_statistic of 2.0, and the degrees of freedom was 2.0. 

For Frog Leg 1, Frog Leg 2, and Frog Leg 3, the voltage out at muscle twitch threshold was higher before the injection of lidocaine into the muscle (Figure 2). Furthermore, the voltage out at twitch threshold was similar when recorded at 1 pulse and 5 pulses. The average difference at 1 pulse compared to 5 pulses was -.018166667. 

Discussion:
To restate the hypothesis, if a frog leg is injected with lidocaine, the voltage to produce muscle twitch threshold will be higher compared to a frog leg that is not injected with lidocaine. Based on the results of the paired, two-sample t_test, the findings do not support the hypothesis. While two out of the three frog legs showed an increase in muscle twitch threshold after the injection of lidocaine, it was not statistically significent (p = 0.183503). In Frog Leg 2 the twitch threshold was the same, but the voltage out was 0.005. The muscle twitch was so weak that it was not visible to the naked eye, but it appeared on the myogram so we still had to record it. Even when the stimulus amplitude was altered above twitch threshold, the voltage out was miniscule as well. Since lidocaine serves as a sodium channel blocker, it is possible that it is harder for action potentials to arise. When acetylcholine binds to receptors on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber, Na+ would not be able to diffuse into the motor end plate (Sadava: 2016). Therefore, the muscle fiber would have difficulty depolarizing enough to result in an action potential. However, even with the presence of lidocaine, an action potential could arise if not all Na+ channels are blocked by lidocaine. Due to the mechanism that an action potential is an all-or-none event, if the motor end plate is slightly depolarized, positive feedback with voltage gated Na+ channels ensures that an action potential always reaches its maximum value (Sadava-2016). 
	
It is possible that the lidocaine leaked out of the gastrocnemus muscle after the injection. We observed this in Frog Leg 1, and the voltage out at muscle twitch threshold was significently higher than in Frog Leg 2 and Frog Leg 3. If all Na+ channels in the gastrocnemus muscle were blocked, then the muscle would not have contracted or it would require a higher stimulus amplitude to generate a twitch. Another source of error could be the time that we waited to measure twitch threshold after the injection of lidocaine. We waited 5 minutes, but it could be possible that the lidocaine did not fully kick in until later. Lastly, the fact that we had three different frog legs of different size led to variation in our results. While they did not have major differences in size, some produced a voltage out that was stronger than others.
	
It was interesting to note that lidocaine did have a significent effect on the voltage out, which corresponds to the strength of the contractions. At twitch threshold, the voltage out was significently lower after the injection of lidocaine. This shows that lidocaine weakens the muscle contractions. Even as stimulus amplitude was increased in 0.1 increments all the way to 0.5 V, the voltage out stayed relatively constant. This led to the conclusion that since lidocaine is a local anesthetic it weakens the strength of muscle contraction. 
	
Going forward, the experiment could have been performed with more frog legs, giving us a wider variety of results. This could have allowed for the statistical test to show statistically significent results. In addition, we could have determined twitch threshold at different stimulus amplitude increments. Instead of 0.1 increments, we could have done 0.05 increments to give us even more varied results. Furthermore, the effects of lidocaine could have been studied on muscle tetany and muscle fatigue. Since the strength of the muscle contraction was weaker with the presence of lidocaine, it would be interesting to explore if the muscle would reach fatigue more rapidly.
