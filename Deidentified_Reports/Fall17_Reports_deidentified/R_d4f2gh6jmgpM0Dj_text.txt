Title:  The Effect of Temperature on the Specific Metabolic Rate in Crayfish

Abstract:
This study serves to investigate whether change in temperature has an effect on the specific metabolic rate in Procambris sp. We hypothesized that if we make the environment colder, the specific metabolic rate will be less than in the room temperature environment. We used three similar sized crayfish and placed them each in test chambers filled with the specific temperature water that we were testing. By measuring the amount of dissolved oxygen concentration we were then able to solve for the specific metabolic rate. Our results were not significently different due to the p_value of 0.969. The third organism yielded opposite results of the other two. Our hypothesis cannot be supported because not all of the test groups yielded the same results.   

Introduction:
During aerobic respiration, glucose is broken down into CO2 and releases many high energy electrons that are captures in the FAD and NAD proteins. These proteins transport the high energy electrons to the electron transport system that uses the energy from the electrons to convert ADP into ATP [Bio 114 Lab Manual, 2017]. In order to remove the electrons off the transport system, oxygen is required. This is important because the amount of oxygen consumed is directly proportional to the amount of energy expended, which is the specific metabolic rate. We want to know whether or not temperature will have an effect on the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. According to a classic experiment by Ege and Krogh they developed the concept of metabolic cold adaptation which suggested that the resting metabolic rates of polar fish would be raised in relation to the rates predicted by the extrapolation to polar temperatures of the resting metabolic rate of temperature water species. [Clarke, 1999]. We hypothesize that if we make the environment colder, the specific metabolic rate will be less than in the room temperature environment. 

Materials and Method:
We will use three similar sized Procambris sp. to carry out this experiment. We start with weighing the crayfish and filling the screw-top glass testing chamber with first room temperature water. We place the crayfish in the test chamber and screw the top on tightly to make sure no oxygen is getting in. The chamber is placed in a dishpan filled with room temperature water also. Insert the dissolved oxygen probe and turn on the instrument to begin recording the dissolved oxygen concentration. We take a baseline reading originally and then again every 5 minutes for 20 minutes. We poured the water from the test chamber into a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of water for the equation of specific metabolic rate which is SMR=  (∆O_2 (mg/L)x volume H_2 O(L))/(Time (⁡min )x weight (g))
Repeat on the same crayfish next with the cold water and then repeat everything for the other two crayfish. 


Results:
Due to the two tailed t test our results are not significently different because of the p_value of 0.969. The third organism yielded opposite results of the other two. 


Discussion:
Only our results for two out of the three crayfish supported our hypothesis, but since there was not unison we cannot say that our hypothesis was confirmed. For the first two tests the metabolic rates were lower in the cooler water than in the room temperature water, but opposite for the third test. It is interesting to note that initially the O2 usage of the crayfish in the ice water increased at the five-minute mark but decreased overall throughout the 20 minutes which is the final number we used in our calculations. Next time we do this experiment, we would want to use a larger sample size, test over a longer amount of time, and maintain the exact temperature of the colder water. We could explore the effect on metabolic rate when the water has high rates of salinity or carbonation. According to an article by Johnston and Dunn in what they call temperature fish, cold water temperatures either lead to dormancy or trigger homeostatic responses that serve to offset the effects of the lowered temperature.
