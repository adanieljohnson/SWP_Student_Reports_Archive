Title: Effects of salinity on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp.

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salinity on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. The hypothesis was that the specific metabolic rate would increase with salinization. Three different Procambris sp were used, each its own controlll and experimental group. The subjects were first placed in jars filled with room temperature water and their oxygen consumption measured at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes. They were then removed and placed in jars filled with water, into which 100Ml of 6.5% NaCl was added. Oxygen consumption measurements were taken at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes. The oxygen consumption is directly related to specific metabolic rate and was used to calculate the specific metabolic rate. The controlll and experimental specific metabolic rates were compared. For specimen one, the controlll specific metabolic rate was 0.00018 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.00057 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental. For the second specimen, the controlll specific metabolic rate was 0.00033 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.00031 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental. For the third specimen, the controlll specific metabolic rate was 0.00099 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.0017 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental. When comparing the three specimens together, the paired t_test 

Introduction:
This study examined the effects of salinity on the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. The Procambris genus includes many different species of crayfish, although the physiological mechanism involved in this study is the same throughout the genus. The Procambris sp typically lives in fresh-water environments and gets its oxygen from diffusion across the two sets of gills on its cephalothorax. In aquatic animals, substances other than oxygen diffuse across the gills, and create imbalances in the internal fluid of the organism. The organism must then exert metabolic energy to excrete or conserve water and salts in a process called osmoregulation (Sedava: 2016). The Procambris sp osmoregulates like most fresh water fish. Because the Procambris sp lives in freshwater, its internal fluid has a higher osmolarity, or higher concentration of solutes including salt, making it hypertonic to its environment. Due to this, water moves osmotically from the water to the Procambris sp and salts diffuse out of the Procambris sp and into the water. To maintain water-balance, the Procambris sp must keep salts in its internal fluids by actively transporting sodium and chloride ions into its internal fluid through pumps. This transportation requires energy in the form of ATP, therefore the Procambris sp is constantly expending energy to maintain water-balance (Sedava: 2016). In a high enough concentration, the addition of NaCl to the surrounding water environment of the Procambris sp will make the Procambris sp hypotonic to its environment and salt will diffuse into its internal fluids. As a result, the Procambris sp will have to actively transport the increased salt out of its internal fluid, expending energy. In a similar study using Procambris clarkii, it was confirmed that increased salinity increased the energy expenditure, and thus the specific metabolic rate of the specimen (Feng: 2009). We hypothesize that the introduction of NaCl to the surrounding environment of the Procambris sp will increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. 



Materials and Method:
For this study, we used three separate specimens of Procambris sp and each acted as its own controlll and experimental group. To measure the specific metabolic rate, this study used an apparatus that measured oxygen consumption, which directly proportional to specific metabolic rate. First, one Procambris sp was weighed and then placed into a jar containing room temperature (22C) water. The jar was then placed in a bath of room temperature water and the apparatus used to measure oxygen consumption was placed in the jar and the jar sealed. Measurements of oxygen consumption were recorded at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes and then the jar was removed from the water bath. The jar was then emptied and the volume of water in the jar was measured and recorded. Next, the crayfish was placed in the same jar, this time with room temperature water that had been salinized with 100Ml of 6.5% NaCl solute. The concentration of the salinized water varied per Procambris sp and can be found in the results section. The oxygen consumption apparatus was then placed into the jar and the jar sealed. Measurements of oxygen consumption were recorded at 0, 5, 10, and 15 minutes and then the jar was removed from the water bath. The jar was then emptied and the volume of the salinized water was measured and recorded. This same procedure, beginning with the placement of the Procambris sp in the jar, was repeated for the remaining two specimens. The collected data was then used to calculate the specific metabolic rate for each controlll and experimental using the following equation - [O2 (mg/L) x volume H2O (L)] / [Time (min.) x weight (g)]. A paired t_test was run on the data to determine statistical significance. 


Results:
Specimen 1: The specific metabolic rate for the controlll was 0.00018 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.00057 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental. 

Specimen 2: The specific metabolic rate for the controlll was 0.00033 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.00031 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental.

Specimen 3: The specific metabolic rate for the controlll was 0.00099 mg O2*g-1*min-1 compared to 0.0017 mg O2*g-1*min-1 for the experimental. 

The average specific metabolic rate for the controlll was lower than that of the experimental (average controlll = 0.0005 mg O2*g-1*min-1, average experimental = 0.00086 mg O2*g-1*min-1). The paired t_test yielded a value of p = 0.230. 


Discussion:
After conducting the physical section of the study and analyzing the results, our hypothesis was rejected; the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp did not increase with the addition of NaCl to the surrounding water. For the first and third specimen, the specific metabolic rate was higher for the experimental than the controlll. This was not the case with the second specimen. The paired t_test yielded a value of 0.230, which is not statically significent. There are limitations and possible errors in the study that are important to recognize. Human error may have accounted for inaccurate values of H2O volume measured from the jars, as spillage occurred when transferring water from the jar to a graduated cylinder. Although unlikely, the experimental specific metabolic rate for the second specimen being lower than the controlll could be accounted for by errors with the oxygen consumption apparatus or readings by the researchers.

There are many possible reasons as to why this study’s hypothesis was not supported by the results. Interestingly, a previous study conducted on red-claw crayfish found that salinity from 0-20ppt did not have a significently increase the specific metabolic rates (Meade: 2002). Because the concentration of our experimental solution was ___, it is reasonable to suggest that the concentration used in the study was not high enough high enough to increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. A similar study confirmed that at a 0-10ppt salinity range, the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris clarkii, a member of the species used in this study, did not increase significently (Meade: 2002). There are a few possible reasons as to why the specific metabolic rate did not change at the salinity of our study. One explanation is that the Procambris sp did not need to expend much more energy to retain its internal salts. This could have happened if the osmolality of the salinized water was a value higher than the osmolality of the Procambris’ sp internal fluid. If this value was close to the difference between osmolality of the Procambris sp and the osmolality of the water before the addition of NaCl, then the specimen would have to work just as hard to excrete the excess salt (experimental) as it would have to keep the salts in (controlll). Another study raises the important point that there are many other factors that could influence the rate of oxygen consumption and therefore the specific metabolic rate. If the Procambris sp was stressed or had some sort of nutritional deficit there is the possibility that it consumed more oxygen unrelated to the effects of salinity in its water. 

If this study was to be performed a second time, it would be beneficial to increase the concentration of NaCl in the solution. In addition, it would be necessary to use the same concentration of solution for each Procambris sp, as the concentrations varied slightly in this study. Additionally, one study found that beyond 10ppt of NaCl, the oxygen consumption rates of Procambris clarkii were highly variable (Meade: 2002). It would be interesting and valuable to increase the concentration and attempt to determine the specific ranges in which specific metabolic rate increases past 10ppt.
