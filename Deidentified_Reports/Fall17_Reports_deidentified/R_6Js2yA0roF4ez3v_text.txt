Title: Effects of acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (Sevin) on the amplitude and relaxation period of the Rana pipiens’ action potential using electrical stimuli, producing insignificant results

Abstract:
This experiment explores the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on the amplitude and relaxation period of the action potential of the Rana pipiens.  An IX-20 box is used to administer a shock to the dissected leg, held in place by a force stabilizer.  The leg is tested both with and without the presence of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AchE), Sevin.  It is hypothesized that the amplitude will increase in voltage and the relaxation period will be prolonged after administering the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Sevin, to the gastrocnemius of the organism.  Two paired T-tests are conducted, both returning statistically insignificant results, creating a need for more experimentation and data. 


Introduction:
Plants and animals are the organisms that dominate the Earth.  Plants accomplish all necessary tasks while staying rooted.  Animals have the capability to move to do this.  The skeletal system and muscles work together to accomplish this need.  This lab looks into how the muscle works to aid in movement.  The myofibril, a long cylindrical structure, is the most basic unit of a muscle cell.  When bundled together, multiple myofibrils create a muscle cell, containing multiple nuclei.  Bundles of muscle cells create the muscle itself, bound by connective tissue [Binder:1976].  Neurons that control muscles bind at the myofibers, a place known as the neuromuscular junction.  The neuron extends all the way back to the spinal cord, specifically the grey matter, to relay information [Johnson:2016].

The neuromuscular junction uses the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to communicate between neurons and muscle cells.  When an action potential depolarizes the axon terminal of the neuron, voltage gated calcium ion channels are opened, allowing calcium ion into the cell.  This influx causes acetylcholine, already bound in presynaptic membrane vesicles, to re-bind with the presynaptic membrane and are released to the synapse.  In this way, the vesicles are recycled in the neuron. [Heuser:1973]  The acetylcholine neurotransmitters then bind to corresponding receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, initiating the opening of sodium ion channels, depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane and further continuing the action potential into the muscle.  

Also in the neuromuscular junction is an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase.  Its job is to break acetylcholine off from its receptor, break it into two parts, and return it to the presynaptic membrane to be taken up and reused.  With the help of acetylcholine, an action potential is fired, which creates a muscle twitch.  The muscle twitch has three parts; the latent, contractile, and relaxation period.  The latent period is the time between the stimulus and the reaction of the cell.  The contractile period occurs when the muscle contracts.  The relaxation period is the repolarization process when the muscle cell relaxes and comes down to resting potential voltage, -60mV.  

In order to study the muscular twitch, the Rana pipiens will be used.  It serves as a model organism because of its size, large enough to see results yet small enough to be easily handled in a laboratory.  Frogs also have well developed leg muscles, allowing them to jump high and far.  Additionally, the neuromuscular junction of this organism is similar to that of a human.  Acetylcholinesterase is concentrated at the neuromuscular junctions [Anglister:1994].  This experiment introduces an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, the independent variable, Sevin, to test the effects on the amplitude and relaxation period of the action potential.  The dependent variables are the amplitude and relaxation period of the action potential.  Without active acetylcholinesterase, the acetylcholine will stay attached to the postsynaptic membrane, allowing sodium ion channels to remain open, prolonging the total time of the action potential.  It is hypothesized that the Sevin will cause an increase in amplitude of the action potential, as well as increase the length of the relaxation period, the dependent variables. 


Materials and Methods:
1. Collect 3 frog legs.  Skin the legs, expose the sciatic nerve, sever the gastrocnemius and tie so that it hangs perpendicularly above the rest of the leg, using string and a pair of scissors.  
2. Use the force transducer to create tension in the leg.  
3. Periodically drip Frog Ringer’s solution onto the leg to keep the muscle moist.  
4. Use the computer program LabScribe to record electrical activity.
5. Use a sleeve electrode to clamp the sciatic nerve, attaching it to the recording device that measures electrical activity, which displays the data on LabScribe. 
6. Determine a threshold for the frog leg.  This will be repeated on each new leg.
7. Use the voltage determined from the threshold to administer 5 single electrical impulses to the leg, waiting approximately 3 minutes between trials.  
8. Record the amplitude and relaxation period of each trial.
9. Administer 0.1mL of 2% concentration of Sevin to the frog leg using a needle.  Administer half the dose in the top of the gastrocnemius and the other half in the bottom half of the muscle.  
10. Wait 3 minutes to allow the chemical to take effect. 
11. Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the newly injected leg.  
12. Once the control and experimental trials for one leg have been completed, repeat steps 4-10 on the two remaining legs.  
13. Conduct a paired T-test for the amplitude and relaxation period dependent variables.  For each test, compare the data from each leg before the administration of Sevin to the data after the administration. 


Results:
Generally, the amplitude of the action potentials post injection of Sevin were smaller in magnitude than the control group’s (t-value=2.117343, df=2, P=0.168431).  This is shown graphically in Figure 1 by each orange bar being lower than the corresponding blue bar. .  The magnitude of each frog leg’s action potential was between 0.034 and 0.352 millivolts.  The bars represent the standard deviation.  More trials are needed to improve accuracy of the standard deviation. 

There was no recorded trend among trials testing the relaxation period when the paired T-test was run (t-value=0.245509, df=2, P=0.828957).  As shown in Figure 2, the relaxation period of either the control or experimental trials is not consistently longer or shorter than the other.  The relaxation period of the frog leg’s gastrocnemius ranged from 125 milliseconds to 213.4 milliseconds.  

It should be noted that the threshold not only changed from leg to leg, but also in between trials.  Leg 1 created an action potential at a threshold of 0.1mV, while leg 2 and 3 reached threshold at 0.2mV.  While testing the amplitude with a Sevin injection, the frog leg became unresponsive after trial 3.  Trial 4 was continued when a new threshold of 0.3 was established.  


Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis that the amplitude and relaxation period will increase in magnitude and time, respectively.  The P-values for each variable were 0.17 and 0.83, for amplitude and relaxation period. 

Human error greatly contributed to this experiment.  Measuring the relaxation period is subjective.  There is often not a clear line to when the end occurs, creating room for much human error to occur. 

When Sevin was administered, it interacted with the AchE inhibitor, causing changes in the data from the control trials, though did not support the hypothesis.  Very little research has been done to explore the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on action potentials.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are now being studied as possible medical breakthroughs. 

Drugs such as E2020 are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that are used to treat Alzheimer’s.  By removing the number of acetylcholinesterases in the synapse, more acetylcholine is able to bind with their receptors, delivering more messages, something that is inhibited in Alzheimer’s [Kawakami:1996].  It is known that with decreased activity of acetylcholine, the less active the memory and muscular function are [Fambrough:1973].  The role of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is only beginning to be explored.  

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are promising subjects to study.  Studying the frequency at which action potentials are fired before and after the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is a worthy future study.  As Fambrough discovered, the activity of acetylcholine is much more active when acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are functioning at high levels.  The smallest portions of the body make the largest differences in physiology, which is why acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are being studied so heavily by researchers.  While the data collected in this experiment did not support the hypothesis, a change in the data did occur, giving support to the notion that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors cause changes in the body and could possibly have a use in the medical field.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: A general trend of lower amplitude can be seen in the experimental group.  Although, the P-value indicates insignificant data and all conclusions are not reliable.  The blue bars represent the average of the control trials for each of the three legs.  The orange bars represent the average amplitude of the three Sevin treated legs.

Figure 2: No trend can be seen in the data due to errors in the experimental design as well as not enough trials. Standard deviation bars are also shown.
