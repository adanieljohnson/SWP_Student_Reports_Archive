Title: Induced Exercise Revealed No Effect on Specific Metabolic Rate of Procambris sp. 

Abstract:
This experiment investigated the effect of induced exercise on the specific metabolic rate of Procambris sp. The significance of this project resides in its ability to expand upon the findings found for the effect on exercise on the metabolic processes of organisms, and how to effectively utilize knowledge about these systems to invoke positive trends in the health of the general population, as well as developing a clearer idea on the specificities of the metabolic systems across varied species. To conduct this experiment, crayfish were exercised for 5-minutes and readings of the surrounding level of O2 in the water were taken at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes. These readings were then used to calculate the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish. It was hypothesized that the introduction of exercise would cause the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish to increase significently. The specific metabolic rate of the crayfish did not significently increase after introduction of exercise in the three trials, with the p value of the specific metabolic rates for all three trials being 0.569172. 

Introduction:
In order for living organisms to function properly and execute metabolic processes, there has to be an adequate source of energy, specifically adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The metabolic rates of all organisms are directly correlated with energy production and the utilization of ATP to power physiological processes. O2 and CO2 levels serve as indicators for ATP production. As glucose is converted into energy, the electron transport chain (ETC) is activated, releasing energy as each electron “jumps” to a subsequent section of the ETC. The energy released is then utilized to synthesize ATP. After the conversion, the amount of energy produced is directly proportional to the amount of O2 consumed [Johnson: 2016]. During exercise, O2 consumption increases, as the muscle tissues are expending energy at a much faster rate than when at rest [Adamczewska: 2001]. Studying the effect of exercise on crayfish is important because it can help us further our understanding of the link between exercise and oxygen consumption. This can help us better understand the difference in lifestyles of marine organisms through differentiation of activity and prediction of behavior of other organisms based on differing levels of O2 consumption. Biological research on the effect of exercise in organisms is important because it can help researchers further understand energy conversion within the body, and how the body adapts to exercise. While studying exercise, molecular biologists have discovered different signaling pathways that induce adaptive responses to physical activity. In an experiment conducted by Green, training resulted in adaptive changes in an organism’s metabolic pathway [Green: 1992].
In this experiment, the effect of exercise on the metabolic rates of Procambris sp. is closely examined. The Procambris sp. is a specific species of crayfish that belongs to the genus Procambris. These crayfish are model organisms for experimentation, as they are ectotherms, and thus, it is easy to manipulate their internal temperatures, providing a necessary constant for our experiment.  Also, crayfish are biologically very adaptable and can survive in most conditions, such as fluctuating salinity, temperature, and pH for an elongated period. Furthermore, the crayfish are of a decent size that enables for more precise biological analyses [Vogt: 2011].  According to an experiment conducted by Adamczewska, the heart rate of Christmas Island Red Crabs Gecarcoida doubled at the onset of exercise. As well, O2 delivery was increased, through increased extraction of O2 through the blood. These results indicate that there was an increase in O2 consumption, and thus, a subsequent increase in O2 production to continuously supply the crab with enough energy to perform the exercises. The source also mentions that maximal O2 consumption was achieved within the first 5 minutes of exercise [Adamczewska: 2001]. Both crayfish and crabs belong to the decapod crustaceans, revealing that both organisms exhibit similar characteristics and physiological processes [Vogt: 2011]. As both crabs and crayfish share similar processes and characteristics, it can be inferred that the effect of exercise on the Christmas Island Red Crabs will be indicative of the effect of exercise on the Procambris sp. Based on this research, we hypothesized that induced exercise would positively increase the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. 


Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, a small crayfish was weighed and then placed into a test chamber, filled with room temperature water (22°C) saturated with air. Once placed into the chamber, the test chamber itself was placed into a dishpan filled with room temperature water. The dissolved O2 probe was then inserted into the test chamber, and the O2 probe reader was turned on. Once the readings stabilized, a timer was started for 20 minutes. At 5-minute intervals, the O2 probe reader was consulted for O2 level readings. After 20 minutes had passed, the probe was removed from the test chamber and the crayfish was placed back into its tank. Using a funnel, the water that remained in the test chamber was then poured into a graduated cylinder, and the remaining volume was measured. Next, the same crayfish was placed into the dishpan filled with room temperature water. The crayfish was then exercised for 5 minutes, which consisted of the crayfish walking around the dishpan in response to being prompted by a red Sharpie marker. After 5 minutes, the crayfish was immediately placed into the test chamber, again filled with room temperature water, and the dissolved O2 probe was placed inside the test chamber. The O2 sensor was then turned on, and the readings were allowed to stabilize. Once stabilized, a timer was set for 20 minutes, and the O2 levels were documented at 5-minute intervals. After 20 minutes, the crayfish was placed back into its tank and the remaining volume of water was again measured using a graduated cylinder. Afterward, the rate of oxygen consumption was calculated using the equation for specific metabolic rate. 
Equation:
Specific Metabolic Rate =(∆O2(mg/L)*volume H2O(L))/(Time(min)*weight(g))


Results:
Trial 1 exhibited a lower specific metabolic rate (SMR), 0.0006376 mg O2*g-1*min-1, for the controlll group (pre-exercise) than the experimental group (post-exercise), 0.0007603 mg O2*g-1*min-1. In Trial 2, the experimental group exhibited a slightly higher SMR, 0.0007772 mg O2*g-1*min-1, as compared the SMR of the controlll group, 0.0007675 mg O2*g-1*min-1. Trial 3 depicted a different trend, as the SMR for the controlll group was higher than the experimental group, with the SMR being 0.0005423 mg O2*g-1*min-1 and 0.0005145 mg O2*g-1*min-1, respectively. The average SMR and standard deviation of all three trials for the controlll and experimental groups, was 0.000649133±1.13042E-07 mg O2*g-1*min-1 and 0.000684±1.47034E-07 mg O2*g-1*min-1, respectively  .  The p value was calculated to be 0.569172, and the tstat value was calculated to be 0.61943. The degrees of freedom was 2.  

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that induced exercise would yield a significent increase in the specific metabolic rate of the Procambris sp. was not supported by the statistical data gathered, thus failing to reject our null hypothesis that there would be no difference in the specific metabolic rate in response to induced exercise. There were no general trends, and the data gathered was insignificent. Though our primary literature discovered an increase in specific metabolic after induced exercise, the difference in organisms could have been a factor in our differing results. The specific crabs used within Adamczewska were Christmas Island Red Crabs, which undergo a long-distance migration that could have led to an adaptive change within the crabs’ metabolic systems; thus, resulting in an increased and more efficient specific metabolic rate, as discovered within Green’s experimental study. The Procambris sp. crayfish used within our experiment undergo no such migration, thus possibly inducing a smaller difference in specific metabolic rate after exercise. As well, we decided to exercise our crayfish for 5 minutes since our primary literature stated that this specific time interval induced an optimal rate of specific metabolic function. 
Regarding human error, there may have been inconsistency when exercising the crayfish, as our technique for exercising the crayfish differed based on how the crayfish was reacting to the red sharpie marker. Also, in our experiments, our crayfish were of varying weights, indicating that some may have needed a longer exercise period than others. There was also a difference in the behavior of the crayfish, as some were more active than others. 
To further this experiment, it would be beneficial to test our hypothesis by exercising the crayfish for a longer period of time, in order to see if a difference in specific metabolic rates would result. As mentioned earlier, the crayfish may be less adapted to exercise than the crabs, thus causing the crayfish to require a longer amount of time to increase specific metabolic rate. As well, it would be beneficial to choose crayfish that are similar in weight and activity level, in order to gain more consistent and valid results.  Lastly, it would be beneficial to test other method of exercising, such as placing multiple crayfish together to prompt movement, using a larger object, or creating a current to force the crayfish to either move against the current or swim along with the current. 
This experiment revealed that exercise does not have a profound effect on the specific metabolic rates of the Procambris sp. This concept is important to analyze, as it can help provide research on the metabolic processes of humans and animals alike, and it can help theories revolving around cardiovascular health and prolonged life. Generating more knowledge within this area can advance our knowledge of energy conservation within organisms, and how exercise can help predict the actions and lifestyles of different organisms. Furthermore, this research will help to advance our knowledge of the intricate innerworkings of the metabolic system and how it differs across species.
