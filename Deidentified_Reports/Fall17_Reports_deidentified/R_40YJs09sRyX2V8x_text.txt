Title: Effects of Light Wavelength on the Electron Transport Chain of Chloroplasts in Spinacia oleraca

Abstract:
We tested the effect of different wavelengths (ultraviolet light, blue light, green light, and visible light) on the electron transport chain in the chloroplasts of spinach leaves Spinacia oleraca. We proposed that visible light would excite the electrons the most in comparison to the other wavelengths and thus have the highest photosynthetic rate. We made an enriched chloroplast sample, used DCPIP as an artificial electron acceptor, and then conducted an assay on each different light group periodically in intervals of ten minutes for thirty minutes. We compared the results by calculating the percent change of absorbance from t=0 in relation to visible light. Blue light and green light had a significent difference in absorbance, whereas ultraviolet acted more closely to visible light with a decrease towards the end. The difference in absorbance was due to damage to photosystem II in the electron transport chain, causing an inefficient photosynthetic rate, thus supporting our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Plants undergo photosynthesis to synthesize energy from the sun into chemical energy from carbon dioxide and water. ATP is generated by reactions of photosynthesis which can be split into the light-dependent interactions and light-independent interactions. In this experiment, we focused on the light-dependent reactions in the chloroplasts of spinach leaves Spinacia oleraca. In the electron transport chain of photosynthesis, the passing of electrons creates a current that generates a proton gradient which drives ATP synthesis. [Kawashima et al: 2017] Various environmental conditions can limit the rate of photosynthesis, including the quality of light. Light is the driving force of photosynthesis – when the pigment molecules absorb light energy, electrons in the thylakoid membrane get excited and passed down the electron transport chain. In non-cyclic photophosphorylation, the process of synthesizing light to produce ATP, the absorption of light is required twice – once in photosystem I and the second in photosystem II. Experiments in the past have shown that plant type has a correlation to how chlorophyll pigments absorbs different wavelengths on the visible light spectrum. [Chappelle et al: 1987] We tested whether the quality of light has an impact on electron transfers in from PSII to PSI via light absorption. Due to the green pigment in chlorophyll, chloroplasts are expected to absorb all “non-green” wavelengths of light in the visible light spectrum, with green being around 500-550nm. In past experiments, ultraviolet light tested on plants was found to initially photosynthesize normally, but with prolonged exposure it would damage the cell. [DeLong et al: 1997]  The general process of electron transfer is called the Hill reaction, which measures the reduction of electron acceptors from water in the electron transport chain during the light-dependent reactions. [Johnson:2017] An artificial electron acceptor is used to test the Hill reaction, dye 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP). When DCPIP becomes reduced, it changes color going from blue to colorless, which makes it easy to test the rate of the Hill reaction in our isolated spinach chloroplasts. We hypothesized that green light would be absorbed the least by the chloroplasts, therefore having the least excited impact on the electrons, hereby having the slowest Hill reaction rate, that blue light was expected to have a higher absorbance due to its longer wavelength, yet still have a lower absorbance, and that UV light would all have a lower photosynthetic rate in chloroplasts than visible light. 

Materials and Method:
	To do this experiment, we first prepared a mortar and pestle, a medium sized beaker, and 3 50Ml centrifuge tubes into an ice bath. We then deveined 4 spinach leaves and added it into the mortar and pestle in which we grinded it with 10Ml of grinding buffer. We added another 10Ml of grinding buffer once spinach formed a thick paste. Then, we moved on to centrifuging the 200 μl of filtered liquid. We had to ensure that the centrifuge was balanced and then spun the first sample at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4° C. Then, we poured out the supernatant out of the first sample, without transferring any of the debris. We repeated the same process for the second sample, but we set the centrifuge to 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4° C. We poured the supernatant out of this sample, added 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet sample, suspended it, and then transferred 200 μl of the pellet sample. The sample with the pellet contains the highest density of chloroplasts and this was the sample we used to test our hypothesis.
        	We prepared 3 replicates of our testing groups with 4 samples in each: a group with no chloroplasts, a group containing chloroplasts and visible light, a group containing chloroplasts and black light, a group containing chloroplasts and blue light, a group containing chloroplasts and green light, and a blank sample. The blank sample contain 8 Ml of water, no DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). All other samples contained 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml of the reaction buffer. Then, we added 100 μl of the enriched chloroplast sample we isolated to the blank and sample test tubes and mixed. When ready to do the assay, we set the spectrophotometer to 600 nm and blanked it. We then tested the absorbances of each of our samples at time 0 and then placed each sample according under the light they were being tested. After 10 minutes, we tested the absorbances again, placed the samples under their according light wavelength and repeated the process again at 20 minutes. We repeated this process one more time and tested the absorbance of the samples at 30 minutes.
        	We calculated the percent change of the absorbance of each group over time to determine the Hill reaction rate and ultimately observing the rate of photosynthesis. We conducted a one paired t_test to determine if there was a significent difference (P < 0.05) in the rate of photosynthesis between different wavelengths of light.  

Results:
The chloroplasts exposed to visible light had a constant increase in absorption over time. The sample containing no chloroplasts stayed constant at t=0, showing that no absorption happened. After exposing the spinach chloroplasts to UV light, there was an increase from t=0 until t=20,  and then a steady decrease in absorption in comparison to the visible light (p=0.1048). There was a slower, but steady increase in the chloroplast’s absorption of the blue light (p=0.0355).  When exposed to green light, the chloroplasts minimally absorbed the light at a constant rate(p=0.0398). The sample containing no chloroplasts had no absorbance (p=0.037).


Discussion:
The rate of photosynthesis over time in the sample of chloroplasts increased the most rapidly in visible light,  lower under the ultraviolet light with a decline towards the end, and a lower rate in the chloroplast absorption exposed to blue light. The chloroplasts tested with green light had the least change in absorbance over time, thus little to no photosynthesis occurred. The increase in absorption over time with the visible light is expected, for that is the standard for plants to receive light energy to excite the electrons inside the thylakoid matrix to drive photosynthesis. We measured the light-dependent rates of electron transport in the membranes of chloroplast by observing the reduction of absorbance of DCPIP, and hereby, the reduction of the electron acceptor - exhibiting that the electron transport chain was actively running and photosynthesis was occurring. In a past study done on the effect of ultraviolet light done on the photosynthetic function of spinach leaves, the fluorescence of the absorbing chlorophyll pigments initially rise, but then over time the UV radiation inhibits photosystem II, which is indicated by a reduction in energy harvesting. [DeLong et al: 1997] This supports our results and hypothesis, as we found that that the absorbance over time with the UV/black-light increased similarly to visible light. The UV light imitates the electron excitement the same way visible light does initially, but then causes damage to Photosystem II which ultimately leads to the inefficiency of the electron transport chain to function and the chloroplast to photosynthesize. Thus, the ultimate inhibition of photosynthesis supports our alternate hypothesis. Normal levels of light on the visible light spectrum cause photoinhibition in plants, affecting the reaction centers in Photosystem I and Photosystem II. [Powless: 1984] Hereby, lamps stimulating sunlight, which contains wavelengths 400-700nm, can damage a plant’s photosystems if exposed to the light strongly. Blue light was found to have a significent difference in the change of absorbance over time than the absorbance found in visible light, showing that blue light (450-495nm) has a less functioning photosystem than visible light due to its lower absorbance and slower rate. Green light (495-570nm) was found to have an adverse effect on the photosynthetic rate of plants in comparison to other wavelengths on the visible spectrum due to the green pigment found in chlorophyll. In a past experiment researching the mechanisms underlying the “stop” mechanism of green light, it was found that green light inhibits FADH+, making it into an inactive form, causing the plant to not absorb any energy. Thus, the electrons in Photosystem II are not excited enough for the electron transport chain to occur efficiently due to the lack of energy in the system, ultimately leading to a lack in photosynthetic rate. [Folta et al: 2007] Furthermore, the electrons in spinach chloroplasts are excited less when exposed to ultraviolet light, blue light, and green light in comparison to visible light, thus causing a reduction in its photosynthetic rate and supporting our alternate hypothesis. Ultraviolet light and blue light are often found hand in hand in the environment. As the air is continuously becoming more polluted, it is getting harder to filter out the radiation posed on plants. [Zheng et al:2008] Future research can be done on observing the mechanisms underlying blue light and ultraviolet pathways to find how they interact with each other under various conditions (stress, light intensity and exposure) in relation to photosynthetic rate.
