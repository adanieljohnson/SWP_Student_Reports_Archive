Title: Insignificant effects of inhibition of calcium channels on growth and cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
In this experiment we aim to test the different reactions Physarum polycephalum has when two distinct calcium channels are inhibited. We hypothesized that by inhibiting both separately, the slime mold would produce different reaction mechanisms in the form of slower cytoplasmic streaming and less growth. To inhibit IP3 activated calcium channels we used lanthanum trichloride and for 〖Ca〗^(2+) activated calcium channels sodium butyrate was used. After leaving the prepared plates in an incubator overnight we found that there is no significant difference in how the Physarum reacted to the individual solutions. 

Introduction:
Our goal in this experiment is to determine if the inhibition of IP3 activated calcium pathways or 〖Ca〗^(2+) activated calcium pathways would affect cytoplasmic streaming and growth more. We hypothesized that the inhibition of either calcium pathway would produce different results in amount of growth and rate of streaming. Furthermore, as a secondary biological question, we were curious to see if cytoplasmic streaming and growth were linked in anyway. According to a study done in 2013, streaming acts as a determinant for growth, so we expect to see the greatest amount of growth in the samples with the highest streaming rate [Tominaga: 2013]. The subject of our experiment is Physarum polycephalum. This slime mold is a commonly used test subject due to its ease of growth in culture and above-average growth rates [Britannica: 2016]. The calcium in the Physarum is used in streaming and growth because the elongation of shape is dependent on the contraction and pushing of the organism. The calcium, like in a contraction of a human muscle, is released through these channels we tested and creates an electrochemical gradient due to the high concentration of calcium ions outside of the cell, which in turn causes the water to diffuse leading to a contraction [Yoshiyama et al.: 2009]. Knowing this, we believed that the IP3 and 〖Ca〗^(2+) activated channels, although producing the same effect of releasing calcium, would somehow create a different reaction among the organism, simply based on the notion that there would be only one type of channel if the two had the same effect.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, 9 water agar plates were needed. These 9 plates were divided into three separate groups being the control, the IP3 inhibited sample, and the calcium inhibited sample. The control plates were left untreated, while the IP3 inhibited plates were treated with 5 mL lanthanum trichloride and the calcium plates were treated with sodium butyrate. The treatment solutions were introduced into each plate by pouring a 50 micromolar solution of lanthanum trichloride and a 100 micromolar solution of sodium butyrate into the prospective plates and allowing them to soak for 10 minutes. After the plates were prepared with their respective treatments each had two 1 cm x 1 cm squares cut out on either side of the plate. One contained a piece of stock physarum mold while the other contained three pieces of oats, or the mold’s food source. The plates were wrapped in tin foil to eliminate any effects of phototaxis and placed in an incubator for 18-24 hours. We observed and recorded streaming by counting how long it took for the streaming to change directions. However, after this produced result that we had trouble explaining, we changed our methods of taking data to how quickly the stream was moving. We were able to observe these characteristics using a phase microscope. After the data was collected a two-sample t-test was used for growth and streaming to determine significance in each.

Results:
We were unable to prove significance in the differing effects of inhibiting calcium pathways with IP3 and the calcium ion in neither the rate of streaming (p=.682, df=3.34) nor growth (p=.258, df=2.01). There was no sharp change in the rate of streaming in the two samples although, the plates treated with sodium butyrate exhibited a much higher growth rate, regardless of their similar streaming rates (fig. 1 and 2). This led us to believe that the rate of streaming and growth are not linked in a significant manner. 

Discussion:
The Physarum acted in ways that we did not predict. There was very little correlation between inhibition of calcium channels through both methods and streaming rates. However, after researching the topic more we discovered that it is not unreasonable to conclude that altering calcium levels, whether it be by inhibiting IP3 activated calcium channels or 〖Ca〗^(2+) activated calcium channels does not affect streaming in a way indicative of significance [Ayling: 2012]. Since our original hypothesis that inhibiting specific calcium channels that have different activation circumstances would produce different effects in streaming and growth became less viable due to Ayling’s claims, we decided to leave the samples in the incubator for a second day but, instead, quantify streaming by how quickly it was moving rather than how much time it took to change directions. One study suggested that high velocities of streaming correlate to straight motion and elongated shape, or, growth [Rodiek and Hauser: 2015]. However, this strategy gave us the same insignificant results because the fastest moving strands were found in the control followed by the lanthanum trichloride plates, leaving sodium butyrate as the slowest. This did not alter our conclusion that there is no correlation between the characteristics of streaming and which calcium pathway was inhibited. The lack of change in the streaming in growth could possibly be explained by the fact that the slime mold retains its 〖Ca〗^(2+) specific gating function even in the absence of the ion, allowing the organism to continue signaling like it would normally [Kaufmann: 2012].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This figure shows the average amount of growth of Physarum in each individual treatment. The value of growth was recorded by measuring the length of the longest strand coming from the initial stock Physarum. The standard error bars indicates the statistical accuracy of the estimates made from the data.

Figure 2: This figure displays the average rates of streaming found in each treatment. The measurements were gathered by recording the amount of time the strand took to change directions of streaming. The error bars indicate how much deviation these values exhibit from statistically accurate amount.
