Title: Inhibition of Photosynthesis with the Presence of Excess Ferric Acid Solution in Plants

Abstract:
The presence of excess heavy metal (Ferric acid solution) in plants exhibited inhibition in photosynthetic activity of plants. The organism employed was Spinacia oleraca. Photosynthesis was exhibited to be sensitive both in vivo and vitro elements of plants. The experiment was performed in hopes to replicate previous studies of heavy metals inhibiting photosynthetic activity. Conditions other than the presence of excess heavy metals were kept constant. The functionality of photosynthetic rates was assumed to be interrupted at cellular level of plants, and includes features like stomatal closure, damaged chloroplasts, and the photosystems being inhibited. Consequently, heavy metals in excess was supported to have negative effects to photosynthetic activities in plants. 

Introduction:
     Though heavy metals are natural components of soil at appropriate amounts, surplus of undesired buildup of toxicity in the environment negatively impacts the proper functionality of plants. Excess heavy metals elevate the toxicity in plant’s system, damaging chloroplasts and disrupting photosynthesis. There are two kinds of heavy metals found in soils. One group is referred as essential micronutrients for normal plant growth (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mg, Mo, and Ni), and the other group is known as nonessential elements with little information of its biological and physiological effects (Cd, Sb, Cr, Pb, As, Co, Ag, Se, and Hg) (Chandra: 2015). Amongst many heavy metals, a homeostatic balance of iron is a crucial micronutrient for metabolic activities in plants (Chnadra: 2015). Low levels of iron can cause iron deficiency which occurs due to high pH value in soil. An excess amount of iron is toxic to plants in acidic soil. To accommodate for possible external disruptors, plants have developed chelators in its system, a set of molecules that bond very tightly to heavy metal ions based on plant’s needs. Moreover, plants employ various defense strategies of tolerance or detoxification with heavy metal contact, when confronted with high concentrations of heavy metals (Sheoran: 1993). Once the threshold of plants for heavy metals is exceeded however, chlorophyll pigments will be damaged, resulting in inability for the plant to continue photosynthesis. With this knowledge, we hypothesized the following: if there is excess iron in the plant leaves, then the photosynthetic rate will drop. The following claim will be further supported by the mechanism of photosynthesis in a highly functioning plant and the damage in mechanism with the presence of excess heavy metals. This paper’s ultimate motive is to investigate the essential elements of photosynthesis, and further confirm the adverse effect of excess heavy metals on photosynthetic rates. 
    To fully engage in affirming the effects of heavy metals on photosynthetic rates, analyzing the mechanism behind photosynthesis is crucial. Photosynthesis is a process plants utilize to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight. The process involves two phases: a light phase (electron transport) to produce NADPH, ATP, and a dark phase (Calvin cycle) to produce glucose molecules. It requires chloroplasts which contain the green pigment chlorophyll to extract energy and produce oxygen as its waste. The summary equation for photosynthesis is as follows: 
6 CO2 + 12 H2O → C6H12O6 + 6 H2O + 6 O2
As a light dependent organism, fully functional plants take energy of sunlight from a chlorophyll-protein complex, which is passed on as excitation energy to both PSII and PSI. The reaction centers of photosystems and the electron transport chain collaborate to carry out electron transport once photon energy is received and the system is excited (Pavlovic). Electron transport is employed by chloroplast stroma through a series of protein complexes (PS2, plastoquinone, cytochrome b6/f complex, plastocyanine, PSI, and the complex of ATP- synthetase). Electron transport is carried out by the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast that utilizes photon energy to synthesize ATP and NADPH. Once a photon energy is received by the plant leaf, PSII reaction center (P680) converts excitation energy into chemical energy with a releasing of an electron. The electron is accepted by pheophytin, a primary electron acceptor in PSII. The excited electron is passed down through the electron transport chain. As the electron is moving down the chain, transmission of electrons through the thylakoid membrane occurs, leading to ATP synthesis. PSI’s reaction center (P700) is the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, and the received electron is further passed down to iron-sulfur protein complex, which is finally transferred to ferredoxin (Fd). This allows PSI to implement the reduction process of 〖NADP〗^+ to 〖NADPH〗^2. This is a crucial process because NADPH and ATP created together create a sugar molecule (glucose). Consequently, chlorophyll content dictates the productivity of photosynthesis under highly functional plant conditions mentioned above. Monitoring chlorophyll content is crucial to optimize photosynthetic activity (Pavlović: 2014). 
    The presence of excess iron ions would not only damage the chlorophyll content, but also reduce the repairing rate of damaged cell structures, thus resulting in inhibition of photosynthetic activity. To accommodate for best possible results, Spinach leaves (Spinacia Oleracea) were employed as our model organism for measuring photosynthetic rates under excess iron. Spinach leaves were regarded as good model organisms for tracking photosynthesis for many years. In the past, plant biochemists often chose spinach to be studied because spinach was easy and inexpensive to obtain, and the thin walls of spinach leaf cells could be easily broken open for experiments (Haughn: 2014). Moreover, it was one of the representative species that was easy to manipulate. These leaves also show visible signals when its’ chloroplasts are introduced by DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol), an indication of the photosynthetic mechanism of electron transport which can be measured by changes in absorbance. DCPIP allows the high energy electrons in the chloroplast to reduce the molecule and change its color from blue to colorless. 



Materials and Method:
    Spinach leaves (Spinacia oleraca) were obtained from a local fresh market and were stored in the fridge. The spinach leaves that appeared to look healthy with similar surface area were picked out and divided into two sets. The central veins of the leaves for both sets were isolated, and thrown away. The remaining leaves were put into two separate beakers, and were left in solutions for 20 minutes to allow diffusion to occur (one in deionized water, the other in deionized water + ferric acid solution). The ferric acid (Iron III chloride) solution’s concentration of ions was 27%. They were separately grinded with mortar and pestle along with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer solution (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to make it a slurry. 10 Ml of additional cold grinding buffer was added, having enough fluid for centrifuge. 
    The spinach solutions were strained through cheesecloth to get the remaining chunks off. Both solutions were centrifuged twice (resuspended the vial to separate supernatant from pellet) to ultimately isolate the chlorophyll pigments needed in the pellet. Initial solution was centrifuged at a speed of 200 x G. Its’ supernatant, a concentrated set of chloroplasts located at the bottom, was then centrifuged at a speed of 1000 x G. The pellet of the second centrifugation was isolated, and 20Ml grinding buffer was added to suspend the Spinach chloroplasts. The two samples were each placed in a plate to be compared for its chloroplast density under a hemocytometer. This was to prove that the amount of chloroplast did not change, while chloroplasts with excess iron was damaged and malfunctioning, resulting in lower photosynthetic activity then chloroplasts with just deionized water. The density was relatively the same, as expected. 8 test tubes were prepared: one for blank with the centrifuged solution (100 ul of solution without metal), three for solution without metal, one for blank with the other centrifuged solution (100 ul of solution with excess metal), three for solution with metal. Blanks had 8 Ml of deionized water, and the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) but no DCPIP. The rest of the test tubes had 6 Mls of deionized water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 100 ul of solution (3 test tubes of chloroplasts with iron solution, 3 tubes of chloroplasts without iron solution). Absorbances of the spinach chloroplasts were measured using the percent change in absorbance of 130 mM DCPIP in a reaction buffer of 100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5. Starting with the blank solution, the absorbance at 600nm was measured at the initial time of zero, and the subsequent absorbance measurements were taken at 10, 20, 30 minutes of light. To optimize the experiment, every external variable was kept constant to minimize error (light, temperature, concentration of ions, volume and healthy sample). Absorbances for each test tubes were recorded, and t_tests were performed to get the data graphed between solution with excess iron element and solution without it. 


Results:
 The chloroplast samples with iron solution had an average photosynthetic activity of -2.81 +/- 0.95. The chloroplast samples without iron solution had an average photosynthetic activity of 39.57 +/- 9.83. The absorbance rate for chloroplast samples with heavy metal solution stayed relatively the same, and correlated to an inhibition of photosynthesis. The absorbance rate for chloroplast samples without heavy metal solution decreased as time passed by, and correlated to a visible photosynthetic activity.


Discussion:
    The inverse effect of photosynthetic rates and excess iron metals confirmed that chlorophyll pigments were damaged and the plant’s photosynthetic mechanism was inhibited by the heavy metal presence. The experiment results supported our hypothesis. With a huge statistical difference in the photosynthetic rates of chloroplast samples with iron solution and chloroplast samples without iron solution, our experiment proved the adverse effects in photosynthetic activities and excess iron molecules. The chloroplast samples with iron solution had an average photosynthetic activity of -2.81. This shows that not only there was no photosynthetic activity, but there also was an aversion towards any kind of photophosphorylation within the plant (negative number). In a stark contrast, the chloroplast samples without iron solution had an average photosynthetic activity of 39.57. The sample showed that chlorophyll contents were actively photosynthesizing. The chloroplast sample with iron solution was overwhelmed by the heavy metal contact, resulting in critical damages and shut downs of the mechanism for photosynthesis. Once plants reach its’ tolerance point with the interference of metal ions, photosynthetic pigments will be indirectly reduced, affecting the functioning of stomata, and the overall transpiration rate (Chnadra: 2015). Because of the inverse relationship with photosynthetic rates and the presence of heavy metals, it is important to analyze the defense mechanism of photosynthesis when a highly functioning plant is disrupted. To unravel the defense mechanisms of plants, the physical barrier must be the first point of examination as they are the first line of defense. Cell walls, thick cuticles and active tissues like trichomes make up the outer layer of plants, blocking unnecessary materials from entering. When the presence of heavy metals overcome such biophysical barriers, and enter inside the plant cells, a series of cellular defense mechanisms are activated. This causes biomolecules such as the metallochaperones and chelators to restrain metal poisoning. These defense mechanisms hold a threshold, as too much heavy metal overcomes it, destroying the plant’s ability to photosynthesize (Sheoran: 1993). 
    Few possible errors could have occurred during the experiment. One minor mistake our lab group didn’t account for was the initial sizes of spinach plant leaves which differed in surface area, resulting in possible differences in the number of chloroplasts for each leaf. Furthermore, a minor cross contamination is expected while handling the fluids. Gloves were not switched when mixing (inverting) the test tubes of chloroplast samples with iron solution and chloroplast samples without iron solution. Lastly, a more detailed observation of chloroplast densities in each sample using hemocytometer could have happened. We observed the samples for a few seconds and assumed they had the similar amount of chloroplast density. A more accurate version could have been counting the chloroplasts shown in each phase microscope to compare the sample sizes and account for the differences. This would give us a more accurate data in the long run as well. 
    With the supported knowledge of the excess iron ions inhibiting photosynthetic activity, few future studies could be hypothesized. This further strengthens our original hypothesis as well, given that it succeeds. The study would measure how the iron solutions at different ppm (parts per million) would affect photosynthetic activity, given that other conditions are kept the same. It would be hypothesized that there would be a decrease in photosynthetic activity, as the ppm (concentration of ion) of the iron solution increases. Another study could be implemented with same conditions, but using a different heavy metal, assuming it will produce similar results. A similar experiment in the past showed the effects of Cd and lead (Pb) on Brassica juncea L. The presence of such heavy metals presented a “decline in growth, chlorophyll content, and carotenoids”.  They also found that Cd was found to be more detrimental than Pb (Chnadra: 2015). On this notion, an additional study of comparing which heavy metals are more inhibiting to plants would be a plausible one. 
    Plant photosynthesis in the molecular level must be thoroughly examined to quickly determine plant’s health and their resistance to environmental factors. The mechanism of electron transport can be examined when experimenting with heavy metals in plants to get a more plausible assumption. Insights on what is happening at the cellular level presents a clearer view of how photosynthetic activity is inhibited in the presence of heavy metals. A common site for blockage seems to be at the oxidizing side of PS II, along with enzyme activity and photophosphorylation sites that can have additional impact on inhibition. Inhibition due to iron in vivo seems to have a couple of reasonings. The immediate effect is on stomatal closure due to overwhelming amount of iron, which translates to the damaged chloroplasts. Long-term exposure to heavy metals produce features such as the “reduced leaf growth, decreased photosynthetic pigments, darkened chloroplast structure, and decreased enzyme activities for CO2 assimilation” (Sheoran: 1993). Consequently, the chlorophyll content, its distribution, and the change in chlorophyll content can be thoroughly examined as it is “one of the most obvious symptoms of plant stress”; it is the most important feature in relationship to photosynthetic activity and external stressors like heavy metals.
