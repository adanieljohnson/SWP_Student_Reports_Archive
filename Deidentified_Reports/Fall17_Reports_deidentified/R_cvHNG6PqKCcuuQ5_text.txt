Title: Effect of Exercise upon the Metabolic Rate of Crayfish Cambarus procambarus

Abstract:
Metabolism is how an organism makes energy usable for itself. The rate of metabolism can be measured through the respiration of an organism, in this case, the amount of oxygen consumed by crayfish. To test whether metabolic rate is affected by exercise, three crayfishes oxygen consumption for 20 minutes was measured before and after five minutes of exercise. The five minutes of exercise led to no significant increase of oxygen consumption by the crayfish and a p-value of p = 0.521. However this result should be viewed with skepticism as there may have been skewing of the results based on the activity of the crayfish and the type of exercise they were subjected to.

Introduction:
Different organisms have different ways in which they obtain energy; plants conduct photosynthesis, animals eat other organisms, some prokaryotes conduct chemosynthesis. Whatever the way that an organism obtains this energy, it relies on a process called metabolism to convert that energy into something usable.
Exercise is rigorous physical activity that uses the body’s energy stores. There are two main forms of exercise, aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise specifically requires high amounts of oxygen whereas anaerobic does not.
In an experiment by Adamczewsk and Morris, it was found that exercise upon the Terrestrial Christmas Island Red Crab Cegarcoida Natalis caused a doubling of resting oxygen consumption. This finding was taken and used as the basis of this experiment. We decided to test if exercise increased the metabolic rate of Crayfish Cambarus procambarus. This organism was used because it is easy to keep alive and small enough to keep in a mason jar while also being large enough to measure oxygen intake. The hypothesis was if we exercise crayfish, its metabolism will increase.


Materials and Methods:
We weighed our crayfish. Then we filled a mason jar with room temperature water and placed it in a tub of water. Then we placed the crayfish in the mason jar. Then we closed the lid on the crayfish in such a way that it was airtight and an oxygen level reader was inserted inside. Then we measured the initial oxygen level. Then we waited 20 minutes, reading the oxygen levels at every five minutes. Then we took the crayfish out of the jar and measured the water volume. Then we exercised the crayfish for five minutes by chasing it around the tub of water with a red sharpie. Then we put it back in the jar in the same manner and measured the initial oxygen level. We waited 20 minutes, reading the oxygen levels at every five minutes. Then we took the crayfish out of the jar and measured the water volume. Then we repeated all of this with two other crayfish. To make sense of this data, we used a one tailed, paired t-test using the average metabolic rates of the crayfish.

Results:
The raw data of oxygen levels is taken along with the weight of each crayfish and the water volume and is used to calculate the average metabolic rate. This metabolic rate was then run through a t-test to test for significant increase in metabolic rate. No significant increase was observed in the average metabolic rate between the before and after exercise (Figure 1, 1 tailed T-test, T = 0.771, p = 0.521). The results observed are confusing and unexpected. A smaller p-value was expected, one that would be significant or at least close to being significant.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that exercise would increase the metabolic rate of crayfish was not supported by the data. This is counter to the study mentioned previously where oxygen consumption, directly linked to metabolic rate, was doubled (A. Adamczewsk, S. Morris).
	That being said, the results obtained from this experiment should be brought to question due to some flaws in the study. The first one is that the exercise that each crayfish was subjected to was flimsy at best. The only way that they able to be coaxed into moving was by prodding with the sharpie. Even then, they moved at a leisurely pace. In addition, one of the crayfish was very agitated whenever it was put in the jar, especially during the pr-exercise trial. This might have affected its metabolic rate both times.
	If this experiment had reputable findings, it could be applied to exercise science and be built upon to show why humans have different resting metabolic rates before and after aerobic exercise.
	To improve upon this experiment and to make its findings applicable to real life situations such as recommended intake of calories for athletes, many changes should be applied. The crayfish used should be the same size. Crayfish that are “jumpy” or “relaxed” should not be used. More Crayfish should be used or more trials run with the same crayfish.
