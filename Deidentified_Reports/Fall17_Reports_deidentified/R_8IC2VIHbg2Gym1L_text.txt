Title: Effect of Sevin injection on voltage threshold within leg muscle of Rania pipiens for nerve stimulation 

Abstract:
Carbamate pesticides, especially Sevin, are widely used due to their low contamination to the environment and high efficiency. Sevin acts on the somatic neuromuscular system by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine (the major neurotransmitter between motor neurons and muscle cells). The main objective of the study was to determine the capability of Sevin to alter the minimum amplitude of nerve stimulus required to initiate muscle contraction. It was hypothesized that Sevin would decrease the voltage threshold. I examined how voltage thresholds change in response to the injection of 2% solution of Sevin into gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs by stimulating the sciatic nerve with pulses of increasing amplitude. Comparing the controlll and experimental groups, there was a large percentage decrease in threshold voltage but it failed to reach significance (P>0.05).  Hence, the presence of Sevin in gastrocnemus muscle in frog legs did not significently lower the voltage threshold for a muscle twitch. This result opposed the hypothesis probably because of the small sample of subjects, and the effect of Sevin on neuromuscular controlll remains to be explored. 

Introduction:
The outstanding jumping ability of frogs is attributed to high power output generated by leg muscle contraction. Muscle contraction is regulated by acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase at neuromuscular junctions. Once an action potential arrives at nerve terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open and the sudden increase in calcium concentration causes the fusion of vesicles of neurotransmitters called acetylcholine with membranes and release of acetylcholine into synaptic clefts. Subsequently, the binding of acetylcholine to the ACh receptors on the postsynaptic motor end plates initiates action potential, excitation-contraction coupling, and finally the formation of actin-myosin bonds, resulting in the contraction of myofibril [Sadava: 2016].  To restore muscle to relaxation state, an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, located in synaptic clefts, hydrolyzes acetylcholine, terminating signals to muscle cells [Beauvais: 2001].

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors operate as nerve agents by suppressing the function of acetylcholinesterase. An example is carbaryl which is a chemical insecticide sold under a trade name Sevin [Relyea: 2006] Therefore, if Sevin is injected into muscle tissues, acetylcholinesterase will cease to function; acetylcholine will linger in synaptic clefts and continue to activate muscle contraction.  As a result, Sevin interferes with the somatic neuromuscular system, and triggers spastic muscle paralysis or even death of organisms [Sadava: 2016]. 

According to the mechanism of Sevin acting upon neuromuscular juctions, it can be conjectured that Sevin may alter the voltage threshold- the minimum voltage for initiation of action potential and therefore a muscle twitch- for nerve stimulation. Thus, in this investigation, I examined the effect of Sevin on voltage threshold for muscle contraction. To be more specific, my hypothesis was that Sevin would decrease the value of threshold voltage for nerve stimulation. The absence or presence of Sevin was the independent and categorical variable, and the threshold voltage was the dependent and measurement variable. Three legs of Rania pipiens were selected as subjects because of their appropriate size and visible muscle contraction. Each frog leg acted as its own controlll and experimental groups. I examined how the injection of 2% solution of Sevin into the gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs would affect the threshold voltage when the sciatic nerve, which is attached to the muscle, was stimulated by individual pulses [Johnson: 2017].

Materials and Method:
One frog leg was placed in a dissecting pan. Its skin was peeled away from the top of the leg with a pair of forceps. After gently separating the inner thigh muscle with a pair of scissors, the white sciatic nerve was pulled out from the surrounding connective tissue. The exposed tissues were kept moistened with frog Ringer’s solution.

A knot was tied at the junction between gastrocnemus muscle and the tendon. The gastrocnemus was suspended from a force transducer and the bones were immobilized with pins. Next, the sciatic nerve was laid on the top of a bipolar stimulation probe, and covered with a rubber sleeve. 

Then, Labscribe software was used to controlll the stimulator. Control variables were kept the same throughout the experiment (number of pulses: 1, frequency: 1, pulse width: 5ms). The stimulus amplitude was set to 0.0 V at first and raised in 0.1 V increments until the first muscle twitch was generated (amplitude of muscle twitch was not 0). The value of voltage threshold was recorded in the raw data table. After that, 1 Ml of  2% solution of Sevin was carefully injected at 3 different sites on the gastrocnemus muscle, and the previous procedure was repeated. 

The other two frog legs were examined with the same method above. And all voltage thresholds were recorded in the raw data table, and the differences before and after Sevin injection were calculated and collected in Table 1.  Average voltage thresholds before and after injection were calculated and displayed in a bar chart (Figure 2). Paired t_test was used to compare the controlll and experimental groups, and the level of significent was set to p<0.05.

Results:
According to Table 1, the gastrocnemus muscles of 2 frog legs had higher threshold voltages for muscle twitch, especially the threshold voltage of frog leg 3, which decreased by 0.3 V. But frog leg 1 revealed an increase in voltage threshold (0.1 V) after the treatment. 

Overall, the difference between the mean threshold voltages before and after injection is negative (see Table 1), indicating the general decrease in threshold by 0.08 V which is also shown in Figure 1.

Comparing the experimental group to the controlll group, the mean threshold voltage after Sevin injection was not significently lower than its mean before the injection (t_stat = 0.68, d.f. = 2, P = 0.28>0.05). 


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that a significent decrease in threshold voltage caused by Sevin injection would be shown. But data opposed this hypothesis and showed that there was no effect of Sevin injection on threshold voltage, as the values of threshold voltage were not significently lower with Sevin compared to the controlll group (P>0.05). 

The practical significance of the result is vague and questionable, since there was a relatively large decrease in mean voltage threshold ( 27.6%) in response to Sevin injection carried out properly. This was probably due to the limited sample size of subjects and relatively low concentration of Sevin solution, so improvements could be made by testing on a larger number of frog legs and preparing Sevin solution with a higher concentration. 

The drop in average voltage threshold was primarily caused by the effect of carbaryl (Sevin) on acetylcholinesterase activity. Carbaryl lowered the enzyme’s activity by carbamylating its active site [Iyer: 2010]. The effect of Sevin is comparable in different organisms. The capability of carbaryl to inhibit acetylcholinesterase was statistically proved by a study on earthworms’ responses to carbaryl by D Ribera. Acetylcholinesterase activity was significently suppressed to 23% of the controlll value at all doses of carbaryl (P<0.001*). Even at lowest dosage of carbaryl (12 mg carbaryl kg−1 soil), there was a significent drop in the amount of activity [Ribera: 2001]. 

Subsequently, acetylcholine concentration within synaptic clefts remained high, due to the inactivity of acetylcholinesterase which broke down acetylcholine. Acetylcholine continued to bind to nicotinic receptors, sending excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) from motor end plates to the axon hillock where summation takes place [Sadava: 2016]. Since more EPSPs could be delivered at the same amplitude of stimulus on motor neurons, it was more likely to reach threshold, generate an action potential, and initiate a muscle twitch. In other words, muscle contraction could be generated with a nerve stimulus at a lower amplitude.
 
The main limitation of this research was the small sample size and therefore low reliability of the results, so further investigation would be based on a much larger sample size (over 20 frog legs). Apart from this modification, the categorical variable (before- after) will be replaced with a quantitative variable (concentration of Sevin solution or dosage of Sevin solution), allowing finding the correlation between the amount of Sevin injection and the resultant threshold voltage. 

Even Sevin is supposed to have little contamination to the environment, this experiment showed that it could cause neurotoxicity to aquatic organisms through acetylcholinesterase inhibition. A study by Beauvais proved that acetylcholinesterase inhibition would affect spontaneous locomotory behaviors, like swimming, in carbaryl exposures [Beauvais, 2001]. The decreased speed of locomotion would impair organisms’ abilities to migrate, attract mates, and avoid predators, resulting in muscle paralysis or even death [Beauvais, 2001].
