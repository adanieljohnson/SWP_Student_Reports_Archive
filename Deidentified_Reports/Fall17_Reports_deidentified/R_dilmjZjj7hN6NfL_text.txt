Title: Effect of salinity on the specific metabolic rate of Oreconectes sp. through oxygen consumption

Abstract:
Specific metabolic rate of an organism can be calculated by measuring oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. With increased salinity of water, there will be an increase in the concentration of Na+ and Cl- ions in the water. We hypothesized that a 0.65% NaCl solution of water will lead the Oreconectes sp. to have higher specific metabolic rates than in regular water. We tested this by measuring the oxygen consumption over time in regular freshwater and salt water. The specific metabolic rates of the crayfish in the salt water were 0.00105 mgO2/gmin, 0.0009336 mgO2/gmin, and 0.001419 mgO2/gmin, and the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish in the regular water were 0.0009614 mgO2/gmin, 0.0007251 mgO2/gmin, and 0.001202 mgO2/gmin. Our results showed that a saltwater environment increased the specific metabolic rates of the crayfish, most likely due to more energy being required to return the ion concentration in the organism back to normal. The one tailed paired t-test comparing the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in the freshwater and that of the crayfish in the 0.65% NaCl solution resulted in a t-stat = 4.133699, a degree of freedom (df) = 2, and a P value = 0.05384.

Introduction:
Organisms respond and adapt to environmental changes on a daily basis, but the source of the energy used in these functions differs between the types of organisms. Autotrophs use captured sunlight and chemical energy in glucose through photosynthesis. Heterotrophs, on the other hand, obtain high-energy molecules and materials by consuming autotrophs or other heterotrophs. Both, however, use mitochondrial enzymes to convert high-energy molecules into low-energy ones and capture the energy released in ATP. Metabolism includes this process of balancing energy capture, conversion, and transfer. Metabolic rate refers to the amount of energy being used at a specific time. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are indirect indicators of energy production and use by an organism. When an organism converted glucose to energy, the carbon and oxygen molecules are converted into carbon dioxide gas. Electrons are released in this process and are captured by NAD+ and FAD molecules. As these electrons move through the electron transport chain they give up energy which converts low-energy ATP to high-energy ATP. These electrons are removed from the mitochondria by transferring them to molecular oxygen. Oreconectes sp. or crayfish are ectotherms who inhabit fresh water ecosystem, which makes it easy to alter their body temperature and thus, their metabolism, and is why they were a good model organism for this experiment. A study published in India in 1970 showed that a diluted solution of saltwater solution resulted in a higher metabolic rate, which is the amount of oxygen consumed per gram of body mass per unit of time, for freshwater crabs than when they were in the freshwater solution [Venkatachari: 1979]. To test their findings, we analyzed the effects of a 0.65% NaCl solution of water on specific metabolic rate of freshwater crayfish. We expect that the higher salinity solution will cause the freshwater crayfish to have a higher specific metabolic rate than when they are in the filtered freshwater.

Materials and Methods:
Assigned three similarly sized crayfish at room temperature, 22 degrees Celsius. Filled screw-top glass testing chamber with water that has been saturated with air. Set testing chamber in empty plastic dishpan. Weighed crayfish, placed crayfish in chamber, and screwed on top. When top was secure, we filled the container with water until overflowing. Placed tank setup to the neck in dishpan filled with room temperature water. Inserted dissolved oxygen probe in top of the chamber and made sure chamber was still completely full of water. Turned on instrument and led readings stabilize, 30 seconds to a minute.
Took baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. At 5, 10 ,15, 20 minutes, we measured the oxygen concentration in the testing chamber again. Removed the probe and crayfish from the testing chamber. Measured volume of water the crayfish was in during the experiment by pouring the water from the test chamber through a funnel intro a 1000 mL graduated cylinder. Volume was recorded in a table and water was poured down the sink and rinsed. Specific metabolic rate = [∆O2 (mg/L) x volume H2O (L)]/[Time (min) x mass (g)] was then calculated for each crayfish.
For the salinity measurements, 100 mL of NaCl at a 6.5% concentration was poured into the 1000 mL graduated cylinder and the rest filled with water, resulting in a concentration of 0.65% NaCl. This solution was then poured into the glass testing chamber with the crayfish. Weighed crayfish, placed crayfish in chamber, and screwed on top. When top was secure, we filled the container with water until overflowing. Placed tank setup to the neck in dishpan filled with room temperature water. Inserted dissolved oxygen probe in top of the chamber and made sure chamber was still completely full of water. Turned on instrument and led readings stabilize, 30 seconds to a minute. Took baseline reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. At 5, 10 ,15, 20 minutes, we measured the oxygen concentration in the testing chamber again. Removed the probe and crayfish from the testing chamber. Measured volume of water the crayfish was in during the experiment by pouring the water from the test chamber through a funnel intro a 1000 mL graduated cylinder. Volume was recorded in a table and water was poured down the sink and the graduated cylinder rinsed. Specific metabolic rate = [∆O2 (mg/L) x volume H2O (L)]/[Time (min) x mass (g)] was then calculated for each crayfish.
The experiment was then repeated for the other two crayfish with their data recorded and their specific metabolic rate calculated. A one tailed paired t-test comparing the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in the freshwater and that of the crayfish in the 0.65% NaCl solution was ran.

Results:
All three crayfish in the higher salinity solution showed a higher specific metabolic rate than when they were in the freshwater at room temperature. The dissolved O2 concentration fell over time for all three crayfish, which is directly proportional to the amount of energy used, but fell more in the higher salinity solution compared to the regular, untreated water. The specific metabolic rate for the control crayfish (1-3) were 0.009614, 0.007251, and 0.001202, respectively. The specific metabolic rate for the saltwater crayfish (1-3) were 0.00105, 0.000936, and 0.001419, respectively. Which means that all three-crayfish had a higher specific metabolic rate when they were in the 0.65% NaCl salt solution compared to when they were in the freshwater. The one tailed paired t-test comparing the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in the freshwater and that of the crayfish in the 0.65% NaCl solution resulted in a t-stat = 4.133699, a degree of freedom (df) = 2, and a P value = 0.05384.

Discussion:
Our results on the specific metabolic rate of crayfish in freshwater and 0.65% NaCl solution supported our hypothesis as the specific metabolic rate of all three crayfish increased in the salt water when compared to the regular freshwater. A higher specific metabolic rate can be attributed to the crayfish being required to generate more energy, which is related to oxygen consumption. The salt water has more Na+ and Cl- ions in solution compared to the regular filtered water, so these ions will enter the cell more frequently through diffusion down the concentration gradient compared to the regular freshwater. In order to maintain the regular ion levels inside of the cells, the excess ions must be pumped out of the cell against the concentration gradient which is an active process and thus requires energy. 
Because there is this increased concentration gradient in the salt water, more energy is required to activate ion transporters that pump the ions out of the cell back into the water solution, which allows the cell to maintain its regular ion levels. This increase in energy required causes oxygen consumption to increase, thus increasing the specific metabolic rate. These findings were reflected a similar experiment dealing with freshwater crabs, where the diluted saltwater solution resulted in the crabs having a higher metabolic rate when in the saltwater, compared to when they were in their usual, freshwater [Venkatachari: 1979].
Our data, as well as that of 1979 experiment done in India, increased salinity leads to an increase in specific metabolic rate for freshwater crustaceans so they can maintain ion levels in the cell to preserve cellular function. However, after running the one tailed paired t-test for specific metabolic rate, the p-value was 0.05384, which is greater than 0.05, so the results were not statistically significant and there was not a significant difference between specific metabolic rate in regular water than in salt water. 
A future study, other than running the experiment again, but using more similarly sized crayfish, could be using much higher concentrations of salt to see whether that causes an even greater increase in specific metabolic rate than this experiment showed. Or seeing how long it would take for the crayfish to adapt to this increased salinity solution and their specific metabolic rate drops to the level it was when the crayfish were in the freshwater.

The specific metabolic rate of the three control and experimental crayfish in the 0.65% NaCl concentration are shown above. All three-crayfish had a higher specific metabolic rate when they were in the 0.65% NaCl salt solution compared to when they were in the freshwater. Crayfish 1 exhibited the least difference in specific metabolic rate in the freshwater and saltwater solutions, while Crayfish 3 exhibited the largest different in specific metabolic rate in the freshwater and saltwater solutions. While all similarly size, Crayfish 3 also had the largest specific metabolic rate in both the freshwater and saltwater solutions compared to Crayfish 1 and Crayfish 2. The one tailed paired t-test comparing the specific metabolic rate of the crayfish in the freshwater and that of the crayfish in the 0.65% NaCl solution resulted in a t-stat = 4.133699, a degree of freedom (df) = 2, and a P value = 0.05384.
