Title: The insignificant effects of sodium butyrate and lanthanum trichloride on IP3 and Ca2+ signaling pathways in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Organisms depend on signal transduction pathways to sense and respond to their environments, and without these pathways, cells would not be able to readily adapt to extracellular changes. In this study, migration and cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum polycephalum was observed after it was exposed to varying inhibitors of different signaling pathways. We hypothesized that a sodium butyrate inhibitor would have a greater effect on growth and streaming because of its inhibition of intracellular calcium channels in the Ca2+-mediated pathway. After gathering data 21 hours later, there was no significant difference between the growth and streaming of the physarum in the three groups. Once an additional 24 hours passed, the samples were reevaluated, and general observations revealed that the physarum in both inhibitor-soaked groups had grown largely to the outside of the plate. Although the initial results neither were significant nor supported the hypothesis, these results in conjunction with the later general observations demonstrated that the physarum was still capable of relatively responding to its environment. This data continues to support that theory that organisms have an extensive network of signaling pathways to respond directly to abnormal changes in their environment. 

Introduction:
Without properly functioning signaling pathways, life on earth could not exist. These immensely detailed transduction pathways allow organisms to detect, understand, and respond to their environment constantly throughout daily life. Amongst the many different types of signaling pathways, most are arranged into families in which the type of receptor, second messenger, and effector mechanisms are the same [Johnson: 2018]. The IP3 mediated path is a major G-protein coupled signaling pathway in most cells that contains the effector enzyme phospholipase C. This enzyme produces two second messenger molecules by cleaving phosphatidylinositol: diacylycerol and IP3 [Johnson: 2018]. While diacylgycerol activates Protein Kinase C, IP3 binds to a receptor on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum that opens a Ca2+ channel, and this sudden efflux of Ca2+ can trigger a cascade of cellular changes [Thatcher: 2010]. Slightly different than a G-protein coupled receptor pathway, the Ca2+ signaling pathway is an ion channel-coupled pathway that also releases Ca2+ from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. As calcium diffuses into the cell from its external environment, it binds to a ryanodine receptor on the smooth ER that opens a calcium channel in a very similar fashion to IP3 [Putney: 1999]. In this lab, Physarum polycephalum were chosen because the effects of its signaling pathways can be directly investigated through its migration and cytoplasmic streaming. Physarum controls every one of its responses by intracellular signal transduction pathways because it does not use hormones and/or a nervous system [Johnson: 2018]. Motility and streaming of physarum are directly linked to internal processes such as the assembly and disassembly of actin filaments that respond to their environment using chemo-mechanical coupling in signaling pathways to generate a response [Smith: 1992]. Being such a diverse organism, physarum must respond quickly and efficiently to extracellular signals, and inhibition of the previously mentioned pathways can have a drastic effect on the life of physarum. The purpose of this lab was to determine if the IP3 pathway or the Ca2+ pathway plays a larger role in cytoplasmic streaming and growth by specifically inhibiting one pathway in different experimental groups. According to previous research, lanthanum trichloride is known to inhibit IP3-activated intracellular calcium channels, and sodium butyrate is known to inhibit Ca2+-activated intracellular calcium channels [Johnson: 2018]. Based on existing data, we hypothesized that inhibiting Ca2+ signaling pathway would have a greater effect on streaming and growth. To test this hypothesis, physarum growth and cytoplasmic streaming was observed in different inhibitors after an extended period of time. 

Materials and Methods:
After sterilizing a spatula soaked in 95% ethanol under a flame, two 1 cm x 1 cm equally spaced squares were cut from three water agar dishes labeled “control”. One 1 cm x 1 cm square was then removed from the physarum culture stock plate and placed into one of the wells in each water agar plate. 2-3 oat flakes were placed in each remaining well. Three additional water agar plates were soaked in 4 mL of 100uM sodium butyrate, and three more were soaked in 4 mL of 50uM lanthanum trichloride. After they soaked for 10 minutes, they were prepared in the exact same way as the control, with one square containing physarum and the other containing 2-3 oat flakes. The spatula was sterilized with the ethanol and flame every time it contacted the water agar plate or physarum culture. Then the lids were taped to the plates with clear tape, wrapped in foil, and labeled. They were then placed in the incubator. After all nine plates sat in the incubator for 21 hours, the distance that the physarum migrated in each plate was measured using a millimeter ruler. Then one strand from each plate was evaluated under an inverted phase microscope by measuring the time in seconds it took for the cytoplasm to change direction, stop, and change back to its original direction. After 24 additional hours in the incubator, the plates were examined and general observations were recorded. The growth and cytoplasmic streaming were compared between groups, and a statistical analysis including a one-way ANOVA test (α = 0.05) and a Tukey-Kramer test was used to analyze the data.  

Results:
When the data was gathered, the average growth of the control group was 13.33 +/- 2.082. The average growth of the physarum in the sodium butyrate plates was 34.67 +/- 21.01, and the average growth of the physarum in the lanthanum trichloride plates was 15.67 +/- 1.15. There was no significant difference between any of the three groups (p = 0.142), as displayed in Table 1. Figure 1 displays the average physarum growth after 21 hours, with the standard error shown through error bars. The physarum in the control group took an average of 35 +/- 13.23 seconds to switch back to its original direction, the sodium butyrate group an average of 39.33 +/- 22.18 seconds, and the lanthanum trichloride group an average of 32.67 +/- 13.05 seconds. There was no significant difference in cytoplasmic streaming between the three groups (p = 0.886), as displayed in Table 2. Figure 2 displays average cytoplasmic streaming rates after 21 hours, with the error bars representing standard error. After the additional 24 hours, the physarum in the control plates was completely in the wells containing the oat flakes, but the six experimental plates each had only one strand of physarum near the food source with the majority of it surrounding the perimeter of the plate. 

Discussion:
After analyzing the data, the hypothesis is not supported because there was no significant difference between the plates soaked in the IP3 pathway inhibitor (lanthanum trichloride) and the plates soaked in the Ca2+ pathway inhibitor (sodium butyrate). The plates soaked in inhibitors should not have experienced as much growth as they did, so there may have been errors in the precision of the dilutions, the livelihood of the physarum stock culture, or the accuracy of the provided inhibitor solutions. Previous research, however, has also produced similar insignificant results. One study published in the EMBO Journal investigated the strong link between these two signaling pathways, concluding that the important role that Ca2+ plays in both pathway makes it extremely difficult to accurately test these pathways in isolation from each other [Miyakawa: 2001]. In terms of the similar streaming data, a study done by Ayling, Brownlee, and Clarkson produced comparable insignificant results in terms of cytoplasmic streaming, suggesting that altering intracellular calcium rates does not affect cytoplasmic streaming [Ayling: 1994]. Although there was no significant difference in terms of growth and streaming, the six experimental groups did experience an end location of the physarum that is very different than the control. The physarum in the inhibitor-soaked plates primarily grew towards the outside of the plate, demonstrating a common, well-known phenomenon called chemotaxis. During chemotaxis, physarum was migrate towards chemical situations that may be beneficial and away from situations that would have a negative effect on growth, streaming, food resources, etc. [Durham: 1976]. Perhaps the physarum detected that the inhibitors would shut down intracellular calcium channels and attempted to migrate away from this dangerous environment. Moving forward, it may be beneficial to conduct a larger experiment with a larger sample size to obtain an average with less standard deviation. Additionally, an experiment could build off this data and investigate signaling pathways that do not involve calcium, such as a kinase-mediated or cAMP-mediated signaling pathway. The lack of significant results does not diminish the importance of the IP3 and Ca2+ mediated pathways; if anything, it simply emphasized the complexity of the signaling transduction networks that physarum uses to react and respond appropriately to its environment and needs.
