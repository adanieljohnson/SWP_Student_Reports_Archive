Title: Effect of Lidocaine on Muscle Contraction in the Rania pipiens Gastrocnemius

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effect of Lidocaine injection into the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens, the northern leopard frog, was studied in order to compare the twitch threshold and amplitude of twitches during repeated stimulation before and after injection.  Using a force transducer and pin electrodes, the gastrocnemus muscle was stimulated in the frog legs before and after injection of 0.1 Ml Lidocaine.  Each frog leg served as its own controlll.  We hypothesized that the injection of Lidocaine would inhibit muscle contraction of the gastrocnemus entirely, however, this was proven incorrect.  Although twitch threshold was higher and amplitude during repeated stimulation lower after injection, the results showed no significent difference (as determined by the p_value calculated in a paired t test) between controlll and treatment data for both tests.  While this indicates that Lidocaine does play an active role in inhibiting muscle contraction, further study is required.


Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is a form of rapid intercellular communication that allows organisms to sense and respond to their internal and external environments.  In a study done on the effects of different concentrations of Lidocaine on conduction in leopard frog sciatic nerves, researchers determined that beginning at 40 mM concentration of Lidocaine, nonreversible loss of impulse activity in the sciatic nerve occurred, a trend that continued in a progressive fashion with increasing drug concentration [Bainton and Strichartz: 1994].  Thus it follows that Lidocaine acts as an impulse blocker in muscle contractility.  In this experiment, our group will work with a leopard frog gastrocnemus in order to determine the effect of injection of a fixed concentration of Lidocaine (0.1 Ml) directly into the muscle on muscle contraction. We will use a force transducer, pin electrodes, and LabScribe software in order to stimulate and record muscle contractions.  We hypothesize that if Lidocaine is injected directly into the muscle, then the gastrocnemus muscle will be fully inhibited and unable to contract.

Materials and Method:
	In this experiment, three Leopard frog legs were used.  Prior to experimentation, they were prepared so that the skin was pulled off to expose the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve.  Throughout the experiment 100Ml of Ringer’s solution was applied to the muscle in order to prevent it from drying out.  Each frog leg served as its own controlll group.  A string was tied around the gastrocnemus muscle, with the other end of the string tied to a ring stand in order to suspend the muscle.  The tension of the string was adjusted in order to remain taut while still offering some give.  Extraneous muscle was pinned into place on the dissecting tray.  Pin electrodes were placed through the gastrocnemus muscle, with the red electrode above the black one.  Pre-injection twitch threshold was determined using an FT-302 force transducer and LabScribe software.  Pre-injection amplitude during repeated stimulation was determined using the force transducer and LabScribe software, with the frog leg stimulated for 5 pulses.  The gastrocnemus was injected with 0.1 Ml of Lidocaine and 5 minutes elapsed before further testing.  The Post-injection amplitude during repeated stimulation was determined using the force transducer and LabScribe software.  The Post-injection twitch threshold was also determined using the force transducer and LabScribe software, with testing beginning at the threshold determined during Pre-Injection.  The procedure was repeated for each frog leg. 


Results:
For all 3 frog legs, pre-injection twitch threshold was lower than post-injection twitch threshold.  During the test of amplitude during repeated twitch stimulation, the amplitude of twitches post-injection was lower than that of pre-injection for all 3 frog legs.  Each frog leg served as its own controlll.  There were no defective frog legs or faulty gastrocnemus muscles.  Twitch Threshold refers to the action potential threshold determined through increased voltage stimulation of frog legs.  Amplitude During Repeated Stimulation refers to the strength of muscle contraction.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported as we believed that injection of Lidocaine would inhibit muscle contraction entirely rather than require greater input to contract or cause a decrease in amplitude during repeated stimulation. We can reject the null hypothesis on the basis that injection of Lidocaine did make a difference in muscle contraction, requiring greater input voltage for twitch threshold and causing a lower amplitude during repeated stimulation post-injection.  We most likely got these results because Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker, and sodium channels are necessary for the perpetuation of action potentials as they act to depolarize cell membranes in order for muscle contraction to occur.  A different study found that Lidocaine injection in increasing concentration to the sciatic nerve of Leopard frogs resulted in irreversible loss of impulse activity [Bainton and Strichartz: 1994].  This further demonstrates the importance of sodium in muscular contractility not only in the muscle itself, but in the sciatic nerve as well.  Limitations to our experiment included the number of frog legs able to be tested as well as string tension, a factor that could not be easily replicated.  Additionally, neither of our tests were statistically significent.  Although the mean twitch threshold after injection was higher than that before injection, it was not significently lower (t_stat = 1.3401, d.f. = 2, P=0.3121).  Additionally, although the mean amplitude during repeated stimulation after injection was lower than that before injection, it was not significently lower (t_stat = 1.9912, d.f. = 2, P = 0.1847).  If we were to perform another experiment, it would be interesting to test frogs of different species such as bullfrogs or poison dart frogs to see is size of gastrocnemus muscle has any impact on results.  Additionally, it could also be interesting to test across different vertebrates, not just amphibians.
