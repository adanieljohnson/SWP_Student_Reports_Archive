Title: The Effects of Different Beats per Minute on the Aggressive Behavior of Betta Splendens 

Abstract:
	This study aims to determine the effect of beats per minute on the aggressive behavior of male Betta Splendens. Betta fish naturally show agnostic, or aggressive, behaviors toward one another and we are curious to see how different BPMs (fast tempo or slow tempo) will change their intrinsic behavior patterns. We assigned the betta fish aggression scores in order to quantify their behavior. Our control group consists of the betta fish placed in a separate tank without music for three minutes and the betta fish placed together for three minutes without music. We hypothesized that the betta fish would become more aggressive when the BPM (tempo) increased and that the fish would change their behavior according to different sounds. Our hypothesis that the betta fish will be more aggressive when the BPM is higher was supported, but our hypothesis that music would affect the fish’s behavior was not supported as evident by the paired t test. 


Introduction:
	Siamese fighting fish, or betta fish, are territorial fish that express aggressive behaviors toward one another. When two males are placed together, they will most likely fight to death. Betta fish therefore exhibit agnostic behaviors and should not be placed in the same tank for a long period of time. Male betta fish usually fight to show superiority, claim their territory, or to attract a mate. Their aggressive behavior usually can entail pelvic flickering, tail beating, and showing of the red mane. Normally, betta fish do not recognize themselves in the mirror and will portray aggressive behaviors when placed infant of one. One study found that in the presence of a female, male betta fish will increase the intensity of their conspicuous displays and decrease their highly aggressive behavior delays directed towards the other males [Doutrelant: 2001]. Betta fish therefore are cognizant of their environment and adjust their behavior accordingly. We are interested to see if betta fish will change their behavior based on the tempo (BPM) played. Beats per minute (BPM) is the tempo or speed of a song. The purpose of this experiment is to observe how sound (in terms of BPM) affects the aggressive behavior of betta fish. We are using betta fish since they naturally portray aggressive behaviors and we want to manipulate their environment to quantify their behavior. We hypothesize that beats per minute in a set interval will cause a change in the behavior of the betta fish and that the faster tempo will result in an increase in their aggressive behaviors. 


Materials and Methods:
	The general experimental set-up is described in the BioCore Resource Guide. The experiments were carried out in the classroom and two male Betta Splendens were originally obtained from the instructor. We switched the fish out after every few rounds so that we could reduce the risk of habituation. Before observing the fish, we made an aggression scale for both broadside movements and facing movements. In terms of broadside movements, pelvic fin flickering represented score 1, tail beating represented score 2, and tail flashing represented score 3 (most aggressive). In terms of facing movements, having a pectoral fin erect represented score 1, the spreading of the gills represented score 2, and the protrusion of the red mane represented score 3 (most aggressive). First, we observed the behavior of two males that were not visible to one another for three minutes with no music playing. We then placed the two males together in the same tank without music. These were the control groups. We allowed the fish to rest after each trial for about five minutes. Then, we observed the two males when they were visible to one another, but with classical music this time (the song adagio). We repeated the last step, but with the song humble (rap music). We also placed two males together with classical music and two males together with rap music in two separate trials. All together, we ran 6 trials. At the end of the experiment, we performed three paired t tests with an alpha level of 0.05 to compare before and after observations on the same subjects but with different variables. 


Results:
	After running a paired t test, it is evident that the non-music and adagio group is not statistically significant (0.1478, 1, 0.9066). The group with no music and the song humble were statistically significant (1.0285, 1, 0.4911), as was the group with the song adagio and the song Humble (1.5356, 1 0.3675). A general trend that we saw in the data was that the betta fish became more aggressive as the tempo increased. When the two males were placed together, they showed the most aggressive behavior toward one another, such as through multiple tail flickers, pelvic flickering, and protrusions of the red manes. 


Discussion:
	Our hypothesis was partially supported. The hypothesis that BPM would change the fish’s behavior was not supported as evident by statistical insignificance. This statistical insignificance could be the result of error in the lab or simply be due to the idea that fish might not change their behavior in response to sound as a result of adaptation to their environment. However, the hypothesis that the betta fish’s aggressive behavior would increase when the tempo increased, was supported. Adagio has a very slow tempo (66-76 BPM) and Humble has a very fast tempo (152). We said that a BPM of 140 was high and a BPM under 90 was low. The betta fish became more aggressive when the BPM was higher; when the song humble played, the betta fish had higher aggression scores and exhibited agnostic behavior, such as the protrusion of their red manes. Despite statistical significance in this case, this study can not be used as a generalization of all fish. 

	 In terms of the larger purpose of this study, scientists are not exactly sure how and to what extent sound effects aquatic animals. One study was concerned with the effect of human-generated sound on fish. The study suggested that sound might result in temporary behavior shifts, however, it is impossible to extrapolate these results to all fish species [Popper: 2009]. There were not many studies that were remotely close to our study, so we did not have many options to compare this study to. Sources of error could have included our personal reactions to the fish. Our excitement could have scared the fish and caused their behavior to change as a result. This study should be relevant to everyone as the human race needs to be more cognizant of how our personal behaviors and the sounds we make can affect the behavior of fish.
