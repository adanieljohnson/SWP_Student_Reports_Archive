Title: The Effect of Salinity on the Metabolic Rate of Procambarus sp. 

Abstract:
Chemical reactions take place all the time within us. The sum of all the chemical reactions in a biological system is metabolism. The metabolic rate of animals can be affected by many environmental factors. For example, for animals and plants, the temperature is one of the primary determinants of their metabolic rate. This experiment focuses on the effect of the salinity of surrounding water on the metabolic rate of the Procambarus sp. Our hypothesis is if the salinity of the surrounding water increases, the metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. will increase, and the result did not support our hypothesis. (t (2) =1.869, p = 0.10, df = 2) However, we found past literature and proposed a new hypothesis about the metabolic rate’s change under the influence of salinity, and future study is still needed to support this hypothesis.


Introduction:
Chemical reactions take place within all living things all the time and occur when the atoms have enough energy to form bonds or break bonds. The collection of all the chemical reaction occurring in a specific biological system in a certain time period is called metabolism. Think about all the activities we do daily - if we exercise, we sweat; we eat food to attain sufficient energy for our muscle movement; and even when we inhale air, metabolism is involved using oxygen to make ATP, which is the energy support of our body. Thus, metabolism is a vital and constant process that begins when we are born and ends when we die. The goals of metabolism are to convert food and fuels to energy (ATP) as well as molecules that help build up the body and to eliminate body wastes. (Sadava:2016) 

There are two types of process to produce energy: anaerobic and aerobic respiration. In the process of converting glucose to energy in aerobic respiration, high-energy electrons are released. Oxygen is then needed to remove the electrons that have given up the energy to form ATP at the end of the electron transport chain, converting itself to water. Thus, the amount of oxygen consumed is proportional to the energy that a biological system produces during metabolism. Meanwhile, as climate warming continues, it affects animals’ metabolism rate as temperature increases globally. Research done by Michael indicates that climate warming’s increases exponentially the metabolic rate of non-regulating, innert and exposed ectotherms which rely on environmental temperature. (Michael:2010) 

The metabolic rate of animals can be affected by many environmental factors. For example, for animals and plants, stated by Gillooly, temperature is one of the primary determinants of their metabolic rate. (Gillooly:2001) Salinity is also a factor that influences the metabolic rate of animals. For aquatic animals especially, as the surrounding water might always have a lower concentration gradient of salts and ions than that inside their body, they undergo a process of osmoregulation to keep the concentration of their body fluid. Thus, when salinity increases in the water, they may use more energy to get rid of the excessive sodium ions. Previous research done by Villarreal, Patricia, and Jose revealed the elevated demand for metabolism at higher salinities. (Villarreal:1994) For us, we want to investigate the effect of salinity on the metabolic rate of the ectotherm crayfish. (Procambarus sp.) We are measuring the crayfish’s metabolic rate through oxygen consumption. Our hypothesis is that if the salinity of the surrounding water increases, the metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. will increase.


Materials and Methods:
We used three crayfish (Procambarus sp.) of the similar size and weight for this experiment. First, we made sure the room is at room temperature and prepared a tank of water that has been saturated by air. Second, we filled a glass bottle with the aerated water and placed it inside a dishpan with room temperature water. Next, we weighted the crayfish and put it into the bottle with the top tightly screwed. There is a dissolved oxygen probe attached to the top which is used to detect the oxygen concentration of the water. We made sure that the bottle was totally filled with water. We then recorded the oxygen concentration of the water at 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes after we record the original oxygen concentration of the water. After that, we removed the top and recorded the volume of the water in a measuring cylinder. We then mixed 100 ml 6.5% NaCl solution with 900 ml aerated water and filled the bottle with 0.65% NaCl solution. Then, we put the same crayfish into the bottle again with the top tightly screwed. We recorded the original and the after oxygen concentration again at 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes. Then, we recorded the volume of the NaCl solution in the bottle. We repeated the procedures on the other two crayfish and recorded the data. We used the specific metabolic rate to compare the difference before and after the salinity treatment of crayfish. The specific metabolic rate is calculated as: (△O2(mg/L) * volume of H2O (L)) / (Time (min) * weight (g)) We used a one-tailed paired t-test to determine the result. 



Results:
There was a decreasing trend of its metabolic rate after the crayfish was put in the water of increased salinity. The mean specific metabolic rate of the Control group is 1.1167E-03 mg O2/(min*g) ± 4.90748E-04 SD, and the mean specific metabolic rate of the Salinity group is 3.433E-04 mg O2/(min*g) ± 4.46356E-04 SD (t(2) =1.869, p = 0.101, df = 2) 

Discussion:
The results of the one-tailed paired t-test indicated that our data did not support the hypothesis that the increased salinity of the surrounding water will significantly increase the metabolic rate of Procambarus sp. (p = 0.101 > 0.05). This corresponds to the result of the research done by Allan, Froneman, and Hodgson where the did not find any significant difference in the respiration rate of P. peringueyi at different salinity of surrounding water (Allan:2006) as well as that of Meade’s on red-claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. (Meade:2002) Also, Feng, et al suggest that there is no significant relationship between salinity concentration of water and the metabolic rate of Procambarus clarkii (Feng:2007). We proposed that this is because these ectotherms are well adapted to the inhabiting environments of increased salinity in freshwater. However, as interpreted by Gilles, if the surrounding chemical concentration increases, the aquatic animals will spend more energy on regulating and excreting extra ions that flow into their body down a concentration gradient. (Gilles:1979) There was also a decreasing trend of the metabolic rate after the crayfish was put in the water of salinity from our result. After looking into Swanson’s (Swanson:1998) and Nelson’s (Nelson:1977) study which suggests that the elevated cost of osmoregulation at higher salinity is detectable and that there is a critical point where the metabolic rate of ectotherm began to fall with the increase in salinity, we proposed that the increased salinity of the surrounding water will increase the metabolic rate of the crayfish to a certain point due to the increase in the effort of osmoregulation and then fall because of environmental stress. To get the best result, for future study, we should test the metabolic rate of the crayfish with different concentrations of NaCl to see the effect. Also, on the environmental scale, we should do the experiment on other aquatic ectotherms to see the effect of the globally raised salinity on the metabolic rate of them.
