Title: Comparing Root:Shoot Ratio in Vigna radiata Exposed to Colored vs. Natural Light

Abstract:
Sunlight is essential to the growth of plants; they trap sunlight in their leaves and use its energy to convert into glucose by using chlorophyll. Research has shown that green light causes an excess of chlorophyll to be produced. Plants have to allocate limited resources to the process of photosynthesis and the process of physical growth, and if more energy is spend on the increased production of chlorophyll, less energy will be able to be allocated to plant growth.  The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the color of light changes the resource allocation of mung bean plants. It was hypothesized that the plants under green light would have different root:shoot ratios because green light has different wavelengths than sunlight, and that energy will be different and therefore the allocation of that energy will turn into different root:shoot ratios. Experimentation did not support this hypothesis because statistical tests concluded that there was no significant difference between the root:shoot ratio of plants exposed to the different colors of light.


Introduction:
Light exists on a spectrum, and the color of light affects its absorption. We are attempting to research the way that plants respond to light, and how the color of the light affects the way they allocate resources (Johnson). Because of the ways plants respond to light and their production of chlorophyll and the color of chlorophyll, green light may have specific effects on the growth of plants, therefore affecting the root:shoot ratio. Green light is said to enhance chlorophyll production (Han et al.). Pei-Pei Han et al. conducted a study on the effects of five different pigments of light on the plant Nostoc flagelliforme. This was a similar experiment conducted on a different plant, and their results found that when exposed to green light, these plants had a higher concentration of photosynthetic pigments in the cells. This would indicate that chlorophyll production had increased, and that additional energy devoted to the production of chlorophyll would mean that less energy could be allocated to plant growth, indicating a lower root:shoot ratio. 
Plants located in the understory as opposed to the canopy may have a greater difficulty absorbing green light, as the canopy affects the access to light provided to the understory. This experiment will investigate whether plants will allocate their resources differently when exposed to a different color of light. The biological alternate hypothesis is that if plants are exposed to green light, they will have a smaller root:shoot ratio than a plant exposed to natural solar light. 

Variables
	We will be manipulating the color of the light that the plant is exposed to. We will be then testing/measuring the root:shoot ratio for plants exposed to both colors of light. We will control for temperature, nutrients of soil, water, and amount of available light. 


Materials and Methods:
Materials	
Materials required for this lab are 6 black containers of mung bean plants, clear plastic film, green plastic film, larger plastic trays, and 8 sticks. 
Methods
Plant a handful of mung bean seeds into a plastic black container of vermiculite. Place 3 Mung bean plants in a larger tray. Place sticks in all four corners of the tray and tape them together at the top to for a pyramid. Wrap clear plastic film around the sticks and tape it down so that the entire tray is covered and no natural light can get it. Cut a flap in the film to allow for watering, but keep this covered at all other times.  Repeat two previous steps for the second set of mung bean plants, but use green plastic film this time. Place two trays of mung bean plants side by side in an indoor greenhouse so that the plants have the same access to sunlight. For two weeks, water plants until saturation at the same time every day. After two weeks of watering, remove the plants from the clear plastic tray. Place them individually in a bucket of water and separate out the shoots, making sure to keep the roots attached to each shoot as you separate between them. Choose ten shoots at random from each container, being sure to keep them separate. Dab each shoot dry with a paper towel. Weigh the entire shoot and record data. Take the length of the shoot in cm and record. Cut the roots off of each shoot, being sure to cut at the same place on each one. Weigh the roots. Measure length of the roots and record. Repeat for the two remaining trays of the natural light plants, and then repeat the procedure for all of the green light plants. Use a 2-Tailed T test to compare the root:shoot height ratio and the root:shoot weight ratio of the two groups in order to determine if the difference between the root:shoot height and weight ratios was statistically significant. A 2-tailed test is used because the hypothesis of this experiment is that the plants in green light will have a smaller root:shoot ratio, however, results that showed the opposite would still be notable and therefore testing to see any difference at all is preferable. 



Results:
The results of the experiment showed that the average R:S weight ratio for green light plants was 0.379, and the average for natural light plants was 0.390 (Figure 1). 
Figure 1: 
The P value is 0.901, which means that there is a 90% chance that the differences between the green light and natural light were by chance (Figure 1). 
	The results showed that the average R:S length ratio for green light plants was 0.328, and the average for natural light plants was 0.318 (Figure 2). 
Figure 2:
The P value is 0.780, so there is a 78 percent chance that the differences between the green light and the natural light. 


Discussion:
Both P values were very high and they showed that the independent variable, or the color of light, did not significantly affect the length or weight of the mung bean plants, which does not support the hypothesis that the green light would cause a smaller root:shoot ratio. The graphs also show that the averages between the green light and natural light plants are very similar. This shows that the color of light does not change its resource allocation or affect the chlorophyll in the chloroplasts of plants. 
This is interesting because of the research done by Han, the results of which showed that plants exposed to green light did have an excessive of photosynthetic pigments. In a different study conducted by Yihai Wang and Kevin Folta found that responses in plants to green light are typically low-light responses (Wang), which suggests that the green light would slightly change the resource allocation. The experiment that we conducted, however, showed that there was no significant difference between the color of light and how resources were allocated to plant growth. More research needs to be conducted on the topic involving different species of plants, as both experiment cited used plants other than the Vigna radiata in order to determine if this hypothesis could be supported by different plants.
