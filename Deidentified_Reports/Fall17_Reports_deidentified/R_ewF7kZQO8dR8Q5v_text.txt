Title: Effect of 100mM Tetraethylammonium Chloride on the Amplitude of Gastrocnemius Contractions in Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
This report details the effects of injecting a potassium channel blocker, Tetraethylammonium Chloride, on the amplitude of contractions in the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. Our experiment was done in one class setting and included four frog legs that were each their own controlll, and later injected with two millimeters of 100 mM Tetrraethylammonium Chloride. This report also details the results of our experiment that matched the research done prior by scientists, and simultaneously supporting our alternative hypothesis because of the statistical significance. 

Key Words: Tetraehtlyammonium Cl (TEA), Action Potential (AP)


Introduction:
The neuromuscular junction, or synapse, releases Acetylcholine (ACh) after a nerve signal arrives by the motor neurons. The ACh binds to the receptors on the post-synaptic membrane of the muscle fiber which in turn causes ion channels on the motor end plate to open. More specifically, this binding stimulates the opening of sodium channels due to depolarization. The opening of voltage-gated sodium channels generates an action potential that releases calcium ions that then activate the muscle fibers, and ultimately results in a muscle contraction. Due to the ACh and calcium ions being difficult to measure, a myogram is used in order to measure the force of a contraction.
	Along with that, potassium gates open to a certain stimuli, causing the cell membrane to hyperpolarize due to the additional potassium flowing out of the cell. In detail, the balance between sodium and potassium ions creates an electrical and chemical gradient that functions to transport molecules in and out of a cell, and then, transmit nerve signals to induce muscle contractions. The potassium ion also plays a crucial role in the repolarization of the cell membrane, which in turn is responsible for ending the muscle contraction and allowing the muscle to relax. 
	In an experiment done by P. R. Stanfield in 1970, the impact of Tetraethylammonium on muscle conductance of a frog was tested by controlllling the membrane potential and approximating the membrane current. As a result, it was found that the potassium channel blocker, Tetraethylammonium overall decreased the amplitude of the muscle contraction. Following that, the amplitude of currents recorded during both depolarization and hyper polarization were reduced by 88% when 150 mM Tetraethylammonium was added to the frog skeletal muscle [Stanfield: 1970]. A few years later, in 1995 researchers M. T. Nelson and J. M. Quayle conducted an experiment on the effects of a potassium channel blocker in arterial smooth muscle. Through their experiment, it was found that the muscle experienced vasoconstriction, therefore causing a decrease in the amount of blood flow [Nelson and Quayle: 1995]. 
	Similar to the previous studies, we chose to experiment on the gastrocnemus muscle of  Rania pipiens. With the knowledge provided from prior experiments combined with our knowledge in regard to the role of potassium channels in muscle contractions, we developed a hypothesis primarily based off the experiment done by Nelson and Quayle. We predicted that by adding a potassium channel blocker, there would be an increase in the amplitude of muscle contractions due to the muscle being unable to repolarize, and therefore relax. So — in theory by the muscle staying constricted — we assumed that the muscle would have a higher amplitude until the potassium was no longer being blocked, and the muscle could properly relax.

Materials and Method:
Before beginning, it is important to gather all of the necessary materials prior to conducting the actual experiment. Four Rania pipiens legs, a myogram, a syringe, frog ringer solution, and 100 mM Tetraethylammonium Chloride must be obtained in order to ensure the rest of the experiment can run smoothly. 
	To start, the gastrocnemus muscle and siatic nerve must be revealed so the electrode from the myogram can be properly connected and an accurate reading can be obtained. Therefore, the skin must be peeled away from the gastrocnemus muscle, allowing both the siatic nerve and muscle to be revealed. Along with that, it is important to make sure the muscle and nerve are hydrated with Ringer solution, thus the solution must be doused over both the muscle and nerve every 5-7 minutes. Following that, the frog leg must be properly set up with the muscle hanging at a ninety degree angle by a string and clamp. Along with that, the siatic nerve needs to be pulled away from the muscle and crossed over both the metal wires on the electrode in order for the experiment to work correctly.
	Once the myogram and muscle have been contructed properly, it is time to set the lab scribe specifically for the experiment. So, the amplitude is set to one volt, the number of pulses is  set to five, and the frequency is set to one as well. After this is all completed, the first frog leg without any potassium channel blocker is stimulated and the data is recorded in a data table. This serves as the first controlll — it is important to keep in mind that each frog leg serves as its own controlll for this experiment — therefore, the same frog leg is later injected with two milliliters of 100 mM Tetraethylammonium Chloride through a syringe and stimulated with the same setting as the controlll. This process of setting up the frog leg and the stimulation of the muscle is repeated six additional times — three being the controlll and the other three being the experimental. All results are then recorded into separate data tables and averaged for each stimulation. 
	The 100 mM Tetraethylammonium Chloride serves as our independent variable, and the amplitude of the contraction is the dependent variable in our experiment. Once the experiment was completed in one class setting, a paired t_test was conducted in order to determine whether a statistical significance was present among our controlll and experimental results.

Results:
Our first frog leg displayed an expected increase in the amplitude of contractions from the controlll to the experimental where the potassium channel blocker was added. However, the remaining three frog legs, depicted an unexpected decrease in the amplitude of muscle contractions post-addition of the potassium channel blocker into the gastrocnemus muscle. Through a paired t_test, our p_value was determined to be 0.003 which is less than the standard alpha value of 0.05; due to this, it can be inferred that there is in fact a statistical significance between the results of our controlll and experimental. Our alternative hypothesis states that there would be an increase in the amplitude of muscle contraction, which is supported by the overall data or our experiment, specifically by the first frog leg.
	Generally, most of our data showed a decreasing trend in the amplitude of contraction after the injection of the potassium channel blocker, with the exception of the first trial. Since we performed five pules for each stimulation at 1.0 volt, there was an excess of raw data present. Therefore, in Figure 1, our results of each stimulation are averaged so the difference in amplitude among our frog legs are displayed more clearly. Furthermore, as seen in our graph, the first trial presented results that conflicted with the other three frog legs, but coincided with our alternative hypothesis. 

Discussion:
Our p_value was calculated to be 0.003 after running a paired t_test. Due to the value being less than the standard alpha value of 0.05, it can be reasonably inferred that there is in fact a statistical significance between the results of our controlll and experimental. With this, we accept our alternative hypothesis and reject our null hypothesis. However, technically speaking, our alternative hypothesis is not supported by our data due to the discrepancies present from our first frog leg. Additionally, based on the case studies we evaluated, our results are accurate in terms of  the second, third, and fourth frog legs due to their decrease in amplitude after injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with a potassium channel blocker. 
	By looking at the research done prior in 1970 by Stanfield, and in 1995 by Nelson and Quayle, we would expect for all our trials to show a decrease in the amplitude of muscle contractions after the addition of a potassium channel blocker. However, with the first frog leg displaying an increase in amplitude of muscle contractions, this resulted in a smaller p_value which gives off the allusion that our alternative hypothesis should be supported. In reality, our predicted hypothesis along with the research done by Stanfield, and Nelson and Quayle, should technically have been rejected if there had not been an error in our collected data from the first trial. 
	Furthermore, considering our experiment only consisted of four frog legs, it is impossible to conduct an outlier test on such a small data set in order to determine the first frog leg as an outlier. It is possible that the first frog muscle was defective or there was an error made on our part while conducting the experiment which could explain why there was such a variation in our results from the first frog leg to the rest of the trials. 
	Since the 1970 experiment by Stanfield and the 1995 experiment by Nelson and Quayle also resulted in a decrease in the contraction amplitude with the addition of a potassium channel blocker, we hesitantly agree with our calculated p_value and therefore hesitantly accept our alternative hypothesis while rejecting our null hypothesis. Along with that, we would prefer to run the experiment again with multiple trials in order to gain a larger data set. This would then allow us to run an outlier test and possibly obtain an explanation for the odd results from our first trial. Ultimately, we do not fully trust the results from this experiment since there was such a large variation among our results when comparing the first frog leg to the other three Rania pipien legs.
