Title: Signaling of Physarum polycephalum in Response to Different Types of Sugars

Abstract:
(I did not write the abstract for this report because I was told the lab report was not required before I got around to it.)

Introduction:
In this lab, we plan to examine signaling pathways in Physarum polychepalum. Conclusions drawn from this experiment can help us discover more about human cells as all eukaryotic cells have a common shared ancestry with similar signal transduction pathways. Physarum will be examined because it is easy to grow and observe without a microscope. 

Physarum undergoes positive and negative chemotaxis, which occurs when it senses molecules in its environment and crawls toward or away from these molecules. In our experiment, we will examine the effects of glucose and sucrose on this slime mold. The slime mold has microvilli made of actin filaments, which allow it to “crawl” in response to different molecules or stressors. Glucose has been shown in previous experiments to have high positive chemotactic effect [Kincaid & Mansour: 1978]. 

Fructose and glucose are two monosaccharides which are isomers with the same chemical formula but different chemical structures. This alters the flexibility of the open chain forms of the molecules. The differing structures could lead to differing chemotaxis [Ibrahim et al.: 2006].

We hypothesized that glucose will attract the slime mold while sucrose will repel it. We expect the controlll group to lead the slime mold to grow in a generally outward direction. By comparing the distances and directions of movement of Physarum, our group observed that Physarum had a tendency to move toward glucose as well as fructose. Therefore, our data did not support our hypothesis. Our statistical two-tailed t test yielded a p value of 0.710 for glucose and 0.882 for glucose, so we cannot conclude that our results showed a significent difference in Physarum’s movement toward glucose or fructose. Conclusions drawn from this experiment allow us to see how eukaryotes tend to respond to different sugar types.


Materials and Method:
Acquire 1 plate of Physarum sample and 10 water-agar plates. One plate will remain plain agar, one plate will be soaked in glucose and 1 plate will be soaked in fructose. Label plates. For test plates, create each of the following setups by using a scalpel to cut a 1 cm x 1 cm square for each labeled box, which should be drawn on the bottom of each plate in Sharpie. Create 1 test plate for the controlll group with a square labeled “blank” on each side and a square labeled “Physarum” in the middle. Create three plates with squares for “blank” and “glucose” on either side with “Physarum” in the middle. Create three plates with squares for “blank” and “fructose” on either side with “Physarum” in the middle. Names can be abbreviated on the plates. Wrap each plate in parafilm. Wrap in tin foil and place in cabinet in dark. 
After 18-24 hours, return to plates to record distance traveled by Physarum as well as direction traveled (away from or toward agar squares). 


Results:
There was not a significent difference in the movement of Physarum in the two different sugar conditions. The data from was used to perform a two-tailed t test. In this t test, individual distances were compared to the controlll distance of 30 mm which was the average distance of the movement of the controlll group. The p values acquired were 0.710 for fructose and 0.882 for glucose. Because these values are greater than 0.05, we cannot reject our null hypothesis because the absorbances are not shown to be statistically different. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that glucose would attract the slime mold while sucrose would repel it was not supported by our data or our t test. Physarum tended to move toward glucose but with fructose it moved in other directions, not necessarily away from the sugar [Table 1]. This is likely because the structural differences were considerable, but they did not result in the hypothesized movement [Ibrahim et al.: 2006]. Our p values of 0.710 for fructose and 0.882 for fructose did not signify that there was a significent difference in the distance of movement of Physarum between the two sugars compared to the distance of movement of the controlll group. An error that may have affected our results could have been that when preparing the plates for storage, the agar squares may have slid around causing the sugars to be spread on the bottom layer. This could be avoided by using a different method of placing the sugars on the plate so they do not slide.

Movement of slime molds is often dependent on the stage of growth of the mold, the substrate used for cell movement, and effects of salts, pH and temperature [Kincaid & Mansour: 1978]. In future experiments, we could compare this to a sugar like sucrose which is a disaccharide. The direction of endoplasmic flow changes according to the pressure gradient and interactions of actin and myosin [Costello & Adamatzky, 2013]. 

Results from this study could be used for evidence about whether chemotaxis is linked to any fundamental metabolic process such as energy production in eukaryotes [Kincaid & Mansour: 1978]. Additionally, this information could help scientists see how slime molds interact with different plant and animal species [Costello & Adamatzky, 2013].
