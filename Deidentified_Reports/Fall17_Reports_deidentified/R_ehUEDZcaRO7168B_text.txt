Title: The effects of Nicotinic ACh agonist on the Rania Pipiens gastrocnemus muscle contraction

Abstract:
Acetylcholine (ACh) is a key player in the neuromuscular system. It instigates a muscles contractile process by binding to the postsynaptic membrane of muscle fiber. When it binds, it depolarizes the fiber, which leads to the release of calcium ions, which are responsible for initiating the actual contraction of a muscle. Moreover, it can be predicted that an ACh agonists will enhance the effects of ACh, thus increase muscle contraction. In this experiment, the nicotine ACh (nACh) agonists will be tested on a Rania Pipien’s gastrocnemus and its effects on it muscular contraction. Due to the nature of ACh in the muscular system, it is hypothesized that the nACh agonist will cause the muscle contraction of the Rania Pipien’s gastrocnemus to increase. To test this hypothesis, three Rania Pipien’s legs gastrocnemus will be tested, each leg having two trials. The first trial is the controlll, where the threshold stimulus will set the first muscle contraction, and the second is the experimental, where the threshold stimulus will be tested, but with 0.1 Ml of nACh being injected into the gastrocnemus. The results will them be tested with a paired t_test. Ultimately, the results provide p_values lower than 0.5 for every leg tested, which support the hypothesis made.

Introduction:
Nicotine is known mostly for its presence on cigarettes, however, have you ever wondered what effects it could have on muscles? The contracting process of a muscle is begun by the release of acetylcholine (ACh). The release of ACh from the presynaptic membrane of a motor neuron then depolarizes the postsynaptic cell, in this case being the muscle fiber. The depolarization then instigates the release of calcium in the muscle fiber, which initiates the actual shortening of the muscle [Sadava: 2017]. This information provides us with an understanding of muscle function, which ultimately helps us respond to the question behind our experiment: How does an ACh agonist, in this case nicotine, affect the muscle contraction of a Rania pipien’s gastrocnemus? To respond to this question, we will test how the addition of nicotine on the Rania pipien’s gastrocnemus will affect the muscle contraction. A nicotine ACh agonist (nACh) has been shown to increase calcium permeability, which can lead to a higher concentration of ACh. Moreover, nACh has such a high permeability of calcium that it could also instigate exocytosis itself. [Wonnacott: 1997]. Therefore, we can note that, as an ACh agonist, nicotine has the potential of causing a chemically induced muscle contraction in the Rania pipien’s gastrocnemus. Also, our use of the Rania Pipien fits to answer our questions on nACh’s possible effects on human bodies, this is because it’s neuromuscular junction is similar to that of humans. To respond to the question of our experiment, we will test three Rania Pipien legs and isolate the gastrocnemus. With each leg, we then intend to find the muscle contraction at the threshold stimulus of the muscle. Then, on the same leg, test the muscle contraction at the same stimulus voltage as the threshold, but this time with an injection of 0.1 Ml of nACh into the gastrocnemus. Given what we know of nACh, my group and I hypothesize that nACh will cause the muscle contraction of the Rania Pipien’s gastrocnemus to increase. 

Materials and Method:
To begin, we had to have a dissecting pan, a pair of forceps, dissecting probes, dissecting needles, Ringer’s solution, a syringe, nACh, and an electronic stimulator with the BNC connector (the one with pin electrodes). The next step is getting the three Rania Pipien legs. Now to set up the experiment, with our hands, we gently removed the skin from the legs, starting from the top and removing it like a sleeve towards the foot. Once this is done, we separated the gastrocnemus from the bone, without detaching it from the knee joint, then we cut through the Achilles tendon. With a piece of string, folded in half, we tied a knot at the end of the Achilles tendon and hang the muscle by the string onto the transducer apparatus. After this, we placed the pin electrodes to the muscle, the black one going at the top (towards the remaining Achilles tendon), and the red one at the bottom. We then connected the electrode wire to the electronic stimulator, which is controlllled through LabScribe’s toolbar in our laptop, where we can measure the muscle contraction through the myogram drawn. Throughout this process, the leg should be kept moist with the Ringer’s solution. Moreover, for each leg we did a controlll trial and an experimental trial. In the controlll trial we began by stimulating the leg (in volts) at 0 v but increased the voltage by 0.1 until we found the threshold stimulus. The threshold stimulus is when the muscle contracts and you get a muscle contraction. Once we have the threshold stimulus, we repeat the stimulus at that voltage another three times. After finding the threshold stimulus, utilizing the same leg, we can move onto the experimental trial. To keep the data consistent and easily comparable, we initiated the stimulus voltage at the threshold established in the controlll trial. Moreover, to find the difference in contraction more easily, you begin stimulating the muscle before the injection of the nACh. In each experimental trial 0.1 Ml are injected directly into the muscle while it was being recorded and stimulated. The myogram then illustrates the original muscle contraction in addition to the muscle contraction after the nACh is injected. By this, not only are we able to measure the difference in contraction, but we are also able to see how the nACh effects the muscle’s contraction. This process is repeated with all three legs. To test our hypothesis, we utilized a paired two tailed t_test.

Results:
In our first leg, we obtained an average difference of approximately 0.08567 and a P-value of 0.00187. This shows that there was a clear increase in muscle contraction following the injection of nACh. The graph of leg #1 illustrates that the average muscle contraction of the experimental trial is much higher than that of the controlll. Moreover, the standard deviation bars show little difference, meaning that there were no significent outliers. In the second leg we tested, there was an average difference of 0.3367 and a P-value of 2.74E-5. This conveyed that there was a clear increase in muscle contraction after the injection of nACh on the leg. In the graph of leg #2, it can be shown that there was a greater difference in average than there was in the first leg. Along with that, the standard deviation bars are small, which convey that there we no outliers in its data either. Lastly, in our third and final leg, our results seemed to follow suit with the two previous legs. The average difference was approximately 0.12867 and the P-value of this leg was 4.70E-5, which is very low, and conveys that the muscle contraction averages between the controlll and experimental trials are significently different. In the graph of leg #3, the standard deviation bars are very small. These standard deviation bars are the smallest of the three graphs, thus illustrating that this leg had the greatest muscle contraction average difference of the three, the size of the standard deviation bars, again, show no significent outliers, which helps validate our findings. Overall, in each of our t_test, there was a low standard deviation, and a P-value lower than 0.5, illustrating that there was an increase in muscle contraction throughout. 

Discussion:
The results of our two-tailed paired t_test support our hypothesis. Thus, they illustrate that the nACh does cause the muscle contraction of the Rania pipien’s gastrocnemus to increase. To elaborate, the low P-value’s in all three of our test, as well as the small standard deviation bars in each of our graphs serve to support our hypothesis because they show that there is a strong significent difference between the controlll and the experimental trials average muscle contraction. The smallness of the standard deviation bars further validates our data by illustrating that there were no outliers in our data, showing that it was consistent. Ultimately, the statistical test we took supported our hypothesis, while also validating our data. Through the results of our experiment, it can be concluded that nACh did increase the effect of ACh on the muscle fiber. This can be explained by nACh’s high calcium permeability. Because calcium does allow the release of ACh through the presynaptic membrane, by placing nACh, it increases the amount of calcium that goes into the vesicles, causing more ACh to be released. Thus, nACh increases the muscular contraction of the muscle by causing a chemically induced contraction, as it can be shown through the results of the experiment. Although our experiment successfully supported our hypothesis, to further validate our findings, we could have tested more Rania pipien gastrocnemus muscles. We could have also better portrayed the difference in muscular contraction had we utilized the muscle nerve to stimulate the muscle instead of directly stimulating the muscle. This could have provided us with better data because we would have evaded the risk of the wire disrupting the chemical processes occurring at the time of muscle contraction. However, this was not possible due to the nerve muscle of our legs being too short. In the end, our data results provided strong evidence that greatly supported our hypothesis. This experiment could be further studied to compare the difference between neuronal nACh receptors (nAChRs) and muscular nACh receptors and their difference effects on the human body. Utilizing the findings of our experiment, we know that nACh enhances the performance of ACh, thus, would it have the same effect on the central nervous system neurons? In a study that touches on the concept of neuronal nAChRs and muscular nAChRs, it concludes that neuronal nAChRs have a higher calcium permeability than do the muscular nAChRs. [Vernino: 1992]. This can lead us to conclude that nACh has a greater effect in the efficiency of processes in the central nervous system rather than the muscular nervous system. However, it does not pertain to nACh’s effect on the human body. Another question that could be addressed in future studies is the long-term effects nicotine can have on the body. For example, a study could question the efficiency of nACh when it was first injected in to an organism in comparison to its effects after a few days, weeks, or months. A real-life example is smoking, with which nicotine is often negatively associated with. This is addressed in a study regarding the cognitive effects of nicotine. In the study it is found that nicotine improves cognitive performance, which can be explained by the high calcium permeability in neural nAChRs [Rezvani: 2001]. This study too, however, fails to address long-term effects of nicotine in the human body.
