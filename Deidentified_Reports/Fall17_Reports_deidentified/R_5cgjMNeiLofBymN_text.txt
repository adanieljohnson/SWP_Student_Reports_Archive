Title: Effect of Lanthanum Chloride upon the Voltage Generated in Frog Gastrocnemius

Abstract:
When muscles are activated by nerves, calciums starts the chain reaction that causes the muscle to contract. To test whether calcium is actually this important in muscles, this study tested the voltage generated with and without calcium in a frog’s gastrocnemus. To do this, Lanthanum Chloride, a calcium antagonist, was used to generate the lack of calcium in the frog’s gastrocnemus.  The addition of Lanthanum Chloride lead to no significent decrease in voltage generated by the gastrocnemus. This finding indicates that calcium does not play as much of a role in muscle contraction as previously stated.

Introduction:
Calcium is essential for muscle function in the human body. When nerve cells transmit instructions from the brain or spinal cord, the muscle is activated by the calcium released by into it. The calcium is let inside the muscle, and it causes a chain of events that fully cause the contraction of the muscle. Thus, calcium is essential for muscle activation.
	Antagonists are chemicals that block an element or chemical from binding to something. Usually they are found as a part of of a biological system. Calcium antagonists therefore block calcium from interacting in its environment, specifically in this study in relevance to muscles. One such calcium blocker is D-600. D-600 was used in a study by R. S. Eisenberg, et. al. (1983) to study the effects of calcium blockers upon frog legs. In the study it was found that paralysis was caused in the skeletal muscle fibers that were exposed to the chemical.
	The results of this study formed the basis for our own experiment. We decided that we would measure the voltage output of a frog leg muscle before and after exposure to calcium blocker Lanthanum Chloride (LaCl₃). Our hypothesis for this experiment was that there would be a significent decrease between the voltage generated in the before, or controlll, trial and the voltage generated in the after, or treatment, trial.

Materials and Method:
Set Up
	Three frog legs were kept refrigerated until we degloved them. We then detached the gastrocnemus muscle from the lower part of the leg and suspended it by a string that was pulled taut. Two probes were then inserted into the muscle that were attached to a voltage monitoring device. The sciatic nerve was then pulled away from the leg and attached to an electrical wire that was attached to the same voltage monitoring device.
The Trial
	Electrical pulses of voltage 1V were delivered to the sciatic nerve in a burst of five while the response voltage of the muscle was recorded. The gastrocnemus muscle was then injected with 0.2 Ml LaCl₃. Ten minutes then elapsed for the LaCl₃ to take effect in the muscle. Then the same burst of 1V pulses were delivered to the sciatic nerve and the response voltage was recorded.

Results:
	No significent decrease in voltage was observed in response to the LaCl3 after 10 minutes had elapsed (Figure 1, 1 tailed T-test, T = 4.104, p = 0.0546).

	The treatment of 0.2 Ml of LaCl₃ was not found to decrease the voltage generated by the gastrocnemus of the frog leg significently. However, the fact that there was a decrease in voltage should be noted

Discussion:
Exposing the frog gastrocnemus muscle to Lanthanum Chloride did not have any significent effect. This is counter to the study mentioned in the introduction where the frog leg was completely paralyzed (R. S. Eisenberg, et. al.). However it is worth noting that the data was barely above the threshold for being not significent.
	The results taken by themselves suggest that calcium antagonists, or at least Lanthanum Chloride, have no effect on muscle reaction time. This would suggest that calcium does not play an important role in muscle compression, and that some other chemical plays a bigger role. However, as noted before, the data was barely above the threshold for being not significent, and if the experiment were to be repeated the outcome might be different. To remedy this and to get a more accurate result, it is suggested that the experiment be repeated with more trials and that varying doses of Lanthanum Chloride be tested.
