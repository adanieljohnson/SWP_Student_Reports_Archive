Title: The Effect of the Presence of Food on the Aggression Level in Beta splendens 

Abstract:
In this particular lab, the presence of food on the level of aggression in a male Betta splendens was studied. Through patient observation and tallying the number of broadside facing movements it was possible to calculate the level of aggression of the focal fish through assigning a point system to the movements exhibited. It was hypothesized that the presence of food in the tank of the focal fish would cause a change in their level of aggression towards their aggressor. The focal fish’s aggression was calculated through five-minute observation with and without food as it was physically but not visually separated from its aggressor. It was calculated that in the presence of food the focal fish experienced, on average, a 79.45% decrease in its calculated level of aggression.

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior, known as ethology, allows for scientists to study species and their behaviors through patient observation. It is crucial for one to understand behavior to understand its connectivity with physiology and evolution. In this lab, the intraspecific, agonistic behavior of broadside movements was studied through Betta splendens [Johnson: 2017]. This species uses three specific movements in the broadside position to indicate their relative level of aggression to their contender. The three movements, in increasing level of aggressiveness, are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. In pelvic fin flickering, one moves its pelvic fin in an arc on its side opposite of its competitor. Tail beating is distinguishable by its rapidity and its abnormal amplitude. The tail is bent towards its opponent during tail beating as well. Lastly, the most aggressive of the behaviors, tail flashing is the swift opening and closing of the caudal fin [Simpson: 1968]. As stated by Thor and his colleagues in their study of the chemical suppression of fighting in Betta splendens, fighting behavior can be manipulated through food deprivation. In our study we hoped to manipulate the level of aggression through the deprivation of food of the aggressor and the presence of food in the focal fish [Thor: 1967].  Our studied sought to examine how the presence of food influenced the aggression levels of the fish that was the recipient of the food. It was hypothesized that the presence of food would affect the level of aggression in the male Betta splendens due to their shifted focus from territory to food. 

Materials and Methods:
First, a fish tank was obtained that had three compartments made through separation with a both an opaque and glass divider. A male Betta splendens was placed in middle tank and another was placed in one of the two side compartments. The fish in the side compartment was chosen to be the focal fish while the fish in middle section was deemed the aggressor. These fish were both visually and physically separated from each other. For a period of five minutes, the number of each of three broadside facing movements of aggression were recorded and tallied. Each specific movement was given a number value to indicate its relative level of aggression: pelvic fin flickering was one point, tail beating was two points, tail flashing was three points. At the end of the five minutes of observation each number of actions was multiplied by its respective point value. The sum of these values indicated the fish’s level of aggression. The opaque divider was reinstated and the fish were given five minutes of rest so that they would not become habituated to the stimulus of the other. Next the focal male fish was given a substantial serving of food and the opaque divider between the two fish was removed so that they were no longer visually separated. The timer was set for another trial of five minutes and the focal fish’s aggressive acts were tallied and multiplied. Once the five minutes was over the opaque divider was reinstated and the aggressor fish was given five minutes of rest. During this time the focal fish was swapped out with a new male Betta fish of comparable size and color. This procedure was then repeated for a total of four male focal fish. At the end the aggression values of each fish with and without food were averaged and their standard deviation was calculated. A two-sample t-test was performed to determine statistical significance of our results. 

Results:
Our results showed that the presence of food caused a decrease in the number and magnitude of aggressive acts by the focal fish. As seen in Figure 1, during the trial without food, on average, the fish had an aggressive value of 28.00 ±14.04. Meanwhile during the trial with food, on average, the fish had a value of aggression of 5.75± 6.10. Our two groups, with and without food, were proven to be statistically significant with a p-value of 0.031.

Discussion:
Our data supported our hypothesis that the presence of food would affect the level of aggression in the male Betta fish. The presence of food caused a great decrease in the levels of aggression in all the male Betta fish. It was concluded that the fish shifted its focus from defending its territory to consuming the food. In a study done by J. Hogan, he examined when given the option between fighting or food which would the Betta fish take. Our data consistently supported the hypothesis that the male Betta fish chose food first and foremost. His results supported the data we collected through our trials [Hogan: 1974]. Haller also conducted a study examining the biochemical costs of fighting versus fasting in Betta splendens. Through studying both the behavioral and biochemical changes in fasted and fed fish, it was concluded that fed Betta fish degraded larger amounts of lipids, glycogen, and amino acides; however, fasted fish only broke down glycogen during aggressive acts. Though it is unknown why fasted fish do not degrade lipids and amino acids; it can be hypothesized that consuming food allows for fish to degrade more and thus increase performance. Meanwhile, fasted fish have less of a reserve to utilize for metabolic activities. This allows for better understanding why the fish in the experiment chose to feed then fight—they were increasing their reserve of nutrients [Haller: 1991].  The next step for this study would be to test the levels of aggression in females in the presence of food and examine to see if they experience a similar drastic decrease. In conclusion, it was found that the presence of food lessened the level of aggression in a male Betta fish by switching its focus from protecting its territory to eating.

Figure 1. The average level of aggression, as represented by point values, in the presence of food was 28.00 plus or minus14.04; however, its level of aggression was only 5.75 plus or minus 6.10 in the absence of food.
