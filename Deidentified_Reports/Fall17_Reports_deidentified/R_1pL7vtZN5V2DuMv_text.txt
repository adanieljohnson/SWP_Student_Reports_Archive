Title: The Effects of Lidocaine on Physarum olycephalum Growth

Abstract:
Cell signaling is a process that occurs within multicellular organisms in order to assist in the transmission of information. Cell signaling depends on the type of receptor managing behavior: either G-protein coupled receptors or ion-coupled receptors [Hock: 2010]. This experiment tested the distance in which Physarum Polycephalum would grow with the presence of lidocaine. Lidocaine is an inhibitor that works by moving to the inside of the cell and binding to sodium channels. The specific behavior we observed was chemotaxis defined as the process of movement for Physarum that enable it to perceive the molecules in its environment. We conducted this experiment by taking 10 potato-dextrose agar plates and a Physarum culture, and filled each plate with varying concentrations of lidocaine, leaving the Physarum culture in the plates for 18 hours in order to examine the growth of the Physarum polycephalum under differing conditions. We hypothesized that as the concentration of lidocaine increased, the growth of the Physarum polycephalum would decrease due to the inhibitive properties of lidocaine. Our hypothesis was somewhat supported by our data, however, our results were found to be insignificent as the p_value yielded was 0.067.

Introduction:
Cell signaling is an integral process within multicellular organisms. It is a process that aids in the transmission of information. Pysarum Polycephalum is an organism that contains multiple nuclei that are contained in a single plasma membrane, behaving as a plasmodium or single large cell. While most multicellular organisms have the capacity to detect their environments through hormones or a nervous system, the Physarum Polycephalum cannot. Rather, this organism utilizes signaling as their primary functional detecting aspect. For the Pysarum Polycephalum to maintain life, every response must be controlllled and organized by one or more of their intracellular signal transduction pathways. The majority of the behavior of the Physarum Polycephalum is managed by G-protein coupled receptors, and ion-coupled receptors [Johnson: 2017]. These receptors effectively aid in the cell’s ability to adapt to its environment. The majority of signaling events generate three steps. First, the stimulus activates a receptor or protein that acts as a sensor for the protein. Once this occurs, the receptor or molecule causes the release of a second messenger. The last step occurs when the second messenger binds to an effector to prompt the cell to alter its behavior, thereby causing it to respond to the initial stimulus [Johnson: 2017]. Our experiment examined how Physarum Polycephalum growth would reaction with the presence of various concentrations of lidocaine. The specific behavior being observed is known as chemotaxis, the process of movement for Physarum that enable it to perceive the molecules in its environment and either move towards or away from them [Johnson: 2017] Lidocaine is known as a numbing agent and local anesthetic. It is uses primarily for anesthetic purposes within the medical field.  Lidocaine works by moving to the inside of the cell and binding to the sodium channel, causing a block in the influx of sodium ions [study.com]. We hypothesized that as the concentration of lidocaine increased, the growth of the Physarum polycephalum would decrease due to the inhibitive properties of lidocaine. This inhibition will increase as the concentration of lidocaine increases, the lidocaine acting as a disruptor of overall cell function. 

Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, we retrieved 10 potato-dextrose agar (PDA) plates and a Physarum polycephalum culture. After this, we collected an alcohol lamp with 95% ethanol, flat tipped forceps, ethanol, and a flat metal spatula. We then prepared three solutions of Lidocaine with varying concentrations: 1.25mM, .625mM, and 0.3125mM. Once this had been completed, we labeled the bottom of the PDA plates: 3 were labeled 1.25mM lidocaine, 3 labeled 6.25mM lidocaine, and three 0.3125 lidocaine and 1 labeled controlll. Once the set up for the experiment was complete, 5Ml of the solutions of lidocaine were added to the PDA plates according to their concentrations using a pipette. Water was added to the controlll plate. We allotted 10 minutes for the lidocaine solutions and water to soak onto the PDA plates. After 10 minutes, the excess water and lidocaine were poured out. Using the small spatula, we cut a square (1 cm2) from each of the PDA plates (before cutting into a new plate, the spatula was placed in the ethanol for 20 seconds and then placed in the fire and taken out to cool). After this, we cut a square out of the Physarum polycephalum and placed it into one of the PDA plates. This was repeated for each of the ten plates. We placed lids on all of the PDA plates and sealed them with aluminum foil. The plates were labeled and placed in the cabinet for 18 hours. After the allotted time, we measured the growth of the mold. Once the experiment concluded, we calculated the average growth for each concentration of lidocaine and used an ANOVA test to calculate a p_value for the data collected. 

Results:
For this experiment, we measured the growth of the Physarum. We then calculated the average growth for each group of lidocaine. The overall average growth for the 1.25mM lidocaine concentrated grew 0.00367cm2 compared to the controlll which grew 0.057cm2. The 1.25mM lidocaine concentration caused the largest inhibition of growth. The 0.625mM lidocaine concentration (which grew 0.02367 cm2) inhibited growth less than the 0.3125mM lidocaine concentrated group (which grew 0.006 cm2). After performing an ANOVA and Turkey-Kramer test on the data, a p_value of 0.067. Since our p_value was above the significent value of 0.05, our data did not yield a significent difference between the three concentrations of lidocaine. 

Discussion:
This experiment aimed to analyze the function of signal pathways under the presence of lidocaine, a signal transduction pathway inhibitor. We hypothesized that as the concentration of lidocaine increased, the growth of the Physarum polycephalum would decrease due to the inhibitive properties of lidocaine. This inhibition will increase as the concentration of lidocaine increases, the lidocaine acting as a disruptor of overall cell function. The data we collected somewhat supported our hypothesis. By introducing an inhibitor like lidocaine, we were able to inhibit the process of signaling thus slowing down the rate of growth of the Physarum. With the aid of second messengers, the physarum grew at a slower rate due to the fact that the signals were less readily transferring the initial incoming signal due to the fact that lidocaine inhibits sodium channels from releasing.  The highest concentration of lidocaine did in fact inhibit growth the most and the controlll group grew the most, however, the lowest concentration of lidocaine seemed to inhibit growth more than a higher concentration of lidocaine did. Our data ultimately was proven insignificent. The data did not produce a p_value that would be considered significent as we had hypothesized. It is possible that we did not leave the PDA plates in the incubator for long enough to yield significent results. Additionally, if we did not clean the spatula sufficiently, it is possible that the plates could have been contaminated, yielding results that were not significent. This experiment has larger implications due to the fact that other stimuli of cell signaling manifest naturally in the environment which could ultimately produce inhibition of bacteria growth. Additionally, inhibitive substances could be utilized in order to prevent growth of bacteria that could be harmful, so it is important to understand how lidocaine works and hopefully learn ways to utilize it successfully in the future. Lidocaine is often used within the medical field; future experiments could be conducted in order to further understand lidocaine’s effect on cells. For instance, an experiment was conducted that looked at the effect of various concentrations of lidocaine in the body [Werdehausen: 2007]. Another experiment looked at the effects of lidocaine on the secretion of IL-2 from Jurkat cells [Lahat: 2008]. It would be interesting to test lidocaine’s effect on varying cells within the body to ascertain if there are any harmful effects of lidocaine.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This graph shows a comparison between the average growth of the Physarum polycephalum under varying concentrations of lidocaine. The graph shows that the most growth occurred within the controlll group, and the least growth occurred with the highest concentration of lidocaine. The data demonstrates that there was more growth in the 0.625 mM lidocaine concentrated than there was in the 0.3125 lidocaine concentrated solution. Overall, the controlll group had the most growth while lidocaine inhibited growth.
