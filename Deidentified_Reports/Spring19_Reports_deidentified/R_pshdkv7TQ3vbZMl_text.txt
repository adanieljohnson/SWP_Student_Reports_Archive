Title: The effects of insect growth hormones on the development of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
N/a

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of the insect growth regulator, Precor, on the growth of the Manduca sexta. Insect growth regulators are substances that affect regulatory processes that are essential for normal function. In Manduca caterpillars, two important hormones that affect their development as they grow are the Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). As JH decreases towards the end of the 4th larval instar, this signals the caterpillars to pupate and eventually form into normal sized moths. In this experiment, the insect growth regulator (IGR) used to affect JH functions is Precor because Precor mimics the effects of JH. The Manduca caterpillars are used as a model in this experiment because of the previous extensive research on them and the simplicity of hormone manipulation. The experiment treats the caterpillars with an IGR that mimics JH function and uses their weights as an indication of their development. If the insect growth regulator, Precor, is added to the diet of the Manduca sexta the caterpillars will be smaller in weight compared to the control group that did not receive an IGR.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing between 1.5 and 3 grams were used and divided into two groups of three. Two, 4 cell containers were used for the experiment with one caterpillar per cell. Two holes were also punctured into each cell to allow air flow for the insects. Each caterpillar was fed one of two diets with four caterpillars (control group) being fed Manduca food with about 60 mL of water added using a dropper (Diet 1). The other four caterpillars (treatment group) were fed manduca food with about 60 mL of the IGR, Precor, with a 1:1250 concentration, also using a dropper (Diet 2). All of the caterpillars were kept in 12-hour light and 12-hour darkness at (insert temp) to avoid confounding variables. The caterpillars were checked and weighed daily using a standard lab balance. Food was replenished when needed. Observations and weights were recorded for 11 days. A two-sample t-test was used to determine differences in the average weights of the caterpillars in the control group compared to the treatment group that received the IGR.


Results:
The mean weight for the mass of the control group was 9.03 grams and the mean weight for the mass of the treatment group was 7.80 grams. We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results and a p-value of 0.475 was obtained. The mean mass of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the mean mass of the treatment group. As seen in Figure 1. both groups started growing around the same constant weight with the control group eventually having a slightly larger weight throughout the experiment until the end when they started losing weight. Also, towards the end the control group began to pupate while the treatment remained bright green.


Discussion:
The hypothesis that the addition of an IGR to the diet of the Manduca sexta the caterpillars will be smaller in weight compared to the control group that did not receive an IGR was not supported. With the p value of 0.475 being below the significance value of 0.05 the null hypothesis was accepted indicating that the addition of IGR to the Manduca diet had no significant effect on the development and growth of the caterpillars. The loss of weight towards the end of the experiment was water weight.
