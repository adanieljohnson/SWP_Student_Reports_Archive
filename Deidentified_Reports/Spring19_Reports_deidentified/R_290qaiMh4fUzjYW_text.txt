Title: Chemical Induced Tetany Through the Injection of Caffeine 

Abstract:
Vertebrate skeletal tissue consists of thousand of myofibers which aid in muscle contraction. They work in conjunction with the nervous system by responding to the nerve impulses. The stimulation of the sciatic nerve and the subsequent contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle are used as a baseline for the injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemius. The frog legs were skinned and prepared to be used with the iWorx software. After a baseline was taken, the muscle was injected with caffeine to chemically induce tetany. We found that caffeine chemically induced tetany of the gastrocnemius muscle by releasing calcium ions more quickly. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle exists in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The primary focus will be on vertebrate skeletal tissue. Skeletal tissue consists of thousands of myofibers. These myofibers form muscle tissue to which motor neurons attach themselves. Motor neurons are a part of the nervous system, which is responsible for the transmission of signals which either contract or relax the muscle tissue. Muscle cells, or myocytes, contain myofibrils composed of actin and myosin myofilaments which slide past each other producing tension that changes the shape of the muscle fiber. The muscle activity will be examined when the nerve has been stimulated. The sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle will be isolated from a frog leg to display basic properties of the neuromuscular system. After a baseline is established, using iWorx software, caffeine will be injected in the gastrocnemius muscle to induce chemical tetany. Tetany is the state of constant muscle contraction that results from an improper concentration of ions, such as calcium. The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions into the muscle where they bind to troponin, thus producing contraction. Caffeine has been known to release calcium from the muscle cell. Caffeine works by enhancing the calcium releasing actions. Caffeine has been known to produce a muscle twitch in low doses and has the potential to produce muscle contractions in high doses [Endo: 1975]. By altering the calcium release mechanism, chemical tetany is more likely to be achieved. By injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with caffeine, which a stimulant, and recording the twitch using iWorx software we will be able to get a numeric value of the electrical activity of the sciatic nerve. An increase in voltage stimulus as well as caffeine, the caffeine should create a chemical induced tetany of the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog. 

Materials and Methods:
Frog legs will be used for this experiment. The leg will be prepared, exposing its gastrocnemius muscle for easy observations. This will be done by separating the gastrocnemius from the tibia by cutting the achilles tendon. The end of the achilles will be strung to a strength measuring device. The sciatic nerve will also be exposed so that it may receive the voltage stimulus, by placing a probe across the nerve. Three trials will be run using three separate frog legs. Each frog will be their own control and experimental group. Muscle contraction will be measured throughout the entire experiment: before, during, and after the introduction of caffeine. Each frog will be stimulated with a voltage of 1.0(V) with a probe on the sciatic nerve, and then the same frog will be given an injection of  0.1(mL) of 200(mM) caffeine. The myogams of this continuous recording will be photographed to see if chemically induced tetany occurs or not. The gastrocnemius muscle is then applied pressure with fingers to physically test tetany. The voltage at the highest muscle contraction is then recorded and the averages of each control and treatment trial for each leg will be calculated. The voltage can be calculated to measure if chemical tetany has been reached. Any other observations will also be recorded throughout the duration of the experiment to describe the strength and appearance of contractions. A paired t-test will be used to determine the significance of the data collected.


Results:
The first leg acted as its own control and was stimulated without caffeine. As soon as the caffeine was injected, the gastrocnemius muscle immediately swelled. After the trial was ran, we felt the muscle with our fingers. The frogâ€™s gastrocnemius was quite firm to the touch. The second frog leg was stimulated without caffeine as a control then was injected with the caffeine. The leg felt firm to the touch and tetany was reached. However, as the caffeine was injected, the excess solution along with extra fluid was ejected from the injection sight. The third frog leg was stimulated without the caffeine solution to act as its own control. It was then injected with caffeine and stimulated. Its contractions were very forceful. A paired t-test was used to analyse the collected data, its values (t-stat = 6.0276, df = 2, P value = 0.0264) were then used to draw conclusions. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis of an increase in voltage stimulus as well as caffeine, the caffeine should create a chemical induced tetany of the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog, was supported. Overall, the caffeine produced a chemically induced tetany in all three frog legs. Caffeine induced calcium release works similarly to normal muscle contraction [Endo: 1975] . In this case, the caffeine released the calcium more rapidly that normally, which in turn, results in faster and faster muscle contractions which ends with tetney of the gastrocnemius muscle. Further areas of study would be to inject the gastrocnemius with other stimulants such as dopamine or adrenaline to see if chemical tetney will be reached.
