Title: The prioritization of a reproductive processes over food in male Betta splendins

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior is crucial in understanding the physiological reasoning behind behaviors in certain situations. Betta splendins (Siamese Fighting Fish) were used as the organism of study due to their conspicuous displays of aggression or interest based on their situation.This experiment focused on the intraspecific interactions among sexes to better understand whether a male will prioritize its well-being over the opportunity to breed. It was hypothesized that the male would focus more on reproducing as opposed to obtaining food. The male behaviors were studied during 5-minute sessions with a female as well as in isolation. 20 flakes of food were placed in the tank in each situation, and the flakes eaten were counted and collected. The fish were given 3 minutes to rest after each iteration, and the order of exposure the male was faced with was determined by a coin flip. The results of the two tailed t_test did not indicate a statistically significent difference between each of the situations. However, the trend depicted that in the company of females, males ate less and focused more on the female, which supported our hypothesis.These results compelled us to look further into the prioritization and decision-making process among fish and how they have evolved over time

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior connects a variety of scientific fields, such as evolutionary biology, genetics and ecology to examine the physiological reasoning of certain agnostic behaviors in organisms. Betta splendins, a commonly domesticated aquarium fish known as the Siamese Fighting Fish, was used as the model organism for studying animal behavior because of its clear and consistent reactions in response to both inter and intraspecific situations. Depending on the level of aggression the fish chooses to display, males can display a wide variety of agnostic behaviors. It is observed that in the presence of female Betta splendins, males exhibit facing movements for displays of aggression, such as erect pectoral fins, spread gill covers and the flaring of the operculum. These facing movements are associated with varying forms of aggression, species recognition and possible sexual activity. This variety in behaviors makes its easier to analyze aggression in the organism and can subsequently allow us the clearest insights into the motivations behind their agnostic behaviors. However, these conspicuous behaviors costly fish. Though it does allow them clearer forms of communication that can intimidate intruders and predators, it expends valuable energy that could be used to breed or to discover food. Not only do conflict related stimuli affect Betta splendins, but reproductive settings have also produced a marked effect on male response [Dzieweczynski, et. al.,2010]. Every organism must make decisions on how much they prioritize and expend energy toward various behaviors. Whether it be spent on these forms of aggression, sexual reproduction, or food scavenging to ensure their survival, this study tested whether male Betta splendins will focus more of their energy on a successful interaction with a female or on finding food that will facilitate their individual survival. This study gave us deeper insights into prioritization in organisms and will help us understand the depth of animal instincts. It was hypothesized that the male would prefer the female interaction due to the desire and instinctual response to reproduce.

Materials and Method:
The first scenario which was observed for five minutes was with an isolated male placed in a tank with 20 flakes of food(controll). The other scenario, again observed for five minutes, placed a male and female in a tank with 20 flakes of food (experimental). During each of the five-minute observation periods, we counted the number of food flakes eaten while analyzing the male’s behavior. Following one iteration in a certain condition and a three-minute period of rest, the same male was then moved into a different tank to observe the second condition with the female. This situation was repeated five times, each with a different male and the same female. A coin was flipped before the start of each new iteration to determine whether the male would be isolated or be exposed to a female first. The number of flakes eaten in each condition were then compared using a paired t_test (critical number was 0.05).

Results:
The total mean for flakes eaten in males without the female audience was 2.6  2.55, while the total mean for flakes eaten in males with the female audience was 0.05  1.12. The results of the paired t_test did not produce significent results when using a significance level of 0.05 (d.f.= 8, N= 5, t-value= 1.61, p_value= 0.15). This means that the two groups were not significently different in the number of flakes eaten due to the company of a female. 

Discussion:
Though the experiment did not yield significent results, it can still be noted that the general trend indicated the presence of females altered the individual eating habits males. This data supports our hypothesis that the presence of a female in the tank with the male will decrease the number of flakes eaten, as the male is more focused on the possibility of reproduction as opposed to his own individual welfare. This decision to favor reproduction could be due to the innate sexual drive recognizable among all animals, creating powerful hormonal changes difficult for an organism to overcome [Veenhoven, 1974]. A similar study was conducted, analyzing Betta splendins in their decision to eat food or display aggression to an opponent. Each time the male fish focused more on the food then on the other male, demonstrating an instinctual hierarchy that emphasizes food over territorial conflict. However, when given the option of food or a female as in our experiment, the results showed how the female had the ability to sway the male away from their food source. These results highlight the power the female has on the male and their innate desire to reproduce as she was able to deter the male from the food, while the aforementioned study with just males did not [Hogan.,1974]. In addition, following the female laying her eggs and the completion of the reproduction process, the male will even chase the female out of the protective bubble in which he built to ensure and focus on the survival of his offspring [Jaroensutasinee,.2003]. This strong paternal instinct demonstrates the importance of the procreation process to male Betta splendins and could explain why less food was eaten by males in the presence of females because of this possibility to breed. Though our experiment did not yield significent results, our findings could help highlight trends in intraspecific animal behavior that could lead to valuable insights relating to the decision-making process and reproductive fitness.
