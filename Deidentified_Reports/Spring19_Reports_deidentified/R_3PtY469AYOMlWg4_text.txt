Title: Caffeine’s Effect on a Frog’s Muscle Twitch Response 

Abstract:
There are many molecules and compounds that are required to maintain bodily functions  specifically the nervous system, so molecules such as caffeine affect bodily functions in such a way that affects heart beat and muscle contractions. Responses are relayed through nerve cells from neuromuscular junction, to dendrites, through the axon, back to the neuromuscular junctions as actions potentials caused by sodium-potassium pumps. Calcium is responsible for triggering neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction, so a substance such as caffeine would affect reabsorption of calcium. Without reabsorption of calcium, the muscle continues to contract without relaxing due to the presence of calcium. For our experiment, we focused on the effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemius frog muscle, and we hypothesized that tetany will occur sooner with a higher twitch response when injected with caffeine. Our results supported our hypothesis through the observations of trends and amplitude response of the muscle. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are made up of myofibers and bound together by connective tissue. They are stimulated by motor neurons located in the gray matter of the spinal cord through excitation-contraction coupling: Action potential travels along the axon, depolarization occurs at the neuromuscular junction and releases acetylcholine, acetylcholine diffuses into muscle fibers and bind to receptors, causing sodium channels to open, action potential spreads and stimulates the release of calcium, ATP cleaved to provide energy for contraction, and finally calcium is taken up to allow muscles to relax. However, spatial or temporal summation can occur if calcium is not removed. Spatial summation is increasing action potentials arrive at the axon hillock simultaneously; whereas, temporal summation is post-synaptic potentials created at the same synapse in rapid succession that can be summed. Thus, the state of maximal sustained contraction is called tetanus or tetany. The environment of the muscle and nerve cells affect how the muscle will respond based on cellular mechanisms. More specifically, if caffeine is present in the muscle, then it may cause a response; for example a former experiment proposed that caffeine can reduce the storing and accumulating calcium of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which alters movements when caffeine enters the muscle fiber [Brust: 1976]. Thus, we tested caffeine’s effect on the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle by having a control group and a treatment group both stimulated by the same impetus, but the treatment group will be injected with a high dosage of caffeine while stimulated by that impetus. We hypothesized that if caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle, then tetany will occur sooner, but also with a higher twitch response than control. 


Materials and Methods:
We used 3 frog leg from both the control and treatment group. First, we skinned the leg, separated the gastrocnemius muscle from the leg extending to the knee leaving it attached to the thigh, separated the thigh muscle to expose the sciatic nerve, tied a string double-knotted to the detached end, and connected the string to the myogram. We kept the frog leg moist not too wet in Ringer’s frog solution. We set up Labscribe on our computer and set number of pulses to 5, frequency (F(Hz)) to 1 Hz, and Pulse Width (W) to 5 ms. We put the electrode stimulator into the gastrocnemius muscle to send the electrical signal to stimulate the muscle. We tested one leg at a time, so we stimulated the leg with electrode an measured and recorded the response for 5 seconds for the control group. Then we injected the gastrocnemius muscle with 1 mL caffeine using a syringe right as we sent the electrical signal again for the treatment group. We measured the point before the twitch where the stimulus was added and the height of the voltage response. We used a paired t-test to analyze our data and calculated the standard deviation for each average value of each leg for pre-injection and post-injection. 

Results:
After injecting the caffeine, the gastrocnemius muscle stiffened, and it continued to stay hardened for a prolonged amount of time after the experiment was conducted. We found that the post injection of the caffeine had an exponentially higher amplitude response than the pre-injection [Table 1]. Each leg had different values for  pre-injection and post-injection. The third leg had the lowest of the values, the first leg had the middle of the values, and the second leg had the highest of the value [Table 1]. All data had an increase and reached maximum value at the 4th and 5th pulse. The amplitude stayed increased and did not decrease. We also calculated the mean values (pre-injection=0.187,0.8842, 0.2914,0.693, 0.0972, 1.037; injection= 0.8842, 0.187, 0.693, 0.2914, 10.37, 0.0972). Thus, tetany reached to fatigue. According to the paired t-test, our data is significant. The standard deviation has a small range and less than +/- 1 from the mean value, meaning there is little room for error [Figure 1]. 


Discussion:
Our results support our hypothesis that the caffeine will cause tetany sooner and create a higher amplitude response than the control group. Caffeine is a stimulant of the central nervous system, so it stimulates the nerves to move the muscle, creating a response. Caffeine should create a greater response and causes tetany until fatigue because it affects the accumulation and reabsorption of Calcium more so than affecting the action potential; moreover, the fact that caffeine affects calcium suggests that the movement of calcium affects fatigue [Brust: 1976]. There should be a greater response caused by caffeine since it inhibits the reabsorption of calcium, preventing the muscle from relaxing due to the accumulation of calcium, causing tetany to last longer. Another effect of caffeine is that it increase the oxygen consumptions, specifically in phasic frog muscle. We observed that the twitch response after the injection of caffeine had a higher voltage-peak referring to calcium release [Kovács:1983]. Another research experiment suggests that the difficulty to reabsorb the calcium is caused by the caffeine effect which enhances the release of calcium [Kovács:1983]. This reasoning can be observed through out experiment because it did not take much charge or time to reach tetany. We can relate the effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemius frog muscle to other organisms such as the possible effects on human’s muscle because the systems work the same with the same neurochemical transmitters and ions, but the only difference is the composition such as body mass, surface area, volume, ion availability and concentration. So, for example, we can speculate when a cup of coffee, shot of espresso, or energy drink does to our nervous system.
