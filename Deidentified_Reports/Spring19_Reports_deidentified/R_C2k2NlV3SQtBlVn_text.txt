Title: Effects of Ecdysteriod Inhibitor in the Development of the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Hormone regulation is an important factor in many animals’ growth and development. Often, seemingly random animals and insects are studied in order to learn more about hormones, but in fact, most have similar hormone development to humans. A commonly studied caterpillar, the manduca sexta, contains the hormones JH and ecdysteroids in order to develop properly into an adult. Here we look at the effect of ecdysteriod inhibitor on the growth and development in the manduca sexta. Our expected result was that if we fed the caterpillar ecdysteroids, then it would not develop as well or grow as large as normal caterpillars. Our data revealed that there was a statistically significent difference (through the paired t_test) between the controll group of caterpillars and caterpillars fed ecdysteriod inhibitor. This suggests that ecdysteroids are crucial to the growth of the manduca sexta and our hypothesis was supported. With these results, we can conclude that specific hormone levels can be modified and manipulated in order to inhibit growth. It is important for us to study levels and important hormones because it can help further medicine and cures to hormone related diseases.

Introduction:
Caterpillars and their development have been studied for many years in order to help scientists learn more about hormones. Despite this, we do not know how a specific ecdysteriod inhibitor will change the caterpillar’s development. Specifically, we do know that the manduca sexta is a caterpillar that needs the juvenile hormones and ecdysterones in order to properly develop into an adult. Manduca sextas go through four stages in life that all require hormones. These stages are embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult [Johnson: 2016]. Ecdysteriods regulate the timing of molting during the insect’s development. Many transcription factors occur throughout the molting process and they must be regulated by ecdysteroids in order for it to molt properly [Riddiford: 2003]. Without this vital regulation, the insect would die. This experiment evaluates how important normal levels of these development hormones actually are. When evaluating caterpillars, we question how important different hormone levels are because we have similar hormone systems and it helps us learn more about our own hormones. In order to carry out this experiment, we will inject the caterpillar’s food with ecdysteriod inhibitor and record their weights to see if we have increased or decreased in weight when exposed to the inhibitor. Our hypothesis is, if ecdysteroids are inhibited, then the manduca sexta will decrease in weight as it develops.

Materials and Method:
In order to carry out this experiment, we split the caterpillars into two separate groups of four and each caterpillar got their own cell. One group of four was the controll group, and the other group was altered using the ecdysteriod inhibitor. The altered group was the experimental group. We feed the controll group with normal caterpillar food that we were provided with and added five drops of water to it. We feed the experimental caterpillars the same food, but instead of adding five drops of water we added five drops of the ecdysteriod inhibitor. We checked and weighed each caterpillar every day for two weeks and replaced their food as needed. Each time we replaced the food, we would re-add the ecdysteriod or water drops depending on if it was the controll group or the experimental group. The independent variable in the experiment was the inhibitor and the dependent was the weight. After two weeks of observing and weighing each caterpillar, we calculated the paired t_test with our data to see if our data was significent. In order to use this statistical test, we had to find the mean of both groups, one tailed p_value, and standard deviations. We then graphed the average weights of both the controll and experimental group to see the effect of the independent variable on that dependent variable.

Results:
The average weight of the controll group was 3.57 grams and the average weight of the experimental group was 1.8251 (Fig. 1). The t-value for the experiment was 2.1067 and the one-tailed p_value was 0.03987. The standard deviation of the controll group was 1.163 and the standard deviation of the experimental was 1.183 (Fig. 1). The standard deviation is represented by error bars in Figure 1. The difference in weights between the groups is statistically significent because the p_value is 0.03987. As we monitored the caterpillars, it was apparent that the experimental group continued to have a smaller mass than the controll. The experimental groups mass grew slowly, if at all, and the controlls steadily increased for the most part. Overall, the controll and experimental caterpillars had very different average weights over the span of two weeks.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, if ecdysteroids are inhibited, then the manduca sexta will decrease in weight as it develops, was proved to be supported in our experiment. We observed a significent difference in our statistical data, which correlates to our hypothesis. Since the caterpillars were not able to achieve the right levels of the crucial ecdysteriod hormone, they did not grow or even survive as long as the controll group did. Their inability to produce the hormone must have made it impossible for the caterpillar to continue to move through the stages of its life correctly. Additionally, according to other studies on the manduca sexta, the release of ecdysteroids it crucial in initiating metamorphosis so the caterpillar can eventually turn into an adult [Riddiford: 1978]. This data is supported by our results. It has also been found in several studies that juvenile hormones (JH) are just as important and crucial to the manduca sexta’s development into metamorphosis as ecdysteroids are [Safranek: 1980].Since we found that ecdysteroids are critical to the caterpillar’s development into an adult, the next step is to do another experiment to find how ecdysteroids are affected by JH levels and how significent JH is to the development into the next stages of life. Caterpillars are so closely studied because they, like humans, need hormones to develop and grow. By studying hormones like JH and the ecdysteriod hormone we learn more about how hormones work. The more we learn about their hormones, the more we can learn about ours and learn how to manipulate them in order to further medicine.
