Title: Comparing the Effect of Two Artificial Fish and One Artificial Fish on the Agonistic Behavior of  Betta splendens 

Abstract:
Animal behaviors are complex actions that are influenced by environmental changes via evolution and selection. Betta splendens, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish,  are known for aggressive interaction in intraspecific behaviors. In this experiment, to investigate how betta fish react to the presence of two betta fish in their tank instead of one, artificial fish were added to a tank with a betta fish and observed for five minutes. Aggression was measure through red mane display time. A one way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test was used to analyze our data. It was predicted that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two artificial fish compared to one artificial fish. Ultimately, there was not a significant difference between the display time of bettas’ red manes while in the presence of zero, one or two artificial fish. We were unable to prove that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two artificial fish compared to one artificial fish. We believe that the lack of movement in the artificial fish may be responsible for the lack agonistic behavior in betta fish

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior. Ethologists do not isolate behaviors from one another but rather seek to understand the physiological purposes for behaviors and how selection and evolution have shaped those behaviors. In order to understand an animal’s behavior, long periods of patient observation are needed allowing for data collection, the recognition of patterns and the development of ideas [Johnson:2016]. 

The animal used in this experiment is Betta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish or betta fish. They are a popular fish found in aquariums that originated in Southeast Asia [Johnson:2016]. They were originally bred for aggression due to being used as entertainment in cockfight-like contests [Verbeek:2007]. Later, in 1850, wild species of the Bettas were starting to be bred in captivity and domesticated for aquariums. Betta fish are practical model organisms for experiments due to their highly visual agonistic behaviors. Male bettas are known for being territorial and aggressive towards other males. In the wild, they are found in muddy, low oxygenated and standing waters such as canals, rice paddies, and floodplains. Unlike their wild counterparts, domesticated betta fish are bigger have been bred to permanently display their bright fighting colors[Johnson:2016].

Betta fish show distinct threatening social behaviors while in the presence of other Bettas, especially between two males. Bettas display two kinds of agonistic behaviors: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are when a fish turns to its side towards his opponent. Specific behaviors that fall under this category are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements are when the fish is facing the opponent head to head. Similar to broadside movements, there are three specific behaviors that fall under this category: erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and a red mane. The red mane is created when the betta fish protrudes its branchiostegal membranes, located under the opercula. The red man behavior is often used to measure aggression due to being one of the easiest agonistic behaviors to notice. In response to agonistic behaviors, the opponent betta fish can either ignore it, match it, flee, behave submissively or escalate the situation by showing another agonistic behavior at a higher intensity [Johnson: 2016].

A factor that could influence the agonistic behavior of betta fish is the number of inanimate objects in the tank. Inanimate objects such as artificial fish, lures and robotic fish have all been used in the past in order to test animal behavior such as aggression. Through the combination of looking like and at times moving like natural stimuli, decoys have been successfully able to provoke responses. The more the inanimate objects are able to stimulate their target, in this case, the betta fish, the higher the intensity of the response [Romano:2017]. Often, if given enough time, decoys and inanimate objects tend to lack randomness which often will result in habituation. Habituation is a behavior that occurs when a stimulus lasts long enough to lose its effect; the organism decides that it is no longer advantageous to react and saves its energy [Johnson:2016].

Understanding behavioral changes in animals as a result of potentially threatening external stimuli could lead to a better understanding of animal socialization and communication. In our experiment, we hope to answer the following question: How do betta fish react when one or two other artificial bettas are present in their tank? It was predicted that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two betta fish (artificial) compared to one betta fish(artificial); red mane display time will be used to measure aggression.


Materials and Methods:
Tank preparations:
First, we obtained an aquarium tank with two opaque dividers that divided the aquarium into three distinct equally sized sections. We also obtained 2 artificial fish that resemble the betta fish in shape and color. Next, ¾ of the tank was filled with fresh water. Then, we carefully added one male betta fish to each of the sections (3 betta fish total).  

Control:
First, without putting anything in the sections of the tank, we observed, timed and recorded the time the betta fish displayed its red mane in 5 minutes.  We repeated the process for all three betta fish.  

One fish-shaped object:
First, we added one fish-shaped object into one of the sections. After the fish-shaped object was added, we observed, timed and recorded the time the betta fish displayed its red mane in 5 minutes; the fish-shaped object resembled the betta fish swimming near the surface of the water. We repeated the process for all three betta fish. 

Two fish-shaped objects:
First, we gave each of the fish 5 minutes to rest. After the 5 minutes were up, we added two fish-shaped objects into one of the sections. After the two fish-shaped objects were added, we observed, timed and recorded the time the betta fish displayed its red mane in 5 minutes; both fish objects resembled the betta fish swimming near the surface of the water. We repeated the process for all three betta fish.

Statistics:
Lastly, after collecting the time the betta fish displayed its red mane, we compared the average red mane time in the control, one fish-shaped object, and two fish-shaped objects by running a one way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test.


Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the average time that betta fish displayed their red manes in the control group, the group that had zero artificial fish, was 7.33土12.7 seconds (n=3). The average time that betta fish displayed their red manes in the group with one artificial fish was 7.31土10.17 seconds (n=3).  The average time that betta fish displayed their red manes in the group with two artificial fish was 0土0 seconds (n=3). Compared to the mean of the control group, the mean of the group with one artificial fish was approximately 0.314% lower. Compared to the mean of the group with one artificial fish, the mean of the group with two artificial fish was exactly 100% lower. There was not a statistically significant difference found between the two experimental groups and the control group (df=8, p=0.575). Based off figure 1., betta fish did not significantly display higher levels of agonistic behavior when exposed to two betta fish compared to one or to the control group. Comparing the control group with one artificial fish, a trend of nearly identical levels of aggression were found while two artificial fish produced a trend of zero agonistic behavior.


Discussion:
It was predicted that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two betta fish compared to one betta fish. It was found that betta fish do not significantly display their red manes more while in the presence of two artificial fish compared to one, therefore, rejecting the hypothesis. While there was not enough evidence to make conclusions, there were two trends found in the data. The first trend was that the bettas displayed similar levels of aggression when comparing the control to the presence of one artificial fish. The second trend was that two artificial fish elicited no response. 

	The Journal of Scientific Reports published a paper where scientist studied agonistic behavior of betta fish using two kinds of inanimate and artificial fish. One of the artificial fish was realistic looking, robotic and programmed to mimic the agonistic behaviors of betta fish. The dummy fish was betta shaped and made out of rubber; they were either static or moving in twisting motion. All of the artificial betta fish were capable of mimicking the red mane behavior by using red LED lights as the mane. Their results showed that male betta fish responded significantly more aggressively to the robot betta fish due to its aggressive movement patterns. The static dummy fish was not able to garner any agonistic behaviors out of the male bettas. In contrast with the static dummy, male betta fishes had a noticeable but small reaction to the twisting dummy fish[Romano:2017]. The static dummy fish most resembles the artificial fish we used in our experiment. Similar to their results, our artificial fishes were unable to solicit a significant response. The scientist concluded that male betta fish only display their red mane if threatened. In order to be threatened, they must see movements and signs of aggressive behavior.  In our experiment, the artificial fishes did not move or display signs of aggression, therefore, they did not feel threatened by either one or two artificial fish.  

The intra- and interspecific behaviors of betta fish were studied by scientists who published in the Journal of Animal Behavior. They allowed betta fish to swim through tanks and react to slow-moving conspecific, non-conspecific and inanimate objects. All of the objects provided an elevated response level compared to having no stimuli. They found that conspecifics objects, objects that look like bettas, elicited the same levels of aggression as the other objects. Betta fish did not perceive different levels of threat based on different shapes [Johnson:1973]. Unlike our experiments, the betta fish reacted to the inanimate objects (artificial fish) noticeably more compared to the control. Similar to the experiment published in the Journal of Scientific Reports, the moving inanimate objects that resemble fish elicited an agonistic response. This suggests movement plays a vital role in order for bettas to perceive a threat.  

A potential source of error in this experiment may have been that the bettas could see each other from their neighboring tanks since the opaqueness of barriers did not totally reach edges of the glass dividers. If a male betta fish saw another male betta through the edges of the divider, this would cause unwanted aggressive behavior. This would explain why the bettas display their red mane while testing the control. Our control values look nearly equal to the values obtained by the group with one artificial fish, perhaps suggesting the continuation of aggression towards the neighboring fish.  Interestingly enough, adding two artificial fish, lead to no response which could possibly be interpreted as a result of habituation. The betta fishes got used to seeing each other through the edges and no longer waste their energy reacting.

In conclusion, there was no significant difference between the display time of bettas’ red manes while in the presence of zero, one or two artificial fish, therefore, our data was not successfully able to prove that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two artificial fish compared to one artificial fish. The bettas were not threatened by the presence of either one or two artificial fish. In our experiment, it is important to note that the betta fish reacted to static artificial fish.  For potential and future experimentation, it would be interesting to investigate betta fish’s reaction to aggressive moving artificial fish. Understanding what characteristics of inanimate objects result in agonistic behavior in fish could result in a better and more realistic model of artificial fish which could improve fields such as biomimicry.
