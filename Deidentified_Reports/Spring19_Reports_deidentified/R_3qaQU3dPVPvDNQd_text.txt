Title: The Neuromuscular Effects of Sevin in Rana Pipiens Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
Nerves and muscles are crucial to how organisms react to the environment. Nerves and muscles enable the contract and relaxation attribute of organisms which supports in movement while seeking food or fleeing danger. This lab experiments how Sevin impacts the functioning of a Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius muscle. The lab hypotheses that if the Sevin solution is injected in the muscle of the Rana pipiens, the muscle’s ability to contract will decline significantly. A voltage was applied to the gastrocnemius for the control and treatment experiment. A paired t-test was used to analyze the data. The control group had a 0.946v average response while the treatment group had an average response of 0.339v. The responses relate to the muscles’ ability to contract by letting the flow of electrical current. A one-tailed paired t-test gave a p-value of 0.095, which is larger than the standard alpha value of 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis was not rejected and the results were statistically insignificant. The statistical results show that the Sevin was unsuccessful in weakening the gastrocnemius of the Rana Pipiens. With lack of enough data, this might have hindered the accuracy of the results. Future experiments should maximize the test subjects to have enough data to make conclusions from

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is part of the whole large system called the ‘Central Nervous System.’ Like hormones, organisms use nerves and muscles to respond to the internal and external environments [Johnson:2018]. Both the hormone and nerve systems function in that they enable an organism to sense and respond to the environment accordingly [Johnson:2018]. However, unlike the slow system of the hormones, the nerves of the neuromuscular system respond in milliseconds [Johnson:2018]. Hormones can be found in living organisms including plants, but the nerves are a special unique feature to animals [Johnson:2018].
The lab focuses on the contractions that are enabled by the presence of skeletal muscles [Johnson:2018]. The skeletal muscles of organisms consist of thousands of myofibers [Johnson:2018]. Individual myofibers are found bound together by connective tissues to form functional groups [Johnson:2018] . Within the fibers, synaptic transmissions occur; this is one of the ways that neuronal communication occurs [Werle:2000].The nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction cause the release of neurotransmitters called ‘acetylcholine’(ACh) from the presynaptic terminal [Johnson:2018]. This initiates a rise in cytosolic calcium concentrations [Sudhof:1995]. The ACh binds with its receptors on the membrane of the muscle fiber; this leads 〖Na〗^+ channels to open and consequently generate an ‘Action Potential’ (AP) [Sudhof:1995]. An Action Potential is a fired signal by which neurons of the central nervous system encode and transmit information [Stuart:1997]. Action Potentials stimulate the release of 〖Ca〗^(+2) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson:2018]. The release of 〖Ca〗^(+2) activates contractile mechanism of the muscular fiber [Johnson:2018]. 
The lab experiments three gastrocnemius muscles of Rana pipiens. Rana pipiens, also called ‘Rana’, is a type of a frog. The lab hypotheses that if the Rana’s muscles are treated with Sevin, an ACh inhibitor, the contraction strengths of the muscles will decrease accordingly. Sevin blocks ACh; this should reduce the transfer of 〖Ca〗^(+2) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which minimizes the supply that activates the muscle fibers’ ability to contract [Johnson:2018]. The lab hopes that the results will improve the ways to control the effectiveness of vertebrate pests without completely disrupting their use in the ecosystem. Using Sevin as a pesticide will reduce how mobile the pests are in terms of how much area they can cover.


Materials and Methods:
The iWorx Data Analysis Software was used to record the electromyograms from the frog’s nerve with the applied volts. For each leg, the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve were isolated to determine the basic neuromuscular control [Johnson:2018 ].
Each leg was placed in dissecting pan. Using hands, the skin was peeled off from top to down the feet. The legs were kept moisture with the frog Ringer’s solution. A dissecting probe was used to separate the inner thigh muscles, so the white sciatic nerve is visible. Carefully, the nerve is freed from the tissue, still using hand. Using metallic materials is not recommended because they can damage the nerve. The frog Ringer’s solution is used again to keep the exposed tissue moisturized. The gastrocnemius muscle is detached from the tibialis anterior by cutting, using a scissor, towards the toes. Between the gastrocnemius and the achilles joint, a knot of a thread is tied tightly through. The loop is tied, and, on a ring-stand, the gastrocnemius muscle is suspended at 90 degrees with a tray underneath it. The ring-stand is adjusted so that the leg can touch the tray. Pins are used to pin across the tibia bone, the femur bone and the tibialis anterior muscle to immobilize and attach them to the tray. The pins must not touch the gastrocnemius muscle or the sciatic nerve. The tension tensioner, connected to the ring stand, is used to put a tiny bit of tension to the muscle by making the thread less loose. Next, the stimulation probes are inserted in the gastrocnemius muscle. The red needle probe is inserted in the middle-upper part of the muscle while the black needle probe is inserted in the lower part of the muscle. For better readings, it is important that the two probe needles are not too close.
For data collection, each leg is analyzed for control and experimental groups. For control data, the software is used to apply a voltage of 1Hz is to each leg and recording 3 pulses. For experimental, each leg is treated with the SEVIN substance. A 5mL injection is applied in 3 different sides of the gastrocnemius muscle. A 5-minute wait starts in order to enable the SEVIN to spread through the muscle fibers; the muscle of the leg is massaged for better effect. Again, a voltage of 1Hz is applied to each leg and 3 pulses are recorded. The stimulus is kept constant. A paired t-test model is used for data analysis and the averages for each 3 sets of impulses are compared against each.  For example, the control group had 3 muscles tested and 3 impulses were recorded from each and averaged.  The same process is done for the treatment group. The averages are plotted on the graph and compared.


Results:
For the pulses, the control group muscles had stronger contraction average responses compared to the treatment group. Trial average responses for the control muscle #1, #2, and #3 were 0.68, 1.052 and 1.101, respectively. And for the treatment muscle #1, #2, and #3 were 0.465, 0.156 and 0.396. The treatment muscle had significant lower contraction response. A paired t-test was used to show the significance of the data and gave a one-tailed p-value of 0.0949 which is analyzed comparatively on a standard alpha value of 0.05.

Discussion:
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬The alternate hypothesis was rejected even though the p-value had tiny range difference from the standard alpha value. Due to the results being mathematically insignificant, the conclusion is that they might have been due to chance. The Sevin substance was experimented to see if it can block the acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is responsible for releasing action potentials that cause muscle contractions[Stuart:1997]. The statistical results show that the experimented Sevin was not successful in blocking the acetylcholine. One source of error in the results was that some injected Sevin dripped out. Therefore, the whole 5mL did not transfer inside the muscle, hence a decrease in voltage going through the muscle. Another source that might have affected the p-value is that the lab used only three test samples, hence if there were more repeated experiments a better p-value could be obtained. The p-value relates to how much confidence the results indicate. The larger the sample data, the higher the confidence interval which lowers the p-value. The larger data sample enables the capture of more variation in frog legs. For further experiments and benefits of these studies is that the success of Sevin could open more efficient ways for immobilizing pests, as a pesticide, by making them less active while not damaging the ecosystem.
