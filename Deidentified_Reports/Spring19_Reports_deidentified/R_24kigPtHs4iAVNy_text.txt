Title: The effects of temperature on field pea length and weight

Abstract:
Field peas, Pisum sativum, go through resource allocation like all other plants in order to make up for lost resources due to temperatures, sunlight, or soil composition. The root to shoot ratio of plants is commonly used when determining how resource allocation has worked on a plant. Some plants may grow longer roots in some conditions, or the same plant may grow shorter roots in a different condition. We predict that by increasing the temperature, the root to shoot ratio will decrease. We grew field pea plants for 14 days, and then measured the lengths and weights of the plants in order to determine the root to shoot ratio. We found that the root to shoot ratio for weight was significantly higher in the room temperature environment (p=0.0037; unpaired t-test), but there was no significant difference between the environments when looking at the root to shoot length (p= 0.3823; unpaired t-test). These results show us that temperature plays a bigger role in plant weight rather than plant length or growth. Further research is required to see if in a bigger environment, these plants would grow more. 

Introduction:
Plants are affected by various biotic (living) and abiotic (such as sunlight, temperature, etc.) factors. Abiotic factors lead to resource limitation because of a lack or abundance of sunlight, temperature, win, or soil make-up. This leads to resource allocation, so a plant can survive in different environments or conditions. For example, in a dry environment, a plant will grow longer than normal root in order to access more water. In this experiment, we will be examining the root to shoot ratio in field pea plants, Pisum sativum, that were grown in a hot environment and a room temperature environment. The root to shoot ratio is useful when determining how resource allocation has affected the plant. Previous studies have been done to examine the effects of temperature and root/shoot growth. They have found that warmer climates tend to have shorter shoots and less growth [Lahti: 2005]. Another article found that in arctic sedges, the root to shoot ratio was smaller in plants in colder temperatures [Kummerow: 1984]. However, in Kaspar’s article, it was found that the taproot of a pecan grew the most when at 30 degrees Celsius, and any temperature above or below that showed a decrease in growth [Kaspar: 1992]. We predict that the root to shoot ratio will be lower in the plants grown in higher temperatures because of a lower amount of water present in the environment. 

Materials and Methods:
To begin this experiment, we prepared four plastic containers by packing them with soil and burying nine seeds into each container. We watered each plant with 100 mL of water and miracle-gro. We placed two of these containers in the heated environment at 32 degrees Celsius, and we put the other two containers by a window in the classroom at room temperature. Every day for the next two weeks we watered the plants with approximately 100 mL of water. After the two weeks, we selected 10 plants per condition and removed them from their containers. We cut all of the plants directly above the pea. We measured the length of the root and the shoot, making sure to keep all plants together. We then measured the weight of each plant [Johnson: 2018]. For the root to shoot ratio, divide the root value by the shoot value for the length and weight. We used an unpaired t-test to analyze the data. 

Results:
Our results are fairly similar to what we expected. There was a significant difference in root to shoot ratio weight. However, there was not a significant difference in root to shoot ratio length. The root to shoot weight was always higher than the root to shoot length. The temperature seemed to have little effect on the growth of the plant, and a larger effect on the weight of the plant. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was proven partly correct. The root to shoot ratio weight was significantly higher in the room temperature plants than the hot environment plants (Figure 1; p= 0.0037; unpaired t-test). However, there was no significant difference between environments for root to shoot length (Figure 1; p=0.3823; unpaired t-test). These results are different to the previous studies. This could be due to them having a longer growth period or more space for growth, or because they had different plants than us. We found the opposite to Kummerow’s article, where the root:shoot was less in colder temperatures [Kummerow: 1984]. These results could be due to water not being retained in the in the hotter environment, so the roots weighed more/retained more water in the room temperature environment. The lack of difference between the root to shoot length could be due to the plants only being able to grow for 14 days and a lack of space in their small containers.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Field pea plants were either grown in a warm environment or a room temperature environment. This figure represents the average root to shoot ratios of both the length and weight of the field pea plants after growing for 14 days. The error bars represent the standard deviation (Root:shoot weight in warm temperature: 0.889 +/- 0.175. In cold temperature: 1.089 +/- 0.115 and root:shoot length in warm temperature: 0.596 +/- 0.107. In cold temperature: 0.579 +/- 0.133). The difference in the root:shoot weight was significant (p= 0.0037; unpaired t-test), and the difference in the root:shoot length was not significant (p= 0.3823; unpaired t-test). *************************************************************************
