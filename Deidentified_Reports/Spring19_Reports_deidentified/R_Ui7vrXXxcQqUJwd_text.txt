Title: Averse Effects of Azaguard on Weight Gain in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta is a folivorous pest that inhabits the United States. The effects of AzaGuard, an Insect Growth Regulator, on Manduca Sexta larvae was measured in this experiment. Azadirachtin, the active ingredient in AzaGuard, is supposed to block ecdysteroids, which regulate the molts of caterpillars. AzaGuard was introduced to the experimental group by mixing it into their food, while the controll group received food that was mixed with distilled water. We hypothesized that the experimental caterpillars would not weigh as much as the controll because their molts would be interrupted by the AzaGuard. At the end of the measuring period, there was a difference in weight between the experimental group and the controll group, with the controll group weighing more. Our data does support our hypothesis because according to our statistical test, the weight difference between the groups was statistically significent. 

Introduction:
In this experiment we are testing if the addition of Azaguard, an insect growth regulator (IGR), will have an effect on weight gain in larvae of the species Manduca sexta. An IGR is a compound that leads to abnormalities in insects. It is not toxic to insects but is used as an insecticide. Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is commonly found in the United States and is widely regarded as a pest because it feeds on tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and potatoes. In their adult form they are moths. We introduced Azaguard to the experimental caterpillar’s food in order to study what impact it would have on the growth and development. As an insect like the tobacco hornworm grows, it molts. IGRs prevent an insect from reaching maturity by interfering with the molting process. They interrupt the process by blocking ecdysterone, which regulates when a caterpillar molts. When ecdyteroids peak, larvae pupate. If they are blocked, the larvae may not pupate. A similar study preformed on another type of moth found that the addition of azadirachtin, the active ingredient in AzaGuard, caused delayed effects on development, so our hypothesis is that the Azaguard will block ecdysteroids, the caterpillars will not go through proper molts, and will weigh significently less than the controll [Zhong et al.:2017].

Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta larvae weighing 05.-3 grams were selected. Four were randoMly chosen to receive the controll diet and the others received the experimental diet. The caterpillars were placed into four-cell rearing containers. Holes were poked into the sides of the containers and were labeled "controll" or "experimental". Each cell was labeled 1 through 4. The food was prepared so that each experimental caterpillar received 10 grams of food with 400 microliters of 1: 1250 Azaguard. The controll received the same amount of food except with 400 microliters of distilled water. The food was placed in each cell and the caterpillars were placed in a 24 hour light incubator that was set at 24.9 ˚ C. Each day for 7 days the caterpillars were weighed, their cells were cleaned, and they were given fresh food. A two-tailed T-test was preformed to tell if the differences in weight of the controll and experimental groups were significent or not. 

Results:
The mean weight for the experimental caterpillars was 4.87 grams and for the controll it was 11.25 grams. The standard deviation for the experimental was 2.70 and was 0.845 for the controll. Over the course of the week, the general trend was that controll caterpillars seemed to eat more food, produce more waste, and maintained a more yellow-green color while the experimental caterpillars did not eat as much and had muted colors and one turned brown.  The calculated p_value from the two-tailed T-test was 0.007. 

Discussion:
Our results do support our hypothesis. Our hypothesis was that the AzaGuard would cause the experimental caterpillars to weigh less than the controll. The p_value for our two-tailed T-test was 0.007. If your p_value is below 0.05, then you reject the null hypothesis. In our case we would reject that there was not a statistically significent difference in the weight of the caterpillars. Our controll caterpillars were much larger than our experimental and according to our test, that weight difference is significent. Our data is also supported by a study done previously on Manduca sexta that found individuals that were treated with azadirachtin did not reach critical weight for pupation [Schluter: 1985]. The AzaGuard must have blocked the ecdysteroids. The next step in this study would be to repeat the experiment with different concentrations of AzaGuard to determine what the lowest concentration has the desired affects. This information could then be utilized by agricultural industry to determine the appropriate levels of AzaGuard to use as a pesticide.
