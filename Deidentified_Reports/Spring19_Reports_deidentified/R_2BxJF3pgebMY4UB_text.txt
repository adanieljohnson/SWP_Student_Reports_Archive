Title: The Effect of an Acetylcholine Injection in the Gastrocnemius on the Contractions of the Saitic Nerve of a Rania Pipien

Abstract:
Nerves and muscles allow for the survival of organisms due to the ability they give to respond to different environments. Their ability to do this is a result of the work of Ca+2 channels in the body. These channels are activated by acetylcholine and fire action potentials once a threshold membrane potential has been reached. This threshold allows the information to be sent to the next neuron and eventually signals for movement of the organism in whatever way may seem fitting. In this experiment we looked at how an injection of acetylcholine in the Gastrocnemius of a detached Rina Pippen leg might affect the contractions of the Saitic nerve. Although our expectation was that the experimental leg would react with more force than the controll due to the acetylcholine’s ability to open more Calcium channels, our data did not support this idea, as it resulted in almost no affect at all. 

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to respond to the environments inside or around them. Their nervous system, composed of millions of different neurons, is able to respond to these environments very rapidly due to the myofibers - individual, multinuclear, fused groups of cells which are bonded together by connective tissue to form skeletal muscles. These skeletal muscles are interlaced with motor neurons which join the muscle to more myofibers, creating neuromuscular junctions. Such junctions are responsible for the release of acetylcholine, which allows for the generation of action potentials through the opening of Na+ channels. This process appears in many organisms, including the Rania Pipien, otherwise known as the Northern Leopard Frog: our experimental subject. In our experiment, involving this organism, we will be manipulating acetylcholine levels by injecting more of it into an experimental frog leg while keeping the other untouched. Knowing that acetylcholine allows for the action potentials that travel through the length of the muscle fibers and signal for Ca+2 to be released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. This activates muscle contractions which then allow for the movement of a muscle. This process can be viewed in the controll frog leg, and according to our hypothesis, it will be seen in the experimental leg with more even intensity than the controll. Such results will be able to be seen on a myogram, which is a graphic representation of the muscular contraction, showing the latent, contraction, and relaxation period. We think that the addition of the acetylcholine will cause more intense reactions to the stimulus presented according to its ability to “depolarize the end-plate [of a neuron] and causes contraction [in the muscle],” which could open subsequent  Ca+2 gates, and cause the injected leg to react to the same voltages with greater intensity than the controll [Gerald : 1974]. 

Materials and Method:
Obtain 3 Rania Pippen legs, that had just recently been removed from the body, not ones that had been sitting around. Once you have your leg peel the skin off of it starting from the top and gently tugging until it is past the knee, over the toes, and then removed completely. Lay the bare leg down on the pan you were given and moisten it using the from ringer solution adding electrolytes to it, preserving it to your best ability. Now take a dissecting probe and separate the inner thigh muscle from the white Saitic Nerve, and isolate this nerve by laying it to the side on its own. Now separate the Gastrocnemius, or the lower leg muscle, by clipping it away from the knee and other muscles it may be attached to, tie a loop of string around it and hang the attached yet isolated muscle from the first hook of the transducer. Ensure that the leg is still resting in the pan while you are hanging it from the transducer, and pin the leg down to the pan, creating a 90 degree angle between the hanging muscle and the transducer. Rewet the leg and then place the electrode under the Saitic Nerve and subject the leg to the pulses of different amplitudes, at a width of 5ms, and a frequency of 1 Hz, recording the resulting movement of the Gastrocnemius. Once sufficient data has been collected let the leg rest for about 5 minutes and inject .1Ml of 10mg/Ml acetylcholine throughout its Gastrocnemius and repeat collection steps. Once complete, repeat this entire process with the other 2 legs and record your data. 

Results:
The results collected in this experiment did not show the correlation we anticipated to see, which was one that would have showed the injected leg reacting to the same stimulus with much more intensity than the controll leg did. In fact the general trend of our averaged data was that the injection of the acetylcholine had no effect at all, which can be seen on the graph that follows. In terms of the average standard deviation values, those were almost identical as well, with the controll at 0.25419815 and the experimental at 0.26567907. Additionally,  none of the data collected was significent according the P value of the 2-Tailed T-test that was preformed. These calculations very well reflect all 3 sets of data as we did not have one round that supported our hypothesis and other that did not.


Discussion:
Although we had thought that the addition of the acetylcholine would “act as the transmitter of excitation from nerve ending to muscle end – plate” due to its role in releasing Ca+2 , after the collection of our data, a 2-tailed T-test P value of 0.520 proved that our data was very insignificent [Brown : 1936]. We should therefore reject our hypothesis. This could be due to too little time allowed after the acetylcholine injection, too low of a concentration of acetylcholine, or the fact that there is obviously no blood flow through the muscle, preventing the potential effects of the acetylcholine from being seen. Although the National Institute for Medical Research, who has observed this in mammals’ attributes it to a “low and irregular sensitiveness of normal, voluntary mammalian muscle to the artificial application of acetylcholine,” and although the animal we looked at – the Rina Pippen – is not a mammal, the injection would likely have the same effect on a removed limb [Brown : 1936].  In efforts to verify this notion we could redo the experiment using acetylcholine of a higher concentration, a greater amount of the same concentration, or allow more time between the acetylcholine injection and the testing and see if anything changes, if not, the desensitization proposal is likely relevant to reptiles as well as mammals.
