Title: The growing effects of Mycorrhizae fungi on the roots of R. raphanistrum 

Abstract:
Resource allocation is a key biological mechanism used by all organisms to adapt and survive in an ecological community. Plants must allocate their resources to obtaining water, nutrients, and sunlight. This study aimed to determine if mycorrhizae fungi aided in nutrient uptake by R. raphanistrum, causing their root-to-shoot ratios to increase due to rapid growth of the roots, out-pacing the resource allocation to the plant shoots. To test this question, 3 pots filled with vermiculite were planted with radish plant seeds, along with a pinch of fungi, while another 3 radish plant pots were planted without the fungi. After two weeks of daily monitoring and watering of the plants, 3 plants from each pot were harvested and weighed. The roots and shoots were separated and weighed in order to calculate the root-to-shoot weight and maximum length ratios. It was found the root-to-shoot weight ratios did not produce a statistically significent difference between the two treatment groups, but the maximum length ratios were significently different. The results indicated the alternate hypothesis was correct; that the plants treated with fungi would have higher root-to-shoot ratios. Future studies could examine the effects of different species of fungi on the root-to-shoot ratios of plants. 

Introduction:
For any organism, resource allocation is a key biological mechanism for survival. Different biotic and abiotic factors lead to the need for an organism to shift some of its resources to a certain function to account for changes in the environment. Plants inter- and intraspecific interactions involve obtaining nutrients, water, and sunlight. Mycorrhizae fungi lives in the soil of plants and attaches to the root, where it aids in nutrient and water uptake for the plant. It does so by growing around the root and shortening the distance through which phosphorus must diffuse within the soil [Jakobsen, 1992]. Additionally, the fungi functions to increase the length of the roots so that they can acquire more nutrients from the soil. According to previous studies, Mycorrhizae fungi also allows for increased water uptake into the plant [Kothari , 1990]. The fungi and plant have a mutualistic relationship that causes the root to grow rapidly, so it was expected that the root-to-shoot ratio would be larger for the R. raphanistrum (radish plants) treated with the fungi than those with no treatment. 

Materials and Method:
A hand.f.ul of radish plant seeds were soaked for a minimum of 30 minutes, during which time 6 plant pots were labeled and filled with vermiculite. Each pot was pre-watered and treated with 50Ml of miracle grow. In each pot, indentations around 2-3 times the seed size were made in the vermiculite in which the seeds were to be placed. To 3 of the pots, a pinch of fungi was added to each indentation of vermiculite. Each indentation was then gently covered with vermiculite and all of the pots were watered and placed in the greenhouse. For the following two weeks, all of the pots were monitored and watered daily. Upon returning to the lab, 3 plants per pot were harvested (being careful not to tear any of the thin roots) and gently washed. Each group was weighed, and the total and individual masses were recorded for each pot group. The roots were then separated from the shoots (at the point where the color changed from green to white), and each group was weighed and recorded. The root and shoot with the maximum length for each group was then measured (in mm). The root-to-shoot ratio was then calculated and recorded for both weight and maximum length. The results of the experiment were then tested for significance using a one-tailed t_test.

Results:
The results of this experiment indicated that the general trend was that the fungi treatment group had higher root-to-shoot ratios, as shown in both Figures 1 and 2. After using a one-tailed t_test to test the significance of these results, it was found that he average root-to-shoot weight ratios did not have a statistically significent difference (p_value=0.16), but the average root-to-shoot length ratios did produce fairly significent results (p_value=0.006). 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment indicated that the alternate hypothesis, that the plants treated with mycorrhizae fungi would have higher root-to-shoot ratios, was supported. The calculated average root-to-shoot maximum length ratios were significently higher than those of the non-treated radish plants (p_value=0.006). While the idea of resource allocation would suggest the shoots of the plant would gain more resources, since the roots were getting help with nutrient uptake from the fungi, the biology of the mutualistic relationship between the roots and fungi cause the roots to grow at a more rapid rate than the growth of the shoots by resource allocation. Though the average root-to-shoot weight ratios did not produce statistically significent results, the general trend was that the treated plants had higher ratios than the non-treated plants, as shown in Figure 1. of this report. The lack of a significent p_value could be because there were only 3 plants tested per treatment group, which was a limitation of our study. Future experiments could provide more clear results by tested a higher number of plants. 
	The results support the idea that the mycorrhizae fungi attach to the root of the radish plant and aid in nutrient and water update from the soil. This is consisten with the findings of Kothari and Jakobsen in that the fungi treatment could be useful in the future for increasing agricultural productivity. Further studies would examine the effects of different kinds of fungi to determine if they are all beneficial to plants of if some species can be harmful to the health of the plant.
