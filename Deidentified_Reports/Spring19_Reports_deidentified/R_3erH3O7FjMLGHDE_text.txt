Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone added to the Diet of Manduca sexta on Mass Increase

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of added Juvenile Hormone to the diet of Manduca sexta on mass increase over a two-week period, measured against a controll group. We hypothesized that the added Juvenile Hormone would not only prevent the larvae from pupating but it would cause a larger mass increase. Through this experiment we observed a greater increase in the weight of the treatment group as they were inhibited to continue their lifecycle, but not inhibited to stop growing. The treatment group was unable to continue maturing due to the high levels of Juvenile Hormone which must be absent in order to pupate and mature. This was verified by a one-tailed t_test which determined that the average mass increase of the controll group was significently greater than that of the treatment group. 

Introduction:
Hormones are integral to the maturation and daily function of animals and insects alike as they controll when and how organisms mature. Due to their importance, it is necessary to explore how deviations from self-controllled homeostasis can affect the natural lifecycle of the individual. Manduca sexta larvae undergo multiple successive maturations via molting due to the effects of hormones such as Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, undergoes a holometabolous life cycle, indicating that it experiences 4 major life stages and a physical reorganization during the pupal stage, called metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. This metamorphosis is so drastic that it allows the M. sexta to transform from a caterpillar with chewing mouthparts and legs to a moth with a proboscis. This transition is due to the use of various hormones that controll every aspect of these maturations. One of these hormones, Juvenile Hormone, is necessary in regulating the type of the different molts. It's presence maintains the juvenile status of M. sexta and prevents metamorphosis from taking place. Knowing this, the investigative question: How will adding additional Juvenile Hormone to the diet of M. sexta affect the increase of mass over the span of two weeks? It was hypothesized that if Juvenile Hormone were added to the diet of the insects, the M. sexta would not only fail to pupate, but they would continue increasing in mass, resulting is larger, heavier M. sexta than if no hormone was added to the diet. The M. sexta is an ideal subject for this experiment as they have such a pronounced metamorphosis. This is significent as the metamorphosis is directly controllled by the insect's hormones, so a change in the amount of these hormones would have an observable effect on the ability to transition. 

Materials and Method:
The experiment was begun by setting up the enclosures for the M. sexta. To do this, four-quadrant plastic containers were acquired, and two air holes were made in the sides. Two containers were used, allowing for 8 separate and numbered enclosures. To prepare the food, 80g of dry M. sexta food was weighed and 48 drops of the drug Precor, a form of Juvenile Hormone, were added and thoroughly mixed, then the mixture was weighed out in 10g amounts to be evenly distributed between the 8 enclosures. The M. sexta were then weighed placed into their respective habitats. This was repeated to prepare a controll group as well, adding 48 drops of water to the dry food instead of Precor. The plastic containers were then placed into an incubator, and periodically checked on and weighed over the following two weeks. The observation is integral to making sure that none of the M. sexta ran out of food. At the end of the experiment, the differences in mass from the initial measurement to the last were used to determine whether there was a statistical significance between the mass gained using a one-tailed t_test. 

Results:
Throughout the experiment, trend were able to be identified. From the beginning, the controll group showed a greater increase of mass that persisted during the two weeks of the experiment. The treatment group did not see the same trend, instead experiencing a slower, lesser mass increase, and even some weight low in the second week of the experiment. Our experiment yielded an average mass increase of the group of M. sexta treated with Precor as 6.22g, while the average mass increase of the controll group was 4.94g. These averages were accompanied by standard deviations of 1.82g and 0.51g, respectively.  It is interesting to note how much larger the standard deviation of the treatment group is. Standard Error, the square root of the standard deviation was utilized to communicate the variability of the data when presented graphically (Chart 1.). These values were 1.35g for treatment and 0.71g for the controll. From the data collected, we were able to run a one-tailed T-Test to evaluate statistical significance between the two groups. This yielded a p_value of 0.0468. As this is lower than the alpha value of 0.05, the test tells us that there is a statistical significance between the mass increases of the two groups. 

Discussion:
Through this experiment, we were able to determine that there is a statistical difference between the mean mass increase of the treatment group and that of the controll group through a one-tailed t_test. Though we were able to determine this, the resultant p_value (Table 1.) was very close to our alpha value of 0.05, indicating that, while the difference is significent, it is not large. This is corroborated by Chart 1. as the error bars can be seen to come almost to the average of the other experimental group. This was exacerbated by the large standard deviation of the treatment group. This number indicates the average deviation of the individual measurements from the average. A high standard deviation then indicates that there is a high variability in the mass increase of M. sexta who are fed additional Juvenile Hormone. " Juvenile hormone (JH) is generally considered to have primarily morphogenetic effects which are most often manifest as a retardation of metamorphosis with maintenance of the status quo"[Safrenek: 1980]. This was seen through the additional observations being made throughout the experiment, specifically as none of the M. sexta in the treatment group showed any signs of pupation, while multiple in the controll group had begun metamorphosis. As Juvenile Hormone is just one of a few hormones that controll growth in M. sexta, an increase of it can affect other hormones abilities to fulfill their functions. In normal M. sexta, JH ceases to be secreted once the insect is approximately 5g and allows the subsequent release of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) [Nijhout: 1974]. Therefore, in the treatment group, PTTH was never able to be released and development was stunted.
