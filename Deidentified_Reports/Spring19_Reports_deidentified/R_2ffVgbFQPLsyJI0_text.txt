Title: Effects of Population Density on Energy Allocation of Pisum sativum

Abstract:
Plants and animals need to adapt to both biotic and abiotic factors to live. For plants. population density and space limitation play important roles in nutrition addition and growth pattern. In our experiment, we tested the effect of population density on energy allocation of Pisum sativum (field peas) by using 6 pots with 5 seeds (low density), 10 seeds (moderate density), and 20 seeds (high density) in two of the pots. ANOVA tests were used to compare the root: shoot ratios of plants in the three groups and the results led to a conclusion that the root: shoot ratios might be smaller when field peas are grown in larger population density.

Introduction:
In ecology community, the plants and animals need to adapt to both biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic components are living things, which include animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Abiotic components are non-living components that influence such as temperature, sunlight, and minerals. These two major classes of factors affect everything from energy capture to fitness and reproduction.
By trading off the energy allocation, plants can optimize their energy utilization and adopt a specific plant life cycle for better reproductive and survival benefits when they want to maximize the fitness to live in new habitats [Zu: 2002]. Population density and space limitation may play important roles in nutrition addition and growth pattern in plants [Meekins: 2000]. To understand more about differences in plant allocation, root: shoot ratio can be used by either comparing the lengths or weights among plants. 

In this experiment, we use field pea, Pisum sativum, an important grain crop that is grown in many countries for both human consumption and stock feed, to test our hypothesis that the root: shoot ratio will be smaller when field peas are grown in larger population density because of nutrients limitation. 


Materials and Methods:
We first got six plastic pots and put soil to 3/4 of each of it. Then, we added 50mL of water and 50mL of Miricle Gro to each of the pot and allowed them to drain for 10 minutes. After selecting 70 field pea seeds, we dug small holes in the soil, put 5 of the seeds in the first two pots, 10 in each of another two pots, and 20 in each of the last two pots and cover the seeds with soil (one seed in each hole). Then we placed all the six pots in the greenhouse with fixed temperature and watered them every day with 50mL of water for each pot for 2 weeks. All of the field peas germinated within the first three days, and they seemed to grow well during the 2-week period. After the growing period, we got 4 plants from each of the pot by carefully pulling them with adherent medium of tray and broke apart vermiculite to separate roots. With gently washing and drying, we separated roots from shoots by cutting all plants at the same point, weighed, measured and recorded the lengths (to mm) and weights (to 0.01g) of all the roots and shoots for each plant, and calculated the root: shoot ratios. An ANOVA test was used to compare the difference between the root: shoot ratios of the three groups of field peas. 



Results:
We identified pots with 5 field pea seeds as low population density, pots with 10 seeds as moderate population density, and pots with 20 seeds as high population density. From Figure 1, we can see that the root: shoot ratios calculated by weights do not change much among the three groups, but the root: shoot ratio calculated by the lengths is the highest for low density and lowest for high density. By using weight as scalar, the result of the ANOVA test was not statistically significant from each other (Fs=0.016, df=2, p=0.984); by using length as scalar, the result was not statistically significant among the three groups either (Fs=2.968, df=2, p=0.073); however, if we deleted one outlier and used the length as scalar, the results were significant within the low-density group and the high-density group, the moderate and the high, but not significant within the low and the moderate groups (Fs=4.997, df=2, p=0.019). 

Discussion:
With statistics analysis, our hypothesis is not supported by the data because the root: shoot ratios are not significantly different among the three groups by using both length and weight as a scalar. Root: shoot ratios are different among species and will be altered not only by available space but also by fertility levels, neighbor identity, and sunlight; also, with high population density, competition of space does not generally have greater negative effects on plant performance [Gurevitch: 1990]. 

However, with the deletion of the outlier when using length as a scalar, our hypothesis is supported. Because of more plants in limited space, the plants’ shoots need to grow taller to compete with other field peas for more sunlight; however, with limited nutrition and space, their roots could not grow as well as the plants in smaller population density. Thus, the root: shoot ratios would be smaller for the plants to grow in higher density. 

For future research, we should use more dramatic numbers for the high and low population density to test our hypothesis. Finally, we came to the conclusion that the root: shoot ratios might be smaller when field peas are grown in larger population density.
