Title: Inhibited growth from manipulated juvenile hormones in the [Manduca sexta]

Abstract:
The Juvenile and Ecdysterone hormones are two vital components of development in the [Maduca sexta.]  Our experiment explored the effects of precor and IGR hormones on several caterpillars in the larval stage.  We predicted that the excess amounts of these hormone treatments, combined with above average temporal environments, would inhibit the growth of the [Maduca sexta.]  In order to test this hypothesis, precor and IGR hormones were given to 4 caterpillars, while another 4 subjects were used as controll for 13 days.  Our results revealed that the caterpillars who were given either IGR or precor juvenile hormones experienced a lower average growth in comparison to the controll group.  These results are due to the biological function of the JH hormones, as they regulate the development of the [Manduca sexta], especially during the transition between the larval and pupal stages [Johnson: 2018].  

Introduction:
The [Manduca sexta] is an insect more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. It is known to have a Holometabolous life cycle which includes the egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages.  The juvenile hormones in the [Manduca sexta] controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis into a moth.  In early larval stages, the juvenile hormone is high in concentration until the commitment pulse in the 5th larvae instar stage.  At this point, the JH is low in concentration.  During this stage, the Maduca begins to pupate.  Another experiment in 1986 shows that if the JH is manipulated at the commitment stage, commitment is delayed or inhibited in a dose-dependent manner [Rountree: 1986].  This experiment reveals that increased concentrations of the juvenile hormones will ultimately prevent the [Maduca sexta] from pupating.  For our experiment, the [Manduca sexta] was also chosen for its ability to be easily handled and observed on a daily basis.  We hypothesized that the use of precor and IGR, JH inhibitors, combined with increased temperature in their environments, will decrease the growth of the Manduca. 

Materials and Method:
We began the experiment by creating containers for each of the 8 Manduca sexta.  We used two, four-celled, plastic containers and poked two holes in each cell for the caterpillars to breathe. We also labeled each cell with numbers 1-8, with odd numbers being the controll subjects, with 2,4 and 6,8 being the Maducas with IGR and precor treatments, respectively.  Next, we weighed out 10 grams of food for each of the caterpillars in the controll group. We repeated that step for the experimental group, adding four drops of their respective precor or IGR hormone. Then, we took the masses and lengths of each caterpillar before placing them in their own cell and into an incubator.  Weight, length, and physical observations were recorded for 7 days.  At day 8, the Manducas were placed in another incubator set at 30 degrees Celsius. Once day 13 passed, the growth of the caterpillars was collected and averaged, and a 2-sample t_test was ran to compare each group [Johnson: 2018]. 

Results:
Through observations and the collection of data for the 14 days, both groups did not reach the pupal stage.  Both treatment groups, however, had larger weight and length overall.  Activity in the Manducas decreased as they remained in the warmer incubator during the second week.  In order to observe these results further, a 2-sample t_test was conducted for both weeks 1 and 2 of the experiment and shown below in figures 1 and 2.  Precor weight and length for week one was shown to be statistically significent with values of p= .002478 and p= .037841, respectively.  Week two had no significent values, meaning that all test resulted in a value greater than p= .05.  In addition, figures 3-10 show the the average growth for both the experimental and controll groups for both weight and length. 

Discussion:
From the data collected we can infer that both the IGR and precor growth hormones inhibited the growth of the [Manduca sexta] and created a surge in growth in the larval stages rather than advancement into the pupal stage.  Also, it can be inferred that the increase in temperature to 30 degrees Celsius could have contributed to the decreased activity in all of the Manducas as well as growth. The statistical test reveals hat that the P-value for week 1 only the Control and Precor groups for both variables were statistically significent.  Week two P values revealed that none of the groups were statistically significent.  Therefore, these are not values at which to reject the null hypothesis and fail-to-reject the alternative hypothesis.  These results could be due to the change in temperature from week 1 to 2, and creating more variables that could skew the exact cause of growth in the Manducas.  In addition, the data reveals that there was no change in IGR values from weeks 1 to 2, which also reveals some source of error.  For future experiments, we could increase the amount of IGR and precor and observe further effects on the juvenile hormone, rather than testing both treatment concentration and temporal environment. This type of experiment is shown to produce promising results, as increased injection of the ecdysteroid hormone during a later development stage resulted in depression in the rate of growth [Schwartz: 1983].  This experiment is similar to our results, as the Manducas that received precor and IGR hormones had slower development in regard to weight and length compared to the controll group.
