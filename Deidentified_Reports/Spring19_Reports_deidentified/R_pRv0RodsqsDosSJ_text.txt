Title: The Effects Of Aza-Guard To The Weight And Length Of Manduca Sexta.

Abstract:
Hormones are important chemical elements that will influence the physiological development of human beings and insects since hormones stimulate some specific cells or tissues that relate to growth. In this study, we designed an experiment to find out if the Aza-guard hormones have an effect on the length and weight of the caterpillars and evaluate the influence of this hormone to the life development of the Manduca Sexta. In this experiment, we make the null hypothesis that Aza-guard has no effect on the growth of Manduca Sexta and design a contrast experiment between the treatment group of eight caterpillars and a controll group with wight caterpillars. The living condition and the amount of food is the same and only the treatment group is added the Aza-guard inside. The experiment data shows that the Manduca Sexta in treatment group nearly have no significent difference in the change of the weight and the length while the Manduca Sexta in the controll group has a significent change in the weight and length. This means that the Aza-guard hormones have an effect on the growth of Manduca Sexta that is to inhibit the growth of the Manduca Sexta.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effect of the hormones on insect growth development. Hormones are significent chemical components in the processes of physiological development of human and animals, which are to stimulate the specific cells or tissues. Specifically, Hormones controll most of the insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and emergence of the adult. The passage from one life stage to the next requires molting, in which an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer of cuticle and the old layer of skin is shed [Fulton: 2009]. Insects can change their size and morphology by molting. The development of molting, the formation of the pupa, and the emergence of adults are all mainly controllled by three hormones: Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). 20E and JH together help the caterpillar to molt by each regulating the timing of molting and the type of molt. In our experiment, we use the Manduca Sexta as the model organism to find out the influence of some specific hormones on the growth development of Manduca Sexta. We use this kind of caterpillar as a model organism is because their life cycle and hormone regulation are clearly studied, their life cycle is short and changes obviously, and they are easy to feed so we can controll their hormone levels freely. The regulation of hormone activity was first studied and published by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry. These “insect growth regulators” (IGRS) affect physiological regulatory processes essential to the normal development of insects or their offspring. In this study, These bugs had low egg hatch rates and didn’t mature into adults. It was discovered that the paper towels used in jars with the bugs contained juvabione, which is an insect growth regulator (IGR) compound [Tunaz: 2004]. This makes people try to explore more about the regulation of IGR. In this experiment, we try to figure out the influence of Aza-guard hormones on the growth of the Manduca Sexta by observing and recording the changing length and weight of Manduca Sexta. We use the contrast experiment with a controll group and a treatment group. The null hypothesis in this experiment is that Aza-guard hormone has no effect on the growth of Manduca Sexta while the alternative hypothesis is that Aza-guard hormone has an effect on the growth of Manduca Sexta. All the experimental conditions are the same to these two groups, expect the treatment group has the Aza-guard hormone inside the food with a specific amount. This is similar to IGR’s: If there are Aza-guard hormones in the treatment group, the caterpillars in this group will not have the normal development of the insects. 

Materials and Method:
During the experiment, we selected sixteen Manduca Sexta caterpillars weighing 0.2 to 0.6 grams and 25-29 mm and divided them into groups of four each. Next, we put them into 4 boxes with marks we made in order to record the length and weight of each Manduca Sexta clearly. Each box has four Manduca Sexta, which were placed in its own separate rearing jar. To the controll group, we weighed the same amount of food and all the eight caterpillars in the controll group received the same amount of food. To the treatment group, we weighed the same amount of food and all of the eight caterpillars received 10 g food with the same amount of aza-guard (six drops) inside. All the caterpillars were kept in the same container at the constant temperature. We had the measurement of the length and weight of all sixteen caterpillars after 2 weeks, separated from the box. Each caterpillar was weighed using a standard lab balance. We also recorded the weight and length of each caterpillar. Statistical Analyses: A two-tailed one-sample t_test was used to determine differences in the average lengths and weights of the caterpillars grown under constant temperature.

Results:
All the caterpillars in the treatment group died and they all barely grew compared to the beginning of their own weight and length. But the caterpillars in the controll group grew well. For the weight of the treatment group and the controll group：the mean weight of the treatment group is 0.2362g (table 1)and the standard deviation of the weight of the treatment group is 0.3792 (table 1)while the mean weight of the controll group is 4.9175g (table 1) and the standard deviation of the weight of the controll group is 0.5785 (table 1). The mean length of the treatment group is 0.75mm (table 3) and the standard deviation of the weight of the treatment group is 10.3888 (table 3). The mean length of the controll group is 23mm (table 3) and the standard deviation of the weight of the controll group is 5.3452(table 3). We used a one-sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean of the weight controll group was statistically significently different than that of the weight treatment group (t_stat = 19.1398, d.f. = 14, P = 1.95E-11, table 2). The mean of the length controll group was also statistically significently different than that of the length experimental group (t_stat = 5.3865, d.f.= 14, P = 9.59E-5, table 4).  With the data above, we can find out that both the p_value of the length and weight from the treatment group is smaller than 0.05, so can reject the null hypothesis that Aza-guard has no effect on the growth of Manduca Sexta. 

Discussion:
When observing the Manduca Sexta on the final day, the Manduca Sexta in the treatment group are all dead and they appeared to be around the same length as the beginning. But the Manduca Sexta in the controll group grew well. The length and the weight of the treatment group were all very small in a contrast to the weight and length of the controll group. So, the controll and experimental caterpillars had a different pattern of growth: the Manduca Sexta in the different group had different changes in their weight and length. We had the conclusion that Aza-guard has no effect on the growth of Manduca Sexta. The alternative hypothesis that Aza-guard has an effect on the growth of the Manduca sexta is supported with statistical data. The Aza-guard hormone would delay or inhibit the growth development of the Manduca Sexta by making them unable to become pupae or even killing them. An emergency approach to insect pest controll is the use of substances adversely affect insect growth and development [Tunaz: 2004]. According to research from Tunaz, the Aza-guard hormone is also this kind of substances that adversely affect insect growth and development. The existence of Aza-guard hormones will delay or inhibit the caterpillars from becoming pupae or even making them dead.
