Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Rana Papien Muscle Contraction Strength

Abstract:
The Rana Papien is a small green and brown frog commonly found in North America. Its easy accessibility and incredible muscle strength make it a good if not ideal species for the study of muscle contractions. The nervous system is a communication network special to the animal kingdom that allows an organism to sense and respond to internal and external stimuli within milliseconds. The signals that the nervous system uses are action potentials that go through neurons releasing neurotransmitters; for muscle contraction, the neurotransmitter is acetylcholine (ACh). The groups' hypothesis is that caffeine will increase the strength in muscle contraction; this will be due to caffeine causing a flood of calcium cations to the myofibrils causing constant and faster muscle contractions. The hypothesis was tested by recording the muscle contraction strength before and after an injection of caffeine. With a p-value calculated by using a 1-tailed paired T-test, the results from the experiment showed statistical significance between the two trials as the p-value was lower than our α of 0.05, therefore rejecting our null hypothesis. The relevance of this study can be to help prevent any athletic dishonesty by preventing the use of caffeine as a muscle enhancer.

Introduction:
The animal kingdom is greatly differentiated from other kingdoms by the use of the nervous system. The nervous system is a communication network within the organism that allows them to sense and respond to internal and external stimuli within milliseconds. The signals that the nervous system uses are action potentials that go through neurons that release neurotransmitters; for muscle contraction, it is acetylcholine (ACh). Acetylcholine then travels through the synaptic gap, which is the space between neurons that neurotransmitters travel, triggering the opening voltage-gated sodium channels. The sodium channels upon being depolarized release calcium cations (Ca2+) that bind to troponin, that when at rest block the actin-myosin binding site. When the calcium binds to troponin it allows for the tropomyosin-binding sites to open and cross-bridge formation between the actin and myosin occurs causing muscle contractions [Johnson: 2016].
	Muscles consist of actin and myosin which are arranged into cylindrical, multinuclear fused aggregates called myofibrils. These cells make up the skeletal muscles in invertebrates and vertebrates when bound together. When a group of axon terminals branch out to myofibrils and innervate them, these are neuromuscular junctions. 
	Myograms are graphic representations of myofibril contractions and therefore muscle movement. Myograms show us the strength of the muscle contractions by the differences in the recorded amplitudes of the peaks. Myograms can also differentiate between muscle exhaustion and relaxation by the way it presents the graph.
	The Northern Leopard Frog or Rana Papien is a small green and brown frog commonly found in North America. The Rana Papiens’ incredible jumping abilities have been attributed to the amount of force exerted by its hind legs. Its easy accessibility and incredible muscle strength make it a good if not ideal species for the study of muscle contractions [Kargo & Rome: 2002].
 	Caffeine is a nervous system stimulant that upon reaching the brain causes alertness. It is commonly used to treat drowsiness, headaches and migraines. When too much is taken it can reverse the effects and cause headaches.
	The groups' hypothesis is that caffeine will increase the strength in muscle contraction due to it being a nervous system stimulant. Due to caffeine impacting alertness/awareness we are hoping this is in correlation to quicker responses or stronger contractions. The caffeine on a cellular level causes flooding of calcium cations on the myofibrils causing constant and faster muscle contractions as the binding sites are for a period of time unblocked.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, the experiment was conducted at room temperature with normal lighting. To being 3 Rana Papien legs were obtained and skinned as preparation. The sciatic nerve was then isolated from the thigh muscle without letting the nerve touch metal.
	The gastrocnemius muscle was separated, and the knee end of the gastrocnemius was severed from the tendon. The gastrocnemius was pulled through a string knot that was looped around the hooks of the myogram machine, making sure that the muscle made a ninety-degree angle with the rest of the leg.
	The electrodes were then placed on the sciatic nerve of the first leg and received five shocks of 1V and the contractions were recorded using the myogram. After the five voltages were administered, 0.1mL of a 200mM concentrated solution of caffeine were injected into the gastrocnemius using a needle. Another five voltages were administered and recorded.
	The whole experiment was repeated for the remaining two legs in quick succession to maintain the sciatic nerve moist and in optimal condition.


Results:
In all of the trials, the after caffeine injection trials had stronger contractions than the first tests. Most of the muscles also showed progressive fatigue with the exception of the 2nd frogs after caffeine injection trials in which the muscle contractions continued to increase.
	The mean contraction for the before caffeine injection trials was of 0.75; the after caffeine injection trials had an average contraction of 1.29.
The data from the experiment gave us statistical evidence to reject the groups null hypothesis which was that caffeine would have no effect on the muscle strength contraction. The results of the 1-tailed paired T-test gave us, (t-stat =-13.75; df =14; p =7.98E-10), meaning that there was statistical significance between the two trials. With the data provided we can say that the differences observed between the two trials isn’t due to random chance alone as our p-value was lower than that of our α which had a value of 0.05.


Discussion:
As our p-value was lower than our α-value our null hypothesis is rejected. This allows us to say that caffeine does impact the strength in muscle contraction and that the differences in the trials were not just by random chance. Ways that caffeine may have increased muscle contraction strength include the ability to allow a constant presence of calcium cations needed for cross-bridge formation and allowing an easier breaking of adipose cells that contain high amounts ATP which can then be used for more muscle contraction.
	The real world applications of the experiment include a variety of things, such as that of the prevention of cheatings within sports. As caffeine is a nervous system stimulant and increases muscle contraction strength, some athletes may use this to enhance their performance during an event or competition [Grgic: 2018].
For future testing, we would make sure that the frog legs stay hydrated as the sciatic nerve suffers and don’t have the same response if it's not moisturized. Therefore, the best way to test in triplicate would be to test all three legs at the same time so that all legs are equally hydrated and have a similar amount of ATP as they have all had the same conditions. The experiment could also be built upon by changing the molarity/concentration of the caffeine injected as 200mM might be too strong as muscle fatigue started to be seen in two out of the three legs tested.
