Title: Influence of Herbivory on Resource Allocation of Radish

Abstract:
Plants need to regulate their resource allocation in response to herbivory since there are​ limited energy and resource in nature. With changing environment and predators, it is important to understand how plants alter their development in response to the loss of crucial parts. Here we look at the effect of herbivory on the resource allocation of a plant, Radish. The hypothesis was that if there is herbivory, then the root versus shoot ratio in terms of plant length will decrease. We didn’t have enough evidence to confidently support this hypothesis by our data since the test results didn’t show a significent difference in mean root versus shoot ratio of the two groups. This non-significance, along with our test result that there is also no significent difference between the root versus shoot ratio in terms of plant mass of the two groups, suggests that plants would regulate their resource allocation after herbivory to recover to the original healthy level. This adaptation allows Radish to be better prepared for herbivory. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is important to plants because of the limited resource in the environment around the plants. Plants can change how they allocate their resources based on environmental condition, a property called phenotypic plasticity. [Johnson: 2018] The root of the plant serves as the primary absorptive organ for water and minerals in the soil, and it also anchors the plant in soil. [Davies: 1992] The shoot of a plant includes leaves and stems, which are the photosynthetic organs and the principal supporting structure. [Johnson: 2018] This experiment evaluates the influence of herbivory on resource allocation of plant Radish (Raphanus sativus L). The reason why Radish is used in this experiment is that it can grow from seed to mature plant in a short period of time, about one week, and it is environmentally safe for laboratory uses. Also, it can be raised in the greenhouse easily since it is adaptive in environmental conditions that are easy to replicate. [Farrar: 1980] Herbivory is defined as ingestion of plant material, not its assimilation, and includes the effect of all major herbivores; and it could consume a sufficiently large proportion of primary production of a plant. [Cyr: 1993] Accordingly, the plant would use the carbon and nutrient reserved to replace tissue lost through compensatory growth. [Bryant: 1983] This experiment treats the radish with an increased level of herbivory. The change in resource allocation can be measured​ by the change in root versus shoot ratio in terms of length. [Johnson: 2018] The hypothesis is that if there is herbivory, then the root versus shoot ratio in terms of length will decrease. The dependent variable is the root versus shoot ratio in terms of length, and the independent variable is the level of herbivory.

Materials and Method:
Four pots of Radish were randoMly assigned to two groups: two in the controll group, and the other two in the experimental group.
The controll group represented no herbivory, and we let the Radish grow by itself without herbivory intervention.
The experimental group represented herbivory presented. And in the middle of the experiment (after one week), we cut out half of the leaves on each Radish to imitate herbivory.
The two groups were kept growing in the same condition of sunlight, temperature, and we watered them once per two days.
The weight of the leaves that we cut off was recorded.
At the end of the experiment, we harvested three Radish in each pot by carefully pulling the Radish with coherent medium out of the tray.
The vermiculite was broken to separate the roots.
Then the Radish is​ washed in a container of water and dried with paper towel.
We weighed the whole Radish and record the weight.
The roots were separated from the shoots by cutting each Radish apart at the root-shoot junction. (Each Radish was cut at the same location)
Then we weighed the shoots and calculated the mass of the root, total mass minus shoot mass.
Root versus shoot value in terms of mass is calculated.
We also measured the maximum shoot length and root length to the nearest mm and calculated the root versus shoot ratio in terms of length.
The statistical test we used was a two sample, one-sided t_test.

Results:
The mean root versus shoot ratio in terms of length of the group treated with herbivory is 1.05282883 and the mean root versus shoot ratio in terms of length of the group treated without herbivory is 1.283781566. (Figure 1)
The standard deviation for root versus shoot ratio in terms of length of the group treated with herbivory is 0.3872761699 and the standard deviation for root versus shoot ratio in terms of length of the group treated without herbivory is 0.2427784867. 
The one-tailed two sample t_test results is that: t-value is 1.237668; p_value is 0.122055.
We also noticed that there was no big difference between the mass of the Radish with herbivory plus the leaves that have been cut off and the mass of the Radish without herbivory.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if the if there is herbivory, then the root versus shoot ratio in terms of length will decrease, was not supported by the experiment results. We didn’t observe significent different at the 0.05 level, suggesting that there was no significent difference between the root versus shoot ratio in terms of length of the group with herbivory and the group without herbivory. That means an increased level of herbivory would not cause a change in Radish’s resource allocation. This result, combined with the observation that there was also no significent difference between the root versus shoot ratio in term of the mass of the herbivory group and the group without herbivory, shows that Radish would alter their allocation method and regulate their reserved resource to help the damaged leaves to recover. [Bryant: 1983] Therefore, we could not notice any difference from the outside. The non-significent difference in mass maybe is because that Radish that experienced herbivory kept absorbing new nutrients from the soil to help recover the damage while the Radish group that didn’t experience herbivory had no need to absorb new nutrients. [Alam: 1999] Also, the non-significent result could be caused by the short length of the experiment. Our experiment only continued for two weeks and only stimulated one herbivory behavior. If the duration is longer, then the Radish may not be able to recover from the damage of the herbivory rapidly enough to keep the mass and length the same as the group of Radish without experiencing herbivory. Future researches may want to make the experiment duration long enough to see a ​significent difference. Understanding the influence of herbivory on Radish resource allocation would help human beings preserve the plants grow in the wild.
