Title: Impact of Tank Size on the Frequency and Duration of Agonistic Behaviors in Bettas

Abstract:
Behaviors are a response to a specific stimulus that can help a species find a mating partner, get food, but inevitably help an individual or a species survive. Agonistic or aggressive behaviors are also responsible for the fitness of individuals and the overall success of a species. Betta splendins is a fish known to portray many types of agnostic behaviors; one is the presentation of a red mane to fend of interspecific and intraspecific competition. It was hypothesized that male bettas would portray the red mane agnostic behavior quicker and longer in a smaller tank. Fishes were timed over a five-minute interval with a transparent barrier between them. The time it took for the male to present the red mane and the duration that the betta presented the mane were observed and recorded using stopwatches. Even though the trends of the data supported the hypothesis, there was no statistical difference between for both the time till the first presentation of the red mane and its duration over the time interval and leads to a conclusion that there is no effect of tank size on agnostic behavior. Measuring the levels of testosterone could help minimize variability in data due to the overall difference in behaviors in individuals and only observing one agnostic behavior.

Introduction:
Behaviors are defined as a response to certain stimuli, whatever that stimulus may be. Behaviors between a species, such as courtship rituals or singing can help an individual become more fit by increasing its chances of mating [Ota: 2018]. Aggressive behaviors also help with mating in species or can improve the survival of a species when dealing with competition from neighboring species [Boose: 2018]. It is important to study animal behaviors (ethology) because they can help us understand how certain behaviors evolved and increased or decreased the fitness of an animal [Scopece: 2019]. Studying animal behaviors can also generate a clearer picture of the intersection of behavior and an organism’s anatomy and physiology, especially in sexually dimorphic species.

Betta splendins, also called Bettas or Siamese fighting fish, are animals that have observable agnostic or aggressive behaviors. Bettas have been shown to perform agnostic behaviors between each other (intraspecific) and for other fish species (interspecific). There are two main movements for the agnostic behaviors: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are performed when a fish turns its side toward its opponent. There are three broadside movements: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing (in order of aggressiveness). There are also three facing movements: facing an opponent with the pectoral fins erect, spreading out its gill covers (opercula), and finally protruding the branchiostegal membrane to form a “red mane” like structure. There are also other generic threat-like behaviors bettas perform such as raising the dorsal fin, darkening the skin, and darting [Johnson: 2016].

We will be observing whether the size of the fish tank will impact the time it takes a betta to first present an agnostics behavior (specifically the presence of the red mane), and how long that presentation of agnostic behaviors will last during a given time interval. In the smaller tanks the fish will have the probability of seeing each other more, which will result in a quicker first presentation of the red mane, and a longer duration of the behavior as well.  


Materials and Method:
The square area of the small tank was 24 square inches, while the square area of the large tank was 105 square inches (the square area for one fish). Between each trial, the fish rested for five minutes to reduce habituation and maximize the agnostic behaviors that were presented. When the resting time was over, the opaque barrier was lifted, now that the two betta males can see each other. For each trial, only one male was being observed, which resulted in three replicates for each of the male bettas for each condition. The time it took for the male to present the red mane and the duration that the betta presented the mane were observed and recorded using stopwatches. Each trial lasted five minutes, and that was the standard time interval in which the A two-tailed paired T-test was run to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between the time for the first red mane presentation and the duration of the red mane presentation between male bettas in a small tank compared to a larger tank.

Results:
The time till the first presentation of the red mane and the duration of the red mane presentation in a five-minute interval was observed and analyzed for each fish. When the bettas were in the small tank, on average it took them 22.7 ± 31.8 seconds compared to 30.7 ± 34.5 seconds in the large times (Figure 1). However, the times of the first presentation of red mane between the small and large tanks was found to be not a statistically significent difference (t_stat: 1.84, d.f.: 2, p_value: 0.208). The overall average duration of the red mane presentation in the small tanks were 132.7 ± 116.6 seconds and 101.3 ± 92.1 seconds in the large tanks. But there was found to be no statistically significent difference between the duration of the red mane presentation between small and large tanks (t_stat: 0.984, d.f.: 2, p_value: 0.429). 

Discussion:
From the results, it was determined that our hypothesis could not be accepted, which means that the size of the fish tank did not affect the agnostic behavior of the bettas. Even though the difference between the averages of the small and large tanks was not statistically different, the trends that were predicted to occur still were observed. The average time it took for the betta fish to present the red mane was smaller than in the large tank, and the average duration of that the red mane presentation was longer in the small tank compared to the large one. It is still possible that this correlation exists, but more trails and data need to be collected.

One of the fishes that were used to calculate the data never presented the red mane, and it is possible that habituation may have a role in that, but it is also possible that this fish could have just been presenting different agnostic behaviors other than the red mane presentation, such as broadside movements [Johnson: 2016]. Researchers that were studying agnostic behaviors in betta fishes quantified the duration of the red mane, but also analyzed testosterone quantities after the trails as well [Chen: 2016]. Testosterone is a hormone that has been shown to increase aggressiveness in many species [Harley: 2019]. Running the same experiment and collecting testosterone levels could lead to a more accepting argument with certain behaviors of the betta males, due to the difficulty in recording all agnostic behaviors presented and the variability of behaviors between fishes.
