Title: Effects of Caffeine on the Neuromuscular Control in the Gastrocnemius of a Rana pipiens specimen

Abstract:
This experiment tested the results of injecting the gastrocnemius of a northern leopard frog with caffeine. Specifically, whether or not the response (AMP) was stronger after the injection than before the injection. The hypothesis was supported and the muscle contraction was stronger after the injection. This conclusion was determined by comparing the average response (AMP) observations and finding a significant difference between the measurements. 


Introduction:
The northern leopard frogs, Rana pipiens, come from a genus that is considered to be one of the most intensively used amphibians in scientific research. Frogs from the Rana genus and family Ranidae are semi-aquatic animals, with strong legs that are ideal for jumping high and far distances. They are known to be the “frog of choice” in comparative anatomy research and musculoskeletal physiology education [O’Rourke: 2007]. Three legs of Rana pipiens were the subjects of this experiment, and they have muscles composed of various parts that aid in their contraction: myofibers, motor neurons, neuromuscular junctions, and acetylcholine. Myofibers form functional groups that are also known as skeletal muscles. Motor neurons innervate skeletal muscles at the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal after the nerve impulses hit the neuromuscular junction. Afterward its release, acetylcholine binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic nerve, sodium channels open, an action potential generates, and the action potential runs through the muscle fiber. This process stimulates the release of calcium, which then contracts the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. This muscle activity will be observed in the lab by isolating the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog and applying an AMP stimulus. The control of this experiment will be a muscle covered with the Ringer’s frog solution with no injection, and the treatment will be a muscle injected with caffeine. Electromyograms will be recorded and analyzed by a software called iWorx. The goal of this experiment is to learn how caffeine affects a frog’s muscle contraction. Our hypothesis is that the injected caffeine will cause the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle to contract harder than when caffeine is not used at all. The dependent variable of the experiment is the muscle’s recorded response to the caffeine and AMP, while the independent variables are the caffeine and Ringer’s frog solution treatment, solely Ringer’s frog solution treatment, and the AMP stimulus. 


Materials and Methods:
The frog leg, which was collected from the Wake Forest University biology department, was placed on a dissecting pan and then skinned. The skin was pulled down from the top of the leg towards the foot. This process was executed very carefully to ensure that the muscle tissue and nerves would not be damaged. Afterwards, the upper inner thigh muscle was torn down the noticeable portion of the leg that fused two pieces of muscle together in order to expose the sciatic nerve, which was differentiated from the white connective tissue. The leg was moistened with Ringer’s frog solution and the gastrocnemius was prepared for stimulus. The end of the gastrocnemius closest to the foot was cut specifically to leave a decent amount of the achilles tendon on the muscle. Then, a string was tied around the achilles and the muscle was suspended by tying the other end of string to the transductor and pining the rest of the leg to the dissecting pan. The stimulation pin was poked into the gastrocnemius muscle and stabilized to ensure an accurate reading. A series of stimuli with different intensities was distributed by the BNC-banana adapter to the muscle and the response was recorded to establish a known baseline. Afterwards, the true experiment began. The AMP stimulus was applied three consecutive times before and after the caffeine was injected and the response AMP was recorded after each stimulation. Each frog leg was injected with 1mL of 200mM caffeine. This entire process was repeated two more times, with a total of three times on three different legs. Once all data from the stimulus was collected, averages, standard deviations, and standard errors of the AMP responses before and after the caffeine injection were calculated. The summarized data was then analyzed with an ANOVA statistical test to determine if there was any difference in the response AMP before and after the caffeine was injected. The averages of the response AMP’s for each leg were the data values used in this test and the level of significance was set at .05.


Results:
After calculations, it was found that the average response AMP for before the caffeine injection was .6972, while the average response for after the injection was .9377. The standard deviation for before the injection is .24489, while the measurement for after the injection was .129899. The standard error for before the injection was .4948, while the measurement for after the injection was .3604. By using the average responses of each leg in an ANOVA statistical test, with the degrees of freedom being 5, it was determined that the p-value for the comparison of before and after caffeine injection was 0.24. Overall, the response AMPs for before the injection tended to be lower than the responses for after the caffeine injection. 

Discussion:
From the results of the experiment, we can conclude that the hypothesis was supported. The level of significance for the statistical test was set at 0.05 and the discovered p-value was 0.24, which is greater. The response (AMP) for after the injection of caffeine was stronger on average than with each recorded stimulus recorded before the injection of caffeine. This response took place because the caffeine increased the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which caused the muscle to contract harder, thus producing a higher response AMP. Caffeine has been found to have a dose-dependent​ effect on the force of muscle contraction and duration of muscle contraction. The increase in calcium release is a result of physical coupling and conformational changes in the voltage sensitive dihydropyridine receptor [Olorunshola: 2011]. This increase in contraction force would account for a shorter contraction time until fatigue. While analyzing the response AMP of the frog leg, it was found that the response AMP shot up to its apex after the caffeine injection in a shorter amount of time than before the injection. The caffeine accounts for this increase in speed. Another interesting experiment to follow-up this lab would be to conduct the same experiment but focus on the amount of time it takes for the response AMP to reach its apex, or even tetany, rather that whether or not the measurements are overall higher.

Graph 1. This graph displays the comparison of response AMP both before and after the injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemius muscle. It can be seen in this graph that the response AMP in after the caffeine injection indicates a much stronger muscle contraction than before the caffeine injection.*************************************************************************
