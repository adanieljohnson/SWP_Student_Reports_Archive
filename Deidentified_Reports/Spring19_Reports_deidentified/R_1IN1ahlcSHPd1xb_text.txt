Title: How 2% solution of Sevin impacts frogs muscle twitch regarding tetany

Abstract:
Action potential and muscle contraction is a critical aspect of life as it is responsible for all skeletal movement. The regulation of acetylcholine and acetylcholinesterase is essential to movement at a neuromuscular level. This study investigates the effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 2% sevin solution, regarding when tetany occurs. Three frog legs will be analyzed for this experiment as we will observe when gastrocnemius muscles reach complete tetany without the presence of 2% sevin and compare it when 2% sevin solution is injected into the leg. The data displayed no statistical significance regarding 2% sevin affecting the frequency where tetany occurs. Our data failed to support our hypothesis that with the presence of 2% sevin solution in the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle, will cause tetany will occur at a lower frequency. There was no significance regarding the data. 


Introduction:
This experiment investigate the effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, 2% solution of sevin, on frog legs gastrocnemius muscle. Neuromuscular junction is a crucial element to life as it is the synapse between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle causing movement within the body. It is essential to investigate the effects of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular level. Nerve impulses release acetylcholine which then opens sodium channels. Our bodies need acetylcholinesterase to break down the acetylcholine in order to close the sodium channels. With the presence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, there is no breakdown of the neurotransmitter at the action potential level. Furthermore, this increases the level and duration of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which then causes the sodium channels to remain open [Winteringham: 1966]. Sevin is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which also happens to be toxic for the body. Sevin is typically used as an insect killer used on lawns, fruit and vegetable gardens, and home perimeters. Regardless of the solution being banned in various countries, it is legin in the United States, so it is important to research the effects it has on the body [Sastry: 1982]. In this experiment, a frog’s gastrocnemius muscle will be injected with 2% sevin solution at various frequencies and observed to see when complete tetany occurs. It is ideal to use a frog’s gastrocnemius muscle for this experiment as we can see the effects sevin has on the frog’s muscle and assume it would have a similar effect on a human’s gastrocnemius without testing on a human being. Complete tetany is a sustained muscle contraction where no relaxation occurs. The skeletal muscle continually emits action potentials by multiple impulses at a higher frequency [Edman: 1978]. The gastrocnemius muscle used by both frogs and humans is crucial for all leg and knee movement. Both organisms share similar properties and are both connected to an achilles tendon. It is our hypothesis that with the presence of 2% sevin solution in the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle, will cause tetany will occur at a lower frequency. 

Materials and Methods:
Three frogs were utilized during this experiment for both the control and treatment groups. The three frogs was first examined as the control group without the presence of sevin and then the same frogs were injected with 2% sevin solution in order to compared the levels of frequency during muscle fatigue in the gastrocnemius muscle. The three frog legs resembled in similar size. To prepare each frog, each legs skin was removed followed by the separation from the gastrocnemius muscle from the sciatic nerve using one’s fingertips as metal as it will injure the nerve. The gastrocnemius and achilles tendon was then separated from the tibialis anterior using scissors. A loop was tied at the end of an approximately 20 cm long string and then a knot at the junction of achilles tendon in order to suspend the leg at 90 degrees. The frog was pinned to the board while the looped string hung around the force transducer. The stimulation needle probe connected to Labscribe was then injected directly in the middle of the gastrocnemius muscle. The Labscribe recorded myograms of muscle stimulation by recording differences in frequency of stimulation and response. Using Labscribe, each frog was observed with various ranges of frequencies (Hz) to see when tetany occurred. The frequency started at 6 Hz and increased by 2 Hz with every trial until tetany occurred. The Labscribe was set to an amplitude of 1, pulse at 1, and W at 5 (ms) which remained the same throughout the experiment. The observations were recorded as they were later compared to when the same frog legs were injected with the sevin solution. Each frog was injected with 2% of sevin solution in multiple sites on the gastrocnemius muscle. Each frog legs experienced the same frequencies starting at 6 Hz and increasing in intervals of 2 Hz until tetany, which was then recorded. Statistical analyses consisted of a paired t-test in order to determine the p-value to reveal if there was any significant regarding the data. 


Results:
There were no trends regarding our data. Complete tetany occurred around the same frequencies (+/- 2 Hz) for both the control and treatment group for all three frog’s gastnocius leg muscle (Fig. 1). We completed a paired t-test to analyse the results in order to find significance. There was no statistical significance regarding our data (t-stat=0.5, df=2, P=0.667).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the presence of 2% of sevin solution injected into the gatroncius muscle of a frog would cause tetany at a lower frequency (Hz), was not statistically supported. There was no significance supporting that sevin solution has any effect on when tetany occurs. Although our results failed to report this, there are other studies suggesting that frequency does impact summation and when complete tetany occurs. With the presence of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, sodium will continue to rush into the cytoplasm. Tetany would occur at a lower frequency because of the constant flow of sodium and contraction [Edman: 1978]. Complete tetany can be difficult to detect as it is an observe and can be confused with incomplete tetany, which negatively affected our results. Future experiments need to be conducted in order to determine the best explanation for when tetany occurs with the presence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The statistical tests revealed that we reject the alternative hypothesis because the p-value was greater 0.05. It is critical to investigate the effects of sevin regarding action potential and muscle contraction because it is toxic to the body. It is critical to investigate the effects of the solution and all acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in general as it can have a monumental effect. Future experiments need to be conducted in order to determine the best explanation for when tetany occurs with the presence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Skeletal movement is a crucial element to living beings so it is important to recognize what solutions can affect the neuromuscular junction, specifically acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
