Title: The Introduction of Tubocurarine into the Gastrocnemius of Frogs and its effect on the Neuromuscular System

Abstract:
Skeletal muscle movement in invertebrates is dictated by motor neurons that innervate the muscle cells within them; forming a “motor unit.” The release of calcium ions, which initiates contraction of these muscles, is also dependent on the release of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). In this experiment, the group introduced the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (nACh), tubocurarine, to frog legs by directly injecting it into the gastrocnemius, with the intent of inhibiting the release of ACh from motor neurons. The group’s hypothesis was that the frog leg’s muscle contraction would decrease in response to electrical stimulus after being injected with tubocurarine due to insufficient amounts of ACh being released as a result of tubocurarine inhibition of ACh release. The group measured the contraction amplitudes of the frog legs before and after the tubocurarine using iWorx software and compared the data using a paired t-test. While there were patterns of decreasing contraction amplitudes in some of the frogs, the data was deemed insignificant. Previous biological experiments and findings show that nicotinic substances exert negative effects on muscular contraction, suggesting that nicotinic substances should be avoided when possible.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles of vertebrates consist of thousands multinuclear myofiber clusters. Myofibers and the motor neurons that innervate them are called “motor units,” working together to coordinate the contraction of skeletal muscles. In the event of an action potential, nerve impulses will travel down the axon of a motor neuron and arrive at the neuromuscular junction, where the motor neuron innervates the myofiber. This causes the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. After acetylcholine is released, it binds to protein receptors on the muscle fibers, opening up sodium channels that, in turn, generate an action potential in the muscle fiber, causing the release of calcium ions that stimulate the contractile mechanisms of muscle fibers. 
To investigate the role of ACh in muscle contractions, and analyze the effects of its inhibition, the group introduced the chemical compound, tubocurarine, to frog legs. Tubocurarine acts as an antagonist for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChr), blocking the receptor site of acetylcholine, particularly in cases of repetitive stimulation, as shown in a previous study where contraction amplitude in frog legs rapidly decreased in response to a repeated stimulus after being injected with tubocurarine [Magleby: 1981]. The effect of ACh release being inhibited is that ACh will be prevented from binding to protein channels on the muscle fibers, preventing the opening of sodium channels and the proceeding action potential of the muscle fiber. 
The group decided to study the functionality of muscle contraction in a system where the release of ACh was inhibited. The group hypothesized that if tubocurarine was injected into frog legs, the legs would require a greater stimulus to generate a muscle contraction. The independent/categorical variable in this experiment was whether the frog leg had received the tubocurarine injection or not. The dependent/measurable variable was the frog leg's contraction and amplitude. Since the function of acetylcholine is inhibited by the tubocurarine compound, it would require a greater stimulus to overcome the inhibition and release acetylcholine. Such results were found in a study where tubocurarine was injected into the phrenic nerve of rats, where the muscles required increased stimulation to achieve a resulting contraction [Hinman: 2002].


Materials and Methods:
The group selected and skinned three frog legs for the experiment, exposing the gastrocnemius and the sciatic nerve. The gastrocnemius and the sciatic nerve were isolated and suspended from an apparatus with sufficient tension secure the leg and prevent outside movements from influencing the contraction measurements. A force transducer, which distributed and detected the resulting muscle contraction, was inserted into the gastrocnemius and three electrical currents of 0.75 volts were administered. The amplitudes of the contractions resulting from the shocks were measured and recorded using an iWorx system. After recording the initial contraction amplitudes of the frog legs, two milliliters of tubocurarine were injected into the gastrocnemius. The group members massaged the gastrocnemius to ensure that the tubocurarine had adequately spread throughout the muscle. The group measured and recorded the contraction amplitudes after the tubocurarine injection. Pre-injection measurements were used as control data and compared with the contraction amplitudes of the frog legs after they were injected with tubocurarine, which was treated as experimental data. The group used a paired t-test to compare the averages of the contraction amplitude before and after the tubocurarine injections, since all the data collected came from the same group. The one-tailed version of the paired t-test was used, as the group’s alternate hypothesis considered directionality of the experimental results.

Results:
The group completed all six measurements of contraction amplitude and averaged the resulting data points by group. A trend of decreased contraction amplitude in the frog legs after being injected with tubocurarine was observed in the second and third trials. These two frog legs decreased in contraction amplitude by an average of 0.187V. The first trial that did not follow this trend likely negatively influenced the t-value and could have been a factor in its calculated insignificance, however, outlier tests did not prove this trial to be worthy of being excluded from the data. While the contraction amplitude did follow a trend of decreasing in value, the amount by which the amplitude differed before and after the injection was not consistent. For example, frog leg number 2 decreased by approximately 0.5V after the injection while the contraction amplitude of the third frog was suppressed completely. The mean of the control group’s contraction amplitude (pre-tubocurarine injection) was 0. The mean of the experimental group’s contraction amplitude (post-tubocurarine injection) was 0.455V.  The average difference in contraction amplitude between pre-injection and post injection was -0.187. The resulting paired t-value for this experiment was 0.4242 with a P-value of 0.713, which is insignificant. 

Discussion:
While the group’s biological hypothesis was supported by two out of the three frog legs, the calculated p-value for the t-test in this experiment was deemed insignificant. However, the decrease in contraction amplitude in the second and third frog legs were consistent with the group’s hypothesis. The difference in amplitude pre/post-injection in the first leg directly contradicted the group’s hypothesis; the contraction amplitude of the frog leg after being injected with tubocurarine increased by almost a factor of four. The increase in contraction amplitude could be attributable to some of the tubocurarine injection having spilled out of the frog leg during the injection, or the tubocurarine not being given enough time to properly diffuse and exert its effects on the whole muscle, allowing for the release of ACh in amounts that were sufficient for contraction. The data gathered from the first frog leg did not deviate enough from the rest of the gathered data to be treated as an outlier, however, more trials might have provided enough data for it to be treated as such.
	It is important to understand the relationship between neurotransmitters like ACh that allow for motor function in vertebrates, as well as agents that can inhibit them. This knowledge and understanding allows people to be aware of potential consequences that can result from contact with these substances that can be found in both prescription and recreational drugs. 
Given biological evidence, our results should have shown statistical evidence that tubocurarine suppresses the release of ACh. However, other biological experiments have shown significant evidence that nicotinic antagonists such as tubocurarine have the potential to inhibit motor function [Thesleff: 1955], and therefore should be avoided to reduce the risk of acute and chronic defects.
