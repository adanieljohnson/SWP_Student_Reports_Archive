Title: Increasing the amount of ACH and it's effect on muscle contraction in frog legs  

Abstract:
The nervous system works closely with the skeletal system and aids in muscle contraction. The skeletal system that we paid close attention to in this experiment was the frog skeletal system. In this system, Ach is an important neurotransmitter that controls the contraction of muscles. For this experiment, we focused on the effects Ach had on the muscle contraction amplitude. We hypothesized that addition of Ach to the gastrocnemius muscle will result in the amplitude of the muscle contraction curve to be higher than the control muscle contraction amplitude. In order to conduct this experiment and determine if we were correct we were given a total of 3 frog legs per trial, and for each of the three trials, we observed the contraction of the muscle without any Ach and then with Ach. We focused on the average contraction amplitude for the two groups and observed that the contraction amplitude for the Ach group was less than the control group which disproves our hypothesis. Some speculations for why our results were incorrect could be that some type of substance was blocking the Ach receptor. Overall it would be very beneficial to repeat the experiment in order to ensure that we collected the most accurate data.


Introduction:
The nervous system is an extremely complex system of nerves which sends signals from the brain and spinal cord to various parts of the body. Additionally, the nervous system works to respond to different environments very similar to how the hormone-based system does. However, the nervous system is much more efficient with sending signals because, unlike the hormone-based system, the nervous system sends signals to different parts of the body much more quickly through electrical impulses. The nervous system works very closely with the skeletal system and aids in muscle contraction. The skeletal system that we paid close attention to in this experiment was the frog skeletal system. Many parts of the muscle are involved in muscle contraction and they all work to compliment each other. The first and smallest structure involved is the myofibril which consists of actin and myosin filaments which have an A band, M line, Z line, H zone, and sarcomere [Wang: 2014]. For a muscle contraction to occur it requires a stimulus that can be created into a response/ contraction after that acetylcholine vesicles merge to the presynaptic membrane as a result of their being an influx of calcium. The Ach receptors then cause a slight depolarization due to an increased sodium entry which opens the ryanodine receptor and finally, the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases the calcium into the cytoplasm. Once the calcium is in the cytoplasm it binds to troponin which exposes the actin-myosin binding sites and results in the contractions of the muscle [Wang: 2014]. In this experiment, we mainly focused on how Ach affects muscle contraction. Ach is a neurotransmitter that controls the contraction of muscles. In order to test the effects of Ach on muscle contraction, we isolated the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a dissected frog leg, shocked the nerve (imitating a stimulus), and observed the contraction of the muscle. We hypothesized that addition of Ach to the gastrocnemius muscle would result in the muscle contraction amplitude to be greater than the control group amplitude because an increase in Ach in the muscle would cause the muscle to have a higher tension for a longer period of time.

Materials and Methods:
To begin we were given a frog leg and dissected it gently separating the inner thighs making sure that we kept the muscle moist with frog ringer solution. For the first part we attached the gastrocnemius muscle to a stimulator parameter where it was given a single pulse of stimulus of constant duration. For the first trial of the first part we did not add any Ach to the gastrocnemius muscle. Once the apparatus was set up we shocked the muscle at a low voltage and slowly worked our way up until we noticed a contraction of the muscle. For each shock given we recorded the partial time, amplitude, and total time of the contraction. Finally, we found the threshold voltage. After the first trial we injected 10 mg/mL of Ach into the same frog leg and repeated the same steps while recording the same data. For the second part, while dissecting the frog our goal was to isolate the sciatic nerve from the connective tissue in the muscle. Once we were successful in isolating the nerve we attached the sciatic nerve to the stimulator parameter where it was given a single pulse of stimulus of constant duration. Once again we recorded the partial time, amplitude, total time of the contraction, and the threshold voltage. After recording the data for the first trial we injected 10 mg/mL of Ach into the same frog leg and repeated the same steps and recorded the same data. For the last trial we isolated the sciatic nerve again and attached it to the stimulator parameter, however this time we stimulated the nerve for short periods at different stimulus frequencies. Finally we recorded the partial time, amplitude, and total time of the contraction, and the threshold voltage. Lastly, after finishing the first trial we injected 10 mg/mL of Ach into the frog leg and administered the shocks and recorded the same data. After all of our data was collected we conducted a paired t-test to determine if our results were statistically significant.


Results:
Overall the frog legs that were injected with Ach had a lower contraction amplitude than our control group. The average contraction amplitude for the control frog leg group was 1.149V +/- 0.187V and the average contraction amplitude for the group injected with Ach was 0.966V +/- 0.045V. In order to determine the significance of our results, we conducted a paired t-test. Our results were (t-value: 1.172, P-value: 0.362, df: 2). While conducting the experiment we observed the contractions for both the control and experimental group. It was clear that the contraction of the muscle for the experimental group was shorter than the control group which is clear given the recorded averages.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that adding excess Ach to each frog leg in each trial would increase the contraction amplitude was not supported by our experiment. Based on our results the contraction amplitude went down after we added Ach which was not what we expected and therefore the results that we observed have many different explanations that could help us understand why our experiment was not successful. Ach is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the nervous system by stimulating muscle contractions, therefore when a certain substance blocks Ach it inhibits muscle contraction and ultimately decreases its ability to function. If a substance was blocking the Ach receptors that could be an explanation for why the muscle contraction amplitude was shorter for the experimental group than the control group. There are many substances that could block Ach function, the first is a neurotoxin that could have been transmitted to the frog from another insect. There are different types of neurotoxins that both block the Ach receptors and inhibit the production or release of Ach. The first neurotoxin comes from the Krait snake, marine snail, and the sea snake. Therefore the frog legs that we were given all could have been poisoned by one of these animals which then would result in the blockage of Ach receptors in the muscles and could explain why the muscle contraction amplitude was shorter for the experimental group [Chandler:2017]. The other type of neurotoxin is delivered by the common brown snakes, the Australian paralysis tick, and the South American rattlesnake. Another explanation for our data could be that each of our frog legs was poisoned by one of these animals which would result in the inhibition of Ach meaning that muscle contractions would be very weak and explains why our Ach muscle contraction curve was shorter than our control. Finally, our results could be explained by the autoimmune disorder Myasthenia Gravis. Myasthenia Gravis occurs when antibodies attack the Ach receptors and ultimately destroy them. This attack inhibits muscle contraction and causes muscles to become weak, therefore if the three frog legs were infected with this disorder it could explain why the muscle contraction amplitude was much shorter than expected [Chandler: 2017]. According to another similar experiment, where their results were also incorrect, they mentioned that the error could be caused by taking inaccurate measurements and maybe missing Ringer’s solution [Wang: 2014]. Therefore this could be another explanation for our incorrect data. Our experiment was not a success and therefore it would be extremely beneficial to repeat the same experiment with new frog legs and make sure that we follow the same procedure. This will be very helpful because it can help us understand the experiment in greater depth and further explore what we did wrong the first time we conducted the experiment.
