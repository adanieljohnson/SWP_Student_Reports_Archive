Title: he Influence of IGR on JH levels regarding the commitment pulse in Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
This experiment will be investigating the Manduca sexta (M. S\sexta) insect more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm. The Manduca sexta produces two types of hormones involved in maturation which we will be investigating – Juvenile hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). In this experiment we will be manipulating these hormones by adding Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) to increase the levels of JH. Six Manduca sexta subjects will be used, three treated with only water and three with water and IGR. If the M. sexta is treated with IGR then they will not experience the commitment pulse and mature to the pupal stage because they will not experience a drop in JH levels, the treatment group will also not grow as much as the control group because of the lack in maturation. According to a two-tailed T-test, the M. sexta treatment group did not show any significant difference from the control group. This can conclude that IGR does not affect growth in M. sexta.  

Introduction:
This experiment will investigate Manduca sexta (M. sexta) development with the influence of insect growth hormones. The Manduca sexta insect is more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm [Nijhout: 1975]. This insect is part of the Order Lepidoptera, this Order includes butterflies, moths, and skippers. The M. sexta is a holometabolous organism which means it has four major life stages. These stages are egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. We will be observing the larvae and pupa stages [Johnson: 2018]. The life cycle of M sexta maturation progresses as follows, 1st instar larvae, 2nd instar larvae, 3rd instar larvae, 4th instar larvae, 5th instar larvae, pupa, adult moth. We will be following the life cycle of the M. sexta as it progresses from the larva stages to the pupa stage. This cycle takes roughly two weeks, which is the duration of this experiment [Johnson: 2018]. 

M. sexta maturation occurs due to the production of growth hormones. In this experiment, we will be manipulating these hormones to understand how a certain hormone impacts M. sexta development. There are two hormones involved in M. sexta development into the pupa stage. The interaction between these two hormones decide if the insect experiences something called a commitment pulse and goes onto the pupa stage. These two hormones are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) [Jesudason: 1990]. Juvenile hormone is involved in regulating the type of molt during development and regulated multiple functions in adults. Ecdysterone is involved in regulating the timing of molting during insect maturation and regulated adult functioning additionally. JH and 20E work together to impact M. sexta development by existing in specific ratios [Jesudason: 1990]. The way this specifically works is at the 5th larvae stage JH and 20E levels both lower significantly, and JH drops below 20E. This relationship causes a commitment pulse to occur. A commitment pulse occurs when the M. sexta has grown enough that it is able to store enough nutrients to transition into the pupa stage and eventually an adult moth [Johnson: 2018]. We are using M. sexta for this experiment because we know about the hormones that play a role in their maturation and the timeline of their life cycle [Nijhout: 1975].

In this experiment we will be manipulating JH levels to learn more about the commitment pulse. In this case, we will be using a hormone to alter the levels of JH in the M. sexta. [Jesudason: 1990]. If levels of Juvenile Hormone increase, we will test whether the M. sexta larvae matures into the pupa stage of maturation since the levels of JH will not drop below Ecdysterone; which is what triggers the commitment pulse. In order to test this, we will be using a hormone called Insect Growth Regulator (IGR). This hormone will increase the levels of JH in M. sexta [Staal: 1975]. With the addition of IGR, JH levels will naturally rise – rise above 20E during the 5th larvae stage. If the M. sexta is treated with IGR then they will not experience the commitment pulse and mature to the pupa stage because they will not experience a drop in JH levels and grow to the max size. In this case the treatment group will have IGR and the control group will not. We will monitor the growth of the treatment and control M. sexta into the pupa stage by measuring their weight [Nijhout: 1975].


Materials and Methods:
We began by selecting which hormone we will use to influence the treatment group. We decided to add five drops of IGR to the treatment groups food to stunt the growth into the pupa stage.  

We had three M. sexta in the control group and three in the treatment group, which we set up in separate containers. We gave all six M. sexta 10g of room temperature food with 5 drops of water, in addition, we gave the treatment group 5 drops of IGR. To prepare the food sample we mixed the cold food into a paste until it was room temperature, added it to the cells, and added the water and IGR respectively. We added the six M. sexta into their respective cells and left them in an incubator at 25 C. 

We weighed the M. sexta each day we fed them, staring on the first day of the procedure. Every two days the M. sexta were weighed, fed and the feces were disposed of. 
Some variables that were kept contact was the amount of light. In the incubator the M. sexta had 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark. The temperature was kept constant at 25 C. Lastly, the amount of food given was 10g each day for each M. sexta.

In order to determine if our results were significant, we used a two-tailed T-test to compare the treatment group and the control group. The alpha value we used was 0.05. 




Results:
According to the two- tailed T-test comparing the average daily percent change in mean weight at an alpha value of 0.05 resulted in a p-value of 0.46. Table 1 shows the daily growth in grams and percent change of the M. sexta. The change in growth percent is calculated using the daily change in growth in grams. Both control and treatment group grow at a high percent change in the first three days then percent change in growth in the last four days taper off. The average percent change for both groups vary greatly from the daily percent change. The standard deviation is calculated using the daily change in percent values. 

Figure 1 is a representation of the average change in percent in the control group and treatment group. The error bars are a representation of the percent variation above and below the average value. Although the average percent change in growth are slightly different, they are not statistically different according to the two-tailed t-test. 

As the M. sexta grew over the nine days we observed them. The first couple of days the M. sexta ate all the food and had large amount of feces. The last few days the M. sexta did not all finish their food. By day seven one of the control subjects was transitioning to a black color indicating the transition into the pupa stage. None of the treatment M. sexta experienced this transition. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported because the treatment group never entered the pupa stage and the treatment and control group has no significant difference in weight. The t-test showed no significant difference between the two groups. Although there was a difference in the average percent change for the two groups, the results showed to be not significantly different [Johnson: 2018]. 

While the M. sexta grew and stated alive for the entirety of the study, one of the control caterpillars entered the pupal stage. We can assume that the IGR prevented the treatment group from entering the pupal stage although more observation time could have reinforced the results further. The addition of IGR affected the growth into pupal stage, but not the growth of the M. sexta prior to maturation. The groups grew at a similar rate which disproved our hypothesis. Making us fail to reject the null hypothesis [Nijhout: 1975]. Because both groups of M. sexta were treated with food and water they both were able to grow to the 5th larvae stage, only the IGR prevented them from experiencing the commitment pulse. This did not affect their growth [Johnson: 2018]

Our findings are consistent with our hypothesis by saying the M. sexta treatment group never experienced the commitment pulse. But it is inconsistent with the hypothesis in regards to the difference in growth for the two groups. [Johnson: 2018]. Our work is consistent with other studies showing that JH levels indicate a commitment pulse which is the transition from larvae to adult moth in M. sexta [Jesudason: 1990].

A potential source of error in this study is that the M. sexta were left without food on between days we checked on them. This could have potentially stunted their growth temporarily during the larvae stages. During the first five days the M. sexta ate the food very quickly and every other day when we checked on them the food was gone. Whereas the last four days, there was food remaining in the cells when we checked on them [Johnson: 2018]. 

Our standard deviation value is higher than normal because we used percent change, which varied a lot. At the beginning of the study the M. sexta had a high percent change in growth while on the final says of the study the percent change in growth was very low, leading to a not very accurate average percent change, and standard deviation value [Johnson: 2018].

An idea for a future study is to take the experiment longer to see if they actually develop into pupa stage. If we conducted the study until the M. sexta matured into an adult moth we would be able to more confidently state that the group treated with IGR indefinitely did not experience a commitment pulse. [Johnson: 2018] 

In this experiment we successfully observed M. sexta development from the larvae stages into the pupa stage. We also successfully altered a group of treatment M. sexta in order to understand the hormones involved in development [Staal: 1975]. After this experiment we can conclude that IGR hormone does not affect growth of M. sexta in the larvae stages. We can conclude from this study and other studies of insect hormones that IGR plays a role in insect development along with JH and 20E [Nijhout: 1975].
