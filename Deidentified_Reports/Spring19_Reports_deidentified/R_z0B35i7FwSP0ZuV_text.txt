Title: The Effects of Large Temperature Change on the Photosynthesis of Spinach Chloroplasts

Abstract:
Energy transfer reactions are an important part of photosynthesis and fundamental to the existence of life. These reactions can be studied and quantified using various assays, such as the Hill Assay used in this experiment. This was performed in order to test the effects of temperature on the process of Photosystem I, which has been shown in multiple literatures to be significently substantial, whether increasing or decreasing its activity. Samples were left at room temperature, and other heated and cooled, and it was hypothesized that these groups would have lower photosynthetic activity than the first. However, this was not the case. While the heated sample showed a statistically significent decrease in activity, the cooled cells did not. This is perhaps indicative of the nature of the specific species tested, which was spinach, but could also indicate a larger systematic error, as supported by the inconsistencies seen in the data. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the multi-step process through which plants capture and store energy. Electrons are energized by rays of sunlight, therefore starting a chain of energy transfer reactions in which energy is carried in the form of high energy electron carriers (Nelson & Yocum: 2006). As oxidation/reduction reactions, or redox reactions, involve the transfer of electrons from one species to another, this process is very important to the process of photosynthesis. The rate of oxidation is therefore indicative of the rate of photosynthesis (Antal et al.: 2012). This oxidation is normally carried out by plastoquinone, a high energy electron carrier that is difficult to track the change in relative concentrations in oxidized and reduced substance over time (Nelson & Yocum, 2006). Therefore, in order to measure this redox change in order to determine photosynthetic rate experimentally, a different electron carrier reducible substance must be used. DCIP is used as such a substance to measure photosynthetic electron transport, as the rate of reduction can be measured by changes in absorbance through UV-vis spectroscopy (Antal et al.: 2012). This makes it a useful tool in studies involving photosynthesis, the topic of interest of this paper. 
	Several studies have investigated the effects of temperature on photosynthesis, with varying plant species and varying temperature ranges (Rosinger, Wilson, & Kerr, 1982). Studies done in Prague also measured the rate of photosystem I, using oxygen evolution rather than the Hill Assay as their means of measuring progress, and found that at lower temperatures this evolution, and therefore the rate of reaction, were low, and that they steadily increased with temperature (Lukeš, Procházková, Shmidt, Nedbalová, & Kaftan: 2014). It has been conjectured that this influence by temperature is due to the fact that this is a membrane reaction, and that temperature change may alter the conditions and flexibility of these membranes (Rosinger et al.: 1982). In relation to this, differing studies have found differing results and relationships with temperature for different species, specifically in response to chilling. Researchers believe this could be indicative of some plants being more “chill-sensitive” or “chill-resistant” than others (Rosinger et al.: 1982). In the opposite direction of temperature change, different studies have also found different results when measuring the activity of photosynthesis when the system is heated. While heat does seem to fairly consistently have a positive correlation with activity, in that increasing the heat also increases the activity of photosynthesis, studies have shown there is an upper limit to this phenomena (Nolan & Smillie: 1976). Studies done by Nolan and Smillie demonstrate that after the peak of activity, there comes a rapid decrease, at which point soon after activity shuts down completely. This indicates that at a certain point the increase in temperature is actually harmful and breaks down essential components of the system, which has a counterproductive effect on increasing the rate. Similarly to the studies on chilling done by Rosinger, these studies also showed that this upper limit was different for different plant species.
	Therefore, for this report, previous research was combined on the temperature dependence of photosynthesis and the Hill Assay in order to design an experiment which tested the effects of extreme temperatures on the rate of photosystem I of chloroplasts isolated from spinach leaves. As temperatures on both the side of heating and cooling were taken to more extreme limits, we predicted that both reactions would demonstrate a decrease in photosynthetic activity, as compared to the samples run at room temperature.

Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, chloroplasts needed to be isolated from spinach leaves. To do this, leaves were deveined and then grinded up in a chilled mortar and pestle with 20Ml of grinding buffer. This substance was then poured through cheesecloth into a container, and then placed into an Eppendorf tube to be centrifuged for 20 minutes. Once this was done, the supernatant was removed, and 100 uL of chloroplasts added to each test tube. Test tubes each had 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer, except for the blank, which had 8 Ml of water and no DCIP. Test tubes were placed in three groups: group one was placed in an ice bath at -5℃, group two was left at room temperature, and group 3 was placed in a heating bath at 45℃. Each of these groups had five samples per group. Each samples had their initial absorbance measured through UV-vis spectroscopy at 600 nm, and was then left for their reactions to progress in their respective conditions for 10 minutes before another absorbance was taken. This was repeated three times, resulting in a total reaction time of 30 minutes, and three measurements taken after the initial reading. The results of this data were analyzed for statistical significance using two-factor Anova, the results of which are shown below

Results:

Figure 3: Summary of statistical tests of a Mixed Design ANOVA, determining significent difference between the three groups in temperature groups, in percent change over time and interaction between percent change and temperature. This test demonstrates there is a statistical significance to these differences.
Figure 4: This figure demonstrates a Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference Test, which checks for statistical difference between each group specifically. This demonstrates that there was statistical significance in the difference between the heated group and both other groups, but not between the two other groups themselves, those being the room temperature and chilled groups.

Discussion:
These results partially support the initial hypothesis of this experiment, and partially do not. As expected, the excessive heat did produce a statistically significent decrease in photosynthetic activity of the spinach chloroplast cells. The highest reported temperature of the previous studies showed increased activity turned to decreased activity at a maximum value for any tested species of 38℃, and for most species this value was more in the range of the twenties in terms of degrees Celsius (Nolan & Smillie: 1976). Therefore, it follows that at 45℃, the chloroplasts of spinach leaves could show decreased activity. While the total, final result is consistent with other studies, the strange decrease in absorbance between the last and second to last measurement is more difficult to account for. While an overall decrease in activity was expected, there is no reason that increasing the heat should have reversed the reaction that had already occurred. There are several other possible explanations to this apparent decrease. For one, although the temperature was monitored closely by the experimenters, the fact remains that the consistency factor of the equipment is highly limited. The heat bath in question is fallible to fluctuations in temperature, and the thermometer used to track these fluctuations does not have immediate response time, especially to smaller changes. As the total activity was decreased, clearly the limits of what is damaging to the chloroplasts to the extent of outweighing the increased energy available for the reaction to occur had been reached. Therefore, another, even small increase, or even just prolonged exposure to this high temperature, could have caused an alteration in the structure of a cellular or another component in the solution which interfered with the reading. However, a more likely culprit is the readings and taking of samples themselves, and that this perceived decrease was not real but reported through flawed measurements. Causes of this could be an issue in contamination of the blank for the final round of measurements, or insufficient mixing before the sample was taken to be measured.
The data of this experiment that is inconsistent with our previous hypothesis is that of the chilled group. This group was kept at temperatures slightly below the freezing point of water, and therefore it was expected based on prior readings that there would be decreased activity as compared to the group run at room temperature (Rosinger et al.: 1982). However, this was not the case, and statistical analysis demonstrated no difference between the two groups. This could be indicative of a flaw in the experiment itself, but could also indicate that spinach is a more “chill-resistant” species, a term aforementioned in the introduction (Lukeš et al.: 2014). As spinach is considered a wintergreen, it follows that it would be a more chill-resistant plant and be able to perform photosynthesis somewhat normally even under freezing conditions. 
Photosynthesis is a process that has been well-studied, and yet still there are openings in the existing research in terms of how the process can be effected by external factors. This report, as well as the research cited, that temperature has a variable effect on the process, greatly effected by the type of photosynthetic species being considered. This project provides further inquiry into this topic and has possible implications to the expanded research, as well as simply the growth of spinach.
