Title: The Effect of the Presence of Food on the Agonistic Red Mane Behavior in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Competition is a common characteristic among all species.  It acts as motivation in many different processes of fish and many species have their own aggressive displays that they can use whenever they perceive a threat.  Betta splendens show two main types of agonistic displays: broadside and facing.  The most aggressive facing display is the expansion of the branchiostegal membrane, or ‘red mane’.  In our experiment, we tested for the presence of food having an impact on the time that these fish would spend showing the red mane behavior.  We predicted that the addition of food to each side of the tank would cause the fish to display this behavior for a shorter period of time.  We used two groups of fish and ran two three-minute trials with each group to see how the presence of food would affect their behavior.  Our data was not statistically significant, but the standard deviations were much too large, causing the results to be skewed.  More studies on the effects of different factors in the environment of these fish could help to determine the motivations for the different aggressive behaviors displayed.

Introduction:
Animal interaction is a particular difficult subject to study because we always want to give human emotions to their behaviors.  Some animals are very aggressive when they come in contact with another animal of their same species.  In this study we will be using patient observation methods to learn about how Betta splendens fish interact with one another.  These betta fish are very aggressive and show many different displays of intraspecific agonistic behavior [Thompson: 1965].  Most of these aggressive behaviors relate to changing the way they present their fins to one another and how they approach one another once they are aware of each other’s presence.  Some examples of these behaviors would be pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, dorsal fin raising, head lowering, darting, and biting [Johnson: 2018].  They display different levels of aggression when they feel that there is a threat.  The main two categories of displays are facing and broadside.  The most aggressive facing display is known as the red mane behavior, in which the branchiostegal membrane protrudes from under the operculum [Johnson: 2018].  This large red mane is presented face to face in a confrontation between two male fish.  However, the levels of aggressiveness in fish change depending on other factors in their environment, which can be different cues such as food [Hogan: 1974].  In this lab we will be objectively testing to see what extent the presence of food has on changing the behavior of fish.  We hypothesize that if we add food to each side of the tank, the fish will show their aggressive red mane behavior for a shorter period of time than they would without the presentation of food.

Materials and Methods:
In order to test our hypothesis, we used four fish in two tanks.  In each tank, two fish were separated by a glass panel and a white panel, back to back.  The white panel didn’t allow the fish to be visible to each other on each side of the tank.  To begin the experiment, we removed the white panel, but kept the glass panel.  This allowed the fish to be visible to each other, but they still could not make physical contact with each other.  After removing the white panel, a timer was immediately started and set for three minutes total.  We judged the behavior of each fish individually and timed the total duration for which they displayed their aggressive “red mane” behavior over the three-minute time period.  The two fish were then switched out for two different fish and the same process was repeated once again.  The data collected from each trial was the total number of seconds of which the red mane was displayed.  After running these first two trials, we replaced the original two fish in the tank and dropped a small pinch of fish food on each side of the panel separating them.  We observed their behavior again using the same timing techniques to collect data.  Once again, we ran a trial with the second set of fish, but with food added.  Based on the total number of seconds each fish showed its red mane display, we were able to run a paired two-sample two-tailed T test at an alpha level of 0.05 to analyze the data.

Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the average time of red mane behavior for the treatment of no food was 88.25 +/- 94.60 while the average time for the treatment of the addition of food was 26.50 +/- 38.69.  From our statistical analysis, we found that the difference between the means of the treatment groups was not statistically significant (t=1.778, df=3, P=0.173).  In the observations below, Group 1 will represent the first set of two fish while Group 2 will represent the second set of two fish.

Group 1 (No Food):  
Both fish showed the red man behavior for most of the three-minute period.  They focused on each other through the glass panel for most of the time and bumped the glass on multiple occasions.
Group 2 (No Food): 
Neither fish seemed aggressive at all.  They didn’t focus on each other and the red mane behavior was only shown for a very short period of time by one of the fish.
Group 1 (Food):
Both fish alternated between eating and showing aggressive behavior.  The fish showed their red mane behavior for a total duration of less than half the overall three-minute period.
Group 2 (Food): 
Neither fish showed any signs of aggression at all during this trial.  They both ate a small amount of the food that we had placed in the tank, but they didn’t seem to notice each other through the glass at all.


Discussion:
Based on our data, the addition of food proved not to be statistically significant.  We predicted the average time of the red mane behavior to be shorter when food was added to the tank.  Even though the difference between the two groups didn’t return statistically significant results, there was a tendency for the average time of the red mane behavior to decrease with the addition of food.  The standard deviations were so large that it skewed the data and didn’t provide us with the results we had anticipated.  The reason for this is that the two groups of fish showed dramatically different behavior from one another.  While group one showed aggressive behavior for a large portion of each three-minute period for both the trial with and without food, group two hardly showed any aggressive behavior at all between both trials, which skewed the data.  The specific fish that we used in our experiment may have been more predisposed to less aggressive behavior which made our results not significant.  Fish act differently depending on what other fish are around them [Matessi: 2010].  Some are ‘persistent’ signalers of aggressive behavior and show these behaviors no matter what company surrounds them.  Other fish are ‘sporadic’ signalers of aggressive behavior and are only agonistic around certain other fish [Matessi: 2010].  This information sheds light on the idea that some fish are more inclined to display the agonistic red mane regardless of what fish are around them, while other fish may change their behavior depending on how the fish around them act.  When Betta splendens were given the choice of between a mirror image of themselves and food, they consistently chose the option of food.  In an experiment testing how these fish learn, reinforcement was used to see how fish would react differently and either choose food or aggression.  In most cases, fish normally chose food when presented with the option [Hogan: 1974].  On a broader scale, this experiment can be used to test the different motivations of fish and it shows how they act in a natural environment in which both food and competition are present.
