Title: The size of the water tank has no effect on the amount of intraspecific agonistic behaviors that two Betta splendens males present

Abstract:
The experiment is designed to figure out the relationship between tank size and the amount of intraspecific agonistic behavior that two Betta splendens males present. Red “mane” is a high ranked agonistic behavior in aggressiveness presented by Bettas, and it is selected as the representation for the intraspecific agonistic in this experiment. The insignificant differences got from the results reject the alternate hypothesis that the smaller the tank size, the longer duration of red “mane” that two Betta splendens males present and quicker the first red “mane” shows up. However, the results suggest a difference in aggression between the two tanks. The agonistic behavior becomes less necessary as tank size increases as bettas may be able to detect an increased probability to escape. And the insignificant difference is caused by the high standard deviation. Therefore, to improve the experiment, more samples should be studied.

Introduction:
In the study of animal behavior, ethology brings together observation skills from natural history, laboratory methods, and insights and theories from ecology, genetics and especially evolutionary biology [Johnson:2018] Betta splendens are used in the experiment, the fighting fish originated in southwest Asia. Broadside movement and facing movements are two main types of intraspecific agonistic behaviors of bettas. Typical behaviors for each type are ranked in aggressiveness. For the broadside movement, in increasing order of aggressiveness, typical behaviors are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. For the facing movement, the three typical behaviors in increasing order of aggressiveness are fin erecting, gill covers spreading, and creating a red “mane” by protruding the branchiostegal membrane. To understand the relationship between the tank size and the intraspecific agonistic behavior of two Betta males, red “mane” is used as a representation the intraspecific agonistic behavior. There is supposed to be an inverse relationship between tank size and the amount of intraspecific agonistic behaviors. One explanation for this relationship is that bettas may be able to detect an increased probability of escape in a large tank [Goldstein:1975]. Therefore, the hypothesis is the smaller the tank size, the longer duration of red “mane” that two Betta splendens males present and quicker the first red “mane” shows up.

Materials and Methods:
Two aquariums in different sizes were used in the experiment. The small tank was divided into three compartments and the large tank was divided into two compartments. The size of each compartment in the small tank was 4inch×6inch and that in the large tank was 10inch×10.5inch. Three selected male Bettas which had been kept visually and physically isolated from one another for several hours with white plastic dividers and transparent glass dividers between each two were used as samples in both small and large tank conditions. Then removed the white plastic dividers between two males to make them physically separated by transparent glass dividers for each trial. They were timed for five minutes and their intraspecific agonistic behavior (red “mane”) were observed. Red “mane “is observed when branchiostegal membrane protrudes. In the five-minute interval, the time it took for the first red "mane" was recorded in second and the duration of red "mane" was recorded in second as well. Each two fish were introduced in both tanks; therefore, three trails were run for each condition. The fish were allowed to rest for five minutes in between trails with a white plastic divider between compartments for visual isolation. Two paired t-tests were run statistically after the experiment for the time required for the first red mane and the duration of red “mane” in five minutes.

Results:
The mean time required for the first red “mane” to appear is 22.67±31.79s in the small tank condition. The mean time required for the first red “mane” to appear is 30.67±34.49s in the large tank condition. And the mean duration of the red “mane” in five minutes is 132.67±110.62s in the small tank condition. The mean duration of the red “mane” in five minutes is 101.33±92.12s in the large tank condition. There was no statistically significant difference in mean time for first red mane between the two groups (t value=1.54, p value=0.21, degrees of freedom=2) as shown in Figure 1.  Also, there was no statistically significant difference of mean duration of red “mane” in the five-minute interval between two groups (t value=0.98, p value=0.43, degrees of freedom=2) as shown in Figure 2.

Discussion:
The alternate hypothesis that the smaller the tank size, the longer duration of red “mane” that two Betta splendens males present and quicker the first red "mane" shows up is rejected. However, although there are no significant differences shown in these two measurements. However, the lower average time required for the first red “mane” to appear and the longer duration of red “mane” in five minutes under the small tank condition suggest that there is a difference in aggression between the two tanks.  A previous study has shown an inverse relationship between the tank size and the amount of intraspecific agonistic behavior in Bettas. The display rates and display durations across all tank size and attacks is not a function of a decreased ability to detect the opponent in a larger tank. It is likely that displaying, which appears to be less aversive and energetically more efficient than attacking, continues even in large tank conditions as a means of signaling a readiness to fight, should it become necessary. Agonistic behavior, on the other hand, becomes less necessary as tank size increases. One explanation for this is that fish may be able to detect an increased probability of escape [Goldstein:1975]. And the different degrees of proximity, together with the species and responsiveness of an opponent, could act as a sign stimulus for intraspecific agonistic behaviors [Cain:1980]. The possible explanation for the insignificant difference might be the large standard deviation.  In the experiment, one of the three Betta does not respond at all either in a small tank or in a large tank. It becomes an exception in the experiment which makes the data inaccurate. To improve this experiment, more samples should be used to avoid extreme data.
