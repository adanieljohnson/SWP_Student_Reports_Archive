Title: Effect of Caffeine on Muscle Contraction in Rania pipien Legs

Abstract:
We did a study on the effects of caffeine on the strength of muscle contraction in Rania pipien (frog) legs. Caffeine causes a release of calcium in the muscle tissue with causes the muscle fibers to contract. We expected that injecting caffeine would cause an increase in muscle contraction strength because of the excess calcium it would cause to be released. Three frog legs were skinned and dissected to that the gastrocnemus muscle was tied to a BNC-banana adapter from the achilles tendon. One at a time, the muscles were stimulated with three electrical impulses of 0.2amp and the response was measured in volts. The results showed that there was a slight increase in the strength of the muscle’s response when it was injected with caffeine versus when it was not; however, the difference, shown in the statistical data, was not significent. There for our hypothesis was not fully supported and our data was not identical with those of similar studies.


Introduction:
We are doing a study on muscle contraction in Rania pipien legs. Specifically, we are looking at how caffeine affects the strength of muscle contractions. By studying how caffeine affects muscle contraction, we may gain a better understanding of how to use caffeine to get a desired response from a muscle or how to use caffeine to treat certain muscle problems. The way in which we are going to test the contraction if the Rania pipien muscles is by stimulating the muscles before and after being injected with caffeine with 0.2amp and measuring their response using a BNC-banana adapter. The contraction of a muscle is a complicated process in which an action potential travels from a neuron to a muscle, stimulating the release of calcium (Ca2+) which then causes the muscle to contract. [Johnson: 2016] Caffeine is a substance that causes the release of  calcium in muscles, thereby causing them to contract involuntarily [Lopes: 1983]. Because calcium caused the muscle to contract involuntarily, we expect that the muscles injected with caffeine will show a stronger response than the muscles that are not treated with caffeine. 


Materials and Method:
We placed the three frog legs in a dissecting pan and peeled off the skin all the way off starting from the quad muscles. Then we opened the femoral muscle and separated the white sciatic nerve. We then cut the achilles tendon close to the ankle, tied it to a string and hooked it onto the BNC-banana adapter, pinning the other muscles down on the plate. After setting up LabScribe on the computer, we stuck the pin electrodes directly into the muscle. Then we stimulated each of the three legs three times with 0.2amps and measured the response in Volts. Then we injected each muscle with caffeine and repeated the process. After calculating the average response for the muscles before being injected and after, we drew the bar graph seen in Figure 1. And also calculated the standard deviation, standard error, and the p_value using the paired T-test.


Results:
On average, we saw a slight increase in muscle response with the muscles that were injected with caffeine. As can be seen in Figure 1., the average response in muscles injected with caffeine is about 0.3V higher than muscles not treated with caffeine. However, this increase, according to the p_value of 0.1921 is not significent. 


Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis in that the caffeine did not cause a significent increase in the force of the muscle’s response to electrical stimulation, though there was a slight increase. Our results are similar to a study done on frogs legs in Nigeria at Ahmadu Bello University. They found that “caffeine caused a dose dependent significent increase in force of contraction and duration of contraction (p&lt;0.001) of skeletal muscle” [Olorunshola: 2011]. According to this study, caffeine did in fact cause the force of the muscle contraction to increase by a significent amount. The reason why our experiment my not reflect these findings is because our sample size may have been to small to be a valuable representation for generalization. To further study this topic, I would advise redoing the same procedure, but using a much larger sample size.

Figure 1. Average Muscle Response to 0.2amp Stimulus in Volts. Three frog legs without caffeine (left) were stimulated with 0.2amp and their response was measured and averaged. The legs were then injected with caffeine and stimulated with 0.2amp and their response was then measured and averaged (right). The error bars for the legs without caffeine and the legs with caffeine are ±0.4949V and ± 0.3604V respectively.
