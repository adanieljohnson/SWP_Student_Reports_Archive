Title: The impact of enzyme inhibitor acetylcholinesterase on the muscle contraction of a frog leg using 2% solution of Sevin

Abstract:
Over the course of this experiment, the central idea was based on observing whether acetylcholinesterase inhibitor can affect the rate at which the muscle contraction of a frog leg will reach full tetany at a much lower frequency in Hz. acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is the inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. the hypothesis was based on if an  acetylcholinesterase inhibitor binds to acetylcholine channel, it will cause the  sodium channel to remain open which  will cause constant action potential resulting in the  muscle constantly contracting, thus when observing  frequency, the muscle will be observed to be at full tetany at a much lower valued  frequency than anticipated. During the method, three frog legs were experimented on for both control and treatment. The treatment used was 2% solution of Sevin which was injected into each frog leg after conducting the control portion of the experiment. The process was based on increasing the frequency in Hz and observing a response until full tetany was reach. An online program was used to observe where partial and full tetany where at while also utilizing a stimulation probe. Based on the observed results, our calculate data was statistically insignificant, so we rejected our alternative hypothesis.


Introduction:
The main purpose of this experiment is to observe whether acetylcholinesterase inhibitor has a significant impact on the muscle contraction of frog legs. Initially, acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, it functions as the main enzyme. Acetylcholine is essentially responsible for muscle activation which is signaled from the motor neurons. As a neurotransmitter, it signals the muscles to move and create action forces. As an inhibitor, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor inhibits the enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine. This results in continuous muscle movement which can result in muscle fatigue. Based on further studies, that the inhibitor for acetylcholinesterase has been research for use on Alzheimer patients. Since patients with Alzheimer’s disease have low acetylcholine levels, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor would cause a drastic level change if there is an open channel for acetylcholine to enter [Liston: 2004]. The specified acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is 2% solution of Sevin, which is also known to be an insecticide, yet has been shown to have acetylcholinesterase inhibitor properties [Murray: 1962]. Based on the knowledge that acetylcholinesterase inhibitor does impact the muscle contraction, there is a predicted likeliness of the frequency observed in Hz being a lower value for the treatment group. The main hypothesis for this experiment conveys that if an  acetylcholinesterase inhibitor binds to acetylcholine channel, it will cause the  sodium channel to remain open which  will cause constant action potential resulting in the  muscle constantly contracting, thus when observing  frequency, the muscle will be observed to be at full tetany at a much lower valued  frequency than anticipated.

Materials and Methods:
Initially, we began by preparing three frog legs. To simplify the process, we conducted the control and experimental on the same frog leg, and then moved on to the next leg. We prepared the frog legs, by peeling of the skin, if there was difficulty, we used a kimwipe to peel the rest of the skin off easier. Once the dorsal and ventral side were clearly exposed on the leg, we began opening up the thigh by pulling until noticing the sciatic nerve. From there, we picked up the leg, and applied pressure between the gastrocnemius muscle and the tibial muscle, clearly separating the two muscles using scissors in the gap to cut towards the toes, as well as cutting which separated the Achilles tendon. We then tied a string loop knot at the junction between the Achilles tendon, and the gastrocnemius muscle. We made sure the knot was tight and tied twice to ensuring that it was in a secured spot. We then cut off the excess string left, as well as the Achilles tendon. We then hooked the loop of the leg to the ring stand, ensuring the gastrocnemius muscle was laid down at a 90-degree angle while making sure the thread was straight and tight. To secure the position of the muscle, we applied pins to keep the positioning intact during the experiment. Once the positioning and preparation was completed, we laid our sciatic nerve over our stimulation probe, and began conducting frequency change (Hz) at an initial frequency of 6 Hz and increasing with increments of 2 Hz until reaching full tetany for the control group. When conducting with our treatment groups we began by injecting about 1ml of 2% solution of Sevin in many areas of the frog leg and allowed it to spread for about 5 minutes. From there, we repeated the previous conducted frequency change (Hz) beginning at an initial frequency of 6 Hz and increasing with increments of 2 Hz until reaching full tetany. We increased the frequency in Hz by 2 each round. We repeated the same process with each of the three frog legs. Once the results were observed, we used a paired t-test, and calculated results.

Results:
Based on the results calculated and graphed, the calculated peaks for both the control and treatment group frogs was not statistically significant (t-value= 0.5, df= 2, P-value= 0.667). The results were based off of the three observed frog legs. The observed peaks for full tetany for the control group was the highest for the second frog leg which was at a frequency of 22 in Hz. As for the experimental group, the highest observed peak for full tetany was the third frog leg which was at a measured frequency of 20 in Hz.

Discussion:
Referring back to the results, the statistical paired t-test calculated a final value that was not statistically significant, so we reject our alternative hypothesis which is that if an  acetylcholinesterase inhibitor binds to acetylcholine channel, it will cause the  sodium channel to remain open which  will cause constant action potential resulting in the  muscle constantly contracting, thus when observing  frequency, the muscle will be observed to be at full tetany at a much lower valued  frequency than anticipated. Based on the calculated values, our results support our observations which did not seem statistically significant from the beginning. this was strongly observed when comparing the control groups data with the experimental data. The peaks reported for the frog legs in the results were not drastically different when comparing the peaks for full tetany between the control and treatment groups. This may have been due to a misreading in  the visual graphs that  represented the twitches as there was some similarity between a partial tetany  and full tetany that was observed during the experimental process. When increasing the frequency in Hz, the graphing revealed twitches which were quite unpredictable at times leading to increasing the frequency once more to be accurate. As previously mentioned, the data between the control group and experimental were not far by much, which could explain how one more frequency increase could predict a different outcome of results. Although our hypothesis was not supported, research has shown that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors due in fact have an effect on the contraction of the muscle. In the treatment for myasthenia gravis, which is a neuromuscular disease, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor is used activate contractions of urinary bladder to decrease muscarinic side effects [Petrov: 2018]. Although our hypothesis may not be support by the experimented outcomes, there is still a field of study being conducted in which acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have shown to have a great effect on organisms. The specific inhibitor used in this experiment was 2% solution of Sevin, which is also known to be an insecticide, could be substituted for another inhibitor in future experiments to see if inhibitors vary in response to twitching. In addition, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors could be later evaluated to see if there are other synaptic transmissions impacted by the inhibitor other than muscle contractions. Overall, this experiment conducted the use of 2% solution of Sevin, which acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to observe impacts on three frog leg muscle contractions.
