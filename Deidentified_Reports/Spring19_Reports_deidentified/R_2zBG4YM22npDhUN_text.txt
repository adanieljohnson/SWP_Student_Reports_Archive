Title: Averse Effects of Azaguard on Weight Gain in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta is a folivorous pest that inhabits the United States. The effects of AzaGuard, an Insect Growth Regulator, on M. sexta larvae was measured in this experiment. Azadirachtin, the active ingredient in AzaGuard, is supposed to block ecdysteroids, which regulate the molts of caterpillars. AzaGuard was introduced to the experimental group by mixing it into their food, while the control group received food that was mixed with distilled water. We hypothesized that the experimental caterpillars would not weigh as much as the control because their molts would be interrupted by the AzaGuard. At the end of the measuring period, there was a difference in weight between the experimental group and the control group, with the control group weighing more. Our data does support our hypothesis because according to our statistical test, the weight difference between the groups was statistically significant. 

Introduction:
The experiment tested the effects of the addition of Azaguard, an insect growth regulator (IGR), on weight gain in larvae of the species M. sexta. An IGR is a compound that leads to abnormalities in insects. It is not toxic to insects but is used as an insecticide. M. sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is found in the United States and is widely regarded as a pest because it feeds on tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and potatoes. They are moths in their adult form. Azaguard was introduced to the experimental caterpillars’ food to study what impact it would have on the growth and development. As an insect like the tobacco hornworm grows, it molts. IGRs prevent an insect from reaching maturity by interfering with the molting process. IGRs interrupt the process by blocking ecdysterone, a hormone that regulates when molts happen. The larval stage in the life of M. sexta is split into 5 sections, or instars. After each instar, ecdysteroids peak and the caterpillar molts. After the fifth instar, there is a commitment pulse which is a sharp increase in ecdysteroids. This is when the caterpillar receives the signal it is large enough and has stored enough nutrients to pupate a final time and form a moth. If ecdysteroids are blocked, the larvae may not pupate and move on to the next stage in their lives. A similar study preformed on another type of moth found that the addition of azadirachtin, the active ingredient in AzaGuard, caused delayed effects on development, so our hypothesis is that the Azaguard will block ecdysteroids, the caterpillars will not go through proper molts, and will weigh significantly less than the control [Zhong:2017].

Materials and Methods:
8 M. sexta larvae weighing 05.-3 grams were selected. Four were randomly chosen to receive the control diet and the others received the experimental diet. The caterpillars were placed into four-cell rearing containers. Holes were poked into the sides of the containers to ventilate. The food was prepared so that each experimental caterpillars received 10 grams of food with 100 microliters of 1:1250 Azaguard. The control received the same amount of food except with 100 microliters of distilled water. The food was placed in each cell and the caterpillars were placed in a 24-hour light incubator that was set at 24.9 ˚ C. Each day for 7 days the caterpillars were weighed, their cells were cleaned, and they were given fresh food. A two-tailed T-test was preformed to tell if the difference in the average weights of the caterpillars on day 7 of the control and experimental groups were significant or not. 

Results:
The mean weight for the experimental caterpillars was 4.87 g and for the control it was 11.25 g (fig. 1). Over the course of the week, the general trend was that control caterpillars seemed to eat more food, produce more waste, and maintained a more yellow-green color while the experimental caterpillars did not eat as much and had muted colors and one turned brown.   The calculated p-value from the two-tailed T-test was 0.007. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the AzaGuard would cause the experimental caterpillars to weigh less than the control, was supported. In our case, the results of the T-test supported rejecting that there was not a statistically significant difference in the weight of the caterpillars. Our control caterpillars were much larger than our experimental and according to our test, that weight difference is significant. Our data is also supported by a study done previously on M. sexta that found individuals that were treated with azadirachtin did not reach critical weight for pupation [Schluter: 1985]. The AzaGuard must have blocked the ecdysteroids. The next step in this study would be to repeat the experiment with different concentrations of AzaGuard to determine what the lowest concentration has the desired affects. This information could then be utilized by agricultural industry to determine the appropriate levels of AzaGuard to use as a pesticide. IGRs should be looked into as a possible alternative to traditional pesticides because they are not as toxic to the environment. IGRs may not be toxic to other animals that may come in contact with the plants they are applied onto, but they may affect other insects, as pollinators. More research should be done on how IGRs affects different organisms to see if they could be a suitable replacement for tradition al pesticides.
