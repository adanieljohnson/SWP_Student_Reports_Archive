Title: Effects of Temperature on Photosystem II Function in Spinach Chloroplasts

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment was to determine the effect of different temperature/light conditions on photosynthetic activity in chloroplasts. Photosynthetic activity was assessed via the Hill reaction, in which a stand-in compound (DCIP) was used in place of one of the electron acceptors of Photosystem II that changed colored as it was reduced. Our experiment did find evidence to support our hypothesis that photosynthetic activity increases with increased temperature, but failed to find statistically significant differences between room temperature and hot water bath treatments. This discrepancy may have been due to the inclusion of dark trials (which did not differ significantly cross any treatment groups) in the data; statistics calculated without their inclusion may have yielded more significant results.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a chemical process undergone by some organisms (namely plants and some microorganisms) by which they are able to produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water. This glucose can then be utilized by the organisms’ mitochondria in order to produce the ATP required for cellular processes. The cite at which photosynthesis takes place within the cell is the chloroplast, a membrane bound organelle that contains stacks of flat, disk-like structures called thylakoids that function to separate areas of different solute concentration within the chloroplast, helping to establish and maintain the concentration gradient necessary for photosynthesis to occur.

Photosynthesis takes place in two broad phases. In the first phase, referred to as the light-dependent reactions, photons of light are captured and the energy they contain is used, along with water, to produce ATP and the high-energy electron carrier NADPH. Both of these molecules then power the second phase, referred to as the light-independent reactions, which use carbon dioxide in order to produce glucose to be used later. It is the light-dependent reactions that are of interest in this lab.

The light-dependent reactions can further be subdivided into the two protein complexes that carry them out. Firstly, Photosystem II (PSII) absorbs a photon of light, which excites an electron in the pigment chlorophyll that ultimately moves to the carrier molecule, plastoquinone (Q). The lost electron is replaced by splitting water into its constituent parts: H+, which is moved into the thylakoid lumen to create a chemiosmotic gradient; an electron, which replaces the one donated to Q, and O2, which is secreted as waste. Q then passes its excited electron to cytochrome b6f (b6f), which uses it to pulls even more H+ ions into the thylakoid lumen in order to drive the chemiosmotic gradient. Finally, b6f donates the electron to a final electron acceptor, plastocyanin (PC), which shuttles it to the next protein complex, Photosystem I (PSI). PSI re-excites the electron with light energy and uses it to create NADPH to be used later. The H+ ions pulled into the thylakoid lumen earlier are then allowed to flow down their gradients through ATP synthase to produce ATP for the light-independent reactions. PSII is the system of interest in this lab.

The objective of this lab was to assess the effects of temperature on PSII activity. This was done using the Hill reaction, a procedure in which a different chemical, DCIP, is inserted into the chloroplasts’ environment and act as an alternate final electron acceptor in place of PC. DCIP absorbs in the 600nm range, but its reduced form, DCIPH2, is clear. The change in absorbance caused by chemical reduction therefore can be measured and used as a proxy for PSII activity. We hypothesized that chloroplast activity, and thereby change in absorbance over the course of the experiment, would increase as temperature increased, based on the idea that, as temperature increases, so should the incidence of productive collisions within the chloroplast. We also predict based on literature [Masden: 1989], however, that the rate of photosynthesis should only increase with temperature up to a certain optimal point, above which photosynthetic rate has been demonstrated to level out or begin to decrease.


Materials and Methods:
The experiment was begun by placing a mortar, pestle, medium-sized beaker, and several 50 mL centrifuge tubes on ice to cool. While these materials were cooling, 4 large spinach leaves were deveined. The chilled mortar and pestle were then used, along with cold grinding buffer solution (400nM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to grind the spinach to a slurry that was then strained through several layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. 1 mL of the strained liquid was placed into a microtube labeled “Sample A” that was then placed on ice. The remaining liquid was centrifuged at 200G (1200 rpm) for 5 minutes at 4C. Once centrifuged, the resulting pellet was discarded and the supernatant was set aside for later use.

31 test tubes were prepared with the following mixes: one blank test tube containing 8 mL of water and 2 mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5); and 30 test tubes containing 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The blank was then set aside, and the remaining 30 test tubes were split up into the following treatment groups of 5 test tubes: chloroplasts in light on ice (1.5C), chloroplasts in light at room temperature (23C), chloroplasts in light in warm bath (35.1C), chloroplasts in dark on ice, chloroplasts in dark at room temperature, and chloroplasts in dark in warm bath. To begin the assay, 100 L of chloroplast-containing supernatant set aside from earlier was added to all tubes except the blank. Immediately upon adding chloroplasts, a time zero absorbance reading was taken using a spectrophotometer set to 600nm. Tubes were then placed in their treatments, and readings were taken every 10 minutes at 600nm for a total of 30 minutes.

A percent change in absorbance at 600nm from time zero to the end of the experiment (t=30 minutes) was calculated for each replicate, and these percent changes were averaged within treatment groups to produce an average percent change in absorbance for each treatment. Temperature groups were then compared using paired t-tests, and p-values were calculated for each comparison group.


Results:
A statistically significant difference was found between the average percent changes for the room temperature treatments and the ice treatments (P=0.0169). A comparison between the ice treatments and the warm water bath also found a significant difference (P=0.000156). A comparison between room temperature treatments and warm water bath treatments did not reach the level of statistical significance (P=0.116). While statistics were not calculated for this comparison, it can be clearly observed in Figure 1 that in all temperature groupings except the ice treatments, the chloroplasts placed in light had markedly higher average percent changes as compared to their dark counterparts.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that increased temperature would lead to increased average percent change in absorbance over the course of the experiment, was generally supported by the data. Comparison between the warm water bath and ice treatments yielded an extremely low P-value, suggesting that it was almost definitely the experimental treatments themselves that produced the observed differences. A statistically significant difference in average percent change in absorbance was also found between room temperature and ice treatments, further supporting the hypothesis. 

The only piece of data that does not support the hypothesis is the fact that the difference between the room temperature and warm water bath treatments did not reach the level of statistical significance. However, this could be for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the raw temperature difference between the ice treatment and the room temperature treatment (21.5C) was greater than that between the room temperature treatment and warm water bath treatment (12.1). Perhaps if the warm water bath treatment had used a higher temperature, the difference in absorbance between it and the room temperature treatment would have reached significance. Secondly, the literature shows that increasing temperature only increases rate of photosynthesis up to a certain point, above which photosynthetic rate actually begins to decrease [Downton: 1972]. Finally, the lack of significant difference between room temperature and warm water groups could be due to the fact that there was little-to-no difference between the dark treatments in any temperature groups, all of their average percent changes in absorbance hovering between 356% and 495%. The fact that these data were included may have obscured the data; the average percent change in absorbance in just light trials are visibly very different across temperature groups in our data, and perhaps a t-test run comparing only them might have reached significance.

Several avenues are available for follow-up to this research. First, temperature effects should be verified by repeating this procedure, both in spinach and in other plant species, in order to confirm that the obtained results can be generally applied to PSII as a whole, as opposed to being an effect only observed in this individual species. From there, the effects of other manipulations on photosynthetic rate should also be tested; light color, water/nutritional restriction, and atmospheric composition are all good candidates. Finally, if one could find a molecule to substitute for one of the intermediate steps of PSI, one might be able to use a similar procedure to the one in this lab in order to assess PSI activity as well.
