Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca seat Caterpillars

Abstract:
Abstract
The importance of insect controll is growing rapidly as more and more farmers are having their crops destroyed by plant-eating pests. However, the use of insecticides is dangerous not only for humans, but for the rest of the natural environment. The use of Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) is far healthier than the normal pesticide, because it targets only processes that do not occur in mammals. In this experiment, we studied an IGR called Martin’s IGR, and its effect on juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesized that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone would prevent the natural maturation of the caterpillars. However, analyzing our data using a two-sampled T-test showed no statistically significent difference between the treatment group and the controll group. 


Introduction:
In this experiment, we will test the effects of Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) on Manduca caterpillars. IGRs hinder development in the insect; however, unlike other pesticides, they are not directly toxic. By targeting processes that do not occur in mammals, IGRs are far more selective than pesticides and therefore do not pose as great a threat to the environment. In this case, we will be observing the effects of a specific IGR called Martin’s Hormone on juvenile hormone levels in the caterpillars. Manduca sexta caterpillars have five larval instars; along with ecdysterone, juvenile hormone (JH) controlls the timing of these instars [Kingsolver: 2007]. This hormone prevents the larvae from maturing into pupae until they have attained the appropriate stage and size. When the larvae are ready to molt, there is a significent drop in JH secretion [Symkal: 2014]. If the natural level of JH is altered, the normal development of insects should be affected as well. We hypothesize that the addition of an IGR that mimics the effects of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent the caterpillars from maturing into pupae.


Materials and Method:
Using a balance and a ruler, we recorded the initial length and weight of eight Manduca sexta caterpillars. Four caterpillars were identified as the treatment group and four were identified as the controll group. Each caterpillar was placed in its own individual cell in two containers (treatment and controll), each cell including punctured air holes. 80 grams of caterpillar food were measured out in a square container, and the balance was zeroed out before measuring. For the controll group, 10 grams of food were weighed for each caterpillar. Three drops of diluted water were added to each 10 grams of food. A 10-gram piece of food was placed in each controll caterpillar cell. For the treatment group, another 10 grams of food were weighed for each experimental caterpillar. Three drops of Martin’s IGR were added to each 10 grams of food. A 10-gram piece of food was placed in each treatment caterpillar cell. The lid was closed on both containers and the caterpillars were placed in an incubator. A balance and ruler were used each day to measure and record the length (mm) and weight (g) of each caterpillar. The food was replenished if it was dried out. A two-sample T-test was used to determine the differences in average length and weight between the controll group and the treatment group.


Results:
The average weight of both the controll and treatment groups increased steadily for the first eleven days, although the treatment group seemed to gain significently more than the controll group (Fig.1). From day eleven to day fourteen, the treatment weight seemed to decrease and level off (Fig.1.) The controll weight increased slightly between days eleven and twelve, then rapidly decreased (Fig.1.) The length of both the controll and treatment group seemed to increase at a relatively consistent rate from days one through twelve, although there were some slight fluctuations in the length of the treatment group (Fig.2). From day twelve to day fourteen, the controll length seemed to level off while the treatment length continued to increase (Fig.2). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean weight of the controll group was not statistically significently different than the mean weight of the treatment group (t_stat = 0.513508, d.f. = 26, P = 0.611933). The mean length of the controll group was not statistically significently different than the mean length of the treatment group (t_stat = 0.023993, d.f. = 26, p = 0.981041). Based on these results, the controll and treatment groups were not statistically significently different. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent the larvae from maturing at a rate different than that of the controll group, was not supported. Based on our results, we determined that the controll group and the treatment group had relatively similar maturation patterns. While we did see some variation between the controll group and the treatment group, the difference between the two was not significent enough to reject the null hypothesis. An explanation could be that we did not increase the effect of JH enough, and therefore did not see a significent change. Perhaps increasing the amount of juvenile hormone would lead to more substantial results. However, some researchers argue that juvenile hormone does not play that significent a role in the pupation process. A study published in the Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology found that “the primary role of the prepupal peak of JH in M. sexta thus seems to be in promoting normal pupal-adult development rather than having a profound effect on the pupation process itself” [Jones: 1985]. In this case, the expected differences between the controll and treatment groups would be observed once the caterpillars had completed the pupation process. Future studies should focus on the effects of JH on pupal-adult development rather on just the pupation process. If JH is found to have an insignificent influence on pupation, then it would not serve as an effective pesticide for Manduca sexta caterpillars as these insects cause the most damage before they experience pupation.
