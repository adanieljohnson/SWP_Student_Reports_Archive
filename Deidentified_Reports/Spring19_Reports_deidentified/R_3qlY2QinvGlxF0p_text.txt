Title: Effects of juvenile hormones on the growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This experiment studies the effects of juvenile hormones on Manduca sexta. We believed that the hormones would prevent the Manduca sexta from pupating. To test this, we had a group of 4 Manduca sexta fed with 8 drops of juvenile hormones and a group fed with food with 8 drops of water. They were measured and given new food every day for two-weeks. The average weight after two weeks of both groups was roughly the same and no significent change was found between the groups. The p value was 0.30619. The hypothesis was not supported. It is possible that the caterpillars did not receive enough juvenile hormone. Perhaps increasing the amount of juvenile hormone received could slow or prevent pupation from occurring. 

Introduction:
Pests have always been a been a problem to agriculture, they are usually killed using pesticides that could harm the environment. However, an alternative solution to using pesticides would be to use hormones found in the pests themselves to prevent the pests from even being a problem. In this experiment we will observe the effects of juvenile hormones on Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta is commonly referred to as the tobacco hornworm. During the larvae stage the Manduca sexta can grow up to 10 grams [Reinecke: 1980]. We chose the Manduca sexta because it has three hormones that controll its growth: ecdysteriods, juvenile hormones, and prothoracicotropic hormone [Bollenbacher: 1981]. These hormones can be easily manipulated through Manduca sextaâ€™s diet. In this experiment we tested the effects of juvenile hormones on the larvae stage of the Manduca sexta. In this experiment the experimental group was fed additional juvenile hormones. We believe that if Manduca sexta is given enough juvenile hormones then the caterpillar will not begin to pupate ultimately preventing the Manduca sexta from reaching adulthood. 

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta were separated into 2 groups of 4 caterpillars in each group. Each caterpillar was weighed to find their starting weight then placed in a container that was the same for every caterpillar. The four caterpillars in the experimental group were given 10 grams of caterpillar food with 8 drops of precor juvenile hormones added. The four caterpillars in the controll group were given 10 grams of caterpillar food with 8 drops of water added to match the texture and consistency of the experimental group. The caterpillars were checked on and weight gain was measured in grams every day. The food of the Manduca sexta was changed each day with the same food that the caterpillars were given on the first day, 10 grams with 8 drops of juvenile hormones for the experimental group and 10 grams with 8 drops of water for the controll group. The caterpillars were given fresh food and measured every day for two weeks. After two weeks the average weight of both the experimental and controll groups were taken. A two-tailed T-test was used to determine if there was a significent difference between the averages of the experimental and controll groups. 

Results:
The average weight gain of the controll group was 6.55 grams (Fig. 1). The average weight gain of the experimental was 4.09 grams (Fig. 1). Both the experimental and the controll group had roughly the same average weight gain (Fig. 1). The two-tailed p_value was 0.30619. However, visual observations showed that the controll group was much greener and had begun to pupate while the experimental was a very pale green and showed no sign of pupation. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that juvenile hormones would prevent Manduca sexta from pupating was not supported. We received no significent difference between the controll and experimental groups suggesting that adding extra juvenile hormones to the diet of the Manduca Sexta was not enough to prevent the caterpillars from beginning to pupate and reaching adulthood. The two groups of Manduca sexta had almost the same amount of growth over the two-week testing period. It is possible that the juvenile hormones had no effect on the weight gain of the Manduca sexta but prevented the caterpillars from pupating. We believed the juvenile hormones would not gain as much weight and not turn brown and begin to pupate. However, both groups gained a significent amount of weight during the two-week period but did not begin pupation. Perhaps not enough juvenile hormone was given to the caterpillars and weight gain still took place. Increasing the juvenile hormones past 8 drops could prevent the Manduca sexta from gaining weight and entering pupation. Additional research suggests that keeping juvenile hormone levels high in the body could lead to an increase in the time it takes to pupate [Nijhout: 1974]. Perhaps using more juvenile hormones or different hormones that induce pupation then the pupating process could be slowed or halted.
