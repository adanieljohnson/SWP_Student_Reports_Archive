Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone-Mimicking Insect Growth Regulator on Manduca sexta Pupation

Abstract:
In this experiment, the Manduca sexta was the model organism used to test the effects of juvenile hormone on pupation and if it can prevent larvae from growing into adult moths. Juvenile hormone is the hormone that decreases in levels once a moth is ready to pupate. It was hypothesized that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to JH-mimicking IGR, it will make them mature faster, but then hinder them from pupating. Six caterpillars were used. Three were controll, and the other three were treated with a substance that mimics juvenile hormone. Their weights were recorded each week day. The treatment larvae did in fact grow faster, but then their growth leveled off as the controll larvae surpassed them in weight. However, no larvae pupated in this amount of time, therefore the null hypothesis could not be rejected. With a p_value of 0.366165, we can conclude that our results were not statistically significent. We can assume that if the experiment continued for longer, we would get more significent results. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a moth in the Order Lepidoptera that aids in the studies of pest controll and hormone regulation [Johnson: 2018]. Preliminary studies have shown how the larvae and their growth can be manipulated by “insect growth regulators” (IGRs) that mimic certain hormones naturally present in the tissue of Manduca sexta [Nijhout: 1974]. Finding that hormone-mimicking IGRs do in fact inhibit or increase growth of the Manduca sexta can be taken to the field of pest controll, showing which hormones to treat insects that are pests either in adulthood or as larvae. The hormone of focus in this present experiment is the juvenile hormone (JH) and its effect on the Manduca sexta. JH regulates when larvae begin to pupate and go through metamorphosis into an adult moth [Nijhout; 1974]. JH levels are high in the larval stage, and then decline right before the larva begins to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. This leads us to wonder, what happens when larva are continuously exposed to an IGR that mimics JH? It is expected that exposure to a JH-mimicking IGR prolongs the larval stage. Interestingly enough, preliminary studies show that JH-mimicking IGR can aid larva growth at first, but then growth quickly levels off [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, we hypothesize that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to JH-mimicking IGR, it will make them mature faster, but then hinder them from pupating. 

Materials and Method:
To test our hypothesis, we used a total of 6 Manduca sexta caterpillars. We chose them to have around the same starting weight. We divided the caterpillars into treatment and controll groups, 3 caterpillars in each. The two groups were placed in two separate plastic shelters, and each individual caterpillar had a separate box. All 6 caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food consisting of their typical nutrient-rich diet. The controll caterpillars received 5 drops of water in their food, and the treatment caterpillars received 5 drops of JH-mimicking IGR in their food. Every week day, we measured our caterpillars’ weights and recorded them in a table; an example is below (Table 1). We carried out this experiment for two weeks. 
The statistical test used was a two-sample t_test, comparing the amount of growth of the treatment caterpillars to the amount of growth of the controll caterpillars. Our p_value was determined by calculating the difference between each caterpillars’ final weight and start weight – one numeric value for each caterpillar, three numeric values for each group. An example is below:

	Treatment caterpillar #1’s initial weight: 0.70g
	Treatment caterpillar #1’s final weight: 10.42g
	Calculation: 10.42g-0.70g = 9.72g} This is treatment caterpillar #1’s value for the t_test used to get our p_value. 

	Our data was summarized by doing the above calculation for each caterpillar. We then calculated the average change in weight per group and the standard deviation of each. The averages and standard deviations were presented in a graph.  


Results:
For our experiment, the one-tailed p_value was 0.366165. We found that on average, the treatment caterpillars grew very fast, and then their weights tapered off and had no additional growth. On the other hand, the controll caterpillars grew and continued to grow; they ended up heavier than our treatment caterpillars. However, there was one controll caterpillar who served as an outlier, beginning at around the same weight as the others, but barely grew. This is shown with the large error bars on the controll bar (Fig 1). The outlier is also why the treatment’s average growth was higher than the controll’s, even though the controll group turned out heavier (Fig 1). 

Discussion:
Based on our results, our hypothesis was supported in that the JH-mimicking IGR aided the caterpillars’ growth at the beginning, but then they never got as heavy as the controll caterpillars did. However, our p_value was 0.366165, meaning our results are not statistically significent, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Our results were also ultimately inconclusive, due to the fact that no caterpillars pupated out of any group. However, we can assume that the IGR would have continued to keep the caterpillars in their present larval state and inhibit pupation. 
This assumption could be proven with a follow-up experiment, one that tests the same hypothesis, uses the same method, but is just carried out for a period longer than two weeks. It is possible that if the experiment was just one week longer, we would see the controll pupate and the treatment stay behind in the larval state. This could potentially be a very conclusive experiment yielding strong evidence of how and when JH-mimicking IGR should be given to Manduca sexta or other Order Lepidoptera insects in order to keep them at one larval stage.
Other studies have in fact shown that the 5th instar larval stage can be prolonged by JH-mimicking IGR [Nijhout: 1974]. Final instar larvae given JH-mimicking IGR before the time they would have pupated were unable to do so, proving that it does inhibit the Manduca sexta from reaching adulthood [Nijhout: 1974]. This information can be taken out into the fields of pest controll; treating insects similar to the Manduca sexta or others in the Order Lepidoptera with JH in their final larval stage will prevent them from becoming pests as adults. It can also be used to prove that generally, treating insects with naturally-present hormones, but at unnatural amounts and growth stages, can in fact keep them young or speed them into adulthood.
