Title: Nitrogen has an Inconclusive Effect on the Phenotypic Plasticity of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus 

Abstract:
The allocation of resources is an important subject in conservation biology. It is important to recognize and explain how plants will modify their method of allocation in response to changes in their environment. In this lab, we investigate the effect of adding nitrogen on the growth patterns of the roots and shoots of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus. Nitrogen is one of the important nutrients that plants must take in to complete photosynthesis. Nitrogen is also essential to plants’ survival because they are a significent component of amino acids, which help form proteins. The need for nitrogen affects plants’ resource allocation because it is a necessity that cannot be ignored, but too much effort to obtain it could cause plants to lose other important resources they need to function. The expectation was that the root to shoot length ratios would be lower in the radish plants grown in nitrogen added soil compared to radish plants grown under normal conditions. The p_value from our data (.077) showed that the data was not statistically significent and therefore our hypothesis was not supported. This lack of significance proposes that the root: shoot length ratios of radish plants does not meaningfully change in response to adding to nitrogen to the soil. These findings may 

Introduction:
The limited amount of resources affects the presence of species in an ecological community. Almost all plant interactions revolve around obtaining essential resources like water, sunlight, and compounds like nitrogen. This experiment investigates the influence of added nitrogen in soil on plant growth. Plants change how they allocate resources based on the changes in their environment. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a single genotype to produce more than one phenotype under different environmental conditions. Phenotypic plasticity determines development patterns over a change of time [Gianoli: 1924]. In our experiment, we compare the phenotypic plasticity of radish plants under a normal environment and a nitrogen rich environment. We use radish plants because they grow reliably and quickly and can be used in a variety of experiments, specifically for representing the impact of different amounts of nutrients. They are also a part of the family of Arabidopsis thaliana, an important model plant in biological studies [Hewitson 1994]. We test the effect of added nitrogen because nitrogen frequently is the most limited and most diversely acquired nutrient for terrestrial plants. Nitrogen helps form amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, which are necessary to the endurance of plants. Plants also differ significently in how they allocate nitrogen between their roots and shoots. Roots not only anchor the plant in the soil, they also are the main absorptive organ. Plants that allocate resources to root growth and preservation will survive even when water and minerals in the soil are scarce. Shoots of plants (their leaves and stems) provide carbon compounds and allow them to capture light effectively [Hewitson: 1994] Nitrogen changes the distribution of dry matter between the root and the shoots of the radish. Seedlings prioritize shoot growth when grown in low nitrogen soil [Hewitson: 1994]. We hypothesize that the root: shoot length of the nitrogen added plants will be lower than the root: shoot length of the radish plants under normal conditions. 

Materials and Method:
We gathered about 60 radish seeds and soaked them for about 20-30 minutes. We used six pots to store the radish seeds: three were filled to the brim with vermiculite and watered (normal group), while the other three pots had nitrogen spread over them and were filled only halfway with vermiculite. We filled the remainder of these three pots with vermiculite and watered them after adding the nitrogen. We gave each of the six pots 25Ml of Miracle-Gro. Then made nine holes (1in x 1 in) in all of the 6 pots and filled each hole with five radish seeds. Then covered the holes with vermiculite and watered them again. The pots were then all placed in a green house and watered every day for two weeks.Then, we took the plants out of their trays and dried them with a paper towel. We chose five plants from each tray and weighed the five plants together and recorded their weight. Next, we separated the roots from the shoots by cutting each plant at the junction of the root and shoot. We weighed the shoots and recorded the root mass which is total mass minus shoot mass. We measured the shoot and root length to the nearest millimeter and recorded the mean value. We repeated this process for the other five trays. Finally, we used a two-tailed t_test and compared our p_value to the standard alpha of .05 to determine if our data was statistically significent.

Results:
See Figure 1 attached to back of report. 
The graph shows that the controll group had a greater root: shoot ratio in length than the nitrogen rich group. The mean root: shoot length ratio for the controll group was 1.24 ± 0.417, while the mean root: shoot length ratio for the nitrogen rich group was 0.82 ± 0.035. At an alpha of .05, our data was not statistically significent (t=1.76, dF=4, p=.077). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported in that the nitrogen added environment would have a lower root: shoot length in radish plants. Although the average root: shoot length ratio of the nitrogen added plants was lower than that of the normal plants, the trends of our graph produced a p_value of .077 which shows our data was not statistically significent. Since we used Miracle-Gro, this shows the impact in our results because Miracle-Gro contains nitrogen. Miracle-Gro also contains phosphorous and potassium, two other essential nutrients for plant growth and durability [Plant Food Basics: 2019].This could be a confounding variable that neglects the fact that nitrogen was added to certain groups. The Miracle-Gro could have limited the possible nitrogen-burn and having too much nitrogen in the nitrogen rich plants causing little growth. Nitrogen burn describes the scorch of leaves that occurs when a plant receives an excess of fertilizer.  A future experiment like this must consider the use of Miracle-Gro and the contents of the soil used to try to avoid these experimental problems. Too much nitrogen can cause nitrogen poisoning which reduces the ability for plants to blossom and grow their shoots [Hewitson: 1994]. In an experiment like ours, researchers studied the effect of insufficient levels of nitrogen, as well as iron, calcium, potassium and other minerals, on radish plants. Their results demonstrated that as nitrogen levels in the soil increase, the size and tissue of the radish plants decreases. The roots and shoots that grew the most had the least amount of added nitrogen [Hewitson: 1994]. This suggests that it is smarter to buy fertilizers with less nitrogen in order to harvest bigger, stronger radish plants. Also, the extra nitrogen not used by the plants can lead to environmental damage for both animals and plants due to runoff from the soil that enters a nearby body of water. A future experiment could test different concentrations of nitrogen in plants to study what amount is most beneficial to the growth of roots. This study would give fertilizer companies information on how much nitrogen to contain in their fertilizer. Also, this study would provide farmers with a better idea of the amount of nitrogen necessary for their plants, such as how to proficiently space out their seedlings and guarantee maximum growth.
