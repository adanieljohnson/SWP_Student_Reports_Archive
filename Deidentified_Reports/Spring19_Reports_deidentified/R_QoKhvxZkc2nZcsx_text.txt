Title: Insect Growth Regulator Precor Effects the Endocrine System by Preventing Juvenile Hormone Levels from Dropping Contributing to a Weight Increase in Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators can be used to alter the developmental cycle of insects, which can be beneficial in controlling pests. Precor does not allow JH levels to drop, therefore delaying the commitment pulse. We hypothesized if Manduca sexta were consumed precor then the Manduca sexta growth will be stunted. The control group was fed food mixed with water and the experimental group was fed food mixed with precor. The average weight change of each of the two groups will be used as a mean of comparison and a two-sample T test will be used to test the hypothesis. The average of the control was not significantly different than the experimental, therefore the null hypothesis is not rejected. Our data does not support our hypothesis and confirms that increasing levels of JH causes a delay in development, but does not cause a stunt in growth. 

Introduction:
Development stages in most insects like, the Manduca sexta are triggered by a decrease or increase of particular hormones. The advantage of using Manduca sexta as a model organism for studying the impact of hormones on growth and development is the cycle from an egg to an adult moth is the cycle short and only about 39 to 48 days [Jhonson:2018]. The Manduca sexta brain receives input from the environment and processes the information and sends output signals to the endocrine system in order produced activation effects and organizational effects. Juvenile Hormones are organic molecules produced by the corpus allata that regulate the type of molting which is an organizational effect that occurs during the development of Manduca sexta. Manduca sextas have five larval instars separated by molts. Towards the ends of the 4th larval instar JH levels drop slightly due to and Ecdysterone (20E) rises temporality. During the 5th larval instar JH levels drop extremely low and there is another rise in 20E known as the commitment pulse. [Jhonson:2018] The commitment pulse triggers the Manduca setxa to start producing proteins needed for metamorphosis and triggers the start behavioral process of wandering. [Johnson: 2018] Precor is an IGR that does not allow JH levels to drop, like the levels naturally do before the commitment pulse. Studying the effects of precor on Manduca sexta is important because since precor prevents JH levels from dropping, therefore preventing the commient pulse and delaying or stop the developmental process of Manduca sexta. Precor could be beneficial for pest control because Manduca sexta is a pest as a moth, but not as a larva. How could altering the levels of JH change the developmental process and growth of Manduca sexta? Since the Manduca sexta must reach a certain weight threshold before metamorphous begins, [Suzuki: 2013] JH might have an effect on the weight of the llava. We hypothesized if Manduca sexta were given four drops in precor mixed into food then the Manduca sexta growth will be stunted. 

Materials and Methods:
Two containers with separate cells for each Manduca sexta were used to separate the control group and experimental group. We set up the containers by poking air holes in each cell and labeled each cell with the numbers 1-3 and labeled which group would live in the container. The Manduca sexta in the control group were each fed 10 grams of food containing 10 drops of water and the experimental group were each fed 10 grams of food containing 6 drops of water and 4 drops of Precor. Maintenance required placing both containers with lids in an incubator, replacing food and cleaning out feces as needed. The weights of each Manduca sexta were recorded every day except on Saturday and Sunday. Since the Manduca sexta initially had different weights, the change in weight was used to measure growth. A large decrease in weight were used determine when the Manduca sexta have a commitment pulse. The average weight change of each of the two groups were used as a mean of comparison and a two-sample T test was used to test the hypothesis. Two sample T-tests are used to compare the means of two groups of data, such as the control and experimental. An excel template that in the biology core resource guide was used to calculate the p-value [Jhonson:2018].  The p-value was used to determine if the results are significant enough to prove or reject the hypothesis. 

Results:
The control group started the commitment pulse around the fourth day because they decreased in weight and started wandering around their cells. The experimental group did not start the wandering stage and continued to gain weight during the two weeks. According to figure 1, the control group’s average change in weight was 2.83 grams smaller than the experimental group’s average change in weight. The standard deviation of the control is 0.39 and 0.98 for the experiment group. Therefore, the Manduca sexta in the control group had less variation between the weights of each Manduca sexta than the experimental group. The average of the control was not significantly different than the experimental (t-stat=3.76, df=4, P=0.020). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, if four drops of Precor is added to the diet of the larval Manduca sexta, their growth will be stunted was not supported. The P value states that the null hypothesis is not rejected because the mean of the experimental group is not significantly greater or less than the mean of the control group. Therefore, precor is not associated with stunting growth. If our hypothesis was correct than the experimental group would have had a lower average weight than the control group. The Manduca sexta continued to gain weight in the control group because JH levels have an effect on the increase of weight gain before the commitment pulse. Our experiment may have been more accurate, and the standard deviation may have been lower if we weighed the Manduca sexta everyday instead of everyday execpt Saturday and Sunday because we would have more weights to determine the average change in weight. In an experiment conducted by the University of Washington, experimenters removed the corpus allata from Manduca sexta and the weight was significantly lower than the control group. [Suzuki: 2013] The decrease in weight after removing the corpus allata relates to our experiment because removing the corpus allata would significantly decrease the amount of JH in the Manduca sexta and in our experiment we kept the JH levels high which caused Manduca sextas to gain weight. More research could be done to determine if the developmental cycle of Manduca sexta could be prohibited without causing as much harm to the Manduca sexta. The extreme weight gained caused the Manduca sexta of the experimental group to look more swollen and to become less active than the control group. A future experiment could test if adding less drops of precor would slow Manduca sexta development without causing as much of an extreme weight gain. Future experimentation could be beneficial use of IGR’s as pest control has fewer effects on non-targeted insects and animals compared to pesticides [Ramaseshadri:2012] and maybe IGR’s could be less harmful to the targeted pest as well.
