Title: Effect of Martin’s IGR on Manduca sexta caterpillar’s Development 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillar’s development is propagated through two main hormones within the insect: Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). When the balance of one of these hormones is disrupted, a malfunction in molt, pupation, and development occurs. Within this lab, Martin’s IGR, or methoprene, a JH hormone analog, was used to test the growth rate over time as well as what impact it would have on the development of the Manduca sexta. So, six drops of methoprene were added to the experimental group of caterpillar’s ten grams of given food. The controll Manduca sexta received the same food and same amount, however, they received six drops of water. The hypothesis applied to this lab detailed that Martin’s IGR would impact the growth of the caterpillars in a way that prevented them from pupating and, rather, continued to grow as caterpillars until death. However, there was very little distinguishable difference between the controll group and experimental group. Therefore, we failed to reject the null hypothesis and the alternative was accepted instead.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta caterpillars have a multitude of hormones that regulate their many bodily process. Specific to growth and developmental changes within the caterpillars are three main hormones: Prothoracicotropic hormones, Ecdysteroids, juvenile hormones. However, in this experiment, the focus will only be on the latter hormone, but more specifically, its analog, methoprene. For a Manduca Sexta to properly develop past the fifth instar and molt, it must have a low amount of juvenile hormone and a sharp increase in its ecdysteroids. A way of disrupting this natural process is through the introduction to an insect growth regulator. An IGR can cause growth and development abnormalities that inhibit the Manduca sexta from “normal” life cycle and biological processes. An example of this being that, when used in a separate experiment on Ephestiu cuutellu, whom infested a stored container of in-shell peanuts, methoprene effectively caused a greater than 90% reduction in adult development throughout a 2-year experiment [Oberlander: 1997]. The IGR used in this experiment is Martin’s IGR which contains methoprene. The purpose of this lab experiment is to see the effect of this methoprene sample on the biological systems and development of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. Therefore, in conjunction with the Ephestiu cuutellu failing to reach adulthood, it is predicted that the Manduca sexta will only grow large and fail to pupate into adults [Oberlander: 1997].

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta of which were at the 2nd to 3rd instar of development were randoMly selected and split into two groups of four. One group was labeled the controll and the other experimental. Then, each groups were placed into their respective plastic containers of which had four separate living sections for each of the caterpillars. Each section of the controll container had ten grams of the Great Lakes Manduca diet with six drops of water mixed in. Each section of the experimental container had ten grams of the Great Lakes Manduca diet with six drops of Martin’s IGR mixed in. These drops of water and IGR are considered the independent variable. When the Manduca sexta ran out of their diet, it was immediately replaced with diet of the identical formula. They were then placed in a regulatory incubator with a natural 12-hour light and 12-hour dark light cycle. In accordance with the dependent variable, their weight and developmental process, were observed every day at 6:00 pm. The data collected will be examined through a one-sample t_test.

Results:
The experiment conducted demanded to observation of the change in weight of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars in the experimental and controll groups over the time span of fourteen days. It was noted that both groups, experimental and controll, grew in mass each day. However, in the last three days of the experiment, the Manduca sexta caterpillars of the experimental group began to turn brown and lose weight. Figure one shows that the Manduca sexta of the controll averaged a mass of 9.135 grams in the first week and 11.96 grams in the next week. Figure one illuminates the average of the mass of the experimental group was 10.51 grams in the first week and 12.66 grams in the second. The table labeled 1 demonstrates singular caterpillar’s total growth in mass in the allotted time period of the experiment. The figure two’s outcome of our statistical tests yielded a mean of 0.8725 with a standard deviation of 0.1393735986 for the not treated caterpillars. The outcome of our statistical tests yielded a mean of 0.9975 with a standard deviation of 0.2296918225 for the treated caterpillars. Our one tailed p_value ended up being 0.1940066606.

Discussion:
The lab experiment relayed no significent data that would bolster our hypothesis; our hypothesis being that Martin’s IGR would impact the growth of the caterpillars in a way that caused them to grow larger than the controll and then fail to reach peak adulthood. After analysis of data collected, it was clear that there was a slight difference in the treated Manduca Sexta that could support the null hypothesis as seen in figure 1 and table 1. None of the caterpillars reached pupation as well, as predicated because of the known development-inhibiting capabilities of Martin’s IGR. They continued to grow, but towards the end of the experiment, began to turn brown and die rather than pupate. This brings the study done with Ephestiu cuutellu back into focus. The Ephestiu cuutellu were effectively locked into their developmental stage due to the intervention of methoprene much like the Manduca sexta within our own lab. However, there was a 20% likelihood that our results occurred by chance according to the P-value. The Ephestiu cuutellu study was conducted over a period of two years while we only conducted ours for two weeks [Oberlander: 1997]. Perhaps a greater amount of time would have yielded better results in favor of the null hypothesis.  Then, by looking at the results of the one sample T-test, it showed that by giving the caterpillars the methoprene it caused relative weight gain, but the results were not different in any statistical way from that of the controll group.
