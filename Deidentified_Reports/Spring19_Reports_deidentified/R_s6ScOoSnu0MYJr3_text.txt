Title: How Excess Acetylcholine Effects the Neuromuscular Control of the Gastrocnemius in Frog Legs

Abstract:
Acetylcholine is a major neurotransmitter seen in humans and animals that is crucial in the process of muscle contraction. The release of acetylcholine is important for the signaling of muscle fibers due to the formation of action potentials. The main objective of this experiment is to understand the effects of excess acetylcholine (ACh) on the gastrocnemus muscle of a leopard frog, specifically a Rania pipiens. The hypothesis is if the gastrocnemus is injected with 2 Ml of ACh, the minimum threshold voltage will lower because of an increase of depolarization, which creates an action potential at a higher rate, causing muscle contraction to be more susceptible. Three frog legs were set up as controll groups and after their minimum threshold was found, they were all given 2 Ml of ACh. Their thresholds were tested again and the data showed a significent difference in the voltages of the experimental versus controll groups based on the one-tailed paired t_test. The null hypothesis was rejected; however, the experimental group had higher minimum thresholds in each frog leg. Based on this information, the extra acetylcholine caused deficiencies in the process of muscle contraction due to the disruption of the creation of action potentials.  

Introduction:
Rania pipiens, also known as leopard frogs, live throughout North America and they usually are found in marshlands or forests and can adapt to cold environments easily. Their length ranges from five to eleven centimeters. These types of frogs have been used for many muscle studies in the past because they provide a simple layout of different organs and structures within the body and they are easier to examine than other organisms [Dewey: 1999]. In this lab, frog legs are used to test neuromuscular controll and the reaction time of muscle fibers. Motor neurons send signals to muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction. This is where nerve impulses allow the release of acetylcholine—a neurotransmitter—which binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber. Muscarinic receptors controll the release and inhibition of ACh [Slutsky: 1999]. When the ACh binds, sodium channels open to create an action potential [Johnson:2018]. When the action potential spreads through the muscle fiber, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson:2018]. Nicotonic acetylcholine receptors that are part of the neuron also cause an influx of calcium ions which regulate the release of presynaptic neurotransmitters [Shen:2009]. The release of calcium causes contractions, which shorten muscle fibers [Johnson:2018]. The minimum threshold is the least amount of stimulus needed in order for the muscle to contract. A higher minimum threshold means it takes less stimulus for the muscle to contract; therefore, a lower minimum threshold means it requires more stimulus for contraction. How will adding extra acetylcholine affect the muscle’s minimum threshold voltage? As more acetylcholine is added, depolarization occurs at a faster rate, which causes gated channels to open, creating a postsynaptic potential at a more rapid speed—indicating it takes less stimulus for the muscle to twitch. In our experiment, the independent variable is the injection of ACh and the dependent variable is the voltage of the minimum threshold. The hypothesis is if excess acetylcholine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle, the minimum threshold will decrease because there is excess ACh, which makes the muscle more susceptible to contraction. 

Materials and Method:
Three separate frog legs were set up as their own controll groups. Using a dissecting probe, the skin was pulled down and the gastrocnemus muscle was isolated, along with the sciatic nerve. The leg was strung at a 90 degree angle and the muscle was hooked up to electrodes in order for the voltage to spread throughout the gastrocnemus. First, the minimum threshold stimulus was determined by starting at a voltage of zero and then single pulses were induced into the leg. The stimulus voltage was increased by 0.1V until the minimum threshold was reached, which is when the leg twitched. The threshold was recorded and then 2 Ml of ACh was injected into the muscle. This procedure was carried out with all three legs to compare voltages with excess ACh and without excess ACh. The statistical test used to evaluate the minimum thresholds was a one-tailed paired t_test. 

Results:
Generally, the controll group has a lower minimum threshold voltage than the experimental group in each frog leg trial. As shown in Figure 1, the frog legs given acetylcholine, which are the experimental legs, showed a much bigger increase in threshold voltage. The results show a statistical difference between the voltages of the experimental and controll group (t-value=8.66, d.f.=2, p_value=0.01). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis states that if 2 Ml of ACh is injected into the gastrocnemus, the minimum threshold voltage will decrease due to the accessibility of contraction and increased depolarization—which was not supported by our findings. The null hypothesis was rejected because significent results were obtained. Our results present the idea that excess acetylcholine actually creates a higher minimum threshold voltage. In a study regarding ACh, it explains that a low amount of ACh creates muscle contraction; whereas a large or excessive amount of ACh inhibits the muscle from contracting [Allain: 2005]. It is known that too much of anything can be dangerous for organisms. Depolarization needs to attain a certain threshold to open its cation channels, which create a postynpatic potential. This potential makes the muscle twitch. Overstimulation of the synapse from the excess acetylcholine never allows the action potentials to reset. Temporal summation, which is when many action potentials from the same neuron fire to obtain the threshold point, never happens; therefore, more stimulus is needed in order to meet the minimum threshold voltage. In a past experiment, frog legs were soaked in ACh, and it was found that a twitch in the fibers decreased from ten to a few thousand times than other normal fibers [Miled: 1959]. This represents the higher minimum threshold needed for muscle contraction due to the overwhelming amount of ACh. Soaking the frog leg caused major differences to the reaction time of the muscle, so directly injecting the ACh straight into the muscle caused rapid change also. Less twitching could result from fatigue because the muscle is using much more energy to try and create action potentials. Other factors that contribute to the creation of action potentials are the muscarinic receptors which regulate ACh [Slutsky: 1999].  Overloading the receptors with too much acetylcholine causes the regulation to be disrupted, just as any organism would be negatively affected by disproportionate amounts of chemicals. For example, another neurotransmitter—norepinephrine—can cause rapid heartbeat and a high blood pressure if given too much [John:2015]. In order to use acetylcholine effectively and correctly, studies like these are crucial so precise amounts are used in every day medicines such as Miochol E, which contains ACh. [Cunha: 2017]. If doses of ACh are not given properly, side effects include cramps, muscle weakness, or in extreme cases, paralysis, because of the muscles overworking due to the overload of ACh [Adeyinka:2018]. Overall, these studies are crucial to the study of biology and medicine in humans and other organisms. The considerable results show that too much acetylcholine produces consequences that cause the injected muscle to degenerate.

Figure Legends: Figure 1. Comparison of minimum threshold voltages between three frog legs as controll groups and experimental groups. The controll group (blue) was not given any reactant, whereas the experimental group (orange) was given 2 Ml of ACh. The statistical difference is shown because the values of the minimum threshold proved to be significently varied between both groups in each frog leg.
