Title: The examination of the change in Manduca Sexta growth patterns due to the addition of IGR in their diet

Abstract:
This experiment was preformed to study the effects of Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) on the Manduca Sexta. We hypothesized that the larvae treated with IGR would be smaller than the control since they would be larvae for longer and their growth processes would be disturbed leading to potential growth complications. To test this we used 6 larvae, 3 for control and 3 for treatment. We fed them 10 g of food with 10 drops of liquid; 10 of water for the control, and 5 of water and 5 of IGR for the treatment.  We will measure the masses of the larvae to test the effects of IGR. After our experiment we measured our groups and took the largest mean mass difference of each. The means were 9.47 g for the control and, 11.97 for the treatment. The standard deviations of 0.99 for the control and 2.1 for the treatment shows that our results were not precise, but our control was twice as precise as the treatment.  Additionally, we found a difference in mass of roughly 2 g between groups, where the treatment was larger. This difference was found to be insignificant due to our P-value of .14, which is outside of the .05 confidence interval. Although our hypothesis is not supported by our P-value, I believe that the use of IGR has potential benefits in pest control and needs to be tested further.

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta (MS) is an organism that starts as a caterpillar and through many developmental stages, becomes a moth.  It has been seen that Manduca Sexta is a pest in its infantile stages, when it is a caterpillar, but that it out grows its pest-like behavior as a moth [Byron: 2017].  Many hormones go into the development and maturation of a Tobacco Hornworm, the colloquial name of Manduca Sexta [Johnson: 2018].  For this experiment we are focusing on one of the more important hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH), which keeps the Manduca Sexta as a larva for as long as it is abundant in the organism.  We are going to test the effects of JH on Manduca Sexta growth and maturation.  We found this particularly important because, if altering the amount of Juvenile Hormone in a MS would prompt it to develop into an adult moth faster, and therefore being a pest for a shorter amount of time – that would be particularly beneficial for many reasons, particularly farmers.  With that said, we posed the question, If Insect Growth Hormone (IGR) is used, the particular IGR we used altered the JH levels in MS to inhibit or regulate growth, in our MS’s food will it inhibit their growth and make them comparatively smaller than the control?  From this we derived our Hypothesis which stated that we expected our MS treated with IGR to weigh less than our control with normal food because the MS will be infantile for too long and its natural development will be disturbed.  If this is the case than abnormal defects could be expected, specifically with the commitment pulse being mistimed, and the caterpillars’ transition into pupa [Johnson: 2018].  Our independent variable is the amount of IGR added to the caterpillar’s food and the dependent variable is the specimen’s respective mass.

Materials and Methods:
In order to accurately test the effect of IGR in a Manduca Sexta’s diet on their growth we selected six total caterpillars and split them into groups of three.  They were broken into a control group and a treatment group.  To keep as many variables constant as possible we put two airholes in each cell, gave each caterpillar 10 grams of food, with 10 drops of liquid (10 of water for the control and 5 of water and 5 of IGR to the treatment), and both groups were kept in an incubator.  The caterpillars were fed every 2 to 3 days and massed every or every other day.  In order for us to come to a conclusion on our experiment we needed to deduce the overall weight change over the 2-week period, to determine IGR’s affects.  We did so by collecting the masses of each larvae as frequently as possible over our allotted two weeks for this experiment, and at the conclusion of this experiment we found the mean largest mass difference in the control and the treatment.  After doing so, we calculated the mean and the standard deviation for both, allowing us to synthesize and understand our data at a deeper level.  Then we summarized our data in a bar graph which is our experimental groups by the largest mean mass difference of each.  Lastly, we used a two-tailed T test to find our P-value and we compared our outcome to a P-value of .05 to see if our experimental data is in fact significant or not.   

Results:
At the conclusion of our lab, our data turned out as shown in Fig 1.  Our data was best configured as a bar graph (figure 1), with two bars – one for the control group, and one for the treatment.  The x-axis was denoted by our two groups of larvae, the control and the treatment.  On the y-axis the mean largest mass difference was measured.  After collecting data intermittently over the allotted 14-day period we averaged the data for each group and took the largest growth difference from each the control and the treatment.  After plotting this data, along with the standard deviation, we found that the treatment had a larger growth difference than the control by almost two grams on average.  The mean for each group was 9.477 g for the control and 11.973 for the treatment, and the standard deviations for the respective groups were 0.99931 for the control, and 2.100246 for the treatment.  With that said, our p-value is .137, which was found via our two-stemmed t-test.  

Discussion:
After seeing out our experiment with the Manduca Sexta for just over 2 weeks, it became glaringly evident that our hypothesis was not supported.  To restate, our hypothesis stated that we expected the IGR to cause the Treatment to be smaller than the control due to possibly developmental issues due to throwing off the natural life cycle of the Manduca Sexta.  After collecting our data, we calculated a p-value of .137 which prompts us to accept the null hypothesis which is that the IGR had no significant effect on the growth of the MS.  This comes as no surprise because Manduca Sexta larvae entering their 5th interstellar stage, before pupation, becoming quite large reaching around 10-12 grams [Kanost: 2016] [Johnson: 2018].  Using Kanost’s numbers it is clear that although it seemed that our treatment group were abnormally large, they simply fell near the top end of the expected range, while our controls fell on the bottom end of that range.  The disparity of mass can be attributed to the treatment larvae getting a longer period to grow before entering pupation.  Around day 9 of our experiment the two groups branched off, the treatment continued to grow while the control lost weight and prepared to enter pupation.  In addition to the mass of the treatment, they were also longer than the control, with barely any room left in their habitat by the end of our two-week period.  However, neither growth statistic, as stated about – was not significant.  Some errors that occurred throughout the experiment were our time management as a group, and a miscalculation of the size of our starting larvae.  Since we did not feed and weigh our larvae every day, we could have missed out on valuable data due to missing potential peaks in growth, and also because our larvae were not getting fresh food regularly which may have affected their growth patterns.  Additionally, at the beginning of our experiment, we chose larvae of all different masses, and potentially different stages of growth.  Although their mass values were not very far off from one another they ranged from 1.48 grams to .78 grams, which for such a small organism it can lead to statistical errors.  Our study shows that although chemically and genetically altering organisms can be beneficial, especially in the case of pests such as the Manduca Sexta, preliminary studies must be done to see how each compound effects each organism [Kanost: 2016].  For example, in our study we expected the opposite of what occurred, so to avoid any issues on a larger scale, an experiment like ours should be done first to properly alter organisms for their intended purposes.
