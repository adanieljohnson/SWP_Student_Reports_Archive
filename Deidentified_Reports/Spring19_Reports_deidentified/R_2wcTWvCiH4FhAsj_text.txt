Title: Effect of Acetylcholine Injection on Northern Leopard Frog Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
Abstract:
The Rania pipiens, or the Northern Leopard Frog, has a gastrocnemus muscle which receives impulses from the sciatic nerve. The impulses are delivered to the muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction, where Acetylcholine flows across the synaptic cleft. In this experiment, the group tested the effects of Acetylcholine on the contraction force of the gastric muscle in response to varying amplitudes of stimulus. The group first tested the frog legs with no acetylcholine injected, then each leg was injected with acetylcholine. The group then stimulated each muscle with increasing amplitudes and predicted that the experimental group with acetylcholine injected would produce stronger gastrocnemus contractions. However, the results showed that there was no significent difference in the performance of the controll vs. the experimental group, and the controll group actually performed slightly better than the experimental group. 


Introduction:
Introduction:
The Rania Pipiens, also known as the Northern Leopard Frog, is native to the United States. It has very developed leg muscles, which contribute to its ability to jump [Johnson: 2016]. The gastrocnemus muscle, or the calf muscle, is controllled by the sciatic nerve. The cell body of the sciatic nerve is located, along with other cell bodies of motor neurons, in the gray matter of the spinal cord, and its axon reaches into the muscle and splits before it enters the myofibers. At the neuromuscular junction, or the synapse, acetylcholine (ACh), which causes sodium pumps to open, flows across the synaptic cleft. If calcium is present, an action potential will be started. Myosin in the sarcomeres then attaches to actin, which causes muscle contraction. This whole process is initiated by acetylcholine, and the movement of the muscle can be represented by a myogram, which is a visual representation of muscle contraction. We predicted that when the muscle was injected with acetylcholine, it would respond more quickly and intensely to an electric signal applied at the sciatic nerve. 



Materials and Method:
Method:
The group obtained and degloved three Rania pipiens legs in order to reveal the gastrocnemus and the sciatic nerve. The group then suspended and injected each frog leg individually with .1 Ml of 10mg/Ml concentration acetylcholine into the gastric slowly and with varying insertion sites. The group sent an electrical signal through a probe to the sciatic nerve with amplitudes of 5ms width, a frequency of 1Hz, and from 0-.5 volts and measured the response using a myogram. This same process was repeated for each of the three legs. The group then performed a paired t_test on the data. 


Results:
Results:
The experimental group of Rania Pipiens gastrocnemus muscles performed, on average, worse than the controll group when stimulated. As can be seen in Figure 1, at most amplitudes, the controll group actually performed better than the experimental group. The standard deviation of the controll group was 0.232, whereas the standard deviation of the experimental group was 0.245. This means that the experimental group had slightly more variation than the controll group, which can be seen in Figure 2. The paired t_test yielded a p_value of 0.520.


Discussion:
Discussion:
A paired t_test was performed on the data set, and the result was not significent. This means the difference between the controll and experimental data sets is not significent. It cannot be confidently say that the injection of acetylcholine into the gastrocnemus muscle significently impacts contraction strength, which disproves our hypothesis. Acetylcholine may not have an effect on contraction when it is injected directly into the muscle itself, since it could possibly be free-floating in the tissue. Additionally, a sufficient amount of acetylcholine may not have been used, or perhaps there was not enough time between injection and stimulation of the nerve for the ACh to have an effect. Another possible issue with the experiment is the temperature of the room. During the experiment, the room was likely around 23º Celsius. In a study done by Michio Hirano and Lawrence C. Rome, it was determined that muscle function in Rania Pipiens is most effective between 25º and 30º Celsius [Hirano: 1984]. In order to make the experiment more effective, the group could have warmed the room slightly to ensure that the muscle would fire at max intensity in response to the stimulus. In order to change the results, the group could have changed the concentration of the ACh injected, increased the amount of time before stimulating the muscle, or increased the temperature in the room. The group also initially suspected that fatigue, due to lactic acid, could play a role in the force of contraction of the gastrocnemus, but according to a study done by Robert W. Putnam, “accumulation of lactic acid in muscle or blood, depletion of glycogen in muscle, or change in blood pH cannot account for fatigue [in Rania pipiens]” [Putnam: 1978]. This means that lactic acid likely did not play a role in the fatigue of muscle or the results of the experiment. In a follow-up experiment, the group would like to inject lactic acid into the gastrocnemus and test the reaction with the same stimulation used for the controll group.
