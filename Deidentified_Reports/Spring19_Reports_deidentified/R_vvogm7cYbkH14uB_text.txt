Title: Effect of Acidic and Alkaline pH Environments on Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea 

Abstract:
The study of plant and crop health is at the forefront of current scientific discussion as climate change is having a growing impact on the environment. The impact of environmental factors has been the focus of multiple experiments to determine how we, and the environment, can adapt to external factors that impact plant health. Knowledge of the variables that affect the ecosystem will help scientists to optimize plant and ecosystem health. Many environmental factors, such as pH, have the ability to affect photosynthetic rates in plants, making rate of photosynthesis a key determinant of plant health. Using spinach leaves, we can study the effect of pH on photosynthetic rates by utilizing the Hill reaction. We hypothesized that if spinach chloroplasts were placed in various pH environments outside their optimal range of pH 6.0 to 7.5, then the reduction of DCIP, an alternate electron carrier, in the assays will decrease and result in a smaller percent change in DCIP absorbance. The chloroplasts were isolated and spectroscopy was used to measure the change in absorbance over 10 minutes of three replicates at each pH environment. The largest percent change in absorbance was found in the pH 5 assay, the smallest percent change was found in the pH 10 assay, and the data in between var

Introduction:
Autotrophic organisms use photosynthesis to convert energy from light into chemical energy to fuel cellular processes. Photosynthesis occurs in the organelle known as the chloroplast, which consists of membranous sacs known as thylakoids. These thylakoids contain pigment in their membranes (chlorophyll), which are responsible for driving the excitement of electrons and fueling the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is divided into two subcategories known as the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reactions consist of exciting electrons in the pigment known as chlorophyll to reduce NADP+ to NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and also to establish a proton gradient within the thylakoid membrane. Within the thylakoid membrane during the light-dependent reactions, protein complexes known as photosystems transfer excited electrons to their electron acceptors (Which includes NADP+) so that the light independent reactions can proceed, and carbon dioxide can be reduced to glucose. Photosystem II, the first of the two photosystems, absorbs energy from photons while hydrolyzing water to replace lost electrons moving down the photosystem chain, yielding molecular oxygen and free protons. These byproducts are essential in measuring photosystem II activity as increased oxygen production is an indicator of increased photosystem II activity and consequently increased rates of photosynthesis.
     To measure the activity of photosystem II, we utilize an alternate electron acceptor known as 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP). This compound is a useful indicator of photosynthetic activity because as DCIP is reduced to DCIPH2, it turns from a rich indigo to a clear colorless substance. The reaction that reduces DCIP is known as the Hill reaction; it is the reaction involving electron acceptors besides NADP+. A DCIP decolorization assay is the experimental method we use to measure our rates of photosynthesis and how the rate is impacted by environmental factors. Our experiment focuses on the impact of various pH levels ranging from acidic to alkaline (pH 5- pH 10). A publication for the University of Vermont stated that the optimal pH environment for plants ranges from about 5.5-7.0 [Perry: 2003]. The publication further indicates that spinach leaves function optimally in pH 6.0-7.5 [Perry: 2003]. In an article published in the Biochemical Journal, membranes exposed to a pH environment above 8.5 inhibited the water-splitting steps of photosynthesis [Chapmen et al: 1989]. Another study published in Biologia Plantarum identified low pH values (between 5.5 and 7.5) as inhibitory of photosystem II activity [Mathur et al: 2011]. Consequently, we decided to observe the effects of a range of pH value environments on spinach chloroplasts by suspending the chloroplasts in pH values from 5 to 10 in order to determine optimal pH environments. 
     In order to determine the effect of pH on photosynthetic activity, we can use the Hill reaction with DCIP. Using the deep blue color that is characteristic of DCIP we can measure reduction rates by measuring the color change as DCIP is reduced to DCPIP, which is colorless. Spinach chloroplasts can be isolated via centrifuging spinach slurry with grinding buffer, forming a chloroplast pellet which can be resuspended in pH buffers that we assemble. Using spectroscopy, we can measure the absorbency of the chloroplast solutions We hypothesized that if spinach chloroplasts were exposed to various pH values above their optimal range, then the reduction of DCIP in the spinach chloroplasts will exhibit a lower percent decrease in absorbency. 


Materials and Method:
In order to isolate the chloroplasts from spinach leaves to measure their photosynthetic activity after exposure to various pH buffers, we first created a spinach slurry by adding grinding buffer to a mortar and pestle with spinach leaves and grinding to a paste. Filtering the slurry through a cheese cloth filtered the large bits of debris from the solution. We then transferred the filtrate to a centrifuge tube labeled “A” to be centrifuged at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius to isolate small debris from a supernatant with spinach chloroplasts suspended. We poured the supernatant into another centrifuge tube labeled “B,” decanting to leave the heavy debris in tube A. Then, at 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius to isolate the chloroplasts; centrifuging sample B in these conditions yields a product with chloroplasts at the bottom of the tube with supernatant at the top. Pouring out the supernatant from B leaves the chloroplast pellet in the B tube, with which we added grinding buffer and gently swirled to resuspend the pellet to be redistributed into each of six new centrifuge tubes equally. In each new centrifuge tube, add pH buffers of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. We labeled each tube according to their pH buffer and spun each tube again at 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. We then removed the tubes and drained the supernatant, adding grinding buffer to the pellets and resuspending the pellet once again. We then micropipetted equal amounts of the pellet from each centrifuge tube into three replicate test tubes for each pH such that a pellet from each pH buffer centrifuge tube was placed into three replicates, yielding 18 test tubes, 3 for each pH buffer. To each test tube, distilled water, 180 mM DCIP, and reaction buffer was added uniforMly throughout the 18 tubes. A blank test tube was then assembled solely with distilled water and reaction buffer at a volume to match the other test tubes; this ensured the spectroscopy measurements were properly zeroed before taking the readings of the 18 tubes. We set the spectrometer to 600 nm, and one at a time we poured a small portion of each tube into a cuvette for reading in the spectrometer. Once all the tubes were measured for their absorbances, each recording was taken as absorbency at time 0. After 10 minutes, beginning with the blank, absorbency readings were taken again for all tubes and recorded as absorbency at time 10. To measure the decrease in absorbency of each tube, the percent change was calculated and averaged for each pH value. We then used an ANOVA test with the percent change values to determine the significance of our data.

Results:
Our experiment yielded nonsignificent data with a p value equal to 0.154. The average percent change for each pH did not show a clear pattern as indicated in the bar graph below. 

Discussion:
The ANOVA test determined that our results were insignificent with a p value equal to 0.154. This indicates that the null hypothesis, which states that if spinach leaves are exposed to pH values outside of the known optimal range then photosynthesis rates will show a statistical change, cannot be rejected. In fact, at pH 7, neutral pH and in the middle of the optimal pH range for spinach (and most vegetables), the rate of the Hill reaction was the lowest of all but the most alkaline buffer tested in the experiment (at pH 10). Experiments run by S. Mathur and co-authors determined that when spinach thylakoids were exposed to high temperatures and low pH environments, high temperatures hindered the activity of photosystem II more than the acidic pH, and in fact, the acidic pH had little to no effect at all [Mathur et al: 2011]. Experiments done on strains of photosynthetic marine algae found that while some experienced hindered photosynthetic rates, others were unaffected by alkaline environments [Blinks: 1963]. Further research done on the photosystem II activity of spinach chloroplasts proved hindered activity among chloroplasts in pH 9.3 environments [Kuwabara: 1982]. Our percent change in absorbency at pH 10 is consistent with these findings as it was our lowest average percent change in absorbency, however since our data is not significent we cannot determine that the correlation is also causation. The study of alkaline pH environments on photosynthesis is a common topic of research, as studies done on the effect of alkaline pH on heat sensitivity of photosynthetic plants have shown that light can protect spinach plants from heat damage only in alkaline environments [Weis: 1982]. Findings such as these beg further research questions that will become important as climate change will bring about environmental changes in which plants will need to adapt, and understanding the effect of the environment on plants and crops will help us to maintain and optimize the health of the ecosystems on which we rely, and utilize our knowledge to boost plant growth and health. Future studies can investigate the potential beneficial or disadvantageous effects of acidic and alkaline environments on other parts of the photosynthetic cycle, including photosystem I, or the light independent reactions, all of which involve the equilibrium of a multitude of interrelated enzymes, proteins, and molecules that require their own specific optimal conditions.
