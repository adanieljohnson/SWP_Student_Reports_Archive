Title: The Effect of Added JH Analog, Methoprene, on the Weight Gain of Manduca sexta. 

Abstract:
Pest controll is a controversial yet important topic in the world of agriculture. The problem is how to get rid of pests in the most humane way possible. IGR is a form of pest controll that inhibits a pest’s development and, as a result, its reproduction. Here, we observe the effects of an IGR that contains an analog to the Juvenile hormone, Methoprene. The prediction was that adding this analog to the Manduca sextas’ diets would result in more significent weight gain than the controll group. Our data showed no significent difference in weight gain between the two groups, therefore supporting our null hypothesis. While there was no difference in weight gain, there were observable differences between the two groups that show that Methoprene may possibly be an effective IGR. 

Introduction:
This experiment tests the effect of added Juvenile Hormone (JH) on the development of Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta have a holometabolous life cycle that experiences five larval instars before reaching pupation. The development of these caterpillars is controllled mainly by hormones. One of these hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH), regulates the type of molt the caterpillar. This means it determines whether the caterpillar experiences another larval instar or goes through pupation. High levels of Juvenile Hormone (JH) are present during the larval instars until the Manduca sexta reach their critical weight. During this time, the Juvenile Hormone (JH) inhibits the hormone Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH), which in turn inhibits Ecdysterone [Davidowitz: 2004]. Once the larva has reached critical weight, the Juvenile Hormone (JH) levels drops and Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH) secretion occurs [Davidowitz: 2004]. Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH) then releases Ecdysteroid Hormone and the Manduca sexta experiences its commitment pulse and then pupation. Knowledge of these hormone relationships could potentially be helpful in regard to Insect Growth Regulators (IGR). IGR’s can “accelerate or inhibit a physiological regulatory process essential to the normal development of the insect or its progeny” [Siddall: 1976]. PreCore is a specific type of IGR that contains Methoprene and acts as a Juvenile Hormone (JH) analog, meaning it mimics the actions of the hormone and shares similar chemical properties with it [Siddall: 1976]. Using an IGR with a Juvenile Hormone (JH) analog would essentially increase the levels of JH in the Manduca sexta. Increased levels of JH would continue to block the release of PTTH well past the critical weight of the caterpillar and would prevent the release of Ecdysterone, thereby delaying the commitment pulse and pupation of the Manduca sexta. The question addressed during this experiment is how the caterpillars’ physical appearance will stray from the norm if PreCore, the methoprene-containing IGR, was added to the caterpillars’ diets. If 8 drops of PreCore Methoprene, Juvenile Hormone analog, are added to the caterpillar food, then the caterpillars will increase in weight (g). The null hypothesis would be if 8 drops of PreCore Methoprene, Juvenile Hormone analog, are added to the caterpillar food, then there will be no difference in weight between the experimental and controll groups.

Materials and Method:
The Manduca sexta were placed in two plastic bins with 4 compartments each. One bin was marked as controll and the other was marked as experimental. Each compartment was labeled with the number of the caterpillar and holes were poked into each side of each compartment using a hole poker. Eight relatively small caterpillars were selected from the container. Each caterpillar was placed, one at a time, on the scale and the weight (g) was recorded. Forty grams of the stock caterpillar food was measured out using a weighboat, creating food for the experimental group. This step was repeated a second time, creating food for the controll group. For the experimental group’s food, 8 drops of PreCore Methoprene was added to the food and mixed together. For the controll group’s food, 8 drops of deionized water was added instead of the PreCore. Ten grams of the mixed food were measured out on the scale, squished into a collected ball, and placed into their respective container. For a period of eleven days, the compartments were each cleaned out and the caterpillars were fed using the previously mentioned method. After the eleven days, a two-sample T-test was conducted to see how the average change in weight between the two groups differed.

Results:
Over the eleven days recorded, both groups of caterpillars gained weight and ate all of their food. By day eleven, some of the weight began to decrease and the controll caterpillars began to display signs of reaching their commitment pulses. By day thirteen, the experimental caterpillars began to die. The change in weight from day one to day eleven in each of the caterpillars was calculated using the raw data collected each day. This was done for caterpillar 1-4 in the experimental group and caterpillars 1-4 in the controll group. Then, the quantities for each controll caterpillar and each experimental caterpillar were averaged, resulting in an average change in weight for the two groups (controll and experimental). The average for the change in weight in the experimental group was 11.6+/-0.578 (fig. 1) and our average change in weight for the controll group was 12.26+/-.595 (fig 1). For this experiment, a two-sample t_test was conducted. Since the data only charted growth in one direction, a one-tailed p_value was necessary and was calculated it to be .081381. The degrees of freedom were also calculated to be 6 and the t-value was 1.59.

Discussion:
In this experiment, adding 8 drops of PreCore, and IGR containing Methoprene, to the Manduca sextas’ diets did not create a significent difference in weight between the experimental and controll groups. Also, since the one-tailed p_value was .081381, a number above .05 the hypothesis was not supported, and the data was not significent. Because of this, the null hypothesis that the Juvenile Hormone (JH) analog, Methoprene, does not cause a difference in weight was not rejected. Our data was also not significent, meaning that the standard deviation of the two sets of data overlapped. Because of this, any changes between the experimental and controll groups are due to chance. For example, the average change in weight for the controll group was slightly higher than that of the experimental group as seen in figure 1. Since the data is not significent, this difference cannot be associated with the lack of added Juvenile Hormone (JH). Though there was not a significent difference in weight between the controll and experimental groups of Manduca sexta, there were other physical differences observed between them that could be attributed to the addition of Methoprene to the caterpillars’ diets. By day 11, some of the controll caterpillars had reached their commitment pulse while the caterpillars in the experimental group never reached it. This is most likely because the added Methoprene was acting in a similar way to the Juvenile Hormone (JH) and was inhibiting Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH). This was ensuring that Ecdysterone would not be released and that the Manduca sexta would not reach its commitment pulse. Instead, about the time that all of the controll group had reached commitment pulse, the caterpillars in the experimental group began to lose weight and started to die. Two of the experimental caterpillars died, both around day 13 and 14. This could have happened because the release of Ecdysterone was inhibited. Insects need both Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone to survive. Since the caterpillars were cut off from the Ecdysterone, they were not able to survive. Also, after day eleven both groups of caterpillars began to decrease in weight. This occurred because of something called the critical weight of the caterpillar [Davidowitz: 2004]. At this point, it tends to “stop feeding, purge their gut contents, enter a wandering stage, and form a pupa about 6 days later” [Davidowitz: 2004]. This critical weight tends to be about 12 grams which corresponds with the data because the caterpillars started losing weight then they reached that point. Though the experiment ended before the controll group reached pupation, there were observable changes in the Manduca sexta that showed it had entered the wandering stage such as them not eating all of their food and them excreting a lot. The results of this experiment show the potential effectiveness of using a JH analog in an IGR. In the world of pest controll, the specific weight gain of the caterpillar is not as important as reducing its opportunity to develop and reproduce. If this was the focus, the experiment was definitely successful in showing how adding a JH analog can prevent the caterpillar from developing naturally, ultimately resulting in the caterpillar’s death. In order to determine exactly how much of the JH analog, methoprene, will delay the caterpillars’ development long enough to ultimately result in their death, further experiments must be conducted.
