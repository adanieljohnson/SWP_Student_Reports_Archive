Title: Understanding resource allocation in plants and its relation to increased growth in field peas (Pisum sativum) in a phosphorus rich environment.

Abstract:
Plants in ecological systems must adapt to a variety of factors in order to survive. Plants must also focus on overcoming the selective force of resource limitation. Resource allocation explains the phenomenon of how plants decide where to best allocate their energy in order to boost their chances of survival. The measurement of a plants root to shoot ratio can help reveal how a plant has allocated its resources based on the environment it is grown in. Phosphorus is a component of the complex nucleic acid structure of plants and helps regulate cell division and development of new strong tissues. We hypothesized that field peas grown in phosphorus rich soil would have smaller root to shoot ratios than plants in nutrient controlled environments, as more energy would be put into growing the stem instead of the roots. The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis and showed that the experimental plants grew smaller roots and longer stems than compared to the control plants. The results of this experiment can be beneficial to the agricultural community as longer stems can produce more food. 

Introduction:
In ecological communities, plants interact with each other and the environment and adapt in order to give themselves the best chances of survival. Abiotic factors are stimuli from non-living sources that living organisms must also adapt to in order to boost odds of survival. Abiotic factors include sunlight, water, and nutrients, which for plants are all essential resources needed to survive. This leads to a phenomenon called resource limitation, which explains that in any environment, there is only a limited amount of useable resources for an organism. Resource limitation is a potent selection force which species must adapt quickly to in order to survive. In response, plants and animals adapt by choosing how to best expend their energy—a concept known as resource allocation. Resource allocation is defined as the pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources. Plants have much plasticity in resource allocation which allows them to quickly adapt to several environmental conditions [Johnson:2018]. Furthermore, previous research done has shown that plants that grow in resource poor conditions have less plasticity in their growth rates than plants from more nutrient-rich environments: the former cannot grow very fast, even under ideal conditions [Chapin: 1980]. This directly applies to show that plants are actively utilizing their resources to boost their survival odds.  Plants leaves, and stems are both involved in photosynthesis and proper resource allocation would increase their growth rates to find the most sunlight. Plant’s roots, the primary absorptive organ, would be affect by resource allocation by growing longer or more intricate if water or nutrients were scarce. A plant’s root to shoot ratio can be measured to determine where a plant has decided to allocate its resources while growing. Phosphorus has been shown to be a vital soil nutrient plants use in growth and development. Phosphorus is a component of the complex nucleic acid structure of plants, which regulates protein synthesis and for this reason is important in cell division and development of new tissue [Black:1957]. This was furthered by research where phosphorus rich fertilizer produced plants that exhibited significantly greater plant height and root collar diameter than untreated controls [Razaq: 2017]. This experiment uses Pisum sativum, or Field pea plants. These plants are of agricultural importance as they are used for feed or as seed for forage production and the tender shoots of field pea may be cut and used as salad greens. Furthermore, previous research has shown that field peas plants need phosphorus in their soil for optimal growth, ensuring that the field peas are adequate plants to observe uptake of available phosphorus [Singh: 2009]. Lastly, Field peas are also readily available for experimentation and grow quickly, which makes them ideal for experiments. We hypothesize that field peas plants grown in a phosphorus rich environment will have smaller root to shoot ratios than those grown in control environments because plants would not need an intricate or deep root system and can thus focus more energy to growing the stem instead.

Materials and Methods:
Preparing experimental and control plants:

Six planters were obtained and each was filled with vermiculite. Three of the planters were labeled as control and the other three were labeled experimental. All the vermiculite filled containers were then soaked in water to ensure vermiculite was wet. Following this, the three experimental planters were mixed with about a handful of phosphorus rich bone meal. The vermiculite with the bone meal was then mixed, by hand, thoroughly to ensure the phosphate was evenly distributed. Twelve seed holes (3 rows of 4 holes) of about an inch in depth were then made in each planter and each filled with three to four field peas seeds, and they were covered with vermiculite. All six planters were then placed in a greenhouse. The planters were watered daily for a two-week period. Temperature, light, water availability, and vermiculite used were all kept constant amongst the control and experimental planters.

Root-shoot measurement:

Three field peas plants (replicates) were then carefully pulled out of the each of the three control vermiculite mediums making sure to not break the roots in the process. The plants were then washed in a container of water to remove any excess vermiculite. Each replicate was then cut at the root-stem junction, ensuring to cut each at the same place. Amongst the three replicates, the maximum shoot length and maximum root lengths were recorded to the nearest mm. The averages for each group was then recorded. The same procedure was then followed for the experimental plants. Three replicates from each planter were harvested, and maximum root and shoot lengths were recorded. Finally, root to shoot ratio was recorded and the results were tested for statistical significance using a one-tailed t-test with a confidence level of 95%.


Results:
Overall, the average root to shoot ratio of plants grown in the phosphate rich environment (0.5121 +/- 0.08), was smaller than that of the plants grown in the control environment (0.8665+/-0.3). Furthermore, the root to shoot ratio of plants grown in the phosphate rich environment had a smaller standard deviation than those in the control environment, in which the stems and roots varied more in individual lengths, contributing to a larger deviation.  Results were statistically significant (p-value= 0.04, t=2.22, df=4).

Discussion:
The results of our data supported our hypothesis, and the field peas grown in the phosphorus rich vermiculite had smaller average root to shoot ratios than plants grown in the control vermiculite. The difference in average root to shoot ratio of control plants as compared to the experimental plants was significantly larger. This disparity in root to shoot ratio is attributed to the difference in availability of nutrients to the plants. The plants in the control vermiculite had no readily accessible nutrients and thus devoted more energy to growing longer roots in search for nutrients, and less energy to growing the stem. In contrast, the plants in in the bone meal vermiculite had phosphorus readily accessible and did not need a long root system to find nutrients, thus allocating more energy to growing their stems. The results of the experiment also support the data found by previous research in that plants grow in the nutrient rich environment had more plasticity and grew faster [Chapin :1980]. Plus, previous research showing that that plants grown in phosphorus also exhibited longer stems was supported as well [Razaq: 2017]. This information is relevant to agricultural fields since field peas stems are used are used for feed or as seed for forage production and the tender shoots of field pea may be cut and used as salad greens. Furthermore, studies have shown that phosphorus has been identified as the most frequently occurring essential element deficiency limiting crop yields [Jones: 2008] . Since the results were shown to produce longer root lengths, further studies could focus on if using phosphorus would allow for larger edible root plants increase food yields.
