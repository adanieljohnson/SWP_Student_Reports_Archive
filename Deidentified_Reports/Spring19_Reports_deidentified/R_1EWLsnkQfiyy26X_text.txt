Title: Effects of Different Hormones on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a type of invasive caterpillar, known for eating and affecting tobacco plants during their larval development stage. In this experiment, effects of different hormones, stimulants and depressants, on the developmental stage of a Manduca sexta caterpillar were tested. Specifically, in my group we tested the effects of IGRegulator, gentrol and azaguard on the larval Manduca Sexta. This was done by breaking the lab into 2 separate parts. The first part tested the effects of gentrol and azaguard by feeding the hormones to two Manduca sexta each. The control group was given food with only water in it. The caterpillars were then weighed every day for a week. The results varied between the two experimental groups. The gentrol caterpillars were bigger than the azaguard caterpillars, but the average for the experimental groups were  less than the control group. For the second week, the same procedure was used, but the experimental group tested the effects of the IGRegulator hormone. Two of the Manduca sexta died for this part of the experiment for unknown reasons. The two surviving experimental caterpillars showed a greater increase in mass than the control. Thus, both week one’s hypothesis and week two’s hypothesis were supported.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepdoptera. It goes through a holometabolous life cycle. This means that it undergoes a metamorphosis from larvae to adult over four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. To go from larvae to adult, the larvae must first pupate, which is prompted by a change in hormones within the insect, or a slight increase in the levels of Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone [Johnson: 2019]. This increase in hormone levels is called the Commitment Pulse. In our experiment, we tested the effects of specific hormones, such as IGRegulator, azaguard, and gentrol, on the growth of Manduca sexta during the larval stage. All three of the listed hormones are considered IGRs, or insect growth regulators, which means that they impact the development of many insects by either inhibiting or enhancing physiological regulatory processes. For example, during the larvae stage of a manduca worm, a constant level of juvenile hormone prevents transformation, or pupation [Johnson: 2019]. In an experiment performed by Kiguchi and Riddiford, juvenile hormone was used to prevent the molting of the Manduca Sexta. The results of the experiment supported that claim that altering the level of Juvenile Hormone or ecdysterone in the Manduca sexta changes the timing of the molting and the type of molting [Kiguchi: 1978]. For week one, I hypothesized that a concentration of azaguard and gentrol in the food of the Manduca sexta would result in a decreased weight and length in the caterpillars. For week two, I hypothesized that a concentration of IGRegulator in the food of the Manduca sexta caterpillars will result in an increased weight and length in the caterpillars. In this experiment, the independent variables were the hormones, while the dependent variables were the mass and length of the caterpillars. 

Materials and Methods:
To perform both parts of the lab, I needed to gather the listed materials: two 4-cell containers, 2 lids, sharpies, “hole” tool, Manduca sexta food, spoon, square container, electronic balance, transfer pipets, reagent, the hormones (IGRegulator, azaguard, gentrol), and tap water. After the materials were grabbed, I prepared the containers. Next, I measured out 10 g of Manduca sexta food for all 8 caterpillars. 5 drops of either the tap water, azaguard or gentrol were added to the correct food and mixed completely. Four of the Manduca sexta were fed food with tap water. Two were fed food with azaguard, while the other two were fed food with gentrol. The group found 8 Manduca sexta of similar size and determined their mass and weight and placed them into their cells. Throughout the following week, the group checked on them every day and replaced the food source when necessary.  For week two of the experiment the same procedure was followed, except this time there was 4 control foods and 4 experimental food with the IGRegulator in it. Additionally, the same 8 caterpillars from the week before were used, so the group did not need to select new caterpillars and determine their size. At the end of the experiment, the standard deviation and the average mass and length for the different groups were determined. Additionally, the group used a two-sample t-test on the resulting data. This helped determine the standard error and the standard deviation of the data. The data was recorded on the first and last day of the experiment and the averages of the change were taken from that data.

Results:
For the experiment performed during the first week of the lab, the mean change in the mass of the control caterpillars was 6.31 grams (Figure 1). For the caterpillars fed azaguard, it was 0.42 grams, and for the gentrol, it was 4.65 grams (Figure 1). Both the gentrol and the azaguard were fed only to 2 different caterpillars, while the control was done on 4 different caterpillars. For the week two data, the average change in mass for the control caterpillars was 3.48 g, while the average change in the caterpillars fed IGRegulator was 6.55 g (Figure 2).  The group used the two-sample t-test to analyze and compare the data from week two. The standard deviation for the control caterpillars’ mass was 0.96 and the standard error was 0.98 (Figure 2). For the IGRegulator fed caterpillars, the standard deviation was higher, 1.74, as was the standard error, 1.32 (Figure 2). The average change in length for the Manduca sexta was 0.93 for the control and 1.25 for the IGRegulator. When the two-sample t-test was done for the experiment, the results were (t= 2.937642, df= 4, p= 0.021244). The p value confirmed that there was a significant difference between the average change for the weight of the control caterpillars and the experimental caterpillars. 

Discussion:
My group’s hypothesis, that when the Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to azaguard and gentrol the development and growth of the insects would be inhibited was supported. Additionally, the hypothesis that when the Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to IGRegulator the development and growth of the insects would be promoted was supported. The IGRegulator mimics the effects of the Juvenile Hormone, causing the Manduca sexta to increase in size. Additionally, when other labs were performed on Manduca sexta using other growth inhibitors, it showed similar results. This could indicate that an imbalance with any known hormones that act as inhibitors results in a difference in the size, weight and overall look of the larvae [Johnson: 1989]. A similar study was conducted by Kenji Kiguchi and Lynn Riddiford. They also concluded that an increase in JH, or IGRegulator because it mimics the same effects, results in a change in mass but prevents larval pupation [Kiguchi: 1978].For the second half of the lab, my group hypothesized that a concentration of IGRegulator in the food of the Manduca sexta caterpillars would result in an increased weight and length in the caterpillars. A similar study was conducted by Kenji Kiguchi and Lynn Riddiford. They also concluded that an increase in JH, or IGRegulator, results in a change in mass but prevents larval pupation [Kiguchi: 1978]. Unfortunately for this portion of the lab, Manduca sexta caterpillar 3 and 7 both died within the week, leaving us only with the collected data from 2 caterpillars. For this portion of the experiment, the weight of the larvae fed the IGRegulator average increased faster than the control caterpillars. This change in mass could indicate that the juvenile hormone increased the grow of the caterpillars at a faster rate without allowing for pupation. Unlike the controls, the experimental caterpillars were not pupating. Thus, we can also conclude that a continuous high rate of JH in the system forces the Manduca sexta to remain in the pupation stage longer. It would be beneficial to run this same experiment again but use the same hormone for two weeks straight. If this was done, it would eliminate some unnecessary sources of error within this experiment that came as a result of reusing the Manduca sexta. The information from this lab would help tobacco farmers better understand the Tobacco Hornworm and prevent them from destroying their fields.
