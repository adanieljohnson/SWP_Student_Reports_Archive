Title: Decrease in Size of Male Betta Splenders’ Active Zone Results in Increase in Male Betta Splenders’ Agonistic Behavior. 

Abstract:
Animals need to regulate their behaviors in response to all environmental conditions since they need to gain food, ran away from predators, and avoid intraspecies competition to survive. In order to understand the behavior of animals and come up with better plans to protect biodiversity, it is important to understand how the effect of the size of niche influence animals’ intraspecies agonistic behaviors. Our experimental subject was male Betta Splenders. Their agonistic behavior we were looking at was the “red mane.” We put pairs of fish in big tanks and small tanks and the duration of the red mane of two fish in five minutes was recorded. The hypothesis was that if the tank size decreases, then the duration of intraspecies agonistic behavior will increase. The resulted significant difference between the duration of the red mane of fish in the big tank and small tank gave us confident evidence to support this hypothesis. This result suggests that male Betta Splenders would be more aggressive toward other males in smaller space. This adaptation warns people to pay attention to prevent the size shrinking of Betta Splenders in order to keep them from the ​intraspecies competition.

Introduction:
Agonistic behaviors are adaptive acts which arise out of conflicts between two members of the same species in competitive situations, and include aggressive, submissive, and defensive behaviors [Barratt: 2001]. This kind of behavior is important to animals to deal with intraspecies competitions, especially when there is limited food, mate, or space. They use agonistic behaviors to display their strength and dominancy to have access to more resource. The subject of today’s experiment is Betta Splenders, also known as Siamese fighting fish. Their agonistic behavior that we were studying was the “red mane.” The red mane is that the fish protrude the branchiostegal membranes located underneath the opercula, during the situation of danger or competition with other Betta Splenders [Johnson: 2018]. Previous research showed that males appear to compete for space through the use of aggressive behavior and to coordinate their fighting activities by means of visual signals [Bronstein: 1981]. This experiment evaluates the influence of tank size, or activity space, on the ​duration of the agonistic behavior display by Betta Splenders, the “red mane.” The reason why male Bettas were used in this experiment is that its agonistic behavior is visually significant- healthy, domestic Bettas are very aggressive towards members of their own species, and easy for the researchers to observe and record the duration of their “red mane” [Norman: 1963]. Also, the size of the fish is small enough for two fish to fit in a small tank. They also can be kept alive easily and is adaptive in environmental conditions (tanks), so it is easy for researchers to replicate the experiment. The duration of the agonistic behaviors could be measured in seconds for each fish. The hypothesis is that if the tank size decreases, then duration of the agonistic behavior will increase.

Materials and Methods:
There was a large tank and a small tank. The size of the large tank was 25cmx7cmx50cm. The size of the small tank was15cmx11cmx19cm.
Three male Betta Splender were used in this experiment. 
We assigned the three fish to pair two times with each other, resulting in six pairs. 
The control group used a ​large tank and represented a large activity range. The experimental group used the small tank and represented small activity space between two male Bettas. Other than the tank size, all the conditions were kept the same: temperature, water condition, other dangers.
Three pairs were randomly assigned to the small tank, the other three were assigned to the big tank.
One fish was put at each end of the tan and the duration of the red mane of both fish in five minutes was recorded.
The length of each observation is five minutes, and more than five minutes were given for the fish to rest before the start of the next round of observation.
The total duration of the red mane of each fish in each observation is recorded in seconds, resulting in six duration sample in each group. 
The statistical test we used was the two-sample paired t-test.


Results:
The average duration of red mane displayed by a Betta in the big tank is 26.16± 47.04 seconds, and the average duration of red mane displayed by a Betta in the ​small tank is 93.23± 90.78 seconds (Figure 1). The average difference was 67.07 seconds. There was significant difference between the duration of red mane displayed by Betta in the big tank and small tank (t= 3.46, df=6, p=0.01). We also noticed habituation in the observation. The Bettas red mane were mainly displayed in the fist three minutes. And as the time of exposure increased, the red mane display was less frequent. Also, the Bettas could display the red mane even before turning around and facing another fish directly.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if the tank size decreases, the duration of the agonistic behavior will increase, was supported by the experiment results. We had confident evidence to conclude that male Bettas are more aggressive when there is a smaller space between Bettas. With smaller activity space between Bettas, they become more aggressive since the competition for space and the possibility for competition for mate is higher [Bronstein: 1981]. This finding fits the general rules of animal behavior since higher fitness is correlated to a high amount of resource they can access. If the fish could use its agonistic display to show its dominance and strength of the space and the other fish surrender to its power, it could get the whole access of the space, leading to higher fitness [Bronstein: 1981]. 
The habituation we noticed in the observation shows Bettas’ strategy to save energy. The “red mane” would cost energy that could be used in swimming, finding food, mating, therefore, the Bettas only display when it is necessary [Clayton: 1968]. When the fish went through some time with the other fish and they didn’t bite each other to death, the level of danger then decreases, and there is no need for red mane to be displayed anymore.
The observations that Bettas could sense the male competition even before visually see the other fish may be influenced by hormones.  Results experiments suggest that male Siamese fighting fish secrete substances which affect mirror-induced aggression and respiration rates [Colyer: 1976]. 
Future researches may want to use new fish for each set of observation to avoid the effect of habituation Bettas may develop during the previous observation. Also, a large amount of repetition is needed for the conclusion to be accepted with confidence.
Finer equipment may be needed for more accurately time the duration of the Bettas since sometimes human eye may miss some occurrence of the red mane. And the definition of showing the red mane needs to be refined since the Bettas sometimes only partially display the red mane, not to the full extent.
Understanding the influence of activity space between Bettas on the duration of agonistic behavior could shed a light on how human beings could improve the environmental conditions to raise of keeping​ the Bettas and other kinds of fish. Enough space may be needed to avoid severe damage to the fish caused by intraspecies competition.
