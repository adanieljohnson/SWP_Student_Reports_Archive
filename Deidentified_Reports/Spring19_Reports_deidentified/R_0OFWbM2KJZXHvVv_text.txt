Title: Effects of fish coloration on the display of aggressive behaviors in male Betta splendins

Abstract:

Male Betta splendins are known to display several aggressive intraspecific behaviors when excited by the presence of another male. One of the most aggressive facing behaviors is red mane. With ethology, it is important to be able to understand how animal behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection and how it can be compared to different species with different ecological backgrounds. Betta splendins are known to be able to discriminate color. We analyzed the effect the coloration of the of the opposing male had on the display of aggressive behaviors of the observed fish. We hypothesized that male Betta fish will display more aggressive behaviors towards other males of similar coloration compared to males of a different color. Our data did not show a significent difference in length of time red mane was displayed for same color pairings compared to different color pairings. This insignificance, along with our observation of the discrepancy between the average time of red mane displayed for the two same color pairings. This suggests that there could be a genetic difference in the display of aggressive behavior between red and blue male Betta splendins, which could be of interest to analyze in a future study. 

Introduction:
Ethology, or the study of animal behavior, seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection [Johnson:2018]. It focuses on the genetic, physiological, and learned actions of an animal and its perception of the world “as it sees it” not how humans see and interpret it. Through ethology, comparisons between different species with different ecological backgrounds and histories can be made. Betta splendins are common aquarium fish that originate from Southeast Asia [Johnson:2018]. At rest, wild males tend to display a dull greyish brown or green color, but in the presence of another male, they flare their gills and fins and display an intense dark blue or red [Johsnon:2018]. We are using betta fish because of their colorful displays in the presence of their own species, which are known as intraspecific behaviors. The most aggressive form of a facing movement for intraspecific behaviors is known as “red mane”, where a male Betta will protrude the branchiostegal membranes located underneath the opercula [Johnson:2018]. In a previous experiment, we observed that the male Betta fish did not show aggressive behaviors in the presence of a male blue gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus), a fish of a different species and coloration, because it was not going to be a competitor to get a mate from the same species. It is also known that Betta fish can discriminate color [Thompson: 1965]. Knowing this, we wanted to test if the color of the opposing male Betta fish influenced the degree of aggressive intraspecific behaviors the observed male Betta fish displayed. We hypothesize that male Betta fish will display more aggressive behaviors towards other males of similar coloration compared to males of a different color. As a result, we expect the average time that red mane is displayed to be longer for the same color pairings, compared to the different color pairings. 

Materials and Method:
A total of four fish were used, two red and two blue. The fish were identified as Red 1, Red 2, Blue 1, and Blue 2. All fish were housed in individual compartments of a tank and were prevented from viewing other fish outside of the planned interactions for this experiment. Two types of interactions were conducted: same color and different color. All interactions occurred between glass, persisted for five minutes, and were followed by a five minute rest period. The two same color interactions were Red 1 vs. Red 2 and Blue 1 vs. Blue 2. The two different color interactions were Red 2 vs. Blue 1 and Red 1 vs. Blue 2. . For each interaction, the total time that each fish displayed red mane was recorded. For statistical analyses, a one tailed, paired t_test was used to determine differences in the average total time red mane was displayed for same color interactions compared to different color interactions. 

Results:
The mean time spent with red mane displayed for the same color interactions was 85.865 seconds and the standard deviation for this pairing type was 91.901 (Fig. 1). The mean time spent with red mane displayed for the different color interactions was 96.705 seconds and the standard deviation for this pairing type was 36.821 (Fig. 1). The mean time red mane was displayed for same color interactions was not statistically significently different than that of the mean time for different color interactions (t-value = 0.176, d.f. = 3, p_value = 0.872). 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis because the opposite trend was observed and there was no statistically significent difference in the average total time spent with red mane displayed for same color male Betta pairing versus different color male Betta pairings. This could have been because red male Betta may be more aggressive in general than blue male Betta fish, thus skewing our results for the same color pairings [Yatrousis:2018]. The different color pairings may have less standard deviation and error because the red male Betta fish became dominant and incited the blue male Betta fish’s aggressive red man behaviors, more so than blue would incite blue. One limitation was that only four individuals were used and thus the sample size may not be representative of the whole population. For future studies, it would be of interest to implement more fish and to test specifically for one color of male Betta aggressive behavior compared to a different color fish, instead of including pairings of more than one colored fish for the same colored trials.
