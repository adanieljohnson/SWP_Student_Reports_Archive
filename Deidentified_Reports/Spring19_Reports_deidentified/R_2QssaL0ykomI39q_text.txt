Title: Juvenile Hormone Application in Metamorphosis Development of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
The manipulation of juvenile hormones in the early stages of Manduca sexta life-cycle play a significant role in pupation and adult development. Just as vertebrates rely on hormones and chemical signals to initiate necessary physiological activities, insects require internal feedback mechanisms to sustain life. If the hormonal levels in an organism are radically altered, then the organism will face developmental challenges and potentially incur abnormalities. The ideal state for regular development is not achieved when additional juvenile hormones are added to Manduca sexa diet. Instead of pupating and moving forward in their life cycle, treatment subjects from this experiment maintained an adolescent state. Control subjects showed steady increase in both height and weight while experimental subjects halted growth nearing day seven. The results from this experiment support the practicality of utilizing IGR’s to manage hazardous adult insect problems. 

Introduction:
This experiment analyzes the role of endocrine hormones on insect development. Similar to vertebrate species, insects require hormones for growth, anatomical development, behavioral characteristics, and other crucial metabolic functions. Chemical signaling in insect development involves communication between sensory inputs and feedback mechanisms that regulate physiological patterns. The insect of interest in this experiment is the Manduca sexta. Common names for Manduca sexta include sphinx moth, hawk moth, tobacco hornworm, and the Carolina sphinx [Johnson: 2018]. These insects have four stages of physiological development that include egg, larvae, pupa, and adult moth. In outdoor conditions, the Manduca sexta life-cycle is primarily determined by diet availability and daily temperatures [Johnson: 2018]. As the insect fulfills metabolic needs through food consumption and behavioral activities, homeostatic circuits help to regulate developmental stages. The three primary hormones that regulate much of insect development are prothoracicotropic, ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH) [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, Manduca sexta treatment subjects are exposed to a highly concentrated JH diet. The treatment insects are measured and evaluated for their changes in weight and height. Similar to insect growth regulators, if the balance of hormones responsible for development are manipulated, then they will differ in their growth stages from a control group. Higher amounts of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will inhibit regular development and increase the probability of abnormalities. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta insects were selected and randomly assigned into groups of four. The two groups either represent treatment subjects or control. After gathering insects and dividing them into isolated plastic cubicles, they were each weighed in grams and measured in millimeters. These measurements were gathered before the subjects were exposed to their relative experimental conditions. Over a fourteen-day period, the insect groups were given one of two diets. The treatment group received ten grams of GLM with five drops of juvenile hormone. The control group received ten grams of GLM with five drops of water. Both groups were kept in the same incubator at twenty-eight degrees Celsius in the dark. The insects were measured every day and recorded in journal entries. For statistical analysis, a two-sample t-test was used to determine and compare the means from the two groups.

Results:
Over the fourteen-day period, the mean weight of the experimental group was 3.59 g and the control group was 6.71 g. The mean height of the experimental group was 47.68 mm and the control group was 59.61 mm. The statistical variability between the means of the experimental and control groups for weight is statistically significantly (t-value =2.796362 , df = 26, P = 0.009591). The mean of the length control group was also statistically significantly compared to that of the length experimental group (t-value = 2.920659, df= 26, P = 0.007129). Figure one displays the average weight changes for both groups. While the average control weight steadily rises, the average experimental group reaches a climax around day seven and slowly decreases. A similar trend is present in figure two, representing the average length changes for the groups. The control group shows a steady increase while the experimental group starts to fall around day seven. The data was synthesized and distributed using a two-sample t-test.  

Discussion:
The results from this experiment certainly depict a correlation between juvenile hormone manipulation and Manduca sexta growth. Juvenile hormones are “long chains of organic molecules” produced by foregut glands within the corpus allata [Johnson: 2018]. In the regular life-cycle of Manduca sexta, JH and 20E are co-responsible for maintaining the holometabolous life cycle. In order for Manduca sexta to reach pivotal stages of development, hormones such as JH must be at their necessary level [Kenji 1978]. The results from this experiment support my hypothesis that manipulation of JH exposure will inhibit regular development. In both figures, the treatment group maintained synonymous growth with the control group up until the seventh day. Around this time period, regular Manduca sexa development calls for a decrease in JH and a pulse of 20E. This allows for insect pupation and adult development. In this experiment, the continued exposure to JH misaligned the hormonal levels required for the treatment group to reach pupation. The treatment group maintained juvenile figure, while the control group reached critical points for development. In IGR application techniques, these juvenile hormones could help prevent certain insects from reaching a certain adult state that is deemed harmful or detrimental to other wildlife.
