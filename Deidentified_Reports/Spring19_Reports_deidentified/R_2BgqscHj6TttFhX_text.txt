Title: The effects of resource allocation in Iglossia woodi plants based on nitrogen levels in soil

Abstract:
The topic for this lab was resource allocation, which largely revolves around studying the changes in organisms based on differences in the environment or the climate in which those organisms exist and grow. In this specific case we looked at how the plant species Iglossia woodi differs based on the amount of nutrients, specifically nitrogen, in the soil it is growing in. We assumed and hypothesized that the plants growing in soil with higher level of nitrogen would have a larger root-to-shoot ratio than the plants growing in normal soil. Our data showed a significant difference in the means the root-to-shoot ratios for both the length and weight between the control group and the experimental group. This difference, along with the data showing higher means for the experimental group, support our hypothesis that plants growing in higher levels of nitrogen will have a larger root-to-shoot ratio because of resource allocation in the plants themselves.

Introduction:
This experiment studies the effects of resource allocation on plants. Resource allocation in plants can cause many changes based on the availability of nutrients in certain environments. For example, a tree growing in the sun would grow differently from a tree growing in the shade because of the availability of the resource of sunlight. In one specific experiment, it was found that low nutrient availability will typically stunt the growth of plants and cause a lower total mass among the plants with fewer available nutrients [Shemesh et al, 2016]. Much of the effects of resource allocation are due to a sort of competition between the plants. Among plants within the same environment, these plants will actually more or less compete amongst each other for various nutrients in the soil [Shemesh et al, 2016]. In this lab, we specifically looked at the species Iglossia woodi. This species of plants is more commonly known as “buckweed”. We hypothesized that if the plant grows in nitrogen-rich soil, then we will have a larger root-to-shoot ratio for both length and weight because nitrogen is a fundamental nutrient for plant growth, so the growth of these plants will be affected by it like they would by any other necessary nutrient found in soil.

Materials and Methods:
We used buckweed (Iglossia woodi) seeds for this experiment. We planted the seeds in four different pots, and these pots were separated into two different groups of two. One group was the control group, and the other was the experimental group, or the “nitrogen group” as we sometimes referred to it. Over the course of two weeks, we watered the plants in the control group with only water, and we gave the plants in the experimental group a solution of MiracleGro instead. MiracleGro is very rich in nitrogen, so we used it to give the plants in the experimental group a more nitrogen-rich diet. We made sure that each day both groups received the same amount, meaning that the control group got just as much water as the experimental group got of its nitrogen-rich solution. After the two weeks were over, we gathered ten plants each from the control group and the experimental group. We then cut each plant where the root meets the shoot and measured and weighed the root and shoot of each plant separately. We used this data to calculate the root-to-shoot ratio for each of the plants.

Results:
The mean root-to-shoot ratio for the weight of the plants in the control group was 0.040, while the mean root-to-shoot ratio for the weight of the plants in the experimental group was 0.490 (Fig.1). The mean root-to-shoot ratio for the length of the plants in the control group was 0.486, while the mean root-to-shoot ratio for the length of the plants in the experimental group was 1.486 (Fig.1). The standard deviation of the root-to-shoot ratio for the weight of the plants in the control group was 0.048, while the standard deviation of the root-to-shoot ratio for the weight of the plants in the experimental group was 0.306 (Fig.1). The standard deviation of the root-to-shoot ratio for the length of the plants in the control group was 0.160, while the standard deviation of the root-to-shoot ratio for the length of the plants in the experimental group was 0.492 (Fig.1). We used an unpaired t-test to analyze the results of this experiment. The mean root-to-shoot ratio for the weight of the control group was statistically significantly different from the mean root-to-shoot ratio for the weight of the experimental group (t-stat = 4.587, df = 18, p-value = 0.0002). Similarly, the mean root-to-shoot ratio for the length of the control group was statistically significantly different from the mean root-to-shoot ratio for the length of the experimental group (t-stat = 6.106, df = 18, p-value = 0.000009). We noticed that the roots of the plants in the experimental group had grown out much more than the shoots.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, in which we assumed that the plants growing in nitrogen-rich soil would have a larger root-to-shoot ratio for both length and weight than the plants growing in the normal soil with only water being given to them, was supported by our results. We saw a significant difference between the means for the root-to-shoot ratios for both length and weight between the control group and the experimental group. The experimental group had much higher means for both the weight root-to-shoot ratio and the length root-to-shoot ratio than the control group did, as we assumed would happen in our hypothesis. The roots of the plants in the experimental group grew much larger and longer to take advantage of the extra nutrients in the soil. These results match up with the results of a past experiment, in which the independent variable was carbon levels in the soil instead of nitrogen levels in the soil. This past experiment also found that the plants growing in the soil with fewer nutrients had less growth overall [Shemesh et al, 2016]. Knowing this about plants and resource allocation gives us an understanding of the factors that can enhance or inhibit plant growth in various environments.
