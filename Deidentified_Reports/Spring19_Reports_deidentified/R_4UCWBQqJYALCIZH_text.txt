Title: Effect of Fish Tank Size on Presence of "Red Mane" in Betta Splendens 

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to study the variation in the amount of agnostic behavior in betta fish (betta splendnes). Specifically, we looked at the time until a "red mane" was produced, and how long mane was shown throughout the 5-minute trials for each fish. The "red mane" is the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane, located underneath the gill covers (opercula). We used two different tank sizes in order to answer the question: Will the tank size increase or decrease the amount of time the first red mane showing actors? 


Introduction:
Fighting is something that almost all animal species take part in. While it might not be actual physical contact, there is always a fight over food, water, space, resources in general. One would think that the smaller the area for a certain species to flourish, the more aggressive the competition will become. This theory can also be put into place for physical altercations. Some species might need to fight one another in order to decrease the amount of competition. In the case of the betta fish, they will engage in a series of agonistic (aggressive) responses in which threats (displays) and attacks can be easily detected, and various components of the agonistic sequence are modifiable through learning [Cain: 1980]. One of these displays is qualified by the spreading of the fish's gill covers and the flaring of the branchiostegal membrane. This gives the fishes head a larger look, called showing its "red mane."  With regards to competition, how will the reduced space for these fish increase or decrease the time it takes for the first show of the red mane to occur. These fish are already fairly aggressive species, who will begin displaying agnostic behavior even if there is a clear divider between the two fish. Fish are herbivores, but being so does not mean they cannot be territorial. Fish in coral reef areas have evolved to protect their patch of sea. Making sure that they do not lose out on their resources in order to survive [Kontra: 2016] The small tanks that most pet stores and small aquariums use cause the fish to stress, worrying about losing out on resources to potential competitors. This can be especially true in the instance of a natural aggressive fish such as the betta. Our hypothesis was that the smaller the tank size, the faster the fish will display this behavior. Since there is less room for the fish to swim around, it is likely that the two will see each other quicker. With the ever-present pollution problem that is facing our problem today, habitat shrinkage is inevitable. How will this affect those species that are close to human contact? Will the species affected turn on each other in order to reduce competition, or will the species begin to die off due to lack of resources. The question of habitat size is one that needs to be answered. We cannot continue to shrink the habitat of animals and expect them to flourish. This experiment is a microcosm of what might happen in the future if we do not take care of the problems we currently have on our hands.  


Materials and Methods:
To start this experiment, we were assigned three betta fish that were "fresh," meaning they had not been studied for four days prior to our experiment. We began with the small tank (measuring 4 inches by 6 inches for one compartment) split up into three compartments, each separated by both a clear and solid barrier. When it was time to study the first fish, we lifted the solid barrier so that the two fish could see each other. For five minutes preceding lifting up the barrier, we measured the amount of time it took until the first display of the red mane. After it had been shown once, the time was recorded, but we also continued the time, stopping every time the fish put down its red mane. This allowed us to obtain the amount of total time the red mane was shown during the three-minute time period. After the time was up, we let the fish rest for approximately 5 minutes. Once the time was up we moved on to the next fish, studying the same behavior for the same amount of time. It is important to note that only one fish was studied at a time. The other fish was used to evoke agonistic behavior. Letting both rests after each trial ensured that neither would become fatigued throughout the duration of the experiment. Once all three fish had been observed and the times had been recorded, we moved on to the larger tank. This tank was split into two compartments (both measuring 10 inches by 10.5 inches). We had the same three fish from the original study, only this time we transferred them from the small tank to the big tank to start the experiment. There was no solid divider long enough to split the two. We used two individual plastic, clear dividers to split the tank. Once both fish entered the tank, one was studied for the same amount of time. The same behavior was recorded. The only change was the size of the tank. We repeated the same process for all three fish, again making sure that there was a period of rest between all trials.  We then ran a two-tailed​-test​ in order to determine significance. 


Results:
After conducting the experiment, it was found that the average time to first red mane was 22.67 seconds with a  standard deviation of 31.79 in the small tank and 30.67 seconds with a standard deviation of 34.49  in the large tank. As for the total duration of the red mane, the small tank yielded an average of 199 seconds while the large tank has an average of 152 seconds. The results of the statistical test yielded a P value of .2079, which is not less than the significant value of .05. Therefore we cannot accept the hypothesis of our experiment. As for the total duration, it seemed to lead to an increase in the length of time in which the mane stayed present in the small tank. 


Discussion:
After completing the experiment and reviewing the statistical test, we believe that our work has supported our hypothesis. There was a decrease in the amount of time it took for the red mane to become present in the small tank as well as the mane was present for a longer period of time. Due to the constraints of the tank, the fish are forced to look at each other, and if there were to be no clear divider separating them, fighting would have likely ensued. There are some notable happenings, though. One of the fish seemed to be very docile, showing no red mane over any trials in any tank. The data point of 0 has decreased our averages. Also, there still needs to be many more runs of this experiment. The six trials are nowhere​ near enough to sufficiently give support or discredit the hypothesis we have come up with. This gives credit to the idea that the small tank leads to an increase in agonistic behavior due to the natural aggressive behavior of fish, especially the betta [Kontra: 2016].
