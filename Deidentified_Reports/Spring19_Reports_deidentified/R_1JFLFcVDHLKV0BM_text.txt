Title: Effect of Methoprene, a JH mimic, on the weight of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The effect of Methoprene, a JH mimic, on the weight of Manduca Sexta was examined. Four Manduca Sexta were given food with 8 drops of Methoprene added daily for 14 days and four Manduca Sexta were given food with 8 drops of water added daily for 14 days. It was hypothesized that the caterpillars who received food that contained methoprene would weigh more than the caterpillars receiving food that contained only water.  Data points for days 11-14 were the only used as the weights of both groups began to decrease after 11 days. Additionally, the caterpillars receiving diets with methoprene added showed signs of death after 11 days.  The average change in mass of the Manduca Sexta consuming a diet with Methoprene added was 11.6 +/- 0.578g while the average change in mass of the Manduca Sexta consuming a diet with water added was 12.26 +/- 0.595g. The p-value was 0.081381. The hypothesis was rejected. There was no significant difference in the average change in weight between the experimental and control groups. 

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone present in the life cycle of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. In juvenile Manduca Sexta, JH effects the type of molt that occurs. If JH levels in Manduca Sexta are high, then the molt the Manduca Sexta undergoes will result in the caterpillar progressing to the next larval instar. In other words, the caterpillar’s appearance will remain the same, but it will grow bigger. If levels of JH present in Manduca Sexta are low at the same time that levels of Ecdysteroids (a hormone that impacts molt timing) are low, then the commencement pulse will be triggered which results in moderate levels of JH secretion paired with moderate levels of Ecdysteroids secretion. The commencement pulse triggers the Manduca Sexta to begin to pupate. Pupation refers to the encasement of the larvae by a cocoon allowing for the reorganization of internal and external structures. 
The natural development of organisms such as Manduca Sexta can be controlled by manipulating the levels of hormones that are present in their bodies. This regulation is achieved through Insect growth regulators (IGRs) which are hormone mimics. An important question to consider is “How does JH impact the size of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars?” This question can be answered through the use of an IGR, specifically PreCore methoprene, a JH mimic. 
Theoretically, if PreCore methoprene was added to the food of Manduca Sexta, the commencement pulse either would not occur or it would occur later because it can only occur if levels of JH are low. This would allow the Manduca Sexta to remain larvae for a longer amount of time. It is expected that the Manduca Sexta larvae exposed to the PreCore methoprene will be larger and weigh more than normal because they will have more time to consume nutrients before pupation. Producing larvae that are bigger prior to pupation could possibly decrease the survivability rates of the Manduca Sexta as the adult moths that emerge from the pupae will be bigger than normal.  
In order to observe the relationship between size of the larvae and JH levels, 8 drops of PreCore methoprene, juvenile hormone (JH) mimic, will be added to the caterpillar food for one group of caterpillars and 8 drops of water will be added to the caterpillar food for another group. It is hypothesized that the caterpillars who receive food that contains PreCore methoprene will weigh more than the caterpillars receiving food that contains only water. 


Materials and Methods:
1.	Get two plastic bins, with 4 compartments each. This will be where you place your caterpillars. Mark one bin as control, and the other as experimental. Label each compartment with the number of your caterpillar. Using a hole poker, poke two holes in the external sides of each compartment. Make sure the holes are open, to ensure the caterpillars can breathe.
2.	Select 8 caterpillars from the container. Make sure the caterpillars are relatively small, larger sized caterpillars are normally closer to the commitment pulse.
3.	Place each caterpillar, one at a time, on the scale, and record its weight, in grams. After measuring each caterpillar, place them in an organized order on the table (make sure you remember which caterpillar is which). 
4.	Measure out 40 grams of the stock caterpillar food, in a weigh boat. Then, in a separate container, break apart the 40 grams of food. Next, add 8 drops of precore methoprene to the food. Mix everything together. Repeat this step for the controlled group, and add 8 drops of deionized water, instead of precore.
5.	Measure out 10 grams of the mixed food on the scale. Before placing the food in each compartment, squish the food together into one, collected ball. This makes it easier for the caterpillars to eat. After you place the food into each compartment, place each caterpillar into the compartment.
6.	Repeat steps 3-5 every day for a period of 7 days. Before adding the food, clean each bin out, and dump any excess waste into a trash bin.


Results:
The average change in mass of the Manduca Sexta consuming a diet with Methoprene added was 11.6 +/- 0.578g. The average change in mass of the Manduca Sexta consuming a diet with water added was 12.26 +/- 0.595g. The one tailed p-value was P Value: 0.081381. After day 11 both the weights of the control and experimental group began to decrease. The commitment pulse was observed starting day 12 in all of the control group caterpillars, but was never observed in the experimental group. At day 13 caterpillars three and four of the experimental group started to turn black and show signs of death.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was rejected. There was no significant difference between the average change in weight of Manduca Sexta caterpillars receiving 10g of food per day with Methoprene added and the average change in weight of Manduca Sexta receiving 10g of food per day with water added. The addition of methoprene to the diet of the Manduca Sexta should have resulted in them having a larger mass than did the Manduca Sexta with water added to their diet because methoprene is a JH mimic that keeps the commitment pulse from occurring, thus allowing the caterpillars more time to consume food. The experiment was carried out for 14 days; however, after day 11, both the weights of the caterpillars receiving the diet with methoprene added and the diet with water added began to decrease in weight, so only the data for days one through 11 were used. The commitment pulse was observed starting day 12 in all of the control group caterpillars, but was never observed in the experimental group. This could have contributed to the results not being significant as the recorded data did not show long periods of time where the control group had reached the commitment pulse and the experimental group had not. Since both groups of caterpillars begun to decrease in weight after day 11, it could be inferred that an external factor was causing the caterpillars to die. An additional factor that could have caused the caterpillars to begin to die was soap residue left over in the enclosures of the caterpillars after cleaning them could have impacted their pH and interrupted normal functions. 
	Theoretically the increased weight of the Manduca Sexta should have occurred because they were able to continue eating and molting into the next larval stage as the control group pupated and reorganized its internal and external organs. Future experiments to test the impact of methoprene, a JH mimic, on the weight of Manduca Sexta could be improved by increasing the size of the enclosure and cleaning it without soap to ensure that external factors did not affect the results. If repeated, the experiment should be carried out for a length of time that allows for the caterpillars to both remain healthy and the commitment pulse to be observed in the control group through up until the point of full pupal eclosion. The experiment would be more valid if more trials were conducted. This research is applicable because if methoprene is shown to be effective at increasing the weight of Manduca Sexta prior to pupation, then it could be used as a method of controlling/ decreasing the population of moths as it has been shown that survivability decreases if they are the Manduca Sexta larvae are larger prior to pupation.
