Title: Effects of fertilizer concentration of allocation pattern: root:shoot ratio trends in Pisum sativum

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of one genotype in an organism to express more than one possible phenotype when exposed to different environmental conditions. In this experiment, the ability of plants to allocate resources for growth to certain parts of the organism based on soil nutrient content was tested in order to determine if Pisum sativum exhibited phenotypic plasticity in response to soil nutrient density. It was expected that plants grown in nutritionally rich soil would have relatively low root:shoot ratios when compared to plants grown in soil with much less nutritional content. Three treatment groups were tested with 100%, 50%, and 25% Miracle Gro solution saturated in vermiculite. Multiple plants were tested from each group and root:shoot ratios were determined by weight and length data. Average root:shoot ratios in both parameters were run in ANOVA, which concluded that no group was significantly different. However, data trends in length root:shoot ratios suggest that plants grown in soil with high nutrient content had lower root:shoot ratios because resources were replete and plants did not have to compete intensely for nutrients. Knowledge of these allocation patterns in several plant species would aid in producing more efficient yields.

Introduction:
Some organisms have the ability to change the expression of a gene as it is modified by the environment. This ability is called phenotypic plasticity [Bradshaw: 1965]. Depending on the environmental situation, a trait can vary on a spectrum or only have two fixed, extreme outcomes [Bradshaw: 1965]. In plants, phenotypic plasticity is an especially helpful trait, as it allows individual plants to control resource allocation according to the availability of resources in their environment. The plant does not take nutrients out of existing tissues, but alters its growth pattern to fit its environment. Essentially, plants use phenotypic plasticity to minimize costs and maximize benefits in a way which requires a reasonable amount of maintenance and would produce the highest possible lifetime yield [Madsen: 1991]. A study on the biomass partition of Abutilon theophrasti, Chenopodium album, and Polygonum pensylvanicum by the Ecological Society of America (ESA) concluded that the root:shoot ratio decreased and leaf area increased when grown with low light and soil with high nutrient contents [McConnaughay: 1999]. This supports that these plants have the ability to allocate biomass and structural resources in order to maximize effective resource absorption. In this study, the ability of Pisum sativum, commonly known as field peas, to exhibit phenotypic plasticity was measured by the variance of root:shoot ratios across plants grown in nutritionally rich and nutritionally deplete soil. It was predicted that P. sativum would have a similar resource allocation pattern as the plants in the ESA research [McConnaughay: 1999]. Therefore, P. sativum plants grown in soil with high nutrient content would have a low root:shoot ratio compared to plants grown in soil with low nutrient content. Because these field peas are grown primarily for human consumption, it is important for the soil nutrient content in farmers’ fields to promote the most shoot growth, as more resources would be allocated to the part of the plant that produces pea pods. 


Materials and Methods:
Field peas were soaked in water for 20 minutes while nine small square trays were prepared for planting. Each tray was filled with vermiculite then divided into three groups of three for treatment. Treatments of 25%, 50%, and 100% Miracle Gro in water were administered by pouring in the soil and allowing to soak in. Twelve holes were poked into the vermiculite of each tray and each hole was filled with two to three peas. More vermiculite was poured in to cover the seeds. The plants were watered until the soil was damp, then moved into the greenhouse and watered each day for 14 days. On the 14th day, a tray was emptied and thee plants were gently pulled from the soil. Their roots were separated, rinsed, and patted dry. Weights for the three whole plants in each group were recorded before the plants were cut where the root turned to shoot (based on the point which the stem turned from white to green). Roots and shoots were weighed separately, then the longest root and shoot were measured in centimeters. These root and shoot measurements were used to calculate root:shoot ratios for each group of three plants. The root:shoot weight and length ratios of each of the three treatment groups were compared using an ANOVA. 


Results:
The mean root:shoot weight ratios were found ( for each treatment group and were compared in an ANOVA tests (F=1.76, Df=2, P=0.25). Weight ratios were similar across all treatments (Figure 1). ANOVA was also used to compare root:shoot length ratios (F=3.83, Df=2, P=0.08), which had a positive trend as soil nutrition content decreases (Figure 2). 


Discussion:
Statistical testing did not support our hypothesis, but general trends in data indicate that higher Miracle Gro fertilizer content reduces root:shoot length ratios in P. sativum. ANOVA testing revealed that there was no significant difference between the three concentrations tested. However, the length data had a distinguishable trend and the weight ratio did not appear to vary based on nutrient concentration (Figure 1, Figure 2). The length data was considered more reliable for this experiment because weight data for fresh plants is heavily influenced by water retention. Some roots may absorb more water than others, and some water may be released even in the short time between removal from soil and weighing. Both factors may cause significant weight variance which did not produce precise data. Dry weight would have been a more precise alternative [Madsen: 1991]. Thus, it was determined that length data was more indicative of the relative amount of growth in the roots and shoots. Although the length ratios were not determined to be significantly different from one another, the P-value was very close to 0.05 and a trend in the data indicates that P. sativum allocate comparatively fewer resources to their roots when the concentration of Miracle Gro is increased (Figure 2). The opposite is true when the concentration of Miracle Gro is reduced. 
There was plenty of light and water available to the plants, so they grew to compete for the resource that was limited: soil nutrients. This follows the root:shoot ratio trend seen in other plants that experience phenotypic plasticity in varying soils with low to high nutrient content [McConnaughay: 1999]. Vermiculite does not have any inherent nutrients, so the only nutrients available were those that we administered. Miracle Gro’s primary active chemical is ammonium phosphate ((NH₄)₃PO₄), which is used to aid growth. Nitrogen promotes growth throughout the organism and phosphorus promotes root development and increases blooms. In order for these plants to effectively access these limited resources, they had to adapt very quickly and compete with the other plants while minimizing costs . Allocation of resources to the roots allowed the roots to increase surface area and absorb more nutrients. Plants treated with 100% Miracle Gro solution had an average root:shoot ratio of less than one because the need to compete was much less due to the amount of nutrients present in the soil (Figure 2). Contrastingly, plants treated with 25% Miracle Gro solution had to compete more intensely for little nutrients, resulting in more resources allocated to the roots and a higher root:shoot ratio of around 1.5 (Figure 2). This data suggests that Pisum sativum has evolved to exhibit phenotypic plasticity for resource allocation to roots and shoot that varies beyond two extreme phenotypes. Phenotypic plasticity of this kind has evolved across many plant species, with some variance in mechanisms and modifications [Bradshaw, 1965]. Using this information, farmers growing field peas and other crops that exhibit a similar pattern of resource allocation based upon soil nutrients could alter the amount of fertilizer in their fields to produce ideal yields.
