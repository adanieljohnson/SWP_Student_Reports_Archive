Title: The Studied Effects of Lanthanum Chloride on Rania pipiens Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
This experiment sought out to observe the effects a calcium channel blocker (lanthanum chloride) on muscle contraction of the Rania pipiens frog.  The hypothesis of the experiment was that when injected into the severed leg it would cause the muscle contractions to become weaker or block them entirely.  Since the legs contain striated muscles that rely on calcium move, a calcium blocker would theoretically prevent the muscle fibers in the leg form contracting.  After reviewing the data of the experiment, it was found that lanthanum chloride had virtually no effect on the muscle contractions stimulated in the legs.  This is likely due to the muscle being stimulated directly rather than being stimulated by a nerve.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system acts as both the interpreter and manipulator of our environment.  Therefore, it is critical that we understand the inner machinations of it.  In this study we attempted better understand the effects blockers have on neuromuscular controll by injecting the chemical lanthanum chloride in different sites throughout the leg of a Rania pipiens frog.  Striated muscles are made up of myosin filaments that slide along tropomyosin when a nerve impulse is sent to neuromuscular junction.  When motor controll neuron receives a nerve impulse it releases ACh into the neuromuscular junction.  The Ach then binds to the sodium channels, allowing sodium to flow into the muscle fiber to produce ATP.  The ATP is used to release calcium allowing the muscle to contract.   Attenuating the damage-induced rise in myocellular calcium concentration may reduce proteolytic activation and attenuate other indices of damage; calcium channel blockers have been shown to be effective in this regard [Crameri; 2002]. It was hypothesized that when injected with lanthanum chloride due the chemicals blocking the binding site for calcium, therefore preventing the muscle from contracting.

Materials and Method:
Three severed legs of Rania pipiens frogs were used for this study.  The skin of the legs were peeled off to expose the muscles of the legs.  Then the inner thigh muscle was detached at one point and the sciatic nerve was exposed.  To prevent the degradation of the muscles, the leg was regularly treated with frog ringers.  The muscles were directly stimulated for 5ms with a frequency at 1Hz with the results recorded and the method repeated with the added injection of .1Ml 4mM of lanthanum chloride.  This was done to determine the threshold stimuli and muscle twitch amplitudes.  For statistical analysis a one tail paired t test was utilized to analyze the different muscle twitch amplitudes at threshold stimuli of the controll and test experiments.

Results:
After the application of the lanthanum chloride the threshold stimuli had an average increase of 0.133V while the muscle twitch amplitudes increased by an average of 0.016V.  The one tailed paired t test showed the results of (t_stats=2.54, d.f.=2, P=0.126) with a standard deviation of 0.041 and 0.048 as shown in Fig. 1.  

Discussion:
The results failed to support the hypothesis that the application of lanthanum chloride would result in weaker or entirely stop the muscle contractions in muscles of the three frog legs.  Contrary to the hypothesis the frog legs’ muscle contractions experienced negligible effects when injected with lanthanum chloride.  If the test were to be repeated with sources of error minimized, the concentration of the lanthanum chloride should be increased to rule out the possibility that the previous levels were insufficient.  Secondly the muscle would be stimulated via nerve rather than muscle to better mimic the natural mechanics of neuromuscular function, with in theory a greater release of calcium.  Additionally, the low p_value may simply due to our low sample size.  It is possible that the results of this test were an abnormality, therefore increasing the sample size in the next test would help to provide a larger range of results giving us a more accurate average p_value.  Since the actomyosin fibers responsible for contraction require an increase in the cytosolic levels of calcium, which signaling pathways induce by promoting influx from extracellular sources or release from intracellular stores[Kuo: 2015].  In theory blocking calcium from binding to receptors should prevent or lessen the contraction in muscles.  Therefore, the test should be reconducted to ensure that the results found are not mere statistical abnormalities.
