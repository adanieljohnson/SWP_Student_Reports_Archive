Title: Photosynthesis Activity Change of Kale with the Presence of Extra CO2 in Environment

Abstract:
Carbon dioxide is an indispensable factor to produce energy in the photosynthesis process of the plant. Thus, the purpose of this experiment is to test whether the increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the environment can increase the activity of photosynthesis. Kale leaves are used to study as the subject for this experiment, and its chloroplast solution is purified and extracted to be tested. Although there is an obvious increasing trend in the activity of photosystem as more carbon dioxide is added, the result is insignificent statistically. There are two main reasons for the insignificance: not enough time for the photosynthesis to fully occur, and not enough concentration of carbon dioxide is added. 

Introduction:
Energy is a crucial factor for all living organism to survive. Plants, like animals, also have their unique way of producing energy, and such a mechanism is called photosynthesis. However, photosynthesis is a totally different mechanism compared to the energy generation and conversion from food intake of animals. Photosynthesis happens during the presence of light, which is the photon, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The products of the reaction are glucose (C6H12O6), water, and oxygen, and glucose is the energy which will then be consumed by other series of mechanisms which are not the topic of this experiment. The reaction can be summarized as 6CO2 + 12H2O + photon----&gt;  C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2. Since carbon dioxide is an indispensable factor in photosystem, thus, it is hypothesized that the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the environment with enough photon and water present can increase the activity of photosynthesis which increases the energy and oxygen production. 
	There are two major stages during the photosynthesis process, and they are collectively called the light-dependent reactions. (Johnson, 2019) The light-dependent reactions happen in the stroma, which is located outside the thylakoid membrane. On the thylakoid membrane, there are four major integral membrane protein complexes which can be used as a catalyst for the light reaction, and they are Photosystem II, Photosystem I, cytochrome b6f, and ATP synthase. (Alberts, 2015) For photosystem II and photosystem I, both of them bind to chlorophylls in order to detect various intensities and wavelength of light. (Gao, 2018)  In photosystem II, the electrons that are excited by light are passed to cytochrome b6f complex via carrier Q and electron transport chain. Energy is then harnessed by cytochrome b6f. As energy is transported from a higher to a lower energy level, the proton gradient is created. An accumulation of an excess of protons in the thylakoid lumen creates ATP because the only way protons can transverse the thylakoid lumen is through ATP synthase complex. ATP synthase complex can synthesize ATP from ADP and phosphate using protons (H+). (Johnson, 2019) The other system is photosystem I, which is interconnected with photosystem II. Photosystem I pass the electrons that are excited by photons to NADP+ and produce NADPH. The system takes some protons out from the chloroplast stroma and adding a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. And as mentioned, proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane can generate ATP. PSI can then reset itself by replacing the lost electrons from PSII by using carrier pC, and PSII reset itself by replacing lost electrons from water. (Alberts, 2015) 
	All the organism that requires photosynthesis to produce energy requires the presence of carbon dioxide. However, carbon dioxide is especially crucial to the electron transport regulation in photosystem II. (Shevela, 2012) Therefore, this lab is focusing solely on the analysis of PS-II activity by using Hill reaction. In order to measure the activity of photosystem II, either reduction of plastoquinone or production of oxygen is required to be measured, but it is technically challenging to measure both of them. However, photosystem II also pass its electrons to alternative electron acceptors which can then be measured easily. Such reaction is called Hill reaction, which is a relatively easier way to measure the activity of photosystem II of the chloroplast. (Johnson, 2019) The alternative electron acceptor for the Hill reaction in this experiment is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), because its property that can change color, it can be measure by spectrometer and determine the absorbance. The the less color, the more photosystem II activity, which represents the more energy is produced. Kale leaves will be used as subject to produce chloroplast solution and be tested on. Three different amounts of carbonated water will be added to the chloroplasts solution to see the effect if how carbon dioxide affect the photosynthesis. 


Materials and Method:
1.	Grind 4 kale leaves, add 10Ml of grinding buffer and grind it until it is a thick paste. Then, add additional 10Ml of the buffer.
2.	Use centrifuge to collect a clear kale solution and distribute the solution equally in 12 test-tubes. Each test-tube has 100 μl of the chloroplast. Prepare another test-tube as blank for the spectrometer. The 12 test-tubes are labeled from 1-12 and group them into 4 categories them as controll, experiment 1, experimental 2, experiment 3, and add the following materials:
 
3.	Once all test-tubes are prepared, blank the spectrometer by using the blank test-tube. Then measure the absorbance 4 times for all the samples at different time elapse: 0 minute (which is at the beginning of the reaction), 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes after the beginning. 
4.	Record the absorbance and find the percentage change. 


Results:
From table 1, the steady decrease in the absorbance (color) can be seen with an increase of time elapsed and with the amount of carbon dioxide added. A decrease in the absorbance represents an increase in the photosystem II activity. In the solution that has no chloroplasts, absorbance as changed from 0.133% to 0.262%. In the solution that has 0.005Ml carbonated water added, the absorbance has changed from 0.195% to 0.384%. In the solution that has 0.006Ml carbonated water added, the absorbance has changed from 0.215% to 0.4%. In the solution that has 0.007Ml water added, the absorbance has changed from 0.235% to 0.529%. 

From figure 1 and figure 2, a clear trend of increase in the percentage change of absorbance can be seen. The more carbonated water added, the more increase in the photosystem activity. Although, P-value is 0.413, which is not significent. 

Discussion:
Photosynthesis is critical in the survival of plant, without carbon dioxide, photosynthesis is unable to occur. Therefore, this experiment is to test whether the increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the environment can increase the activity of photosynthesis. This experiment specifically focused on the activity behavior affected by carbon dioxide, because it provides the electrons for the whole photosynthesis to occur. It transports electrons to generate ATP and eventually, after a chain of reactions, photosystem I create NADPH which is then used as energy. (Loll, 2005) I Although it is hard to measure the activity of Photosystem II, Hill reaction is utilized by its unique way of Photosystem II passes electrons to alternate electron receptor, thus measure its activity. DCIP is used to measure the activity by measuring the change of its color loss as absorbance of photosynthesis using the spectrometer. (Johnson, 2019) Kale leaves is subjected to this study. Its leaves are ground into solution and purified by centrifugal, then its photosystem activity is being studied from its chloroplast solution. 
	From the result, it is clear that the extra carbon dioxide in the environment has increased the photosynthesis. And as the increase of the extra amount of carbonated water, the activity increases as well. However, statistically, the result is insignificent since the p_value is 0.413. The insignificent can be explained by two reasons. One is that the time elapsed is not long enough. Only 10 minutes in between carbon dioxide is not able to see a significent effect from carbon dioxide. The second reason is that the concentration of CO2 is not high enough. Only 0.0005% to 0.0007% of carbon dioxide is added to the environment. In a future experiment, improve the two disadvantages listed above is able to improve the resulting quality. Carbon dioxide is clearly has a significent increase in photosynthesis until it reaches its plateau. (Ainsworth, 2007) Therefore, if the experiment has done under a more suitable condition, the result can be significent.
