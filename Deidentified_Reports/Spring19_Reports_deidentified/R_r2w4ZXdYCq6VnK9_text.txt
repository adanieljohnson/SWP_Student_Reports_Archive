Title:  Treating Manduca sexta caterpillars with a small dosage of 1 Gregulator 1: 1250 shows no significent difference in growth

Abstract:
Insects have hormones that regulate several physiological characteristics, including growth. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) have inhibitory effects on physiological development or over-activate development. In this experiment, we tested the effect of an IGR on the growth of a Manduca hornworm. We hypothesized that the IGR would cause a significent difference between the treated and controll groups. Our results indicated that there was no statistically significent difference between the growth of hornworms treated with IGR and those not treated. This suggests that the IGR had little to no effect on the treated hornworms. However, dosage is important, and here, we used a small amount. In the future, it might be better to increase the dosage to see a difference in treated and controll groups.

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is found in insects and helps in the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars, or tobacco hornworms. JH allows these caterpillars to go through larval stages, that is, it helps them molt; more specifically, it regulates the type of molt. JH is produced by glands located in a region of insects called the corpus allata, positioned near the mouth. After a hornworm’s 4th larval stage, the concentration of JH in hornworms decreases, enter the pupa stage, and they are ready to turn into adults. When JH drops, another hormone called 20E increases in concentration and aids in the development of an adult moth. This rise in 20E is called the commitment pulse. [Johnson: 2018]. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) can be synthetically made to affect insect processes such as growth, affecting JH and other hormones in insects [Tunaz: 2004]. Because JH levels differ based on the stage of development that a Manduca caterpillar is in and IGRs can affect the levels of JH, we decided to test the effect of a specific IGR on the growth of hornworm. In this experiment, we will be using 1 Gregulator 1: 1250, a type of IGR that affects levels of JH in hornworms. The higher the levels of JH in an insect, the more time it remains growing. We hypothesize that the caterpillars given the IGR will grow larger than those that do not receive it because it will cause a delay in the start of the pupa stage, where JH concentration drops.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca caterpillars were divided into two groups. Four caterpillars received normal food with two drops of water per 10g of food (the controll group). The other four received two drops per 10g of food of 1 Gregulator 1: 1250, an insect growth regulator. The hornworms were placed in containers with holes punched on the side and placed in an incubator for 14 days. They were taken out only when they needed more food and to have feces removed. The weights of all caterpillars (in grams) were recorded for 14 days. The weights were recorded because they provided a measurable change in growth, further helping us find out if the JH hormone levels were higher in one group over the other. Their changes in mass over time are a good indicator of the relative levels of JH, and therefore a good measure of their development. A two-sample t_test was used to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between the weights of the caterpillars in the controll and the treatment group.

Results:
The mean change in growth for the treatment group was 7.26g+/-1.29g and 6.31g+/- 1.48g for the controll group (Fig.1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our data. The mean of the weight for the controll group was not statistically significently different from that of the weight for the experimental group (t_stat = 0.968, d.f. = 6, P = 0.185). We obtained a p_value of 0.185, higher than the alpha p_value of 0.05.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, which stated that there was going to be a significent difference in growth in the treatment group compared to the controll group, was not supported. The p_value was higher than the alpha level of significance. This suggests that the IGR had little to no effect on JH levels and on the growth of hornworms. An alternative reason could be that the amount of IGR that we placed in the Manduca food was not enough, being only 2 drops per 10 grams of food. A previous experiment similar to the one performed here tested the effects of dosage of a substance called azadirachtin on hormone levels and growth of Manduca caterpillars. Azadirachtin interferes with juvenile hormone and 20E pathways in the endocrine system of insects. It causes irregularities in growth and molting [Oulhaci: 2018]. It therefore interferes with regular development and often inhibits growth in insects. The conclusion of the study was that a low dosage of azadirachtin caused tobacco hornworms to pupate as they normally would, with slight defects, whereas a high dosage resulted fatal to the hornworms [Schlüter: 1985]. From this information, we can conclude that the dosage of a substance, in this case a chemical known to cause physiological changes, is important.  If our experiment is performed in the future, it would be advisable to increase the amount of 1 Gregulator 1: 1250 placed in the Manduca food to obtain a noticeable difference.
