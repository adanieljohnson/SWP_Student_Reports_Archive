Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Larval Development of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillars rely on Juvenile Hormone (JH) for proper development.  However, the holometabolous life cycle of a Manduca sexta caterpillar can be affected when Manduca sexta larvae are given Insect Growth Regulators.  This can alter the levels of JH in the insect, which can negatively impact the ability of the Manduca Sexta to advance past the larvae phase.  This experiment tests the effects of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta caterpillars by following the developmental progression of the caterpillars when their food was treated with Insect Growth Regulator. It was hypothesized that if Manduca sexta larvae are given Insect Growth Regulator in order to increase the Juvenile Hormone, the Manduca sexta will not reach the pupa stage, and will therefore will not grow as much as Manduca sexta that were not treated with IGR. Our data showed that there is not a large disparity between the mean controll weight of the controll group and the mean controll weight of the treatment group (controll group is 54.53% and treatment group is 42.64%), and we failed to reject the null hypothesis.  The results of this experiment are not statistically significent, as treating the Manduca sexta caterpillars with IGR did not significently affect their weight growth compared to the controll group.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta (M. sexta) is a species of insects that develop by means of a holometabolous life cycle.  These stages are the egg/embryo, the larvae, the pupa, and the adult [Odell: 1998] [Johnson: 2016]  However, this cycle can be affected when M. sexta larvae are given Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) which can alter the levels of Juvenile Hormones (JH) in the insect.  By doing this, the IGRs can lead to various abnormalities that prevent the M. sexta from progressing past the larvae phase.  If the insects never mature into adults, they will never acquire reproductive means, and the M. sexta species population will ultimately decrease.  JH regulates the type of molt that occurs during insect development by determining the level of maturation in the larvae growth cycle.  Molting allows the insect to advance from the larvae to the pupa stage by “terminating the growth phase of a larvae and establishing the body size of the adult insect” [Nijhout: 2015].  This is displayed in the holometabolous life cycle displayed by the M. sexta caterpillars, which serve as the model organism for this study because it is easy to manipulate their hormone levels.  This experiment focuses on six M. sexta larvae and their developmental progression when given IGR drops.  The caterpillars’ weight is considered indicative of changes in the M. sexta growth.  It is hypothesized that if M. sexta larvae are treated with IGR in order to increase JH, the M. sexta will not reach the pupa stage of their holometabolous life cycle, and will therefore will not grow as much as M. sexta that were not treated with IGR.  Testing this hypothesis allows us to test the effect of insect growth hormone on M. sexta caterpillars, which facilitate further study into alternative, non-toxic forms of pesticide for these insects and others similar to them.

Materials and Method:
Six 11-12 days old Manduca sexta caterpillars were used for this experiment.  Their original weights ranged from 0.65 grams to 0.80 grams.  Holes were punctured into the sides of 4-cell containers to allow air flow and each container was labeled either “controll” or “treatment”. 10 grams of Manduca sexta food was measured out and placed in cells 1-3 in the controll container and cells 1-3 in the treatment container.  Five drops of water (dispensed by a pipette) were added to each 10 gram serving of food in both the controll and treatment containers.  The juvenile hormone (five drops of IGR) was added to each of 10 gram servings of food in the treatment container.  The food was clumped together to prevent drying.  Three of the M. sexta caterpillars were placed in the controll container (one per cell) and three of the M. sexta caterpillars were placed in the treatment container (one per cell).  The caterpillars were stored in an incubator kept at a constant 25 degrees celsius with a 12 hour light, 12 hour dark cycle.  The caterpillars were given fresh doses of food (and IGR if they were in the controll group), they were massed, and observations and masses were recorded every over day over the 9-day duration of the experiment.  The average of the weights as well as the percent change in mean weight of the controll group and the treatment group was calculated, and a two-sample t_test was used to analyze the collected data. 

Results:
Both the controll and the treatment groups of the M. sexta caterpillars appeared larger each day of observation with no visual disparity between the two groups in terms of size.  In addition, the M. sexta in the treatment group showed significently less activity compared to the controll group on a daily basis.  Table 1 shows a summary of daily mean weight and daily percent change in mean weight treated with and without IGR.  The average and standard deviation of the daily percent change in mean weight by group is listed in the table.  The mean weight of both groups increased continuously for the duration of the study while the daily percent change in mean weight decreased.  There is not a large disparity between the mean controll weight of the controll group and the mean controll weight of the treatment group, but the overall percent change in weight for the controll group is higher than that of the treatment group. Figure 1 shows the average of daily percentage change in mean weight by group of M. sexta treated with IGR and M. sexta without treatment.  The average daily percent change in mean weight of the controll group is 54.53% with a standard deviation of 33.63.  The average daily percent change in the mean weight of the treatment group is 42.64% with a standard deviation of 27.27.   A 2-sample t_test comparing the average daily percent change in mean weight at an alpha value of 0.05 resulted in a p_value of 0.46.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis stated that if we treat Manduca sexta caterpillars with IGR in order to increase JH, the M. sexta will not reach the pupa stage, and therefore will not grow as much as the controll group.  We compared the weights of the caterpillars in both the controll and treatment groups in order to determine growth.  Our hypothesis is not supported because the 2-sample t_test comparing the average daily percent change in mean weight at an alpha value of 0.05 resulted in p_value of 0.46.  This means that the null hypothesis was not supported and the results of this experiment are not statistically significent, which suggests that the increase in IGR did not significently affect the weight growth of the treated M. sexta larvae.  In addition, it was interesting to observe how the M. sexta in the treatment group had less activity overall than those in the treatment group, considering that “the pupal stage is characterized by reduced movement” and the treatment group should have not reached that phase [Johnson: 2016].  Only three M. sexta were tested in each group.  This limited number of subjects could be a source of error as it increases the likelihood that our results were due to pure chance, and this error could therefore explain the high p_value. Repetition of this experiment could also improve accuracy of the results, as there was an overall difference in the mean percent changes in weight between the controll and the treatment groups, which could possibly indicate that the M. sexta caterpillars were slightly affected by JH [Jesudason: 1990].  For further study, an improved experiment would have lasted longer in order to properly observe if caterpillars in the controll would fully develop into adults.  A longer duration of study would have lead to more conclusive results as transition into the pupa stage would have been observed as well as greater change in weight signifying growth.  Understanding the effect of the insect growth hormone on M. sexta caterpillars and insects like them could further our overall understanding of alternative, non-toxic forms of pesticide.
