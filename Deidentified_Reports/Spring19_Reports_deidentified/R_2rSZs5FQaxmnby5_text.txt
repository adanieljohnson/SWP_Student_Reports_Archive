Title: Hormone Effects on the Molting of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
Hormones are chemicals produced by complex organisms which promote or inhibit development in the physiology of the organism.  This information has proved to be very useful in the area of insect extermination, where limiting an insect’s growth and reproduction can protect valuable agriculture.  In our experiment, we examined how a hormone inhibitor prevented the release of a hormone that impacts the timing of molting in the hornworm (Manduca sexta).  The hormone inhibitor, Aza-Guard, was administered to an experimental group of caterpillars.  Our data showed that there was a significant difference between the growth of the control group, which continued on a normal growth curve for hornworm caterpillars, while the experimental group displayed a lack of growth.  Inhibiting a caterpillar’s growth will prevent it from developing properly and the use of a growth inhibitor that impacts molting is one method of achieving this goal. 

Introduction:
Our experiment examines the effects that hormones have on the development of insects.  The main goal of the experiment was to regulate the development of the Manduca sexta caterpillars (hornworms) using growth hormones.  The Manduca sexta caterpillar is very destructive to tomato plants and so controlling the caterpillar’s ability to grow, is critical to hindering their negative effects.  Caterpillars move to different stages in their life cycles by going through a process of molting.  During molting, a caterpillar’s endocrine system releases hormones that trigger the outer layer of skin cells to shed, allowing the caterpillar to grow and eventually pupate into an adult.  The Manduca sexta has 5 larval stages, but the fifth is significant because it is at this stage that a pulse of hormone called Ecdysterone 20 occurs while another hormone called juvenile hormone stays low.  Ecdysterone 20 is known to regulate the timing of molting during Manduca sexta development.  This suppression of juvenile hormone combined with a peak in Ecdysterone triggers the molt that leads to adulthood.  According to You Song at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research, “20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is the key hormone mediating various physiological and behavioral changes that are essential for molting, and successful molting is key to survival, development, and reproduction.” [You:  2018]  In this experiment, it was predicted that administering an Ecdysterone inhibitor would limit the growth of the hornworm and prevent the pulse of Ecdysterone that would lead to pupation.  

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, a Ecdysterone 20 inhibitor called Aza-Guard was used to block the release of Ecdysterone in an experimental group of hornworms.  Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were split into two groups, four to the control group and four to the experimental group.  The control group was given ten grams of food mixed with 10 drops of deionized water.  The experimental group was given ten grams of food mixed with ten drops of Aza-Guard.  The weight in grams of each caterpillar was tracked over the span of 15 days, with the food being replaced as needed.  Both groups were kept in an incubator to maintain a controlled environment.  The data collected on the two groups during the experiment will be analyzed using a two-sample T-test.    

Results:
The general trends in the data show that the growth of the hornworm control group continued to increase while the growth of the experimental group had an initial increase in growth and then rapidly plateaued.  results of the experiment reveal that the growth of the experimental group was substantially reduced by using the Aza-Guard.  Table 1. Larvae Growth, shows the growth patterns of the experimental and control groups.  The table shows that the growth of the experimental group tracks closely together, while the data for the growth of the control group is a little more erratic, but consistently follows an upward trend.  

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that an Ecdysterone inhibitor would reduce the growth in hornworms was supported.  We observed more rapid growth of the control group and minimal growth in the experimental group.  Table 2. Statistical Data, shows a t-value of 1.719466.  With a dF =6. a one-tailed p-value of 0.06818162 and a two-tailed p-value of 0.136325 were also obtained.  The statistical data find significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  The null hypothesis states that there would be no change in growth patterns between the control and the experimental groups with the application of Aza-Guard.  The one-tailed p-value was 0.068 and this is very close to the commonly used measure of 0.05 to show statistical significance and the rejection of the null hypothesis.  Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the result of the experiment is that inhibiting the release of the hormone Ecdysterone 20 in hornworms results in an interruption in the growth cycle.
