Title: The Comparison of the Rate of Photosynthesis in Purple and Green Leaves 

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine if the rate of photosynthesis was different between purple and green lettuce. Specifically, we were attempting to determine if the anthocyanins that made the leaf purple had a role in photosynthesis. We tested this by adding DCIP in chloroplast samples from each type of lettuce and measuring the changes in absorbance of both types of lettuce. From that information, we were able to determine the relative rates of photosynthesis. We found a p_value of 0.245, meaning that there was not a statistically significent difference between the two colors of lettuce. This could have resulted from the centrifuge removing the anthocyanins or the anthocyanins simply not playing a role in photosynthesis.


Introduction:
Cellular processes in biology require added energy to live which comes from harvesting energy from external sources. Plants are able to use photosynthesis in order to capture and store energy from the sun. Plants harvest energy from the sun in two processes: light dependent and light independent. During light dependent reactions, photons from the sun are used to excite electrons in the chloroplast. The excited electron travels through photosystem I (PSI) and aids in the creation of NADPH from NADP+ [Johnson: 2018]. During photosynthesis, DCIP is reduced to DCIPH2, changing from a dark blue compound to a colorless substance. Thus, we are able to determine photosynthetic activity from the absorbance of the solutions. 
The color of lettuce ranges from light green to dark purple or brown. Lettuce (and many other plants) is purple due to a high concentration of anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are water-soluble vacuolar pigments that play a role in protection from too much light [Gazula: 2007]. Too much light can result in photoinhibition, which is a decrease in photosynthetic activity due to too damage from too much light [Feild: 2001]. Photoinhibition occurs as a result of damage to the D1 protein of photosystem II (PSII) [Gazula: 2007]. This decreases the efficiency of photosynthesis. Without anthocyanins, plants that are exposed to too much light may have lower levels of photosynthesis. For this experiment, we will be testing if the rate of PSII of purple lettuce is statistically different from the rate of PSII of green lettuce. 


Materials and Method:
Obtaining Green and Purple Lettuce Pellets
We obtained four medium-sized purple lettuce leaves and four medium sized green lettuce leaves. We removed their central large veins and the green leaves were grinded in a mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8). 10 more Ml of cold grinding buffer was added and then the slurry was strained a cheesecloth. The purple leaves were then grinded and strained in the same manner. Both samples were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for three minutes at 4°C. The supernatant of both samples was removed. The two samples were then centrifuged again for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm. The supernatant was then poured into waste for both the green and purple samples. We then added 20 Ml of grinding buffer to both solutions and stirred gently. 

Absorbance Measurements
We made three samples of three test tubes each and one blank. In the blank, 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 100µL of green lettuce pellet sample were added. In the negative controll, 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mM DCIP, and 2Ml of reaction buffer were added. In the positive controll (green lettuce sample), 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mM DCIP, 2Ml of reaction buffer, and 100µL of green lettuce pellet sample were added. In the experimental group (purple lettuce sample), 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mM DCIP, 2Ml of reaction buffer, and 100µL of purple lettuce pellet sample were added. The spectrophotometer was blanked at 600nm and then the absorbances for all samples was measured. We placed the samples in light in between the measurements and remeasured the absorbances after 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Our group conducted a paired t_test to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between the change in absorbances of the purple and green lettuce.


Results:
In order to test the effects of color of lettuce on photosynthesis, we compared the absorbances of chloroplast solutions of green and purple lettuce. We compared these samples by calculating the percent that each measured absorbance was of the absorbance taken at time zero. As visible in Figure 1, these values all began at 100% and all decreased from time zero to time 30. Not surprisingly, the negative controll group with no chloroplasts decreased the least from 100%. It ended at time 30 with a 94.3% absorbance of the initial reading. The purple and green lettuce groups decreased a similar amount, but the percent of the initial absorbance of the green leaves decreased slightly more. The green leaves ended at time 30 with a 86.8% absorbance and the purple leaves ended with a 87.2% absorbance. 
	We conducted a paired t_test to analyze our data and compare the percent change of the purple and green lettuce. We found a p_value of 0.245. Since the p_value was not below 0.05, the difference in absorbance between the experimental and positive controll groups was not statistically significent.


Discussion:
Through analyzing the changes in absorbances, it can be determined which group was the most effective at the reduction reactions needed in photosynthesis. Since the green lettuce samples had the greatest drop in absorbance, they had the most electrons added to DCIP. However, since the difference between the change in absorbance from the green and purple leaves was not significent, we can not say that the coloring of the leaves had any influence on the rate of PSII. The answer to our research question is that the purple and green lettuce leaves did not have differing rates of photosynthesis.
These results differ from a study published in 2011 in which researchers used gas analysis to determine that green plants had a higher maximum rate of photosynthesis [Neilsen: 2011]. Our results may have been different from these because we used a centrifuge to separate the chloroplasts from the leaf and they used the whole leaf. Thus, the anthocyanins in our purple leaves could have been removed from the centrifuge. 
The next step could be to determine why there was not a statistically significent difference between the two types of lettuce. One potential explanation could be that the anthocyanins did not play a role in the protection against photoinhibition because the plants were not exposed to a large enough amount of light. Thus, the photosynthesis processes of the two plants were essentially the same. Another potential explanation could be that the anthocyanins got removed during the process of centrifugation and that the anthocyanins would have played a role had we determined the rate of photosynthesis in a different way. A final potential explanation could be that anthocyanins simply do not play a role in the rate of photosynthesis. A follow-up study could be done to determine if the centrifugation removed the anthocyanins that otherwise would have played a role in photosynthesis. This could be determined by measuring the rate of photosynthesis in a different way, maybe through gas analysis. That way, if there is a statistically significent difference between the rate of photosynthesis of the two colors of lettuce, we could infer that the anthocyanins were simply removed from centrifugation in this experiment.

Figure #1. Percent absorbance of initial reading at times 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes. The “No Chloroplasts” group was the negative controll and it contained the same solutions as the other groups but just did not have any of the lettuce sample. The “Purple Lettuce” group was the experimental group and and it is the samples that contain chloroplasts from the purple lettuce leaves. The “Green Lettuce” group was the positive controll it is the samples that contain chloroplasts from the green lettuce leaves. Absorbances were measured using a spectrophotometer at 600nm.
