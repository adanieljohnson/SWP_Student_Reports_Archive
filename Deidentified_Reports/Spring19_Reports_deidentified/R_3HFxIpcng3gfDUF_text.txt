Title: Red light forces Secale cereale to allocate more resources to shoots

Abstract:
Plants allocate resources to the areas which need them the most in order to take in an adequate amount of a given resource. Light is a resource of upmost importance for plants to obtain energy. Red light has a longer wavelength and emits less energy than other light colors, including white light which has many wavelengths. This led us to research how plants in red light allocated their resources to cope with the decrease in available energy. We found that when placing Secale cereale under white light and under all red light that the plants under red light had a lower root:shoot ratio. This means that the plants allocated more resources to the shoots to aid in the capture of energy from the light source.

Introduction:
Plants require many resources to grow such as water and chemical resources. However, these resources are limited, and plants must be able to adapt to deficiencies in certain areas. This adaptation to cope with deficiencies is seen in how the plants allocate their resources for growth is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson:2016]. One resource that is of interest is light and the energy it provides plants. Certain colors of light come in a various wavelengths, blue is around 440-490nm, green is about 490-570nm, and red light is 620-780nm [Reusch:2013]. We can assume that white light is simply a mixture of all wavelengths. The energy available in a photon of light is known to be inversely proportional to the wavelength as seen in the equation E=h×c/λ [Light:2016]. This means that in light of longer wavelengths such as red light there is less available energy. The specific light environment of where a plant grows may significently affect the wavelength of light the plant receives, and thus how effective the plant can harness energy. One plant that is a great study subject for this is Secale cereale or rye as it grows reasonably fast and shows noticeable evidence of phenotypic plasticity. We can use rye to tell us how easily plants can harness energy from white light sources as compared to a source of only red light. The ability of plants to harness light can be determined by looking at root:shoot ratios of plants and how they allocate their resources to a certain area in order to obtain adequate energy from the light source. We hypothesize that when placing plants under white light sources and red only light sources, that plants in the red light will have a lower root:shoot ratio as they will allocate more resources to the shoots.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment we filled 6 pots with vermiculite soil and then created 12 small indentions in each pot. We then planted about 4 Secale cereale or rye seeds in each hole. We then covered the holes with more vermiculite. Because vermiculite has no nutrients it served as a controll for nutrient levels in each pot. As an additional controll each pot received 50 Ml of Miracle Gro solution prior to planting. Once the seeds were planted we then placed 3 pots in a box with a light source that emitted white light and 3 pots in a box with a light source that emitted only red light. All 6 pots were watered daily with enough water to adequately soak the vermiculite of each pot. After 2 weeks the pots were removed and then samples were taken from each pot, each replicate consisted of a 3-plant group, one three plant group originating from each pot. Then plants were then weighed using a balance. Then each plant was cut just above the seed at the root:shoot junction. Then the shoots of the plants were weighed along with the roots being weighed. These values were then used to calculated the root:shoot weight ratio. The plant shoots and roots were then measured to find the longest shoot as well as the longest root from each sample. These values were then used to calculate root:shoot length ratio. 

Results:
We found that plants grown in red light had a root:shoot weight ratio of 0.630934226 ± 0.069061196 and a root:shoot length ratio of 0.284720558± 0.022055982. We found that plants grown in white light had a root:shoot weight ratio of 0.771751752± 0.098230066 and a root:shoot length ratio of 0.374005305± 0.035364169. 

Discussion:
The results of our experiment supported our hypothesis that plants grown in red light would have lower root:shoot ratios. We can make this conclusion because for the t_tests comparing the data length ratios showed a statistically significent p_value of 0.010323. However, our results for weight root:shoot ratios had an insignificent p_value of 0.056029. The weight data did however show the trend expected and as the p_value was just slightly above the significent value of 0.05 we expect this trend would continue until it becomes significent. We can assume that this occurred because the plants in red light were working to maximize their energy uptake from photosynthesis by changing their phenotype to allocate more resources to the shoots which perform photosynthesis. Many plants act in similar ways by altering their phenotype to give them the best chance of flourishing in their environment. One example of this is Arabidopsis thaliana attracting more parasitoid wasps to attack the caterpillars that prey on the plant [Zhang: 2013]. While our data did reflect the trends, we expected there is still potential for human error and the small sample size to inhibit our results, but with more trials it is likely these issues will work themselves out. To further this research, we should conduct more trials and apply this information to how different areas of the world and the available light there will affect plant growth.
