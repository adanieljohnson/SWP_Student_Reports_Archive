Title: Root-to-shoot ratios in relation to nitrogen levels: resource allocation in Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
Abstract
Aims  We aimed to study how different levels of nutrients can impact resource allocation in plants of the same species and to determine the phenotypic results of this resource allocation.  
Method  We investigated how 0 grams, 2 grams, and 7 grams of nitrate impact the growth of 6 radish plants when cultivated in a greenhouse and given 200Ml of water for 14 days.  We compared their root-to-shoot ratios using ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests.
Results  There was a significent difference between the average root-to-shoot ratio mass of the no nitrate plants and the high and low nitrate plants.  There was also a significent difference between the no nitrate group and the low nitrate group, as well as between the no nitrate group and high nitrate groups; however, there was no significent difference between the low and high nitrate groups.
Discussion  Because it did not have nitrate available, the controll group had to allocate its resources into collecting nutrients from the vermiculite, therefore creating a higher root-to-shoot ratio.  On the other hand, the low and high nitrate groups had easy access to nitrate and therefore could expand their resource allocation into stems and leaves.  


Introduction:
Introduction

Adaptation to abiotic and biotic factors in an ecosystem is a characteristic of organisms that allow for their survival in adverse or inconsistent environments.  This is known as phenotypic plasticity (Johnson: 2018).  The levels of the three primary resources (soil nutrients, solar energy, and water) necessary for plant growth may vary in an ecosystem, and as a result, the strategy of resource allocation becomes a solution to this problem.  Within specific species, the resource allocation may also vary and be dependent upon the organs of the plant.  Leaves collect solar energy and carbon dioxide have a high growth rate because of their increased resource allocation (Johnson: 2018).  Similarly, stems aid in this allocation by acting as a supporting structure to lift the leaves towards the sun (Johnson: 2018).  Finally, roots collect macronutrients and transport them to the stem and the leaves (Johnson: 2018).  Transported from roots to leaves in terrestrial plants, nitrogen is one of the most crucial limiting nutrients for plant growth (Zhang: 2018).  The role of nitrogen includes aiding photosynthesis and respiration and forming cells, genes, and enzymes in plant organs (Zhang: 2018).  Although it is an essential nutrient for plant growth, excessive or underprovided amounts of nitrogen can negatively impact the environment in which the plant grows (Zhao: 2005).  Needing to use nitrogen fertilizer in domestic plants is contingent on the current condition and nutrients in the soil where a plant grows (Zhao: 2005).  The biomass of plants and their resource allocations are also closely related (Johnson: 2018).  Through measuring the root-to-shoot ratio of plants by dividing the biomass of the root over the biomass of the shoot, the resource allocation of a certain species can be determined (Johnson: 2018).  We hypothesize that there will be a significance difference in root-to-shoot ratios of the same plan species when different amounts of nitrogen are added.  To test this hypothesis, we applied the principles of phenotypic plasticity to potted Raphanus sativus plants (radishes) in a greenhouse, each with different amounts of nitrogen, to determine the effects of nitrogen levels on plant growth.

Materials and Method

We planted Raphanus sativus (radish) seeds in six pots of vermiculate soil substitute. We added a different amount of nitrate to the soil of each pair of plots.  The first pair had 0 grams of nitrate and were labeled as “no nitrate”.  The second pair had 2 grams of nitrate added and were labeled as “low nitrate”.  The third pair had 7 grams of nitrate added and were labeled as “high nitrate”.  The plants were given 50Ml of Miracle Grow and 200Ml of water initially and then subsequently given 200Ml of water each day for the next 14 days.  The six plots were cultivated in a greenhouse.  

Each plant was removed and placed into a tub of water to loosen the vermiculite and collect individuals replicates of each plot.  Six random replicates were taken from each condition, then dried and weighed.  After collecting their weight, we cut the replicates evenly into roots and shoots and weighed them separately. 

Using the statistical analysis program, ANOVA, we analyzed the data from the controll group containing 0 grams of nitrate and the two experimental groups, low nitrate and high nitrate, which had 2 and 7 grams of nitrate.  


Results:
From the results of our ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests, we determined that there is a significent difference between the controll group (0 grams of nitrate) and the low and high nitrate groups.  The average root-to-shoot ratio mass for the no nitrate group was 0.11658952 ± 0.0374458 grams; the average root-to-shoot ratio mass for the low nitrate group was 0.07816087 ± 0.01055979 grams; and the average root-to-shoot ratio mass for the high nitrate group was 0.07715174 ± 0.0157961 grams (Figure 1).  

The average root and shoot masses (separated) were also evaluated for each group.  The average total mass of roots for the no nitrate group was 0.098333333 ± 0.03250641 grams.  
The average total mass of roots for the low nitrate group was 0.131666667 ± 0.038686776 grams, and the average total mass of roots for the high nitrate group was 0.09 ± 0.045166359 grams. The average total mass of shoots for the no nitrate group was 0.84 ± 0.119833217 grams. The average total mass of shoots for the low nitrate group was 1.67 ± 0.366060104 grams, and the average total mass of shoots for the high nitrate group was 1.128333333 ± 0.314605573 grams.  

The one-way ANOVA test that we conducted exhibited a p_value of .02 for the average root-to-shoot ratio of the no nitrate group and the average root-to-shoot ratio of the low and high nitrate groups, meaning there is a significance difference there.  The Tukey-Kramer test exhibited a value of minimum significent difference between the no nitrate group and the low nitrate group. 
It also exhibited a value of minimum significent difference between the no nitrate group and high nitrate group.  There was no significent difference between the low and high nitrate groups,
according to the Tukey Kramer test.


Discussion:
Nitrogen is one of the most limiting nutrients in plant growth (Zhang: 2018).  This study investigated how different nitrogen amounts in radish plants affect their resource allocation and root-to-shoot ratios.  We hypothesized that there would be a significent difference in root-to-shoot ratios when adding different nitrate levels to the same species (Raphanus sativus).  Our results supported this hypothesis by demonstrating a significent difference between the experimental groups and the controll group.  The root-to-shoot mass ratio in the no nitrate group was higher than in the other two groups, demonstrating a greater biomass in the plants with no nitrate added.  From this, we can draw a conclusion that with no nitrate, the radish plants had to allocate their resources to the roots to prosper in that condition, as mentioned in the study on nitrogen deficiency (Zhao: 2005).  Another observation is that the plants in the low nitrate and high nitrate group had significently lower root-to-shoot mass ratios than the group with no nitrate did.  We can conclude that the reasoning behind this is that with the accessibility of the nitrate, the plants did not have to allocate their resources strictly to the soil and could expand their allocation to other beneficial organs, like the stems.  Roots are more involved in collecting nutrients from the soil, like nitrogen, than stems and leaves, which have other important functions (Johnson: 2018).  To improve this study, we could have collected more replicates from each plot and condition, to ensure more legitimate results.  We also could have added more nitrate throughout the observation time to increase variability.  It is important to remember that because this experiment was done in a domestic environment, conducting it in another environment outside of a laboratory or greenhouse may permit different results.  

In conclusion, resource allocation is a successful way that plants respond to the biotic and abiotic factors in their environment.  Whether these factors are excess sunlight, lack of water, or excess of nutrients, their phenotypic plasticity will allow them to adapt to the conditions for survival and to maintain fitness.
