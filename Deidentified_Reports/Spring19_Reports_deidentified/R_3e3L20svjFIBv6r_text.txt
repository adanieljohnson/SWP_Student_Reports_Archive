Title: Effect of Acetylcholine Inhibition on the Contractions in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Raina pipiens

Abstract:
Skeletal muscle contracts in response to a release of acetylcholine from motor neurons that stimulates an action potential leading to the release of calcium ions in the muscle. In this experiment, the gastrocnemius muscles of Raina pipiens were used to observe the effects of acetylcholine on neuromuscular function after they were treated with Sevin, an inhibitor of acetylcholine. These muscles were tested with a stimulation of 1v to the muscle three times both before and after treatment and the results were compared using a paired-t-test. The mean of average response voltages for the control was 0.946v with a standard deviation of 0.228 and 0.339v with a standard deviation of 0.162 for the treatment. The paired-t-test resulted in a one-tailed p-value of 0.095 at an alpha level of 0.05 so we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Our results are not statistically significant. This experiment did not indicate that Sevin could reduce the strength of muscle contractions in the gastrocnemius muscle of R. pipiens. If repeated, the probe could stimulate the sciatic nerve instead of the gastrocnemius muscle so that the effects of the action potential from nerve to muscle can be observed.

Introduction:
Skeletal Muscle in vertebrates and invertebrates consists of thousands of myofibrils which are bound together to form functional groups of muscle fibers. These muscles are innervated by motor neurons extending from the spinal cord that release acetylcholine (Ach) into the neuromuscular junction [Johnson: 2018]. This neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels to generate an action potential that spreads through the fiber, releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which causes a contraction as the muscles shorten [Pestronk: 1976]. In this experiment we will isolate the gastrocnemius muscle of Raina pipiens to observe the effects of acetylcholine on neuromuscular function. Sevin is an insecticide that inhibits acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction [Todd: 2002]. We will test three legs of R. pipiens by stimulating the gastrocnemius muscle with 1v and recording the resulting response voltage before and after an injection of Sevin (an Ach inhibitor). By inhibiting acetylcholine, there should be less action potentials in the muscle because the release of acetylcholine stimulates the firing of action potentials in the muscle that cause the muscle to contract [Johnson: 2018]. Our hypothesis is if we treat the gastrocnemius muscle of R. pipiens with Sevin then the strength of the contraction (as measured by the voltage) will decrease because inhibiting Ach should decrease the number of action potentials. This is significant because Sevin could be an effective insecticide that would paralyze pests but not harm crops because plants do not have muscles that require acetylcholine stimulation the way animals do.

Materials and Methods:
While gently holding the leg above the gastrocnemius muscle, we pulled back to skin in one quick downward motion to expose the muscle. Then, using scissors, we cut the tendon connecting to the gastrocnemius muscle by the foot and tied a string around that tendon. This string was hung from a hook attached to the force transducer to measure voltage exerted by the contracting muscle. After pinning the remaining pieces of the leg down, the BNC connector probes were inserted into the suspended gastrocnemius muscle of the R. pipiens. Throughout the duration of the experiment the muscles were periodically drenched in Frog Ringers to preserve the muscle. The probe delivered 1v to the muscle three times and the resulting voltages of the responses were recorded, these three responses were then averaged. Then, 5mL of Sevin, an acetylcholine inhibitor, was injected into the muscle from a high angle in three different locations to ensure even dispersion of the treatment. After waiting 5 minutes and administering some gentle massaging of the muscle, the probe delivered 1v three more times and the voltages of the responses were recorded and averaged. This process was repeated on the remaining two R. Pipiens legs. The means of the control trials for each leg were averaged together and the means of the treatment trials for each leg were averaged as well. The difference in these resulting average response voltage for the control trial and the treatment trials were compared using a paired-t-test to determine a one-tailed p-value.

Results:
After treatment, we observed that the muscles appeared to respond with a weaker contraction compared to the strength of the control responses however the first leg did not respond to treatment at first. This is shown in Figure 1 by the difference between the intensity of the responses for each leg before and after treatment. Table 1 shows a summary of average response voltages of the gastrocnemius muscle of R. pipiens following a stimulus of 1v before and after treatment of 5mL of Sevin. The mean and standard deviation of the three tests for each leg are shown for both the treatment and control trials. The mean and standard deviation of those averages are also listed. The average of the means of the control group was much greater than that of the treatment group. Figure 1 depicts a comparison of the mean of three response voltages of three gastrocnemius muscles of R. pipiens at 1v before and after treatment of 5mL of Sevin, standard deviation bars are shown. Before treatment, the control tests resulted in a mean of average response voltages of 0.946v with a standard deviation of 0.228. After an injection of 5mL of Sevin, the treatment tests resulted in a mean of average response voltages of 0.339v with a standard deviation of 0.162. A one-tailed paired-t-test comparing the mean of average response voltages for the control trial and treatment trial at an alpha value of 0.05 resulted in a p-value 0.095.

Discussion:
We failed to reject the null hypothesis and our results are not significant so the results of this experiment could be due to chance. Acetylcholine is responsible for creating action potentials that contract muscles when it is released from motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction [Pestronk: 1976]. Sevin inhibits acetylcholine so a treatment of Sevin should have decreased the strength of muscle contractions by decreasing the amount of action potentials in the gastrocnemius muscle [Todd: 2002]. However, this experiment did not indicate that an Sevin could decrease the strength of muscle contractions. Only three R. pipiens gastrocnemius muscles were tested and this limited number of subjects could be a source of error and could explain our insignificant p-value. Repetition of this experiment could also improve results because it would provide a larger sample size of data and therefore improve reliability. We inserted the probe directly into the gastrocnemius muscle instead of the sciatic nerve which is the nerve that connects to the gastrocnemius muscle to stimulate it [Johnson: 2018]. To take this research further, the same experiment could be conducted but this time the probe could stimulate the sciatic nerve instead of direct stimulation to the muscle to observe how the effects of an action potential beginning in the nervous system are affected by Sevin. This research is important because Sevin could be an effective insecticide capable of paralyzing pests that could harm crops while being too weak to harm humans who consume those crops. This chemical would also not harm the crops because plants do not have muscles that require acetylcholine stimulation the way animals do.
