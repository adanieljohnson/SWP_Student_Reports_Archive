Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Tetany in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog

Abstract:
Animals use nerve cells to send action potentials to muscle cells, causing them to contract and relax. If several action potentials are rapidly and continuously fired on the same muscle cell, they will build upon each other in a process called summation. This causes a stronger and more sustained muscle contraction in a process called tetany. In this experiment, we tested the effects of caffeine on tetany in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg. We achieved this by isolating the muscle and stimulating it before and after injecting it with caffeine, and then comparing the differences in response strength using a paired t_test. We also used observations and a myogram to see if caffeine triggered tetany in the muscle. We found that the force exerted by each muscle was increased after the caffeine injection, and that we observed that each muscle became stiff and hard after the increase in caffeine. Also, the myogram displayed a sudden increase in force exerted by the muscle followed by a plateau in the graph, suggesting that a constant strong force was being exerted by the muscle. This was significent evidence that medically induced tetany had occurred after the caffeine injection....

Introduction:
ABSTRACT CONTINUED ...The stiffness of the muscle and the plateau of the myogram mean that the muscle exerted a long and sustained force, and the paired t_test proved that the responses to stimuli were significently stronger after the caffeine injection, meaning that caffeine caused medically induced tetany in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg. 

Animals use nerve signals to send messages throughout the body, especially to muscle tissues, at a quick rate. Each nerve cell passes an action potential to another nerve cell until the action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction, which is where a nerve cell meets a muscle cell. When the action potential is transported into the muscle cell, it triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which ultimately causes the muscle to quickly contract (or twitch). Therefore, it is known that one action potential will cause one twitch. However, if a muscle receives several consecutive action potentials, the muscle will constantly remain contracted because the action potentials will begin to build upon one another through a process called summation. This continued state of contraction by a muscle cell is called tetany, and if muscle cells remain in tetany for too long, they will become fatigued and relax. The entire process of contraction, summation, and tetany is regulated by chemicals such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and caffeine. Therefore, a common scientific question that can be asked is what would happen if the concentration of one of these chemicals were to be altered. Scientists have discovered that the effect of caffeine in a frog’s leg muscles was to cause the release of Calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Isaacson et al, 1967). We decided that we would increase the level of caffeine in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog’s leg, and a frog was chosen as the organism of study because they have relatively strong legs with a muscle that can easily be isolated through dissection and allow us to easily obtain data. Also there were several previous studies of a similar nature on frog legs, so a plethora of background knowledge was also important in choosing the frog. Therefore, we decided that we would isolate the gastrocnemus muscle, stimulate it with electrical impulses, and use a computer software to determine the force exerted by the muscle with its natural concentration of caffeine and with an injection of caffeine. I predict that an increased amount of caffeine in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog will cause the muscle to experience chemically induced tetany and exert a stronger and more continuous force than the muscle without a caffeine injection.

Materials and Method:
We will begin the experiment by dissecting the frog leg to expose the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve. We will then attach the muscle to a string at the achilles tendon, which is then connected to a machine that can read the force exerted by the muscle and produce a myogram that we will use as evidence to evaluate our hypothesis. At the same time, we will attach an electrical probe to the sciatic nerve (by just resting the probe on the nerve) which we will use to transmit the electrical impulses to the nerve. We will use three frog legs for the experiment, and each will be stimulated without a caffeine injection and then with a caffeine injection. This will allow us to see the change in stimulus response for each leg while eliminating the difference in starting muscle strength between each of the three different frog legs. We will stimulate the sciatic nerve with a 1.0V electric shock three times, then we will use a syringe to inject 0.1Ml of 200mM caffeine, and finally we will stimulus the muscle three additional times. The myogram will be used to determine the difference in voltage in the muscle between the lowest point and the highest point on the graph at each stimulus. It will also be used to observe whether or not tetany occured, and when it occurred. We will also record observations by looking at and touching the gastrocnemus muscle before and after the caffeine injection. We will use the differences in voltage for each separate frog leg to conduct a paired t_test which will be used to determine if we observed a significent difference in muscle contraction due to the increase of caffeine. 


Results:
Each muscle produced a larger response after the caffeine injection than they produced before the injection. Leg 1 produced a response that was 0.102V greater after the increase in caffeine, leg 2 produced a response that was 0.066V greater after the injection, and leg 3 produced a response that was 0.062V greater after it received an increase in caffeine. We observed that each muscle was stiff and hard to the touch after the injection while it was smooth and soft before the experiment. In the three initial stimuli, the myogram displayed a single peak for each stimulus from each muscle. After we injected the muscle with caffeine, the myogram displayed a large trend upward followed by a plateau with only a small peak for each stimulus. Our paired t_test results were as follows: (t-value=6.028, d.f.=2, P-value=0.0264). 


Discussion:
	The results of the statistical test, as well as our observations, support our hypothesis. The p_value suggests that there is about a 98% chance that the increased responses to stimuli were caused by the injection of caffeine. This means that caffeine will cause the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog to produce stronger responses to stimuli. Our observation of the myogram and of the muscle support that each frog leg experienced chemically induced tetany. The sudden increase and plateau that of the myogram (as described in the results section) means that the muscle quickly contracted and remained in its contracted state continuously. This means that tetany was achieved without stimulating the sciatic nerve, therefore supporting the claim that chemically induced tetany was observed. Limited time and resources reduced the variety of claims that could be tested in our experiment, but future studies of similar nature could be done in order to better understand how different chemicals controll the actions of a muscle. For example, a study can be done to compare the effects of all four chemicals in affecting both strength of stimulus response and the process of tetany. Scientists have also discovered that caffeine can more than double the duration of each action potential in an animal muscle cell (Gubareff et al, 1965). Further research could be done about this to determine how caffeine causes this increase, and if other chemicals affect this as well. This would be important in allowing scientists to see which chemicals controll which processes and how prevalent each substance is in a muscle cell.
