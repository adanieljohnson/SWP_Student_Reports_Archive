Title:  The increase in length in Manduca sexta caterpillars with addition of azadirachtin

Abstract:
One of the many problems that biologist aim to solve is pest control.  It is important for farmers to understand the most efficient ways in terminating insects that are detrimental to their crops. The main objective of this experiment was to determine whether the insect growth regulator, azadirachtin, is effective in stunting the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Azadirachtin is a antagonist for the growth hormone Ecdysterone (E20) which regulates the timing of moltage in Manduca sexta caterpillars. A constant amount of Azadirachtin was  mixed into the caterpillars food and the length of the caterpillars will be recorded over a period of 13 days. The expectation was that the caterpillar’s intake of Azadirachtin would block Ecdysterone, causing the growth in length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars to be stunted. Our data showed no significant difference between the average difference in lengths of the control and experimental groups. The similarity in average length increase between the two groups suggests that towards the pupa stage, both groups of caterpillars stopped eating causing the experimental group to stop its intake of Azadirachtin and essentially develop as the control group did. 


Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effect of the hormone blocker azadirachtin on Manduca sexta caterpillars. A hormone is a chemical, regulatory substance that influence certain functions and development in an organism. In Manduca sexta caterpillars the molting hormone Ecdysterone(20E) is responsible for the timing of molting during metamorphosis. * The term molting refers to stage when the insect forms a new outer layer called a cuticle from its existing epidermal skin cells. The old skin of the insect is shed and the molt allows for the insect to change in shape and size. This molt period will last from 19-23 days and signifies the transition to adulthood in Manduca sexta caterpillars. If the hormone levels of Ecdysterone remain at a threshold within the insect then this molting hormone will trigger ecdysis which is the shedding of the old skin [Subramanian: 2016]. Azadirachtin is an “insect growth regulator” (IGR) which is known to be an antagonist of Ecdysterone. This experiment aims to reveal how blocking ecdysterone with azadirachtin affects the length growth in Manduca sexta caterpillars. The addition of an IGR will affect the development of the caterpillars due to the manipulation of hormone levels. We hypothesize that if azadirachtin is used to block ecdysterone then the length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars will be stunted. This is because Ecdysterone controls the timing of molting and if this timing is delayed due to the blockage of that hormone then its development and length will be stunted. 


Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were tested on during their larvae stage of life. 4 caterpillars belonged to the experimental group and the other 4 were the control group. The caterpillars were each placed into their own individual cell with two holes punched through the cell for access to oxygen. For the experimental group each caterpillar was given 10g of caterpillar food containing 6 drops of azadirachtin. For the control group each caterpillar was given 10g of caterpillar food containing 6 drops of water. The food was replenished if it became too dry or it ran out. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator for 13 days. Everyday the length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars were recorded in cm using a ruler. A one tailed two sample t-test was used to determine the differences in the average lengths of the caterpillars under constant conditions. 


Results:
The average difference in length for the control group was 1.1cm and the average difference in length for the experimental group was 0.775cm (Fig. 1). The standard deviation for the control group was 1.1+/- 0.4830 and the standard deviation for the experimental group was 0.775+/- 0.8732(Fig.1).  We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results. The mean of our control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat=0.6514, df=7, P=0.2695). By the final day most of the caterpillars had began to pupate and stopped growing. Overall the control and experimental group had about the same growth pattern over the 13 days (Fig.1). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the addition of azadirachtin to block ecdysterone would stunt the growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillars was not supported. There was no significant difference between the average differences, suggesting that the presence of azadirachtin does not stunt the growth of the caterpillars. Towards the end of the experiment the caterpillars stopped increasing in length and has all began molting approximately at the same time. Therefore it is possible that the hormone ecdysterone was not sufficiently blocked in the experimental group.  It is possible that the reason both groups reached the molting stage at the same time because caterpillars tend to stop eating during the wandering and pupation stages of life [Nijhout: 2006]. During the last 5 days of the experiment no waste was produced by the caterpillars, indicating that they had seized consumption of their food. By seizing their consumption of food they were not intaking azadirachtin which could explain why all caterpillars reached molting stage at the same time. This information provides an explanation for our data. To prevent this from happening in future experiments we could use Manduca sexta caterpillars that are in the 1st or 2nd instar larva stage[Johnson:2016].  By using caterpillars that have just hatched, they would be less likely to pupate or approach pupation over the duration of the experiment.
