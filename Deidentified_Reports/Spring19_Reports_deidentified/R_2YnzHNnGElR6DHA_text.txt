Title: The Effect of Nitrogen Concentration on Root to Shoot Ratio in Secale cereale

Abstract:
Most species of plants have evolved to allocate limited essential resources in a particular pattern which determines where they are likely to grow.  These essential resources required for plant growth are either acquired above the ground, in the shoots, or below the ground, in the roots.  The relative allocation of biomass (root: shoot) can indicate the ability of a plant to acquire resources in a given environment and can change through phenotypic plasticity.  Nitrogen is one such resource that is acquired through the roots and necessary for photosynthesis.  We hypothesized that the root: shoot would be smaller for rye plants grown in an increased nitrogen concentration.  In order to test this, we grew rye plants for two weeks and either watered them with plain water or a water/ Miracle-Gro solution.  We measured root: shoot length and weight for both groups.  Our data supported our hypothesis because the root: shoot length and weight were both smaller for the rye grown in increased nitrogen concentration.  From this we can conclude that the rye plants were able to allocate their resources to the shoots because they did not need to use their energy to obtain nitrogen, unlike the controll rye plants.

Introduction:
In any ecological community, the resident plants and animals must interact with and adapt to each other.  Biotic factors are environmental stimuli that originate from other organisms and abiotic factors are stimuli coming from non-living sources [Johnson: 2018].  Many intra- and inter-specific plant interactions revolve around obtaining essential resources like sunlight, nitrogen, or water [Johnson: 2018].  These resources are not unlimited and resource limitation affects what species are present in a community.  In response, most species have evolved to allocate their resources in a particular pattern, which determines where they are likely to grow [Johnson: 2018].  Resource availability can alter the morphology and physiology of plants significently [Hilbert: 1989].  Resources required for plant growth can be divided into those acquired above ground (shoots) and those sought below ground (roots).  The relative allocation of biomass (root: shoot) can indicate the ability of a plant to acquire resources [Johnson 2018].  Nutrients, including nitrogen, come from the soil and must move from the roots where they are absorbed to the stems and leaves (shoots) [Johnson: 2018].  
Secale cereale (rye) is a plant that grows well in much poorer soils than those necessary for most cereal grains.  It is an especially valuable crop in regions where the soil has sand or peat [Mwaja: 1941].  When measuring the root to shoot ratio in rye plants watered with plain water and rye plants watered with a Miracle-Gro/ water solution to increase the nitrogen concentration in the soil, we hypothesized that the rye plants exposed to a greater nitrogen concentration would have a smaller root to shoot ratio than the plants watered with plain water.  We hypothesized this because nitrogen is a major component of chlorophyll which is necessary for photosynthesis, making it critical for a plant’s survival [Novoa: 1981].  The rye plants exposed to an increased concentration of nitrogen through the Miracle-Gro solution do not need as long roots to absorb nitrogen because there is plenty available.  Therefore, the root to shoot ratio would be smaller. 

Materials and Method:
We planted rye plants in soil and watered them every day for two weeks.  The controll group plants were watered with 100 Ml of water while the increased nitrogen concentration plants were watered with a mixture of 50 Ml water and 50 Ml Miracle-Gro, which is 12% by weight nitrogen (Miracle-Gro: 2018).  After two weeks, we harvested ten rye plants from the controll groups by pulling the adherent medium out of the tray.  We gently washed the plants in a container of water and patted them dry with a paper towel.  
We separated the roots from the shoots by cutting each plant apart at the root-shoot junction.  We weighed the shoot and root separately in grams and recorded each value.  We then measured the length of the shoot and root separately in centimeters and recorded each value.  We then calculated the root to shoot ratio and found the average and standard deviation.  This was repeated with ten replicates of rye grown with an increased nitrogen concentration.  We ran an unpaired one-tailed t_test with a 95% confidence interval to compare our results.

Results:
The average root: shoot weight for the rye plants grown with plain water was 1.10 ± 0.28g.  The average root: shoot weight for the rye plants grown with the increased nitrogen concentration was 0.81±0.12g (Figure 1).  Our results for the root: shoot weight between the rye grown with plain water and the rye grown with the Miracle-Gro/ water mixture were significent (t-value= 2.98, d.f.= 18, p_value= 0.00402).  The average root: shoot length for the rye plants grown with plain water was 1.08±0.27 cm.  The average root: shoot length for the rye plants grown with increased nitrogen concentration was 0.87±0.10 cm (Figure 1).  Our results for the root: shoot length between the rye grown with plain water and the rye grown with the Miracle-Gro/ water mixture were significent (t-value= 2.31, d.f.= 18, p= 0.01655).

Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis that the rye plants grown with increased nitrogen concentration would have a smaller root to shoot ratio than the rye plants grown in controll conditions.  Our hypothesis was supported because the rye plants grown with increased nitrogen concentration had a statistically significent smaller root to shoot ratio for both weight and length when compared to the rye plants grown under controll conditions.  In a previous study, Hilbert found that the optimal root to shoot ratio which maximizes relative growth rate is a function of root-specific activity, which is a function of soil nitrogen availability [Hilbert: 1989].  
These results could be due to the limited resource of nitrogen in the controll plants compared to an abundance of nitrogen in the plants watered with the Miracle-Gro/ water mixture.  Since the amount of nitrogen was not limited in the plants watered with the Miracle-Gro/ water mixture, these rye plants did not have to allocate their resources to longer and larger roots to absorb more nitrogen.  This results in a smaller root to shoot ratio.  This can be interpreted based on the previous results of Hilbert’s study of nitrogen concentration and root to shoot ratio which revealed that when nitrogen availability is high, the root to shoot ratio required to produce a high nitrogen concentration in the leaves can be relatively low because of high root specific activity [Hilbert: 1989].  
The plants grown in the controll conditions had a limited amount of nitrogen, so these rye plants had to allocate their resources to longer and larger roots to absorb as much of the nitrogen as possible.  Another study determined that nitrogen nutrition has significent effects on root and shoot relations.  The authors found that nitrogen deficiency increased root surface area, reduced the amount of nitrogen transported to shoot, decreased shoot growth, and resulted in an increased root to shoot ratio [Sangguan: 2003].  These differences demonstrate phenotypic plasticity because the same species of plants (rye) were able to change how they allocate resources based on environmental conditions.
