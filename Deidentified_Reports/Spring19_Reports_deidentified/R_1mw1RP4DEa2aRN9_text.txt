Title: Energy Allocation in Secale cereale: Increase in Soil Salinity Correlates to Longer Roots

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effect of salinity on energy allocation in Secale cereale. The experiment tests if an increase in soil salinity will result in greater root:shoot ratios in plants in order to allocate resources to roots to better uptake water. Root:shoot ratios are accurate measurements of general allocation through relative biomass because they indicate the ability for plants to allocate resources in a specific environment. A group of rye plants were treated to three percent salt water and both the controll and treatment groups grew in sunlight for two weeks with daily watering. The study found that the root:shoot ratios were greater in reference to both mass and length for the plants treated with salt water. The experiment used an unpaired two-sample t_test to determine that the data was significent. The data supported the hypothesis that an increase in salinity will lead to greater root:shoot ratios however it was unclear if this was a result of longer roots or shorter shoots.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates phenotypic plasticity and energy allocation in Secale cereale. Also known as rye, Secale cereale, is a good model organism for this experiment because its biomass can be measured easily which is an accurate indicator of resource allocation in plants. Phenotypic plasticity is when plants change how they allocate resources based on their surroundings [Johnson: 2018]. Allocation strategies are not static and instead change over time as an organism’s environment is constantly evolving [Perrin: 1993]. Both biotic and abiotic factors influence energy allocation [Perrin: 1993]. Biotic factors are living and include competitive species while abiotic factors are not living and include sunlight and soil. Plants can make changes in how they allocate energy to respond to these factors [Perrin: 1993]. For example, plants can increase growth of leaves to increase rate of photosynthesis, grow longer stems to build support, and increase root growth to increase the absorption of nutrients in soil [Johnson: 2018]. General allocation can be measured through relative biomass which indicates the ability of a plant to obtain resources in its environment [Johnson: 2018].
This experiment specifically evaluates the effects of soil salinity on energy allocation in Secale cereale. A high salt concentration in soil as been shown to reduce the ability of plants to acquire water, which is called the osmotic effect of salinity [Machado: 2017]. In a experiment with tomato plants, an increase in the salt concentration of soil was seen to increase the activity of a bacterium that increased the water use efficiency [Mayak: 2004]. This study is an example of an increase in salinity creating a need for a way to increase water absorption. The experiment suggests that that the salinity decreased the plant’s ability to obtain water which is why it allocated energy into the bacterium activity to maintain water absorption. This study suggested that there may be actions within specific plants to allocate resources towards mechanisms that increase the ability to uptake water which relates to allocation method of rye plants. In this specific experiment with rye, the mechanism to allocate resources to obtain water would be the growth of roots that would be able to grow further into soil to access more water. If Secale cereale are treated with three percent salt water then they will have higher root:shoot ratios than the controll plants because they will allocate energy to grow longer roots in an attempt to obtain water.

Materials and Method:
Four pots were filled with vermiculite and 200 Ml of tap water and 100 Ml of miracle grow were added to each pot. After this preparation, 16 holes were made in each pot and two Secale cereale seeds were added to each hole. Two controll pots were watered with 200 Ml of tap water daily for two weeks. Two treatment pots were watered with 200 Ml of three percent salt water daily for two weeks. The plants were allowed to grow in a greenhouse in sunlight. After the two weeks, 10 plants were removed from the controll pots and 10 were removed from the treatment pots. Each plant was cut above the seed to separate the root and shoot. The mass and lengths of the roots and shoots were recorded after the two week period of growth and root:shoot ratios were calculated. The ratios were calculated by dividing the biomass of the root by the biomass of the shoot. An unpaired two-sample t_test was conducted to determine if the results were statistically significent.

Results:
The results showed that the plants treated with salt water had greater root:shoot ratios in reference to both mass and length. Figure 1 shows that the average root:shoot ratio under tap water conditions was 0.647 +/- 0.147 for mass and 0.493 +/- 0.0696 for length. Figure 1 also shows that the average root:shoot ratio under salt water conditions was 3.67 +/- 1.30 for mass and 1.46 +/- 0.389 for length. The mean of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the mass experimental group (t_stat = 7.32, d.f. = 18, p = 4.20E-7). The mean of the controll group was also statistically significently different than that of the length experimental group (t_stat = 7.77, d.f. = 18, p = 1.84E-7).

Discussion:
The data supported the hypothesis which stated that plants treated with three percent salt water would have higher root:shoot ratios. The root:shoot ratios were greater in the treatment plants compared to the controll groups in reference to both mass and length. One possible explanation for this difference would be that the rye plants allocated energy to grow longer and heavier roots in response to salt stress from their environment. However, it is not clear whether the difference in roots results because of longer roots or shorter shoots. Support for the difference resulting from longer roots comes from the fact that salt stress can affect plants through both osmotic and ionic stress. Osmotic stress is when there is a decrease in water availability and this is induced by salt stress through an excess of sodium ions [Sudhir: 2004]. When there is an excess of sodium outside of a cell, water will be pulled out in attempts to balance the ion concentration of sodium in the cell’s environment. This draws water out of the cells and decreases the amount of water available for plants to use in metabolic processes. Ionic stress occurs when there is an excessive accumulation of sodium and chloride which reduces the ability for the cells to take up other nutrients like potassium, calcium, and magnesium that are needed in the cell [Sudhir: 2004]. This excess amount of sodium also has the ability to inactivate enzymes and inhibit metabolic processes in plants [Sudhir: 2004].
Conclusively, salt stress negatively affects the metabolic processes of plants through both osmotic and ionic stress. One way this stress can be reversed is if the plant allocates resources to increase the uptake of water which is possible through root growth. This way, plants are able to attempt to balance the salt stress and maintain a sufficient water uptake. However, since the data cannot explicitly support this explanation through the use of root:shoot ratios future experiments could be conducted to better determine the effects of salinity on resource allocation by isolating roots and comparing their growth in different salt concentrations. This way, the uncertainty surrounding which aspect of the root:shoot ratio could be eliminated and the experiment could determine how salinity affects water uptake through root growth.
