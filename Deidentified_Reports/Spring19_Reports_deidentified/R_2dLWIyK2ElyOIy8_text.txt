Title: The Effect of Tubocurarine on Neuromuscular Control in Rana Papien Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
Every single movement we perform has the muscle involved in it. The well-designed neuromuscular system in all vertebrates and invertebrates plays a crucial role which enables us to function normally as individual organisms. In this experiment, we study the mechanism of neuromuscular control by finding out the effect of tubocurarine, an Acetylcholine antagonist, on the magnitude of muscle response using Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius muscle. We make the hypothesis that the addition of ACh receptor antagonist – tubocurarine – will decrease the magnitude of response in the muscle.   We give the same electric stimulus to the gastrocnemius muscles on the three frog legs both under the normal situation and after injecting tubocurarine into the muscle. Our hypothesis is supported by statistically significant data and the magnitudes of muscle response prior to and after the injection show changes that are visible to naked eyes. Studying the effect of tubocurarine on skeletal muscle is meaningful, since only when we understand the mechanism between this are we able to use tubocurarine in clinical area such as anesthesia. 

Introduction:
In this experiment, we study the mechanism of neuromuscular control by evaluating the effect of ACh receptor antagonist – tubocurarine – on the magnitude of muscle response on Rana Pipiens’ gastrocnemius muscle. The reason we pick frog legs is that they are easy to access and the gastrocnemius muscle on Rana Pipiens are easier to prepare for the experiment comparing to the other animals. We are trying to answer the question of how does ACh receptor antagonist affect the magnitude of response in the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana Pipiens?  We will be using an analyze software called iWorx to analyze the muscle response magnitude by looking at the myogram generated. [Johnson: 2018]. For both vertebrate and invertebrate animals, the skeletal muscles all consist of myofibers and innervated by motor neurons [Johnson: 2018]. The axons of motor neurons extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate individual myofibers. And the points where the motor neurons branch out are called neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. Acetylcholine (ACh), a type of neurotransmitter, is released as the result of the arrival of the nerve impulse. The binding of ACh to the receptors on the muscle site causes sodium channels to open and generates the muscle’s own action potential. [Johnson: 2018]. Calcium ions are then released into the muscle cell cytoplasm as the action potential spread; through binding with the protein troponin and cause a series of reaction that leads to muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018].  Such action of the muscle cells is recorded on myogram by attaching muscle to a force transducer and measure the force generated in a given time [Johnson: 2018]. On the myogram, three typical stages of a myogram are expected: latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period. The latent period is a short period of time before the contraction period, it allows the twitches to go unidirectionally [Johnson: 2018]. The contraction and relaxation periods change length according to the usage of the muscle at the time. One brief contraction of the muscle makes a muscle twitch, and the summation of muscle brings greater muscle force. [Johnson: 2018]. Some substances can act on neurotransmitter and change the contraction pattern, and tubocurarine is one of those. Tubocurarine is not new to human life, it has been used for hunting by Amazon natives and for anesthesia during surgery. Ball and Westhorpe talk about a historical example of how tubocurarine was used as an anesthetic in their publication – “Anesthesia and Intensive Care”: Burroughs Wellcome began manufacturing ampoules with tubocurarine, registered under the name “Tubarinc”. In March the following year, over a thousand cases anesthetized with tubocurarine were reported to the Royal Society of Medicine [Ball: 2005]. Understanding the mechanism of tubocurarine acting on muscle can help us utilize this chemical better in the clinic and maybe medicine research area. And to answer the biological question mentioned earlier, we hypothesize that the addition of ACh receptor antagonist – tubocurarine – will decrease the magnitude of response in the muscle.   

Materials and Methods:
Firstly, we degloved all the Rana Pipien legs – simply added pressure to the skin and it should come off easily. We pulled a little harder at the knee part to separate the connective tissue. Since we performed the stimulation directly on the gastrocnemius muscle but not the sciatic nerve, we let the thigh muscle remained what it was and didn’t let the sciatic nerve expose out. Next, we detached the gastrocnemius muscle from the bone. Pressing on the gastrocnemius muscle would expose a gap between it and the bone. We glided the scissor tip in between the gap and moved it back and forth to clear up the connective tissue. We cut off the Achilles tendon towards the toe, we left a small section of the tendon, so we could attach the string on it and hang the gastrocnemius muscle up. The gastrocnemius muscle was suspended perpendicular to the tray on the tensioner. We also used pins to stabilize the leg by pinning it near the knee bone on the tray. The precision tensioner was used to make a fine adjustment to the hanging tension and angle. We wanted to make sure that the gastrocnemius muscle was hang up slightly stretched but not too tight. This finished the set-up of the experiment, and the same process was repeated for all three Rana Pipiens legs. Next, we set up the iWorx with the leg muscle by attaching the bipolar stimulation needles onto the muscle – make sure the needles were inserted but not piercing through the muscle. iWorx, the software used to generate myograms, was downloaded prior to the experiment to measure the response level of each gastrocnemius muscle.  From the laptop end, we determined the level of stimulus given to the muscle which was 0.5V. Data needed to be recorded each time a stimulus is given to the gastrocnemius muscle. After this, we injected tubocurarine into the muscle using a syringe. The same amount of tubocurarine (0.1ml) was injected every single time on the three Rana Pipiens legs. We avoided piercing through the muscle while injecting all the tubocurarine into the muscle. We waited 5 minutes after the injection of tubocurarine and then adjusted the tension by turning the dial one round counterclockwise to keep the experiment isotonic. Three stimuli at 0.5V are given to each individual Rana Pipiens leg and the data was recorded to take the average. After that, we performed the exact same steps (stimulated the muscle with 0.5V stimulus using iWorx) on the tubocurarine-injected muscle. We repeated the same process on all three Rana Pipiens legs. Finally, a paired t-test was used to analyze the data (average of the magnitude of response). We ran the test to check if the p-value approves statistical significance. 

Results:
All three Rana Pipiens legs showed less response to the stimulus after tubocurarine had been injected. And Figure 1 is a visual presentation for the data and trend of change. Control 1 (C1) individual had an average of the magnitude of response of 0.246 while Experiment 1 (E1) had an average of the magnitude of response of 0.158. C2 had an average of the magnitude of response of 0.216 and E2 had an average of the magnitude of response of 0.090. This same measure appeared to be 0.105 for C3 and 0.008 for E3. The magnitude of response in different trials are very close to the average with small standard deviation value (in the order mentioned: 0.002, 0.030, 0.013, 0.006, 0.006, 0.001). We used a paired t-test to analyze the data and got a p-value of 0.0120.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that “that the addition of ACh receptor antagonist – tubocurarine – will decrease the magnitude of response in the muscle”, was supported. The t-value proved the data to be statistically significant. The control group results and experimental group results indicated difference among the magnitudes the Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius muscles responded to the stimulus.  From direct observation, we were able to see how the gastrocnemius muscle contracted forcefully before the injection of tubocurarine and how the muscle only appeared to shake or twitch a little bit. We made the conclusion that there is a negative correlation between muscle response magnitude and the amount of tubocurarine, which is an ACh Antagonist, in the tissue. In another experiment that studies the contracture responses induced by acetylcholine and Choline, the author went into more detail describing the reaction observed. D-Tubocurarine can induce tonic fibers to contract and response slower at summation [Katina: 2008]. Our specific numeral data may not match the result in this experiment, but they all revealed the same general trend. Understanding how neurotransmitter antagonists work can help us reason through how we get the experimental result. Antagonist works by blocking the receptors so the natural neurotransmitter (in this case the Acetylcholine) can no longer attach to the receptor site and bring further actions [Sadava: 2017]. An agonist is another substance that can change the normal function of natural neurotransmitters. However, different from antagonists, the agonists mimic the effect of natural neurotransmitters by binding to the receptor sites and keep the receptors activated [Sadava: 2017]. Tubocurarine, in this experiment, weakened the effect of ACh, therefore, lowered the magnitude of response of the Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius muscle. A similar experiment performed on cultured skeletal muscle provided the corresponding result: d-Tubocurarine competitively antagonized the cholinomimetic response [Harvey: 1974]. Some error factors that might affect the result exist. There was a small amount of air mixed in the syringe when we were injecting tubocurarine into the muscle. The air in the syringe takes up space which ought to be filled with tubocurarine, and less tubocurarine is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. Therefore, the amount of tubocurarine injected each time is not exactly the same, which becomes a factor contributing to differences among the magnitudes of response. To minimize the distraction of weight change after tubocurarine was injected, we did turn the dial and adjusted the tightness of the string. This, however, may not fully eliminate all error caused by gravity. For further experiment, we can choose frog legs more similar in size to perform the experiment on to increase accuracy. More frog legs can also be used to achieve the same thing. The experiment can also be extended on learning how different dosages of tubocurarine would affect muscle response. Tubocurarine has been used as an anesthetic for hunting, surgery, and even treatment to smoking withdraw syndrome in the past. However, it lost its popularity in medical and clinic area because the dosage is hard to control. Therefore, altering the experiment to studying the relationship between dosages of tubocurarine and muscle response can be very meaningful. Tubocurarine is very useful, and all we need to do is to find a safer usage.
