Title: The Effect of Ca2+ Blockers on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to internal and external changes in environment. Studying the change in nerve response due to an environmental factor is necessary to understand the conditions that nerve impulses fire best in and what conditions will inhibit their functions. It is important to understand how hormones will affect the response of nerve impulses so that they may be monitored and manipulated to produce optimal outcomes in other scientific research or in other medical studies. Here, we look at the effect of a calcium channel blocker on the strength of a nerve impulse in the Rania Pipens. The expectation was that the calcium channel blocker would cause a significent decrease in the strength of the neural impulse in the Rania Pipens leg compared to the neural response of the frog leg without any calcium channel blocker present. Our data showed that there was a significent decrease in neural response in the frog legs that had been injected with calcium channel blocker. This data suggests that the calcium plays a significent role in the excitation of muscles contraction and neural impulses. This knowledge may be used to better understand muscle contraction and the environment in which they function most efficiently. 

Introduction:
Nerve communications are extremely intricate and complex, controllling the movement of muscles through the entire body. Skeletal muscles are activated by motor neurons, located in the spinal cord. Axons of motor neurons extend into the muscle and then branch into the myofibrils, known as neuromuscular junctions. A nerve stimulates muscle contraction through a process called excitation-contraction coupling [Rios and Pizzaro: 1991]. The action potential travels along the axon to arrive at the neuromuscular junction. Next, depolarization of the neuron causes release of the hormone acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Then, ACh binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening the sodium channels [Jo: 1995]. Finally, after the release of calcium the muscle contracts and the sliding filament theory causes contraction. However, without the release of calcium, ryanodine sites are not exposed, and actin and myosin cannot bond [Huxley: 2004]. Without calcium, myosin heads and actin are never able to bond together, and no contraction is observed. Physical conditions in and around the muscle will affect how it contracts. One short contraction is called a twitch, which is not very useful to the body, however it is what the experiment uses to measure neural impulses [Hill: 1951]. Nerves and muscles are subdivided into of many hundreds of smaller functional elements called motor units. A motor unit is defined as a single motor axon plus all of the myofibers that have neuromuscular junctions with that axon. A motor unit cannot exert maximal contractile force forever. If a muscle is stimulated for long enough, eventually it will run out of ATP, and the actin and myosin cross-bridges will begin to separate. As a result, the muscle will begin to relax again. This process is called fatigue [Enoka and Stuart: 1992]. Without all of the moving parts listed above actin in unison, muscle contraction does not occur, and the organism will die. Since the Rania Pipens species has a very clear gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve it is an optimal test subject for this experiment. The Rania Pipens has very strong, developed leg muscles for jumping and mobility, making the gastrocnemus large and easy to inject with the calcium channel blocker. The Rania Pipens frog leg will be injected with calcium blocker and the strength of the contraction of the muscle will be monitored. Based on pervious findings and background knowledge, we hypothesized that if the calcium blocker is injected into the frog leg, then contraction will be inhibited.

Materials and Method:
Three Rania Pipens legs were originally selected, the gastrocnemus muscles were separated, and the sciatic nerve was identified. The legs were then connected to a lab scribe stimulating device for reading. The myogram was used to record the amount of force generated in each contraction over a given time. Each leg was stimulated three times without any calcium blocker. The controll groups used were the same organisms as the testing group, simply before any blocker was injected into them. A predetermined stimulus of 500 mV was used to stimulate the frog leg for each trial run of the experiment. When the legs were injected with blocker, .01Ml of 4mM lanthanum chloride Ca2+ blocker was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of each frog leg. The stimulus of each contraction was recorded in mV for the three muscles before and after the blocker was injected into the muscle. A paired t_test was used to interpret the results of the experiment. 

Results:
The mean strength of the stimulus of the contraction in the frog legs before the calcium blocker was injected was 513 mV, while the calcium blocker injected group had an average strength of 62 mV. The standard deviation for the controll group of the Rania Pipens was 27.01 mV and the standard deviation for the test group was 32.4 mV. The standard error for the controll group was 5.20 mV and the standard error in the calcium blocker-injected group was 5.69 mV. The data is as follows (t_stat = 11.047291, d.f. = 2, P = 0.008095) While contractions were observed in both groups, the strength of the contractions in the calcium injected group were significently smaller than the contractions in the controll group. The trend observed in figure one supports this claim, as the controll group demonstrates significently higher amplitude than the experimental group.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that there would be a significent decrease in the strength of the muscle response in the muscles injected with calcium blocker, was supported. The low p_value (less than .05) suggests that there is, in fact, a significent statistical difference in the difference in muscle response between the controll and testing groups. A significent decrease in muscle twitch was observed after the calcium blocker was injected into the muscle. During some test runs, the twitch was not even visible to the naked eye and could only be detected on computer software. This suggests that other environmental factors did not contribute to the strength of the muscle response, and the calcium blocker alone, played a significent role in the decrease of the strength of the muscle twitch. Additionally, a past study further supported that calcium is necessary for muscle contraction. The study supported the sliding filament theory that without calcium the actin and myosin would never be able to bond together and the contraction wouldn’t occur [Melzer et al.: 1995]. The findings from the study are consistent with the results from the experiment conducted in lab using the Rania Pipens. This further proves that calcium plays a crucial role in muscle contraction. Demonstrating the role that calcium plays in muscle contraction will help scientist better understand the crucial, yet delicate and temperate way environmental factors can affect muscle contraction.
