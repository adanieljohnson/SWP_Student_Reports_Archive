Title: The Effect of Salt Water on the Resource Allocation of Rye Plants

Abstract:
Plants’ phenotypes are determined by genotype and environment. Because there is a limit to the amount of usable resources, plants must allocate their resources in order to survive. We tested how rye, Secale cereale, would change its phenotype by allocating resources. We observed this by comparing the root: shoot ratios of the length and weight of two groups of plants, a salt water group and a tap water group. We predicted that the salinity of the saltwater will dehydrate the plants and cause them to grow longer roots in search of nutrients, so the root: shoot ratio will be larger in the plants given salt water for both weight and length. The root: shoot ratio for the weight and the length were significantly different between the plants grown in tap water and the plants grown in salt water. Our results compare similarly to other studies which show little growth of plants grown in salt water.

Introduction:
	In nature, plants and animals must interact with and adapt to biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors are environmental stimuli that originate from other organisms whereas abiotic factors come from non-living sources [Johnson: 2018]. Many interactions are shaped by the need to obtain essential resources. Because there is a limit to the amount of usable resources, plants must make certain trade-offs [Johnson: 2018]. Plants do this because they need to use some of their resources in order to extract other resources.  The pattern for this behavior is known as resource allocation [Johnson: 2018]. Plants can modify their allocation pattern to adapt to biotic and abiotic conditions. The leaves and stems of a plant make up the plant’s shoots which are the source of carbon compounds derived from photosynthesis. The sugars derived from photosynthesis are required for metabolism. The roots anchor the plant in the soil and are essential for absorbing nutrients. This means that the growth pattern changes over time with response to the world around them. Plants adjust their root: shoot ratio when allocating for certain resources. Based off this information, plants in a very dry environment tend to grow deep roots to reach water deep below the surface [Johnson: 2018]. Environments can become dry by having too much salt or similar sediments in the soil, and this is a major factor limiting plant growth and productivity [Parida: 2005]. Plants, without a salinity tolerance, grow more slowly and are, therefore, have stunted growth due to salt in the soil [Bernstein: 1975]. The effect of salinity is the most serious threat to agriculture because it causes plant death due to the fact that the plants cannot get enough water [Parida: 2005]. Other research has shown that some salt-affected plants may not show any distinctive symptoms, and only when they are compared with normal plants is the extent of the effect of salt clear [Bernstein: 1975]. Based on this research, we were sure to include a control group in order to observe the difference salt water has on plant growth.
	In this experiment, we used a species of plant called rye, Secale cereale. Rye is a grain that grows well in poorer soils, like those with sand in them. Based off this, it would make sense that rye would grow slightly better in a salty soil than some other plants. For this experiment, we tested how rye plants would change their phenotype by allocating their resources in order to get nutrients they needed. We observed this by calculating and comparing the root: shoot ratios of the length and weight of our two different groups of plants. Due to prior research and phenotypic plasticity, we predict that the salinity of the saltwater will dehydrate the plants and cause them to allocate their resources towards growing longer roots in search of water, so the root: shoot ratio will be larger in the plants given salt water for both weight and length. 

Materials and Methods:
	 First, four pods were filled with vermiculite and added 200 mL of water and 100 mL of mir gro to each pot. About 16 holes were poked in each pod and added two seeds to each hole. The pods were watered daily for two weeks. Each day 100 mL of tap water was added to our control plants and 100 mL of 3% salt water to the control plants. After two weeks, the rye was harvested by carefully pulling plants with adherent medium out of the tray. We broke apart the vermiculite to separate the roots, then gently washed the plants in a container of water and patted them dry with a paper towel. We separated the roots from the shoots by cutting each plant apart at the root-shoot junction just above the seed. Next, the shoots and roots were weighed separately, and the data was recorded in excel. We then measured the maximum shoot length and root length to the nearest millimeter and recorded the mean value for each group in excel. We used those values to find the ratio of root to shoot of the plants. We used a unpaired two-tailed t-test to determine the significance of our results. 

Results:
	We recorded a mean root to shoot ratio for the weight of the tap water plants to be 0.65 ± 0.147 g. For the experimental plants, we recorded an average weight of 3.67 ± 1.29 g. We found that there was a significant difference between these two groups for weight (weight: t-stat=7.32, df=18, P= 8.44 x 10-7). The mean root to shoot ratio for the length of the tap water plants was 0.49 ± 0.069 cm. We recorded a mean root to shoot ratio for the length of the salt water plants to be 1.47 ± 0.389 g. We determined that there was also a significant difference for the results we obtained for length between the control and experimental groups. (length t-stat=7.77, df=18, P =3.68 x 10-7). The difference in average root: shoot ratios for length and weight can be observed through Figure 1. 

Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis that the root: shoot ratio will be larger in the plants given salt water for both weight and length. Other studies have shown that salt causes plants to grow slow and become stunted [Bernstein: 1975].  Our results were similar to other studies, for we did not see much growth in our experimental plants given salt water. Because plants absorb water and nutrients through the roots, we expected the dehydrated plants to grow longer roots in search of water and nutrients by allocating their resources. Since the control plants were given tap water, they were able to grow tall and evenly making the root: shoot ratio fairly small. This is supported by the small averages of the root: shoot ratio for the weight and length of the tap water plants (Figure 1). Water is crucial for the survival of plants, so allocating resources towards finding water is essential for growth. Some plants are capable of surviving in salt-affected soils however because they have a tolerance to the salinity [Bernstein: 1975]. Plants like, tolerant grasses and legumes, can correct soil structure in partially damaged soils through action by their roots [Bernstein: 1975]. However, a previous research study suggests rye to be in the salt-tolerant category of plants [Francois: 1989]. This could explain why we were able to see growth in our plants over the two-week period instead of dead plants. The tolerance that rye plants have allowed us to have enough data to obtain results, but not so tolerant as to hinder the experiment.  Additionally, other research suggests that a small concentration of salt can actually improve certain plant growth, with only a few exceptions [Magistad: 1943]. The next step in this study could be to test what types of plants have more or less of a tolerance to salt in the soil because that tolerance could affect growth and therefore manipulate the root: shoot ratio for the length and weight. This experiment supports that salinity hinders plant growth, but a future study could also test whether a specific, smaller concentration of salt water would actually improve growth like some studies have found in the past.
