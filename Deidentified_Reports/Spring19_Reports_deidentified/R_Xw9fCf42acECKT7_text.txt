Title: Betta Splendins have a decrease in agnostic behavioral responses in the presence of food and other males

Abstract:
The underlying concept of this experiment is observing animal behaviors and their different reactions to stimuli and whether metabolic cost or habituation play a role in an animal’s responses. The cost can be applied to any animal as every response to stimuli come with a cost. Food was chosen as a stimulus because the food will make an organism think whether the metabolic cost of the response is equal or less considering the reward is food. The species chosen were the Betta Splendins because of their agnostic behavior towards stimuli. The two different setups to test our hypothesis was starting with food and then no food after rest, both in the presence of a male, and the other set up was without food first and then with food, again both with male present. The data recorded was the duration of their agnostic behaviors such as pelvic fin flickering and showing the red mane. Due to the preference of food, the betta’s agnostic behavior to each other decreased, thus making the cost of the response towards the food worth the effort. With those results, the hypothesis was not supported significently; however, the results are important because since food increases agnostic behavior in bettas then applying that stimuli to other animals to see if their behaviors are affected is valuable.

Introduction:
Animal behaviors have been studied for a long time are a very important aspect of the animal kingdom due to the many different species and the complex and changing environments that they live in. Behaviors are a resultant of an organism being exposed to a stimulus, which can be an organism or an event that evokes a specific functional reaction in an organ or tissue. The specific behaviors we choose to focus on were the red mane or opercular flaring and the pelvic fin flickering because both are very aggressive, with the red mane being the most aggressive. These responses are also very noticeable reactions so recording the time spent exhibiting the behavior. The species being observed in the lab are the betta fish or Betta Splendins. They are excellent specimens for experiments detailing aggressive behavior because they are both a common fish as well as they exhibit multiple obvious behavioral responses. When in the presence of another male Betta Splendins exhibit aggressive or agnostic behaviors, which can be observed by their fins and movements. When exposed to different stimuli Bettas Splendins exhibit usually aggressive behavioral response but over time the fish are affected by habituation and due to the habituation of the Betta Splendins, they will prioritize their energy rather than fighting [Castro, 2006]. The study of Rhoad, Kalat, and Klopfer also show that over time Betta Splendins due tend to decrease their aggressive behavior towards others with the presence of different stimuli. The results of this study could be important to the results of the proposed experiment because the Betta Splendins might choose to go for the food rather than fight [Rhoad 1975]. The cost of fighting is the main cause for animals choosing to fight or not and in this case between the Betta Splendins the cost is metabolic only as they cannot physically hurt each other in the experiment. The cost is the reason why the fish might choose not to fight. Also, the metabolic cost is very connected to habituation because if the organism has been exposed to exhibiting aggression so many times then they will consider not being aggressive so conserve their resources. With the stimulus present, the Betta Splendins will consider there is food to be fought over and thus choose to exert more energy to obtain and protect the food from the other male. My hypothesis for the experiment is that with the introduction of food, the Betta Splendins will exhibit more aggressive behavior than without food because they will choose to expend energy in order to have complete controll over the food they are provided with. 

Materials and Method:
The experiment had eight trials all of which had two male Betta Splendins that were either exposed to food first or not for five minutes and then five minutes of rest in between. We observed what the Betta Splendins’ reactions to food alone was like to establish a baseline and to make sure the observed behaviors were truly aggressive. We then took two different tanks which had both an opaque and glass partition. For this experiment we choose to only remove the opaque partition, so the behaviors of the fish were uninterrupted. Four of the trials started with Betta Splendins exposed to food first for five minutes with their behaviors recorded and then five minutes without food. The other four trials started without food first for five minutes, and then they were exposed to food for five minutes after. We recorded their aggressive behavior by timing the duration of the exhibited aggressive behavior. We choose two behaviors to record which were the red mane or opercular flaring and the pelvic fin flickering. We also choose to multiply the time spent flaring the operculum by two because that behavior is considered more aggressive than pelvic fin flickering. For consistency, the fish were fed around the same amount of food each time and we had one tank for food and one without food so that there was no food at all for the trials without food. All the data for the trials without food first and with food first were separated and we calculated the means and standard deviation. To portray the results of the experiment the statistical test chosen to compare the data was a paired t_test which tests whether the mean difference in the pairs is different from 0.

Results:
In figure 1 below, the data collected is displayed in graphs detailing the differences in means with the standard deviation applied. The mean time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior for the trials without food first was higher than the mean time for the group with food first. (with food first: 178.7, ±130.7, without food first: 260.4, ±130.9) [Figure 1]. The data for fish four was omitted in the results because in both cases the time was zero. The results show that the group without food first had a significent difference between the other group allowing for the interpretation to be significent (t_stat = 1.65, d.f. = 7, P = 0.15).

Discussion:
The hypothesis proposed for the lab was shown to be not supported by the statics of the paired t_test. The Betta Splendins without food exhibited more aggressive behavior for a longer duration of time compared to the time of the Betta Splendins with food first. The results are understandable because during the trials with the food, there was some aggressive behavior present, but on most occasions the Betta Splendins were distracted by the food. In a study by Bols and Hogan, when comparing food and aggressive display as reinforcers the Betta Splendins would prefer to go for the food and eat it rather than act aggressive towards the other male Betta Splenden, which means that food is inherently more attractive than the sight of another male fish [Bols 1979]. The results of Bols’ experiment relate to that this lab because in both the aggressive displays from another male are a weaker reinforcer than food. The Betta Splendins’ focus on the food actually makes sense because if they are not really threatened by the other male, they will go for the food. The findings also display that they fish might consider the metabolic cost to fighting and that the food outweighs the instinct to fighting the male. Over time, the fish will become habituated and conditioned to go for food rather than fighting due to the partition between them and just being exposed to each other so many times, meaning the threat is not worth the effort or the cost. The results could be due to some limiting factors such as there being a little bit of food present in the tank without food. The presence of food was due to the switching of the Betta Splendins from the food tank to the non-food tank. Also, the imprecise timing of the aggressive behavior could allow for some error within the calculation of the total response time. The evolutionary consequences of aggression for Betta Splendins are that since they are so territorial and aggressive all the time that soon they will become habituated into not fighting and expending so much energy as much. The decrease in aggression and conditioning will help them conserve energy but will eventually lead to the loss of territory to other males that do not learn, because Betta Splendins fight over territory. In the future, the experiment could be improved by adding more trials and seeing how male Betta Splendins act with food in the presence of a female. By adding the female into the experimental equation, the results might show how the males’ responses to the food might change if there is the possibility to mate rather than eat food.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This graph represents the means of the time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior. The two groups are the group with food first and the second group without food first. The error bar for the group with food first ±130.7 and the error bar for the group without food first was ±130.9, these error bars represent the difference between the recorded times. The results of the paired t_test show that the group without food first was statistically different than the other group. (t_stat = 1.65, d.f. = 7, P = 0.15).
