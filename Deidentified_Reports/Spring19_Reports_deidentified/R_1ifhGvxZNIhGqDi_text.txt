Title: Effects of intramuscular creatine injections on the stimulus threshold of frog legs

Abstract:
Several bodybuilders and athletes use creatine monohydrate to increase muscle mass and improve muscular power. Muscle contractions allow a body to move. If a person uses creatine, which increases muscle mass by increasing water retention, then they need more stimuli for muscle movement. Therefore, it was believed that muscles supplemented with creatine would have a different stimulus threshold than before supplementation. Since muscular complexes of most vertebrates are similar, frog legs were used in this study, which focused on stimulation of the gastrocnemus muscle via the sciatic nerve. Despite believing a correlation between creatine supplementation and stimulus threshold, our data showed no significent difference in the average threshold between controll and experimental tests. This may suggest that either use of creatine is not associated with stimulus threshold. Though research shows that creatine affects muscle structure, our study revealed that stimulus threshold as a variable is independent from direct creatine supplementation.

Introduction:
Muscle movement is possible because the brain sends signals via the nervous system to controll muscle contraction in a process called excitation-contraction coupling. The amount of muscle mass an organism has is proportional to the number of signals needed to use their muscles. In the experimental study, neuromuscular system signaling is investigated. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, skeletal muscle is essential for movement. Such movement is orchestrated by several muscular contractions, which are triggered by signals in the body. The nerve impulses from the brain travel through nerves and trigger the release of several chemicals to initiate muscular responses. The process is called excitation-contraction coupling. In skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction coupling involves near-instantaneous signal transduction by the depolarization of sarcolemmal membranes. This is mediated by specific proteins association at receptor sites to controll channel openings, ultimately causing a temporary rise in calcium ions, and thus activating muscle contraction [Heiny: 2012]. The faintest stimulus able to spur an action potential in a neuron and cause a contraction, or twitch, is called a threshold stimulus. Existing knowledge from previous biological research suggests that exposure of certain compounds to the neuromuscular system can influence an organism’s twitch threshold. The focus of this experiment is to test the effect of creatine monohydrate, a chemical compound, on the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle in a frog (Rania pipiens) leg. In humans, creatine monohydrate supplementation increases muscle water retention and mass through increased intracellular osmotic pressure. Higher creatine concentrations are also believed to improve muscular performance by decreasing rate of fatigue [Powers: 2003]. We hypothesized that if a creatine monohydrate solution is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg and given time to diffuse, then the sample’s threshold stimulus will be noticeably higher or lower due to an increased level of intramuscular water mass or decreased rate of fatigue, which studies indicate causes increased contraction performance.

Materials and Method:
The study began with 3 amputated frog legs from different frogs of the same species. These legs, which were assumed to all be harvested from healthy, active frogs, were each used for two tests, serving as both controlls and experimental samples in three trials. For each leg, the controll test was performed first and was followed by the experimental test. Before each trial, the skin on the leg was removed with a scalpel and surgical scissors. Then, the gastrocnemus muscle was snipped at the posterior head and the sciatic nerve was exposed by cutting away connective tissue with the scalpel. The free end of the gastrocnemus muscle was tied with a string to a fixed arm on an overhanging structure. The string was tightened until it was moderately taught. Next the sciatic nerve was attached to electrode prongs, which was connected to a computer program that allowed us to send stimuli starting at 0.01 mV and was increased until the recorded threshold value was reached. Each trial was conducted the same way except that the experimental test had an extra step, which was a 3 Ml injection of creatine solution into the gastrocnemus muscle and allowed 5 minutes to diffuse.  A two-sample two-tailed t_test was used for statistical analysis with a cutoff value of 0.05.

Results:
The mean threshold of the controll tests was 0.090 mV and the mean threshold of the experimental tests was 0.106 mV (Fig.1). The standard deviation for stimulus threshold in the controll tests was 0.120 mV and the standard deviation for threshold in the experimental tests was 0.165 mV (Fig.1). The mean threshold of the controll tests was statistically not significently different than that of the experimental tests (t_stat = 0.281, d.f. = 4, P = 0.792). As a result of this experiment, both the controll and experimental tests had roughly the same average threshold value (Fig.1). Overall, the controll and the experimental tests had almost the exact same responses to stimuli regardless of creatine injections.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that intramuscular creatine monohydrate injections would either cause increased muscle mass, or decrease tetany rate, thus altering stimulus threshold values in frog gastrocnemus muscles was not supported. We observed no significent difference at the .05 level, which suggests that, due to chance, the use of creatine injections to change muscular contraction ability was not supported by the data and. Additionally, past investigations have found that a creatine supplementation does result in increased muscular water retention but not necessarily immediate improvement in muscle contraction ability [Powers: 2003]. While this insight lacks evidence for improved muscular performance due to creatine, the research supports our hypothesis that muscle mass could be increased. This should’ve caused the experimental thresholds to be substantially lower due to more stimulus being required to reach twitch for more muscle mass. That is because the ability for muscle fibers to contract relies on stimuli provided by the excitation-contraction coupling process [Heiny: 2012]. According to our statistical analysis, we can accept the null hypothesis and reject the alternate hypothesis. If the experiment was to be repeated, instead of injecting creatine into frog legs post-mortem, live frogs should be supplemented with creatine for several days before harvesting their legs. This would allow time for the body to naturally facilitate the creatine supplement and alter their muscular structure, thus potentially resulting in higher threshold values. Despite biological knowledge that creatine can affect muscular structure and potentially contractile capability, the results indicate that these effects are not associated with the magnitude of stimulus thresholds.
