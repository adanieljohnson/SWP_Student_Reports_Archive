Title: The Effect of Low Ambient Temperatures on Intraspecific Behavior in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Intraspecific behaviors are displays between the members of a single species. Betta splendens exhibit aggressive intraspecific behaviors in the form of interactions called facing and broadside movements. The purpose of this experiment was to understand the effect of low ambient temperatures on the intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendens. It was hypothesized that if water temperature was lowered then Betta splendens would demonstrate lower rates of aggressive intraspecific behavior. A control group was set up with two pairs of male fish in room-temperature water to determine the duration of aggressive behavior in a five-minute period. The procedure was repeated for the same four fish in an experimental 11-degrees Celsius aquarium. Experimental groups showed lower aggressive display durations than the control group. The data was found to be significant as the control durations were longer. 

Introduction:
Interspecific behavior describes the interactions between different species while intraspecific behavior describes the behavior only exhibited between members of the same species. A model organism for intraspecific behavior is the Siamese fighting fish: Betta splendens. Betta splendens is a model organism as they exhibit agonistic behavior when near each other and do so in obvious and colorful displays including exposing their branchiostegal membranes (red mane), broadside movements, and facing movements. These behaviors are nearly immediate when male Betta splendens are near each other. [Johnson: 2017]. A previous study evaluated the metabolic rates of Atlantic salmon during times of fluctuating sea temperatures. The study concluded that lower metabolic rates can be attributed colder sea temperatures [Enders & Boisclair: 2016]. Being ectotherms, Betta splendens cannot maintain their own body temperature and are subject to the ambient temperature. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of low ambient temperature on Betta splendens and its effect on intraspecific behavior. It was hypothesized that if ambient temperature is reduced then intraspecific agonistic behaviors will decrease in duration.  

Materials and Methods:
To test this hypothesis, four male Betta splendens were obtained. For the control group, the four male Betta splendens were placed in 4 separate small divisions of an aquarium filled with 17-degrees Celsius water. The fish were separated with opaque plastic barriers so that they could not see each other. The partition was then removed from between the first pair of fish. Once able to see each other, the fish started to display the aggressive red mane behavior (defined as the extension of the red branchiostegal membranes) and a timer was started (one for each fish) to determine the duration of the behavior in seconds. The timer was stopped if the fish stopped displaying the red mane and restarted if it were to show it again. After five minutes, the fish were then separated, and the opaque partition replaced. The fish were then allowed to rest for five minutes. This procedure was consequently repeated for second pair of fish in the control group. For the experimental group, the same two pairs of fish were utilized to ensure consistent data collection. After sufficient rest, the four fish were placed into 11-degrees Celsius water and allowed to acclimate for 10 minutes. The same procedure used for the control group was then used for the experimental with the lower water temperature. The data was then averaged and statistically tested for significance using a paired t-test utilizing an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
The control group frequently displayed aggressive behavior and had an average display time of 204.8 ± 39.64 seconds. The experimental group infrequently displayed aggressive behavior and had an average display time of 56.41 ± 50.12 seconds (Figure 1) (t=5.2, df=3, p=1.4E-2). 

Discussion:
The biological hypothesis in this experiment was supported. The average duration of aggressive behavior in the experimental groups was lower than that of the control group and was statistically significant. An explanation for these results is that a decrease in ambient temperature also decreased the metabolic rate of the Betta splendens. A decrease in metabolic rate may explain the decrease in intraspecific behavior of the experimental group. In water, fish are subject to the changing ambient temperatures of the water they live in therefore if the temperature decreases their metabolic rates will decreased causing a reduction in all activity [Enders & Boisclair: 2016]. It is advantageous for the fish to not display aggressive behavior or to fight in lower temperatures as it conserves necessary energy that is not as readily available as it is at higher temperatures. These findings are consistent with a previous study analyzing the activity levels of ectothermic beetles in various ambient temperatures. The article indicated that at lower temperatures the beetles demonstrated lower rates of activity when compared to rates of activity at higher temperatures [Morgan: 1985]. Future areas for study could include calculating the specific metabolic rates of Betta splendens at various temperatures while monitoring intraspecific behavior.
