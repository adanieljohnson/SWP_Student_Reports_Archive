Title: The Effect of Caffeine on Amplitude of Contraction of Rania Pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
Caffeine increases calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing contraction in muscles. The purpose of this lab is to determine the effects of caffeine on the amplitude of contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens frogs. A series of three stimuli at a voltage of 1.0 with and without caffeine, and the amplitude of muscle contraction was recorded using a myogram. The hypothesis, that the amplitude of contraction would increase in the presence of caffeine, was not supported, as no significent difference was found using a paired t_test.

Introduction:
Caffeine is used by athletes to enhance their performance. This lab determines the effects of caffeine on muscle contraction and may provide evidence that caffeine enhances athletic performance if its presence increases the amplitude of muscle contraction. A previous study demonstrated that caffeine caused increased calcium release in frog legs, stimulating stronger contractions [Weber: 1968]. Muscles are controllled by nerves. When an action potential moves down the axon of a nerve, it causes calcium ions to flood into the axon terminal of the nerve, resulting in the release of Acetylcholine from the synapse, where it binds to an acetylcholine receptor on the muscle. In the muscle, acetylcholine binding causes the DHP receptor to unbind from the ryanodine receptor, triggering calcium ions to flood out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and into the muscle. Ca2+ then binds to troponin, exposing the actin binding site on myosin and resulting in muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. A muscle and also be stimulated on its own by applying an action potential directly to the muscle itself. Our subject will be a frog leg from a Rania pipiens frog, which is of the order anura and class amphibia. Rania pipiens are typically 11 cm in length. The gastrocnemus is stimulated by the sciatic nerve, but we will apply a stimulus directly to the muscle. If caffeine is present in the gastrocnemus muscle, then the amplitude of the muscle will increase because more calcium will be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in stronger muscle contractions, and the muscle will eventually reach tetany. 

Materials and Method:
 In this experiment, we tested the response of the gastrocnemus muscle in the presence of caffeine by recording the frequency of the gastrocnemus muscle when injected with caffeine. Caffeine stimulates calcium release in muscles. The experiment required three Rania pipiens frog legs, a dissecting pan, forceps, frog Ringerâ€™s solution, a dissecting probe, a stimulus parameter, and caffeine. A myogram, which plots the amplitude of the stimulus and response over time, was used to collect data. Students first removed the skin of the frog leg and separated the gastrocnemus muscle from the remainder of the leg. The muscle was suspended at a 90 degree angle, perpendicular to the dissecting pan. The muscle was stimulated directly at 1 volt, and the amplitude was recorded for three pulses using a myogram. The muscle was then injected with 0.1 milliliters of 200 millimolar caffeine and directly stimulated three times at 1 volt at a pulse width of 5 ms. The amplitude was recorded using a myogram. The procedure was followed for all three frog legs. A paired t_test was be used to determine the significance of the data.

Results:
The average amplitude of the muscle contraction increased after injection of 0.1 Ml of caffeine. It increased the most during the first trial and a minimal amount during the second and third trials. The paired t_test value was 0.072225, so there was no significent difference between the groups.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported because there was no significent difference between the amplitude of muscle contractions of the group that did not receive caffeine and the group that received caffeine. However, for all of the trials, the amplitude of the muscle increased after injection of 0.1 Ml of caffeine. Caffeine stimulated calcium release in muscles, resulting in stronger contractions and eventually for the muscle to reach tetany in all three trials. However, there was no significent difference between the controll group and the legs treated with caffeine, likely because the concentration of caffeine was not great enough. In a similar study, a range of concentrations, from 1 to 40 millimolar, of caffeine were used to stimulate slow-twitch muscle fibers in the curialis muscle of Rania pipiens. The response of the muscle fibers was measured, but there was no significent difference in the contraction of the muscle, which is in line with our findings [Hoock: 1996]. If we were to continue the study, we would use a larger sample size because the results were very close to being statistically significent.
