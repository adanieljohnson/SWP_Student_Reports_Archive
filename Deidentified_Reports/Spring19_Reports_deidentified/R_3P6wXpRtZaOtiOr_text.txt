Title: The Neuromuscular System and The Effects of Nerve-Blocking Substances on the Neuromuscular Junction

Abstract:
This experiment showed us the relationship between the nervous system and the muscular system through the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle in the legs of Lithobatis pipiens.  We were able to see how these bodily systems work together in the neuromuscular system, and observe the speed at which they do so. We hypothesized that if we added a substance, such as lidocaine, to the leg in order to block sodium channels during the process of contraction that the maximal contraction voltage would decrease, which, judging by our p_value of 0.086658, was true. 

Introduction:
Building off of our previous research with hormones and stimuli, we are looking at a similar process for this experiment, known as the neuromuscular system. The muscles work through a motor neuron that sends signals to the myofibers in the muscle, activating the contraction of the motor unit (ie. muscle that is connected to motor neuron). [Johnson: 2018] This connection between the nervous system and muscular system of animals can show us how they work together to maintain an organism and is extremely relevant, as they pertain to all organisms. Specifically, we will be looking at the relationship between the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle in the leg of a Lithobatis pipiens, or leopard frog. We can observe how these systems work in the frog, which will carry over, at least partially, to our own selves. By looking at the way a frog’s leg moves when “triggered” can clue us into how that works in our bodies. This knowledge can be applied in many ways in order to benefit health. In this experiment specifically, we will be applying lidocaine to the leg of the frog to observe the relationship between the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle. From what we know, we hypothesize that if lidocaine is used to block sodium channels, then the voltage of the maximal contraction will decrease. 

Materials and Method:
We began the experiment by removing the skin from the three different legs of the L. pipiens and splitting the upper thigh muscles to reveal the sciatic nerves. Next, we disconnected the bottom section of the gastrocnemus muscles, including the tendons at the end, and tied them off with a string in order to be able to tie the legs upright to the hook on the probe device. Finally, we placed the probe underneath the sciatic nerve in order to record the voltage of the contractions that we would be inflicting. To be clear, this was done individually with each different leg. As we prepared to conduct the experiment, we made sure to measure the controll results before adding the lidocaine to the frog legs. This way we could compare the two groups accurately. When we began the testing, we first had to establish a threshold, which happened to be 0.2 V for all three of the legs. After we had taken a recording of the voltage of contraction with 0.3 V as the stimulus, we added the lidocaine. We decided to use 0.1 Ml of lidocaine on the frog legs, in order to see the effects that it would have. Lastly, we used the T-test to determine if our results were significent. 


Results:
Once we had recorded all of our raw data, we were able to put together some of the general patterns that were taking place within these processes that we had been looking at. Fairly consistently, whether we were looking at the controll group or the treatment group, the numbers decreased ever so slightly from one test to the next. This trend kept up throughout our data, and was actually more severe when looking at the treatment group. For example, the controll group from Leg 3 decreased a total of 0.001 V over the three contractions, while the treatment group decreased a total of 0.009 V over the three contractions. Overall, the difference between the controll groups voltages for each contraction in comparison with that of the treatment groups dropped significently once the lidocaine had been added. This means that our hypothesis was correct in saying that the maximal contraction would decrease. This means that our p_value should come out significent, which it did end up doing at a value of 0.086658. 


Discussion:
From our results, we were able to reject the null hypothesis, because our p_value came out to be significent (&lt;0.5) at a value of 0.086658. The contraction of the controll group was greater than that of the treatment group for all three of our tests, which supported our initial hypothesis. We noticed the trend in the data that showed the decreasing with each of our contraction, whether it was part of the controll group or treatment group. This shows that the legs are working in the same way as before we added the lidocaine, but at much lower voltage, once the lidocaine had been added. This is a result of the blocking of sodium channels that would permit the influx of sodium once the threshold voltage was conducted. [Clausen: 2003] These results support everything that we suspected would happen in this experiment. To further this experiment, we could test higher voltages on the legs in order to see how much effect the lidocaine actually had on the power of the contraction. This could give us a hint into how much sodium is involved in the process of contraction.
