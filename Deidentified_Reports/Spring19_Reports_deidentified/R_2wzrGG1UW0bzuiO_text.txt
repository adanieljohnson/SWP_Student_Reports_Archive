Title: Effects of fish coloration on the display of aggressive behaviors in male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Male Betta splendins are known to display several aggressive intraspecific behaviors when excited by the presence of another male. One of the most aggressive facing behaviors is the display of the red mane. Betta splendins are known to be able to discriminate color. We analyzed the effect the coloration of the of the opposing male had on the display of aggressive behaviors of the observed fish. We hypothesized that male Betta fish will display more aggressive behaviors towards other males of similar coloration compared to males of a different color. Our data did not show a significent difference in the duration red mane was displayed for same color pairings compared to different color pairings. This non significance, along with our observation of the discrepancy between the average time of red mane displayed for the two same color pairings. This suggests that there could be a genetic difference in the display of aggressive behavior between red and blue male Betta splendins, which could be of interest to analyze in a future study. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins are common aquarium fish that originate from Southeast Asia [Johnson:2018]. At rest, wild males tend to display a dull greyish brown or green color, but in the presence of another male, they flare their gills and fins and display an intense dark blue or red [Johsnon:2018]. We are using betta fish because we are interested in aggressive behaviors and Betta fish are a good model to study this due to their colorful displays in the presence of their own species. The most aggressive form of a facing movement for these intraspecific behaviors is known as “red mane”, where a male Betta will protrude the branchiostegal membranes located underneath the opercula [Johnson:2018]. In a previous experiment, we observed that the male Betta fish did not show aggressive behaviors in the presence of a male blue gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus), a fish of a different species and coloration, because it was not going to be a competitor to get a mate from the same species. It is also known that Betta fish can discriminate color [Thompson: 1965]. Knowing this, we wanted to test if the color of the opposing male Betta fish influenced the degree of aggressive intraspecific behaviors the observed male Betta fish displayed. We hypothesized that male Betta fish will display more aggressive behaviors towards other males of similar coloration compared to males of a different color. As a result, we expected the average time that red mane is displayed to be longer for the same color pairings, compared to the different color pairings. 

Materials and Method:
A total of four fish were used, two red and two blue. The fish were identified as Red 1, Red 2, Blue 1, and Blue 2. All fish were housed in individual compartments of a tank and were prevented from viewing other fish outside of the planned interactions for this experiment. Two types of interactions were conducted: same color and different color. All interactions occurred through glass, where the two fish in the same tank were separated by a clear glass divider that prevented them from touching one another. Each interaction persisted for five minutes and was followed by a five minute rest period. The same color and different color interactions were arranged as shown in Table 1. For each interaction, the total time that each fish displayed red mane was recorded. For statistical analyses, a one tailed, paired t_test was used to determine differences in the average total time red mane was displayed for same color interactions compared to different color interactions. 

Results:
The mean time spent with red mane displayed for the same color interactions was 85.865  91.901 s (Fig. 1). The mean time spent with red mane displayed for the different color interactions was 96.705  36.821s (Fig. 1). The mean time red mane was displayed for same color interactions was not statistically significently different than that of the mean time for different color interactions (t-value = 0.176, d.f. = 3, p_value = 0.872). 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis because the opposite trend was observed and there was no statistically significent difference in the average total time spent with red mane displayed for same color male Betta pairing versus different color male Betta pairings. This could have been because red male Betta fish may be more aggressive in general than blue male Betta fish, thus skewing our results for the same color pairings. This was observed in a similar study where red male Betta fish displayed more aggressive behaviors towards both other red male Betta fish and blue male Betta fish, than the blue male Betta fish displayed toward either color male Betta fish [Yatrousis:2018]. With the same color pairings, the values obtained for the pairing of the red males and the pairing of the blue males were drastically different, so when they were averaged, the standard deviation was high. However, with the different color pairings, we obtained values of the duration of red mane displayed that were closer in value to one another, so that when they were averaged, the standard deviation was a lot lower. The different color pairings may have less standard deviation because in both trials, the red male Betta fish became dominant and incited the blue male Betta fish’s aggressive red mane behaviors, thus evening out the duration of red mane displayed among the different colored fish. One limitation was there was a clear difference in the level of aggressive behaviors displayed by the red male Betta fish and the blue male Betta fish. The red male Betta fish were clearly more aggressive than the blue male Betta fish in the same color pairings, and the blue male Betta fish were really only aggressive when incited by a red male Betta fish. This prevented us from acquiring precise data for the same color interactions, and resulted in a large standard deviation for those trials. The color of the fish could be influencing the results, so for future studies, it would be of interest to test specifically for one color of male Betta aggressive behavior and compare it to the aggressive behavior displayed by a different color of male Betta, instead of including pairings of more than one colored fish for the same colored trials. Since the red male Betta fish appeared to be more aggressive, we would test specifically for their degree of aggressive behavior that they display.

Figure 1: Effect of coloration on the display of red mane in male Betta fish. The average time that red mane was displayed in same color pairings was less than the average time that red mane was displayed in different color pairings, but not by a significent amount. The large error bar for the same color interactions represents the large amount of variability and uncertainty of the data. *************************************************************************
