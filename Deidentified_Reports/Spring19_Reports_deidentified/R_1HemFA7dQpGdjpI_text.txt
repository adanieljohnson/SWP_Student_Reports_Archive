Title: Caffeine Acts as a Stimulus to Increase Strength of Muscle Contraction in Rana pipiens                               

Abstract:
Caffeine is commonly used by endurance athletes for its desirable effects on muscle stamina. This study further documented the effects of caffeine on athletic performance by observing the relationship between caffeine and the strength of muscular contractions in the legs of Rana pipiens. Electrodes were used to apply an electrical stimulation to three separate frog legs, and the strength of their muscular contractions was recorded with and without caffeine using a force transducer. It was assumed that the muscles would contract more strongly in response to the stimulation after they had been injected with the caffeine. For all three trials, the results were overwhelmingly significant, and the muscle contractions nearly doubled in strength as a result of the injection; the caffeine even triggered a state of chemically induced tetany in two of the trials. However, because the caffeine was injected directly into the muscle, it is uncertain whether the effects would be as drastic if the caffeine were metabolized instead.

Introduction:
All animals are capable of locomotion thanks to a responsive system of interacting nerves and muscles. When a stimulus is applied to a nerve cell, it can trigger an action potential. The two main ions involved in an action potential are sodium and potassium, which affect a cell’s membrane potential to allow a stimulus to travel down the nervous system until it reaches the muscle. This prompts a series of chemical releases which then activate the contraction mechanisms of this muscle, causing it to shorten. The contraction mechanism utilizes the conversion of ADP into ATP to create the energy required to shorten and contract the muscle fibers [Johnson: 2018]. Through the contraction of agonist and antagonist skeletal muscles animals achieve a unique method of controlled movement [Johnson: 2018]. Other factors outside of an action potential can influence the muscular contraction mechanism, which affects how the muscle moves and activates. For example, substances such as caffeine are known to affect the muscle contraction mechanisms. Caffeine in particular is commonly used as an ergogenic aid by athletes seeking to increase their athletic performance by increasing their muscular strength or stamina [Green: 2018]. Caffeine is also known to produce muscle cramping in high doses, and while this may be attributed to its role in fluid loss [Lowengrub: 1999], this would only explain muscle cramping over long term exposure to caffeine. This study sought to further examine the immediate effects of caffeine when administered directly to the muscle by observing the muscular contractions in the legs of Rana pipiens. Frogs like Rana pipiens use their strong hind legs to propel themselves on land and in water, making them the perfect candidates for observing the effects of caffeine on a major muscle group. A muscle contraction can be stimulated in the leg using a force transducer to apply an electrical shock, which mimics the natural motor nerve impulse. Injecting the frog leg with caffeine and using a myogram to measure the contraction produced by applying electrical stimulation will demonstrate if and how caffeine alters the normal contraction of the muscle. Based on what is already known about how caffeine effects muscular contractions when consumed by humans, it is assumed that if the frog muscle is injected with caffeine, the following contractions will be noticeably stronger.  

Materials and Methods:
Adult Rana pipiens specimens were used in this experiment to demonstrate the effects of caffeine when it is injected directly into the muscle. First, three freshly detached frog legs were degloved to expose the muscles. The gastrocnemius muscle was then detached from the rest of the leg and then connected to a force transducer using a string attached to the Achilles tendon. The rest of the leg was pinned to the lab tray to keep it in place while administering the electrical pulses. It is very important to note in this process that the muscle should come into minimal contact with any metal implements. Once the leg had been set up on the tray and connected to the force transducer, the probes were inserted directly into the gastrocnemius muscle. A baseline should be established by applying a stimulation of 5 pulses at a width of 5 ms, an amplitude of 1 volt, and a frequency of 1 Hz. Once the baseline has been recorded the myogram should be left running while 0.1 mL of caffeine at a concentration of 200 mM is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. After the caffeine has been injected, a second stimulus should be applied using the same settings as the first stimulus. Finally, a paired T-test using the data from all three trials should be completed to determine the statistical significance of the difference in the strength of the muscular contractions before and after the caffeine injection.

Results:
All three frog legs experienced a drastic spike in the strength of the muscular contractions after being injected with the caffeine. The average strength of contraction for all three legs before caffeine was 0.603 V, while the average strength of contraction for all three legs after caffeine was 0.999 V. Additionally, the physical condition of the muscle was noticeably different after the leg had been injected with caffeine. In all three cases, the muscle felt firmer and less elastic after it had been injected and electrically stimulated. In the second and third leg, the muscle was visibly contorted at the injection site and became fully tensed before any electrical stimulation had been applied. The myogram shows that the injection of caffeine alone was enough to force the muscle into a chemically induced tetany. In this newly established “resting” state, the electrical stimulation did very little to further contract the muscle. A paired t-test showed that these differences were statistically significant (t-stat= 13.5, df= 14, P= 2.13x10-9).

Discussion:
The results of this experiment successfully supported the hypothesis that injecting caffeine into the muscle of Rana pipiens would increase the strength of the muscular contractions, as seen in the greater average contractile strength of the treatment group compared to the average contractile state of the control group in figure 1. Even in the first trial where the observed response was not as drastic, the muscle still experienced a much stronger contraction from the electrical stimulation after it was injected with the caffeine. Caffeine’s stimulating effect is due to its impact on the chemical process of a muscular contraction, specifically that it increases the effects of Na+, K+, and ATPase. Caffeine creates this increase by hyperpolarizing the plasma membrane, which allows for greater K+ uptake and Na+ discharge [Lindinger:1996]. Because these two ions are responsible for triggering the action potentials that cause muscle contractions, reabsorbing and releasing them in greater amounts will lead to more action potentials and stronger muscle contractions. This information and the data gathered from the study suggests potential benefits of using caffeine both for endurance athletes who wish to increase muscular stamina and for athletes who wish to exert more power; however, it is important to consider two factors of this study that may affect the desired outcomes. First, while the caffeine successfully increased muscle strength, it also induced severe cramping and muscle fatigue. The physiological response of the 2nd and 3rd legs is highly undesirable for an athlete looking to enhance performance because it would impair their movement and muscle function. Even the first leg felt tighter to the touch as a result of caffeine, which could lead to exercise associated muscle cramps [Pagel: 2014] and eventually injury. Second, the effects of caffeine in this case were caused by directly injecting it into the muscle, whereas most athletes utilize caffeine through metabolization. For this reason, it cannot be conclusively stated that an athlete who consumes caffeine, either through food or beverage, before performing an athletic activity will have increased muscle strength. For this reason, it would be interesting to observe the effects of caffeine on muscle strength after being absorbed through the GI tract. Unfortunately, this experiment would be difficult to set up with frogs as they would need to be alive while establishing a baseline of muscular strength in order to then feed them caffeine. Additionally, there would need to be enough time between the caffeine consumption and the secondary muscle testing to allow the caffeine to be sufficiently absorbed, which would make the procedure very time consuming. It is possibly that metabolizing caffeine would not have the same hyperpolarizing effect on the plasma membrane that injecting it into the muscle does, which would fail to increase the available Na+ and K+ to the same extent observed in this study.
