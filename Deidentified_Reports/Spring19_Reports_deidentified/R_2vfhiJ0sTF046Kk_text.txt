Title: Juvenile hormone mimic effects on Manduca sexta caterpillar growth

Abstract:
Insect hormones affect the growth and development of insects. When studying insects, it is important to know how certain hormones affect the growth processes, such as the molting stage, of insects. Here we look at the effect of adding JH mimic, and insect growth regulator (IGR) to Manduca sexta caterpillar diets. The expectation of this experiment was that the experimental group that was fed JH mimic in their food would have a significently different average rate in weight change over fourteen days. The results showed that the average weight change over fourteen days for the controll group was 0.5485g, and the average weight change over fourteen days for the experimental group with JH mimic added to the food was 0.747g. Visual observations were inconclusive; one cannot could not tell a difference between the controll and experimental groups. Our data showed no significent difference between the average rate of weight change of the controll group of Manduca sexta caterpillars and the experimental group of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The lack of significance could suggest the experiment was not given enough time. Learning and understanding more about insect hormones, specifically JH, could give us a broader understanding of how hormones affect insect development and the molting stage 

Introduction:
This experiment tests the effects of insect hormones on insect weight changes. Hormones are extremely important factors that affect an insect’s growth and development; they are chemical signals that affect target cells and receptors. Insect Growth Hormones (IGRs) can alter the processes regulated by hormones. Puberty can be used as a metaphor for an insect’s molting stage. Like when humans transition to adulthood through puberty, insects transition to adulthood through molting. Molting can accomplish many different things, like changes in size or changes in form [Nijhout: 2015]. The Manduca sexta, the insect of interest in this experiment, experiences molting [Nijhout: 2015]. Insect molting is controllled by two major hormones: ecdysteriods and juvenile hormone (JH); JH, an IGR, is present during the larvae stage, allowing growth and progression through the larval stage until insects are ready for metamorphosis [Riddiford: 2003]. If JH is not present in the caterpillar, then metamorphosis is allowed to happen; however, if JH is added during the final larval stages, the switch from larva to molting does not occur [Ridd.f.ord: 2003]. In this experiment, the hormone JH mimic was used, as to mimic the effects of the juvenile hormone. The experiment consists of the inclusion of JH mimic in the Manduca sexta caterpillars’ food, and the evaluation of the caterpillars’ weights, using physical appearance as a gauge for observations. If JH mimic is added to the Manduca sexta’s diet to increase JH levels, then this increase will affect the weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar when compared to the controll group. 

Materials and Method:
The Manduca sexta caterpillars were divided eight caterpillars into two groups of four; one served as the controll group and one served as the experimental group. Each day, each caterpillar in the controll group was fed regular amounts of untreated caterpillar food (10g) with seven drops of water added in, and each caterpillar in the experimental group was fed a regular amount of treated food (10g), with seven drops of JH mimic added in. Every day for two weeks, all eight caterpillars were weighed, and the masses were recorded. Visual observations were made every day throughout the 14-day period. Pictures were taken of the caterpillars for visual reference after that particular day. The caterpillars had food every day, and the food was replaced when necessary or when the caterpillars ate it all. When not observing, feeding, or weighing caterpillars, the caterpillars were kept in an incubator under the same conditions, such as sunlight, temperature, and space. A two tailed t_test was then used to determine if the difference in weights of the controll group and the experimental group was significent or not.

Results:
The average weight change over fourteen days for the controll group was 0.5485g, and the average weight change over fourteen days for the experimental group with JH mimic added to the food was 0.747g. The two tailed t_test calculated a p_value of 0.282. In the experimental group, one caterpillar was dead. Another’s coloring suggested that it was getting ready to die. The other two looked relatively healthy. In the controll group, only one caterpillar appeared completely healthy. One had completely molted. Another had a ring around its neck, so it could not molt. The final caterpillar appeared slightly off-color, yellowish rather than its normal bright green. Figure 1 shows the average change in weights of the experimental and controll group over a two-week period.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that if juvenile hormone mimic is added to the Manduca sexta’s diet in order to increase juvenile hormone levels in the insect, then this increase will affect the weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar, was not supported. There was no observed significent difference at the .05 level, thus meaning that the alternate hypothesis was rejected and the null hypothesis was supported; JH mimic does not appear to have an effect on the weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars. According to studies, JH directs the action of ecdysone and 20E; its presence does not allow the hormones to switch from a larva to a pupa, therefore inhibiting the molting process [Riddiford: 2003]. Taking this into account, even though the null hypothesis was accepted, it is possible that the experiment was not given enough time. Perhaps the Maduca sexta caterpillars were not given enough time with the presence of JH in their diets in order to see the results that the alternate hypothesis supported. However, at this point in the experiment, the null hypothesis is accepted. Despite this, hormones are still extremely important in regulating insect development. They controll the molting process, in which the insect is metamorphosed into an adult [Nijhout: 2015]. Understanding more about the effects of insect hormones could further understanding of how they controll the growth process, development, and the molting stage of the insects themselves.

 Figure 1. The effect of JH mimic on Manduca sexta caterpillars’ weights. Control group (first bar) had an average weight change of 0.5485g. Experimental group (second bar) had an average weight change of 0.747g. Experimental Manduca sexta caterpillars were exposed to 7 drops of JH mimic in their diets, while the controll group had seven drops of water added to their diets. Weights of all eight caterpillars were weighed every day. The average rate of change in weight for each caterpillar was calculated and a two tailed t_test was performed.  *************************************************************************
