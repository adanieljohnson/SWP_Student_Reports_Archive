Title: Effects of Ecdysteriod Inhibitor in the Development of the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Hormone regulation is an important factor in many animals’ growth and development. It is important for us to study levels and important hormones because it can help further medicine and cures to hormone related diseases. A commonly studied caterpillar is the manduca sexta which contains the hormones JH and ecdysteroids in order to develop. Here we look at the effect of ecdysteriod inhibitor on the growth and development in the manduca sexta. Our expected result was that if we fed the caterpillar ecdysteroids, then it would not develop as well and grow as much as normal caterpillars. Our data revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the control group of caterpillars and caterpillars fed ecdysteriod inhibitor. This suggests that ecdysteroids are crucial to the growth of the manduca sexta and our hypothesis was supported. With these results, we can conclude that specific hormone levels can be modified and manipulated in order to inhibit growth. 

Introduction:
Caterpillars and their development have been studied for many years in order to help scientists learn more about hormones. The manduca sexta is a caterpillar than needs the juvenile hormones and ecdysterones in order to properly develop into an adult. Manduca sextas go through four stages in life that all require hormones. These stages are embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult [Johnson: 2016]. Ecdysteriods regulate the timing of molting during the insect’s development. Many transcription factors occur throughout the molting process and they must be regulated by ecdysteroids in order for it to molt properly [Riddiford: 2003]. Without this vital regulation, the insect would die. This experiment evaluates how important normal levels of these development hormones actually are. We will inject the caterpillar’s food with ecdysteriod inhibitor and record their weights to see the results. If ecdysteroids are inhibited, then the manduca sexta will decrease in weight as it develops.

Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out this experiment, we split the caterpillars into two separate groups of four and each caterpillar got their own cell. One group of four was the control group, and the other group was altered using the ecdysteriod inhibitor. The altered group was the experimental group. We feed the control group with normal caterpillar food that we were provided with and added five drops of water to it. We feed the experimental caterpillars the same food, but instead of adding five drops of water we added five drops of the ecdysteriod inhibitor. We checked and weighed each caterpillar every day for two weeks and replaced their food as needed. Each time we replaced the food, we would re-add the ecdysteriod or water drops depending on if it was the control group or the experimental group. The independent variable in the experiment was the inhibitor and the dependent was the weight. After two weeks of observing and weighing each caterpillar, we calculated different statistical tests to see if our data was significant. In order to find this out, we found the means of both groups, one tailed p-value, and standard deviations. We then graphed the average weights of both the control and experimental group to see the effect of the independent variable on that dependent variable.

Results:
The average weight of the control group was 3.57 grams and the average weight of the experimental group was 1.8251 [Fig. 1]. The t-value for the experiment was 2.1067 and the one-tailed p-value was 0.03987. The standard deviation of the control group was 1.163 and the standard deviation of the experimental was 1.183 [Fig. 1]. The difference in weights between the groups is statistically significant because the p-value is 0.03987. As we monitored the caterpillars, it was apparent that the experimental group continued to have a smaller mass than the control. The experimental groups mass grew slowly, if at all, and the controls steadily increased for the most part. Overall, the control and experimental caterpillars had very different average weights over the span of two weeks.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, if ecdysteroids are inhibited, then the manduca sexta will decrease in weight as it develops, was proved to be supported in our experiment. We observed a significant difference in our statistical data, which correlates to our hypothesis. Since the caterpillars were not able to achieve the right levels of the crucial ecdysteriod hormone, they did not grow or even survive as long as the control group did. Their inability to produce the hormone must have made it impossible for the caterpillar to continue to move through the stages of its life correctly. Additionally, according to other studies on the manduca sexta, the release of ecdysteroids it crucial in initiating metamorphosis so the caterpillar can eventually turn into an adult [Riddiford: 1978]. This data is proven by our results. It has also been found in several studies that juvenile hormones (JH) are just as important and crucial to the manduca sexta’s development into metamorphosis as ecdysteroids are [Safranek: 1980].Since we found that ecdysteroids are critical to the caterpillar’s development into an adult, the next step is to do another experiment to find how ecdysteroids are affected by JH levels and how significant JH is to the development into the next stages of life. Caterpillars are so closely studied because they, like humans, need hormones to develop and grow. By studying hormones like JH and the ecdysteriod hormone we learn more about how hormones work. The more we learn about their hormones, the more we can learn about ours and learn how to manipulate them in order to further medicine.
