Title: The effect of salt water on root to shoot ratios in Secale cereale.

Abstract:
Plants face limited resources in nature which causes competitive inter-plant interaction. To be competitive plants allocate their given resources in a specific pattern. The purpose of this experiment was to understand the effect salt water has on the root to shoot ratios (resource allocation patterns) of Secale cereale. It was hypothesized that salt water would increase the root to shoot ratios of plants when compared to control plants watered with tap water. Control groups were setup with ten Secale cereale plants watered daily with regular tap water. These plants were compared to ten Secale cereale plants that were watered daily with 3.0% salt water. Control plants exhibited lower root to shoot ratios for both length and weight than the experimental group which had noticeably longer roots and smaller shoots. The data was significant as the experimental plants displayed higher root to shoot ratios.

Introduction:
In the wild, plants face factors that affect their life and growth while depending on their available resources to thrive. These factors can be broken down into two major categories: abiotic and biotic. Abiotic factors are non-living sources of stimuli [Johnson: 2018]. Examples of these factors include sunlight, thermal radiation, and wind. Biotic factors, on the other hand, come from living sources or organisms (e.g. fungi, bacteria, and animals). These stimuli make inter-plant interactions competitive as resources such as sunlight or nutrients may be scarce. In order to do this, plants may outcompete other species causing certain species to be removed from a given location. In order to compete for scarce resources, plants will allocate their limited resources in a specific pattern that allows them to effectively overcome abiotic factors. [Johnson 2018]. A previous study looked into the root to shoot ratios of lettuce when affected by the presence and absence of a nutrient solution. The study found a positive correlation between root to shoot ratios and the presence of nutrient solution. [McLaughlin et al.: 1997]. In Osmosis, water from areas of lower concentrations to areas of higher concentration. Water flows to areas of high salt concentration. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect salt water has on root to shoot ratios of Secale cereale. The Plant model Secale cereale is optimal for this study, due to its fast growth and resilience to environmental factors. It is hypothesized that if Secale cereale plants are watered with 3% salt water then the root to shoot ratios (in length and weight) will be significantly greater than the root to shoot ratio of Secale cereale watered with regular tap water.

Materials and Methods:
To test the hypothesis, roughly 80 Secale cereale seeds were obtained. For the control group, two planting pods were fully filled with vermiculite and 200 mL of tap water was added to the pods. Additionally, 100 mL of miracle grow plant nutrition solution was added to the pods. Sixteen holes were then poked in the vermiculite and at least two Secale cereale seeds were added to each planting hole. The plants were then labeled and placed in a greenhouse where they grew for one week. The plants were watered daily with 100 mL of regular tap water. These steps were repeated for the treatment groups. The treatment plants were also left to grow for two weeks in the greenhouse but were watered daily with a 3% salt water solution rather than regular tap water. At the end of the 2 weeks growing period, the plants were taken from the greenhouse and removed from the vermiculite via water bath. Ten treatment plants and 10 control plants were then isolated for analysis. The individual Secale cereale plants were cut at the seed to separate their roots from their shoots. After ensuring the plants were dry and free from debris, the plant roots and shoots were individually weighed (with their mass recorded in g) and measured (with their length recorded in cm). The masses and lengths of the plants were then recorded as a ratio of root length or mass divided by the shoot mass or length. These root to shoot ratios were then recorded and averaged with their accompanying standard deviation. The treatment and control root to shoot ratios were then subjected to a two-tail unpaired two-sample t test to determine statistical significance with a 95% confidence interval.

Results:
The control group had an average weight root to shoot ratio of 0.647 ± 0.147 and the experimental group had an average weight root to shoot ratio of 3.667 ± 1.296 (t=7.32, df=18, p=4.22E-7). The control group had an average length ratio of and 0.493 ± 0.070 while the experimental groups had an average length ratio of and 1.465 ± 0.389 (t=7.77, df=18, p=3.68E-7). The experimental group had visibly longer roots and lacked major growth of shoots. 

Discussion:
The biological hypothesis of this experiment was supported. The root to shoot ratios were higher for experimental groups and also displayed minimal growth for control groups. The results of this study can be explained by properties of water-salt balance. Due to the high concentration of salt in the soil surrounding the shoots of the experimental group plants, water is under pressure to flux out of the root. These plants likely mobilized resources to counteract this force by increasing the length (and thus absorptive surface area) for water. This reallocation of surface area/length to the roots is not necessary in the control plants because of the relatively lower salt concentration in the soil. Due to the resultant lack of outward water flux in the control plants, less of the length/surface area needs to be allocated to the roots of these plants. These outcomes are different than those of a 2011 study that found salinity increased plant height and dry weights [Qados & Qados: 1997]. The findings of this past study contradict our data. Future experiments in this realm could focus on the effect of salt water on buried plants to see how they would allocate their resources when faced with a lack of water and sunlight. Additionally, future studies that test different concentrations of salt water could potentially help explain the disparity between our study and the Qados and Qados (1997) study.
