Title: Effects of light color on agnostic behavior in Betta splendins 

Abstract:
The lab was performed to determine if the color of light perceived by Betta splendins had any effect on agnostic behavior when faced with another male. The lab was performed using three different color of film: Blue, Clear, and Red. This data was then analyzed using an ANOVA to determine the significance. It was found that color of light had no significent effect on the behavior of betta splendins. There was however a question of if saturation of color played a role in the experiment.

Introduction:
Fish like Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, can see all of the wavelengths of light within the visible spectrum and even some of the ultra violet wavelengths. In an experiment by Thompson and their team, they found that the fish tend to be more aggressive toward fish models that had different colors than themselves. This had shown that these fish do in fact see visible light [Thompson: 1965]. This aggressive behavior is known as agnostic behavior and the most aggressive is when the fish shows its “red mane.” This red mane is produced by the fish expanding the membranes under its gills [Johnson:2016].  In humans, it has been determined that the color of light can induce certain behaviors in humans like how some fast-food establishments use the colors red and yellow to entice customers to eat at their establishment. Different colors have also been proven to affect the mood of the person [Lin:2004]. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if the betta fish are affected emotionally by different colors of light. This will be determined by exposing male betta fish to a certain color of light and observe their agnostic behavior as they interact with another male betta fish. Our hypothesis is that the color of light will cause the time and frequency of agnostic behavior to vary among the fish tested. 

Materials and Method:
The male betta fish will be exposed to the different color light/film during their 15-minute rest period between their five-minute exposure period to one other male betta fish. The time and number of red manes will be recorded during the five minutes of interaction. The bettas were split into three interaction groups: 1. Purple and red betta vs. Red and yellow betta. 2. Red and yellow betta vs. Teal betta. 3. Purple and red betta vs. Teal betta. The experiment was run three times for each film color for a total of one film color per group interaction. The colors of film used were red, blue, and clear for controll. An ANOVA and a Tukey-Kramer test was used to determine the significance of the results.

Results:
The results of the ANOVA are as follows for the effect of light color on agnostic behavior duration: Blue – p_value = 0.101, degree of freedom = 40, Clear – p_value = 0.576, degree of freedom = 55 and Red p_value = 0.0006, degree of freedom = 25. The results of the ANOVA for the effect of light color on the number of times the red mane was displayed are as follows:  Blue – p_value = 0.268, degree of freedom = 5, Clear – p_value = 0.084, degree of freedom = 5, and Red - p_value = 0.986, degree of freedom = 5.

Discussion:
Determined by the ANOVA, the length of time that the bettas exhibited the agnostic behavior of the red mane was not significently affected by the Blue and Clear films prior to interaction. Red did have a significent effect on the time of red manes. However, the number of times that the bettas red maned was not significently affected by the all colors of light. This significent effect on the bettas by the red light could be due to the darkness of the film which made it hard for the betta to see the other fish. Also, we noticed that when testing the fish with the red film that when one was looking at the other with a white background, it was still able to see the fish and thus began its agnostic behavior. This experiment gives us insight into how light could possibly affect the behavior of species other than humans. For future study, it would be interesting to see how the fish would interact when the saturation of the film color is changed instead of the color of film. This would help us understand whether or not this played a role in our experiment. Similarly, Carvalho and their team used a different species of fish and tested how the intensity of light effect the aggressive behavior of Nile tilapia [Carvalho:2013].
