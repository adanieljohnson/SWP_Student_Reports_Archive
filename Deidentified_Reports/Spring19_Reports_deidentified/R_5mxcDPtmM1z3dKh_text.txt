Title: Raphanus sativus Resource Allocation Not Significantly Impacted by Herbivory

Abstract:
This study focused on impact of herbivory on Raphanus sativus radish plants. It is generally accepted that plants can allocate resources to increase growth in various parts to compensate for changes in their environment [Johnson: 2018]. Resource allocation was specifically measured using root to shoot ratios of length. It was hypothesized that with increased herbivory, root to shoot ration would decrease. Twelve radish plants were grown for two weeks. On day six, young parts of the shoots were snipped off of the six experimental group plants to mimic herbivory, and the weights of these cuttings were recorded for future calculations. At the end of two weeks, a replicate from each plant was analyzed for root and shoot weights and lengths, and the mass estimated to have been snipped from the experimental replicates was accounted for before root to shoot ratios were calculated for length and mass. The length ratios were specifically analyzed using a two-sample, one-tailed t-test on the average length root to shoot ratio. The data proved to not be statistically significant with and the experimental group actually showed a slightly higher root to shoot ratio. Thus, the null hypothesis that herbivory does not affect radish plant allocation must be accepted.

Introduction:
In reaction to environmental changes, plants can alter resource allocation to increase growth rates of certain body parts. The two main structures of a plant body are the roots below ground and the shoots above it. Roots are responsible for nutrient absorption from soil while shoots are mainly responsible for photosynthesis. When there is a change that stops one part of the plant from functioning normally, resource reallocation will likely occur to increase the size of that part to increase activity and make the plant more energy efficient again [Johnson: 2018]. As one part of the plant grows disproportionately to the other, the root to shoot ratio (R:S) measured in mass or length changes [Johnson: 2018]. Many factors can cause reallocation, this experiment explored the question how does herbivory impact plant allocation in Raphanus sativus? Raphanus sativus, commonly known as the radish was used as a sample organisms as they grow quickly and are relatively small plants. This is highly relevant to anyone interested in gardening who might wonder how their plants will likely grow or for ecologists interested in whether animals have come in contact with certain vegetation. Prior research on herbivory and plant allocation found that an increase in herbivory on trees caused a doubling in branch biomass over four years [Pratt: 2005]. With all this information in mind, it was hypothesized that increased herbivory would decrease root to shoot ratio. 

Materials and Methods:

At the beginning of a two week period, two trays of 6 radish plants were planted. One group of six was designated as the control group and the other was designated as the experimental group that was further divided into two groups of three for measurement purposes (they received the same treatment). The plants were left to grow in a greenhouse for six days while being watered every other day.  On the sixth day, after they had grown several inches out of the soil, each shoot in the experimental group had one side of its most recent branching cut off. For each of the two experimental subgroups, the total mass of all cuttings was weighed and recorded. The plants were left to grow for another eight days. Then, root and shoot ratios based on mass and length were measured. A replicate from each plant was removed from the soil and dried. Roots were consistently separated from shoots where the green of the plant stem began. Rulers were used to measure each shoot length from the base of the shoot to the tallest point and to measure root length. A shoot and root mass were recorded for each replicate as well. For each of experimental subgroups, the total shoot mass cut from them on the 6th day was divided by the total number of shoots present in the three plants to arrive at an estimate of the average mass that had been removed from the 3 individual replicates in the subgroup. These masses were added to the final shoot masses of the six experimental replicates to account for the very recent loss of shoot mass. R:S by mass and length were then calculated and a two-sample, one-tailed t-test was run on the length R:S. 


Results:
Length ratios were analyzed. The group subject to herbivory had a higher R:S than the control group at the end of the study, though the average ratios are very close to each other (1.05 and 1.28). The spread of the data was similar in both groups. The p-value of the one-tailed t-test is 0.122055 which higher than alpha 0.05. Qualitatively, little change was seen in plant growth, structure, or health during the two weeks plants were being monitored and watered.

Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis that herbivory would decrease root to shoot ratio. The null hypothesis that herbivory does not impact plant allocation in radishes must be supported. Not only were results seen to be statistically insignificant in general, but the trends show that the root to shoot ratio was greater for the plants exposed to herbivory, likely meaning that there was not an increase in shoot growth rate and no apparent reallocation of resources to the shoots as expected. As the raw data did not show any outlying, extremely long roots, it is unlikely that there was a sudden reallocation to roots or cases of extreme root and stem growth either, though. It is very likely that in this short time period, plants did not have time to reallocate resources and regrow shoots back to show significant results. Other studies analyzed reallocation over four years rather than two weeks and also used much larger specimens [Pratt: 2005]. Given the resources, it would be beneficial to redo this experiment over a longer time and using more visible and heavy specimen that are easier to measure and do not require the intermediate averaging of all the light-weight shoot cuttings to add back to masses at the end of the experiment (possible source of error). Another limitation of this experiment was the very systematic and unnatural mimicking of herbivory. Other experiments that supported our hypothesis used beetles completing natural herbivory, providing the plants with a more natural stimulus for reallocation [Throop: 2005]. It could also be of value to see if there is a difference in results when using a flowering angiosperm with its reproductive structures exposed to herbivory. Shoot structures are pivotal in reproduction as well as photosynthesis, so this might stimulate more dramatic reallocation. 
In real world application, the results of this experiment suggest that radishes and similar plants will not quickly allocate resources to compensate for herbivory. This means that those farming such plants should keep the plants protected from herbivores.
