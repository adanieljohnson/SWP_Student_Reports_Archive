Title: Effects of Precor hormone on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Insects are often seen as pests destroying crops and gardens. Sometimes they are pests as adults, such as mosquitos, and other times as larvae, such as the Tobacco Hornworm. Using certain hormones to influence growth patterns, the insects can be eliminated by altering their development. Increasing a juvenile hormone such as Precor, adulthood is inhibited reducing adult pestilences. Increasing ecdysterones would cause rapid development reducing the time larval pests are pestilences. In the experiment, Precor, a juvenile hormone mimicker, was treated on Manduca sexta to test the effects. Our data showed strong statistical significance in the difference in growth and development between Manduca sexta with and without Precor. Both significent mass differences and observations concerning the behaviors leading to and responsible for pupation strongly prove the role juvenile hormones have in growth and development in Manduca sexta. This proves that Precor could be effectively used as a pesticide to inhibit juvenile growth to adulthood. 

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effects of hormones on insect development and growth. Hormones are signaling chemicals produced by organism to stimulate specific responses within the organism. Hormones are present in all plants and animals and are responsible for many physical responses including hunger, excretion, growth, development, and reproduction. In this experiment, tobacco hornworms are used to study the effects of hormones. Tobacco Hornworms (Manduca sexta) have been studied extensively making their hormone regulation well known and understood. Manduca sexta are insects that metamorphize from eggs to larvae to pupa to adult moths. During metamorphosis, two hormones drive growth and development: juvenile hormone and ecdysterone [Staal: 1982]. Juvenile hormone controlls molting, which enables the caterpillar to shed its old skin to metamorphize [Williams: 1956]. To test the effects of hormones on Manduca sexta, Precor is administered to some of the caterpillars. Precor is a juvenile hormone mimicker meaning it acts as juvenile hormone in the Manduca sexta. What are the effects on growth by mass of Manduca sexta caterpillars by Precor? If mass is affected proving the effects of Precor, what ways is the development in caterpillars affected? If Precor is administered to the Manduca sexta caterpillars, then pupation will not occur, and growth will be slower. 

Materials and Method:
The 16 young larval Manduca sexta were gathered and placed into individual habitats with airholes and food. Each was given 10 grams of supplied caterpillar food. For the eight controll caterpillars, the food was dampened by 48 drops of water. For the experiment group, the food was dampened with 1: 1250 Precor solution. Before being put in their habitats, each caterpillar was weighed and measured. For the first week the caterpillars were regularly checked for food shortages. After one week, the groups were weighed and measured to observe size changes. Statistically a one-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine the differences in the average mass of the controll group versus the experimental group. For the final week, the caterpillars were measured and weighed daily and checked for food shortages. At the end of the final week, the Manduca sexta were weighed and measured one last time, and the same t_test was run. For the final t_test, the difference across the entire two-week period was used to show the full change.

Results:
Over the two-week span, the average change in mass in the Manduca sexta in the controll group was 4.94125 grams (Fig.1). The average change in mass for the Manduca sexta treated with Precor was 6.22375 grams (Fig.1). The standard deviation for mass was 0.50959 for the controll group and 1.81704 for the treatment group (Table 1). The standard error was 0.71386 for the controll group and 1.34798 for the treatment group (Table 1). The two-sample t_test was statistically significent for mass difference (t_stat =1.79805, d.f. = 14, P = 0.04688). After two weeks, the controll group had begun pupation with one even fully pupated. The treatment group, however, had not begun pupation and was still growing, not developing. Rather than shedding their larval skins and turning brown, the treatment group stayed bright blue-green and gorged on their food. Overall, the controll and treatment group had different patterns of growth. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that Precor would inhibit development and growth was supported by the experiment. After two weeks of experimentation, the controll group began to pupate and metamorphize. During pupation, caterpillars lose mass from molting and the creation of the chrysalis [Nijout: 1974]. The treatment group did not begin pupation causing the Manduca sexta to not lose mass from development. This difference in mass at the end of experimentation was statistically significent according the t_tests taken. They did not pupate due to an increase in juvenile hormone (in the form of Precor) which slowed the progression of development as a larva and inhibited molting to initiate pupation. Control over development with the basic addition of chemicals, hormones, is immensely significent. Control over aging, growth, size, and appetite are all attainable through simple and appropriate use of hormones.
