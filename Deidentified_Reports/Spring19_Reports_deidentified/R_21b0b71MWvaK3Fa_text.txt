Title: Increasing the amount of JH in the diet of the Manduca Sexta, and the effect on it's growth

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta is a moth of the family Sphingidae.  There are three important hormones that play a role in the Manduca Sexta. Each hormone is very important, however in this specific experiment we focused more closely on the effect of JH on the Manduca Sexta.  We wanted to observe if an increase in JH would prolong the growth of the Manduca Sexta past the fifth instar and prevent it from pupation.  Therefore we wanted to add JH to the diet of the caterpillar and observe if this hormone would inhibit pupation.  In order to conduct this experiment, we observed two groups of caterpillars, one that was fed JH and one control, and observed their growth over a two-week span.  Our hypothesis that adding JH to the Manduca Sexta’s diet would increase the weight of the caterpillars was supported by our experiment. Our results and observations suggest that the presence of JH in the diet of the Manduca Sexta inhibits the pupation of the caterpillar which results in the caterpillar growing unusually large, not changing in color, and ultimately not pupating.


Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca Sexta, is an insect which throughout its lifespan grows from a caterpillar to a moth in a couple of months.  The Manduca Sexta is in the Sphingidae family, and is a pest of many plants including the tobacco plant, pepper plant, eggplant, etc.  These insects are green bodied and have black and white diagonal stripes that run down its back.  The life cycle of the Manduca Sexta is dependent on many things including its diet and environment it lives in.  The growth of the Manduca Sexta is controlled using neuron-based signaling that controls the secretion of hormones.  There are three important hormones that play a role in the Manduca Sexta.  The first one is Prothoracicotropic hormone which is produced by the Corpus Cardiacum and this hormone regulates the release of ecdysterone by the prothoracic glands.  Next, Ecdysterone (20E) regulates the timing of molting during insect development.  Lastly, Juvenile hormone (JH) which is located on either side of the Corpus Allata.  There are many different types of JH, however, they all act the same by regulating the type of molt during development.  The hormone that we paid special attention to in this experiment was Juvenile Hormone (JH), there have been many studies done on the effect JH has on the growth of the Manduca Sexta, according to two scientists Nijout and Williams, who did an experiment on the effects of JH on the Manduca Sexta,  …there is comprehensive body of evidence that a declining titre of JH is a prerequisite for pupation [Nijhout: 1974]..  This research sparked an interest in our group about the JH hormone and how it potentially could affect the Manduca Sexta, therefore we wanted to do an experiment on how JH hormone affects the growth of the Manduca Sexta.  If there was an increase in JH it would prolong the growth of the Manduca Sexta past the fifth instar and prevent it from pupation.  Therefore, we wanted to add JH to the diet of the Manduca Sexta and observe if this hormone would inhibit pupation.  We hypothesized that if we added JH hormone to the Manduca Sexta’s diet then the caterpillar will increase in weight because they will continue to grow and never pupate.


Materials and Methods:
To begin we were given eight caterpillars and split them up into two groups, we named one group the control where they were given 10 grams of caterpillar food with nothing besides drops of water added to it.  The other group was the JH group, we gave them each 10 grams of caterpillar food, each with 4 grams of JH.  We split the caterpillars into two groups, so we would have data on an experimental group and a control group and would be able to compare the growth of the two and make conclusions about the effects of JH.  In order to keep the caterpillars in the same environment, we put them in an incubator.  The growth of the caterpillars was monitored over a two-week span.  The weight of each caterpillar was measured on a scale and recorded each day, we observed the caterpillars every day over a two-week span to ensure that we had more data and would be able to analyze more and come to a precise conclusion.  Furthermore, we refilled the caterpillar's food according to their prospective diet.  Every day the caterpillars had waste in their section of the bin, and finished most of their food, therefore it was necessary that we cleaned and refilled their sides of the bin.  After all of our data was collected, and we used a two-sample T-test to determine the average change in weight of both the experimental (JH) group and the control group. 


Results:
Overall, the experimental group had a much higher average change in weight that the control group. The average change in weight for the JH caterpillars was 7.65g +/- 2.183g and the average change in weight for the control caterpillars was 2.855g +/- 1.161g.  In order to analyze our results and determine if they were statistically significant, we used a two-sample t-test.  Our results were statistically significant (t-value = 3.877, df = 6, P = 0.004).  Over the two week span, the JH caterpillars gained weight and stayed the same blue/green color with black spots.  It was very clear that the caterpillars with the JH diet were getting bigger and there were no signs that they were going to pupate.  On the other hand, towards the end of the two-week span the control group caterpillars started to turn a brown/black color, began to lose weight, and produced less waste.  These were signs of pupation. 
 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that adding JH to the Manduca Sexta’s diet would increase the weight of the caterpillars was supported by our experiment.  Over the two-week span, we observed the caterpillars and found that the average weight change for the experimental group was much higher than the average weight change for the control group.  Furthermore, the caterpillars in the control group showed visual signs of pupation that the experimental group did not show.  These are both signs that the pupation of the experimental group was blocked.  The only difference between the diet of the two groups was the fact that we added JH to the experimental group diet.  We can, therefore, conclude that the presence of JH in the diet of the Manduca Sexta inhibits the pupation of the caterpillar which results in the caterpillar growing unusually large, not changing in color, and ultimately not pupating.  The JH hormone ensures the growth of larvae and simultaneously prevents metamorphosis of the Manduca Sexta.  Therefore, the results that we observed make sense and are supported by evidence from past investigations.  Past investigations also have concluded that “During the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm the presence of juvenile hormone (JH) inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)” [Nijhout: 1974].  This further suggests that the presence of JH inhibits the hormone that causes pupation.  This evidence supports our findings.  Based on our data the experimental group gained much more weight than the control group did, and the experimental group also didn’t show signs of pupation.  These observations, therefore, prove that when JH is added to the diet of the Manduca Sexta it results in the caterpillar growing past the 5th instar and not pupating.  This experiment was a success, however, there is still much that can be done to study the JH hormone and what other effects it may have on the Manduca Sexta.  For instance, in a future study we could do an experiment, and change the amount of JH fed to each caterpillar in order to understand how much JH should be fed to each caterpillar to inhibit pupation, and therefore we would be able to better understand the effects of JH.

Figure 1. JH vs Control Average Change in Weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars
This figure displays the total average change in weight of both the experimental group and the control group.  This data was collected by gathering all the weight measurements for both groups and then calculating an average for each group which is the data displayed in the graph.  The standard deviations for both bars are also displayed by the error bars.*************************************************************************
