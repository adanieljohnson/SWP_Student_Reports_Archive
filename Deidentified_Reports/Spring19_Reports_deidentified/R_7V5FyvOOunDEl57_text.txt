Title: The effect of a tubocurarine injection in the muscle of a frog and its effect on threshold voltage

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system allows both humans and frogs to interact and respond with the environment through the communication between muscles and the brain. It is important to understand the dynamics of this system in other organisms as it relates to humans. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of tubocurarine on muscle contraction in frogs. Specifically, we determined the effect of tubocurarine on threshold voltage. Tubocurarine is a toxic solution that aims to block ion channels across a membrane. It is commonly used as an anesthetic due to its chemical properties and its ability to relax muscles. Initial and final threshold voltages were measured before and after an injection of 0.2Ml 1M tubocurarine solution into the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg. It was hypothesized that with an injection of tubocurarine, the threshold voltage would increase. However our data showed no consistent data supporting this claim. The inconsistency in results found suggests that while tubocurarine aims to block both sodium and potassium channels across the membrane, the threshold is not significently altered but instead the input and time needed to reach threshold is.


Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is composed of nerves and muscles which allow organisms to move and respond with the environment via communication between muscles and the brain. Skeletal muscle in vertebrates and invertebrates are made up of myofibrils which bound together in order to interact with each other and controll body movements[Johnson:2016].  The brain communicates with muscles through motor neurons. Motor neurons specifically are responsible for sending signals from the brain and spinal cord to muscles. The axons of motor neurons extend into muscles in places called neuromuscular junctions[Johnson:2016]. Neurotransmitters release Acetylcholine which travel across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors at the postsynaptic cell causing sodium channels to open.An action potential is generated and travels down the T-tubule, depolarizing the cell. The depolarization triggers the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium binds to troponin causing the myosin binding sites on the actin to be exposed and myosin binds. This process generates muscle contraction and it exists in both humans and frogs. It is beneficial to use frog legs to conduct this experiment because both frog legs and human legs contain the gastrocnemus muscle and both use the same mechanisms for muscle contraction.  This experiment evaluates the effect of an injection of tubocurarine in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog and its effect on threshold voltage. Threshold voltage is the minimum amount of voltage needed to produce  a muscle contraction. To determine the threshold voltage and force of a contraction a force transducer is attached to a muscle to produce a myogram[Johnson:2016]. Monograms consist of the latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase. Tubocurarine is a toxic neuromuscular blocker which blocks sodium  ion channels across the membrane of a muscle [Kim:2019]. While ion channels are open, tubocurarine works to block ion channels at the neuromuscular junction rather than acting as an acetylcholine  antagonist[Colquhoun: 19778]. A higher threshold voltage would be caused by the blockage of ion channels across the membrane which would cause the need for more input to generate another action potential.It is hypothesized that an injection of tubocurarine into the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog would cause the muscle to have a higher threshold voltage.


Materials and Method:
3 Rania pipien legs were degloved, pinned down, and suspended in the air with a force transducer. An electrode was inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle and connected to a computer with the iWorx software downloaded. Using the iWorx Ep unit, the threshold for the frog muscle without a tubocurarine injection was determined. Once the controll threshold was determined, 0.2Ml of 1M tubocurarine solution was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle. A timer was set for 5 minutes and the frog muscle was gently massaged. After 5 minutes the threshold voltage was determined again. This was repeated 3 times for each frog leg and each threshold voltage was recorded. A one-tailed paired t_test was performed to determine the significance between  original thresholds and thresholds after tubocurarine injections.


Results:
For Leg 1 the initial threshold was 0.25V and after the tubocurarine injection the threshold lowered to 0.15V [Figure 1]. For Leg 2 the initial threshold was 0.07V and after the tubocurarine injection raised to 0.20V [Figure 1]. For Leg 3 the initial threshold was 0.24V and after the tubocurarine injection it lowered to 0.23V [Figure 1]. The average difference in threshold of the controll group was not statistically significently different than the experimental group(t_stat=0.099627 d.f.= 2 P= 0.9297).  The threshold for two out of the three frog legs decreased while only 1 increased. The threshold voltage for both the experimental and controll groups did not exceed 0.25V.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that an injection of tubocurarine will lead to an increase in threshold voltage, was not supported. A potential error that could have occured may have been that the concentration of the tubocurarine was not high enough. If the concentration was to low then the solution would not have affected the muscle and the threshold much. Another potential error is the fact that while shocking the first frog leg, the electrode was not hooked up properly so it was shocked continuously. This might have caused desensitization of the solution which would cause it to stop responding. The threshold voltage decreased the most in Leg 1 compared to the other 2 legs. The threshold voltage would be lowered if tubocurarine was desensitized because it would no longer be acting as an acetylcholine antagonist or be blocking ion channels so the threshold would ultimately be lowered. This explains the drop in threshold voltage in leg 1 [Figure 1]. This experiment is important because tubocurarine could be used as a muscle relaxant or anesthetic. Tubocurarine is responsible for blocking sodium and potassium blocking ion channels rather than acting as an acetylcholine antagonist[Colquhoun: 1979]. If this is true and acetylcholine only blocked ion channels then the threshold of the muscle should not be significently altered due to the presence of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft.  Instead of altering the threshold, tubocurarine would cause an increase in both input and time to reach threshold. This would be caused by the decrease in the number of sodium gates opened on the membrane and the ultimate decrease in amount of sodium ions flowing in. A decrease in sodium ions would cause less calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  This dynamic is how common anesthetics function within the body. Another study also supported the notion that tubocurarine blocks ion channels, specifically potassium channels. The study suggest that tubocurarine blocks the calcium dependent potassium channels[Nohmi: 1984]. Potassium is responsible for the repolarization of a cell after an action potential has occurred. Without repolarization, an action potential will never reach its resting membrane potential as well as its threshold to generate another action potential. The lack of generation of an action potential means the lack of a muscle contraction. If tubocurarine blocks potassium channels then the threshold will not be altered because potassium is associated with the repolarization phase of an action potential. Instead of the threshold being lowered or increased, it would just take a longer time to reach resting potential due to a lack of potassium. Based on this information, for future studies it would be beneficial to record the amount of time necessary to reach threshold to be met with continuous shocks.
