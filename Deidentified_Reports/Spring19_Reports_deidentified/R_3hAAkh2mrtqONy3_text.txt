Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Difference of Weight of Manduca Sexta Over a Given Period of Time 

Abstract:
Different hormones in specific amounts will affect organisms in various ways -- some harmful and some productive. A set of 8 Manduca Sexta were tested in an experiment to find if Juvenile Hormone (JH) given orally in food would affect the amount of growth. To do so, a control group was given food with two drops of water; whereas, the treatment group was given two drops of 1 Gregulator 1:1250 (JH). In this experiment we evaluate the weight differences from the control and treatment groups. The idea was that the treatment group would have a greater difference in growth from day 1 to 14 than the control group. The statistical data supported this hypothesis and showed that the treatment group had a greater amount of growth on average. 


Introduction:
Manduca Sexta are a tobacco hornworm that progress through a life cycle resulting in a moth. The manduca sexta may be affected by a growth hormone, Juvenile Hormone (JH), which controls the type of molt during manduca sexta development, as well as regulates multiple other developmental functions. Juvenile Hormone is known to oppose or prevent immature insects from progressing through metamorphosis. How it works is that the JH places a biochemical restraint on the cellular transformations that controls the overall process of metamorphosis [Williams: 1956]. When given 2 drops of 1 Gregulator 1:1250 (JH) per 10 grams of food, the manduca sexta should develop more quickly than the  control group. 


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca Sexta were used in order to evaluate the effects that the JH had. The eight Manduca Xexta were split into two groups: control and treatment. Having 4 in each group would allow to have different results to average and find a general trend from each. 80 g of food was weighed out and then split evenly to two groups of 40 g, one for the control group and one for the treatment group. The 40 g samples were then split evenly into 4 sections weighing 10 g each.  With this food separated out, each group received 10 grams of food that was pre-made in the lab. The control group’s food had 2 drops of water per 10 grams of food. The treatment group’s food had 2 drops of 1 Gregulator 1:1250 (JH) per 10 grams of food. The reason each group got two drops was to keep consistency in how wet the food was so that only the JH added was the independent variable. The reason that the treatment group was given 2 drops was to test what effects would occur due to 2 drops -- whether the drops will increase or decrease the growth prior to pupation compared to the control group. In order to test the results once the experiment concluded, the two-sample t-test was used because there were two distinct groups to evaluate since they all started at different weights. 


Results:
Observations showed that, in general, the Manduca Sexta seemed to progressively grow and gain weight up until a certain point where they then lost weight. As they started losing weight, they also stopped consuming food and defecating. In some of the Manduca Sexta, a liquid was projected out of their bodies as well. In general, the treatment group showed a larger difference in growth than the control group. When looking at statistical tests to use, the data had two main groups: control and treatment.  Due to this, the two-sample t-test seemed to be the most accurate to compare the data. Based on the two-sample t-test results, the sample was not significantly different as the data showed the (t-value = 26, degrees of freedom = 1.1455, t-test = &lt;0.5). 


Discussion:
The manduca sexta that were given 1 Gregulator 1:1250 JH had a larger average growth than the manduca sexta in the control group that received no special treatment. When looking at both groups, the manduca sexta all gained weight and then lost weight towards the end of the measurement period. Based on the t-test result of &lt;0.5, the experiment failed to reject the null hypothesis. The hypothesis supports that the manduca sexta that were given JH had a larger average difference in growth than the control group. As other studies have also supported in the past, the fact that JH inhibits the start of pupation allows the manduca sexta given JH to grow more quickly and heavier than the control groups [Williams. 1956]. In order to evaluate the amount of JH that will allow the manduca sexta to continue to grow more without being harmed by the JH, more studies should be conducted using varying amounts of drops of JH.

Figure Legends: 

Figure 1. This represents the average of differences in weight between the control and treatment groups.  Over the 14 days evaluated, the difference between final weight and initial weight was taken and averaged between the 4 Manduca Xexta in each group. The treatment group had a greater average of growth than the control group.
