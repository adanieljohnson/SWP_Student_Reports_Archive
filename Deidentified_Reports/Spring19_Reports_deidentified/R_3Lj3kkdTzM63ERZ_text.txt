Title: The effects of Precor 1:1250 on Manduca Sexta caterpillars.

Abstract:
Manduca sexta also known as the hornworm has been studied over the years for its hormone activity. In our experiment, we tried to see the effects of Precor1:1250 – an insect growth regulator (IGR) – on Manduca caterpillars. We put some of the IGR in their diet and observed them for 14 days. Our results were that the IGR had no effect on the Manduca caterpillar as they still continued to grow without seizing.

Introduction:
This experiment serves to observe and evaluate the effects of an insect growth regulator (IGR) in Manduca caterpillars. IGRs differ from traditional synthetic insecticides like carbamates that are toxic to insects directly. An insect growth regulator instead leads to abnormalities that reduce insect survival by affecting physiological regulatory processes essential to normal development of the insects or offspring [Siddal: 1976]. One way IGRs work is by altering hormone activity. Hormones are chemical signals in animals that help the body to communicate certain activities such as growth and metabolic processes. Much like humans have hormones that enable the transition from childhood to adulthood, insects also have hormones that regulate their growth. An example of such a hormone is Juvenile Hormone (JH). Juvenile hormone is responsible for molting during the development of the Manduca Sexta. When it is time for the Manduca Sexta caterpillar to move into the pupa stage, the Juvenile Hormone reduces its amount at a time known as the commitment pulse [Kenji: 2003]. The Manduca Sexta is being used because they have been studied intensively with regards to their hormone activity. In this experiment, I will use Precor 1:1250 which is an IGR that alters the Juvenile Hormone in the Manduca Sexta caterpillar. It is our assumption that if I should give the Manduca caterpillar Precor 1:1250, they will seize to grow into a pupa and consequently wouldn’t become adult insects.

Materials and Methods:
I divided the 8 Manduca caterpillar into two groups randomly. One group was the control and the other was the experimental. I put one caterpillar in a cell in the specified container. I then punctured holes in the containers and labelled the containers with group names, TA name, section, treatment or control. I also labelled each cell to keep track of each caterpillar. I measured 10g of food for each Manduca. For the control, I added 8 drops of water and for the experimental, I added 8 drops of Precor 1:1250 and stirred it well to have a consistent food sample for each Manduca caterpillar. I then made the food into a blob and placed the blob into the cell of the respective Manduca caterpillar. I then measured the weights of each caterpillar to record their initial weights before the experiment. I then put both the control and experimental into an incubator which provided them with 12hr light and 12hr darkness. I then measured their weights daily and observed any changes as well as prepare food when necessary. I then performed a two-tailed-T-test with the means of the control and experimental weights to determine the p-value and standard deviation.

Results:
The mean weight of the control was 6.55 while the mean weight for the experimental was found to be 4.09. The p-value from the two-tailed statistical test was 0.30619. I found the standard deviation to be 3.3419 for the control and 2.4612 for the experimental. The first Manduca caterpillar started to turn very brown by the end of the experiment. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the Manduca Sexta will seize to grow when introduced to Precor1:1250 was not supported. The p-value was greater that 0.05 and that suggests that the presence of the Precor1:1250 had no effect on the growth of the Manduca caterpillars. The Precor1:1250 failed to alter the Juvenile hormone quantity in the caterpillars and as such did not seize the growth of the caterpillars. As a result, the caterpillars didn’t remain in their larvae stage but rather try to become pupae [Kenji: 2003]. This means that we should study more about the hormones in Manduca caterpillars and broaden the search for an insect growth regulator that will have the effect we had hoped for. Understanding how the hormone receptors work and why Precor1:1250 couldn’t alter JH amounts could serve as a breakthrough for choosing better IGRs.
