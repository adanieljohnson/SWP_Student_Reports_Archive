Title: The Effect of Azadachrine on the Growth in Length of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Caterpillars of Manduca Sexta are prime examples of insects with a holometabolous life cycle in which there are four distinct developmental stages. Their molting cycle, which dictates their transition from one stage to the next, is regulated by two primary hormones: juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In this experiment, we tested how blocking ecdysterone would affect the growth in length of caterpillars of Manduca sexta, administering azadachtrin (an ecdysterone) blocker in the diet of our treatment group. Throughout the 13 day period of this experiment, we noticed that the treatment group experienced decreased growth and worsened health as compared to the controll group, but our results did not prove to be statistically significent due to challenges in measuring length and overall inconsistencies in data. Thus, we cannot definitively conclude (due to insignificent statistics) that blocking ecdysterone stunts overall growth of caterpillars of Manduca sexta, but we can infer that blocking ecdysterone does weaken and impair the growth of caterpillars due to observations. 


Introduction:
Pest controll proves itself an enduring issue in the world of agriculture and successful farming. Caterpillars of Manduca sexta, colloquially known as tobacco hornworms, fall under this pest category in their larvae form, feeding on the upper leaves of tobacco plants [“Hawk moth”: 2019]. Caterpillars of Manduca sexta have a holometabolous life cycle, which is characterized by four distinct stages: egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. In this experiment, we focused on the larvae stage of the Manduca sexta. The larvae stage can be broken down into 5 different “instar” phases. These different instar phases signal a progression in growth, from the first to fifth instar. By the fifth instar, the larvae will transition to the pupal phase and undergo major metamorphosis to transition to the adult stage [Nijhout: 1975]. The timing of Manduca sexta stages of growth is regulated by the production and release of two hormones: juvenile hormone (also referred to as JH) and ecdysterone (also known as 20E) from the prothoracic gland [Rewitz: 2006] . Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt during development, whereas ecdysterone controlls the timing of molting during insect development. These hormones do not necessarily work in tandem, however. Once ecdysterone production begins, juvenile hormone production decreases. Further research shows that when there are low levels of juvenile hormone and high levels of ecdysone, the insect subsequently molts from a larvae to a pupae [Johnson: 2018]. In our experiment in particular, we sought to determine whether blocking ecdysterone would affect the caterpillars of Manduca sexta in terms of length. We chose to focus on the ecdysterone hormone because we knew that ecdysterone controllled the timing of molt for caterpillars of Manduca sexta, which meant that blocking ecdysterone could potentially slow down the rate of the molting process and decrease overall growth. Thus, we were operating under many biological inquiries. Would blocking ecdysterone slow down growth rate (in terms of length)? Would administration of ecdysterone slow down tor potentially terminate the progression of instar phases? Would ecdysterone blockage result in an inability for caterpillars of Manduca sexta to reach the pupal stage? If we were able to address these questions in our experiment, we could potentially shed light on effective pest controll. By administering azadachtrine, an ecdysterone blocker, into the diets of our experimental group, we sought out to figure out blocking ecdysterone would detriment growth (especially considering that high levels of ecdysterone are necessary for the molt from larvae to pupa). The azadachtrine sample came from the insecticide Azaguard, which is characterized as a “3% Azadirachtin formulated Insect Growth Regulator” and prevents molting between larval and pupal stages. [AZAGUARD: 2017]. We hypothesized that the addition of azadirachtin into the diets of our caterpillars of Manduca sexta treatment group would stunt their growth due to the importance of ecdysterone (blocked by azadachtrin) in furthering insect development.


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we obtained eight total caterpillars of Manduca sexta. We technically “selected” our caterpillars from a container holding fifty-plus caterpillars, yet we did thoroughly check for commitment pulses before selecting our caterpillars. If the caterpillar had a commitment pulse, which signified that the caterpillar was close to the pupation stage, it was not selected. Because we wanted to specifically test the effect of blocking ecdysterone on pupation,  we could not choose caterpillars who were inevitably about to pupate. Once we obtained our eight caterpillars (none of which showed a commitment pulse),  we randoMly designated four of the caterpillars as our controll group. The remaining four caterpillars were placed into our treatment group. On day one, each controll group caterpillar received 10.00 grams of protocol food (obtained from a company called Great Lakes Manduca) with exactly 6 drops of diluted water added to it by a clean pipet. Using a different pipet, we added exactly 6 drops of azadirachtin (3% concentration) to each 10.00 gram clump of food for the treatment group. Thus, the only difference between the conditions between the controll and treatment group is that the controll group received food that only contained 6 drops of diluted water, whereas the treatment group received food that contained 6 drops of azadirachtin. Following food preparation on day one, we measured the length of each caterpillar (in centimeters). This same procedure would be repeated each day: the food was refilled and restored (if necessary) and the caterpillars were stretched straight and measured. We carried this procedure out for a 13 day period, in which a group member would come in during the late afternoon and take out any stale food or waste and observe and measure each caterpillar, writing down observations. They were stored in a refrigerator at 27 degrees Celsius, and only removed from this environment when measured (which usually lasted around 10 minutes). Because the only difference between the controll and treatment group was diet, we concluded that overall growth differences between the controll and treatment group would be due to the food they were consuming and whether it contained an ecdysterone blocker or did not contain an ecdysterone blocker. Further, in order to determine whether our results were significent, we used a two-tailed one-sample t_test.

Results:
The mean difference in length in centimeters for the controll group caterpillars of the Manduca sexta was 1.1 +/ 0.4830 (figure 1). This means that our four controll group caterpillars grew an average of 1.1 centimeters in the 13-day period, with a standard deviation of 0.4830. This standard deviation tells us how spread out our measurement numbers are. The mean difference in length in centimeters for the treatment group caterpillars of the Manduca sexta was 0.775 +/- 0.8732 (figure 1). Thus, our treatment group caterpillars grew an average of 0.775 centimeters, yet their growth had a larger standard deviation, meaning the measurement values were more spread out. The mean difference in length was not statistically significent  (t_stat=0.6514, d.f.=6, p_value=0.2695). 
One of the general trends we saw across both groups is that the caterpillars progressively became more brown in the 13-day window. They all started out very green. We also noticed that generally (except for one caterpillar in the treatment group), all the caterpillars grew in terms of length, with the controll group experiencing a higher average growth than the treatment group. We also noticed that all of the caterpillars in our controll group had pupated by day 11, whereas only half of our experimental caterpillars had pupated by day 13. Thus, our controll group caterpillars reached pupation earlier than our treatment group.  Lastly, we noticed that less food was consumed each day by the treatment group. As the 13 days went on, their appetites seemed to decrease substantially and more food on average was left untouched in their cell with each passing day.



Discussion:
Our hypothesis that caterpillars of Manduca sexta that were fed 6 drops of azadirachtin would experience stunted growth was rejected because our results were not statistically significent. Despite our results not being statistically significent, in comparison to our controll group, our treatment growth did experience less growth in terms of length. Although our results were inconsistent (as explained later on in the discussion), two of the caterpillars in our treatment group had pupated by day 13, while the other two caterpillars had not. Contrarily, all four caterpillars in the controll group had pupated by day 11. Because the controll group ate food that contained no azadachtrin, there was no type of ecdysterone blockage occurring, which made the molting process occur much more rapidly in the controll group than the treatment group. This supported our belief that blocking ecdysterone slowed down overall insect development [Williams: 2018]. Additionally, the controll group on average grew more in length than the treatment group, and the caterpillars of the controll group proved to be healthier and more durable as the research went on. One of the treatment group caterpillars had essentially exploded by day 13, leaking black residue all over its cell. It was still alive, but barely moving. The rest of our treatment group caterpillars were not at “explosion” level, but they proved to be extremely weak and lethargic as compared to the controll group caterpillars. This led us to believe that addition of azadachtrine into the diets of the caterpillars of Manduca sexta detrimentally affected their growth and livelihood. Thus, a possible consideration for farmers is to incorporate azadachtrine into their forms of pest controll because it could potentially slow or decline insect slow the growth of pupation and/or possibly kill the larvae off. To add to this, research supports that adding azadachtrine into the diets of insects (in this particular case, seed kernels) do not kill off the insects immediately, but rather substantially decrease their diet so they stop eating [Morgan: 2009]. Over time, this can potentially result in reduced feeding overall, delays in development of larvae, malformed pupae and adults, and incomplete ecdysis. This research confirms that azadachtrine is a prime candidate for an insect growth regulator [Tunaz: 2004] because it serves as an insecticide as well as an appetite suppressant, delaying development and/or causing death to the larvae pests.
Because we did observe that our treatment group was eating less than the controll group, and that by the last few days, the treatment group was barely eating at all, This experiment was not error-free. As mentioned before, there were differences in average growth in length of the treatment and controll groups, which initially made us think that blocking ecdysterone significently affected the average length in growth of the treatment growth. However, we neglected to think about the variety of factors that needed to be taken into consideration about this “growth”. We did not anticipate just how hard it would be to measure the length of the caterpillars. They were often squirmy and did not want to be stretched out, so our results experienced variation day to day based on the group member measuring the caterpillars. Because of this, we were not obtaining constant data, meaning our data would fluctuate within the first 8 days. This produced skewed results. As our group cohesion improved, we developed better tactics at measuring and a more consistent technique between the three of us, leading to our results evening out and not experiencing nearly as much variation day to day. Despite our improvements in the measuring process, the average differences in terms of length varied greatly. In our controll growth, the average growth was 1.1 centimeters, but our results in this group ranged from 0.4 cm growth to 1.5 cm growth. Similarly, in our treatment group, the average growth was 0.775 centimeters (which is significently less than our controll group), but the range of growth varied from 0.0 cm to 1.8 centimeters. These ranges could be accounted for in our selection of caterpillars. Although we carefully selected caterpillars that were not displaying a commitment sizes, each caterpillar was a different length (with the 8 caterpillars ranging in lengths from 4.1 to 5.6 centimeters originally) and diameter. Because they were different sizes, some caterpillars could have been further along in the developmental process, meaning their growth was slowing down, nearing pupation. Even though there was no noticeable commitment pulse, some of the caterpillars proved to be closer to  pupation than others, and thus experience less overall growth due to that rather than the presence of absence of azadirachtin in their diets. 
The next logical step for this study would be to expand it. We could use the same controll and original treatment groups (6 drops azadachtrine), but add two additional treatment groups that each received a higher dosage of azadachtrine (for example, treatment group two would receive 9 drops azadachtrine, treatment group three would receive 12 drops azadachtrine). Through this, we could potentially uncover the effects of ecdysterone blockage as azadachtrin concentration increased, and subsequently determine the most effective dosage at impairing insect growth and ultimately killing off these pests (or at least severely weakening them) [AZAGUARD: 2017]. In conclusion, our results were not statistically significent, yet azadahctrin was shown to hinder insect growth on average. If we repeated this experiment again, we could potentially iron out the discrepancies in data collection and caterpillar selection and obtain more statistically significent results.
