Title: The effect of Sodium Channel Blockers on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
In this experiment, the reaction and magnitude was examined in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog. Electrical stimulation was applied and was measured using a piece of equipment provided to the experimenters. Work was being done to determine whether injecting a sodium channel blocker into the muscle would increase the threshold level of the muscle, and at the conclusion of the experiment, this hypothesis was supported. After three trials with three separate frog legs, the results are accurate and reputable. 

Introduction:
In a frog, the gastrocnemus muscle serves an integral part in it’s very livelihood, as it’s primary function lies in allowing the frog to leap from place to place. Along with the Achilles tendon, the gastrocnemus muscle works in providing the frog with a form of locomotion. The tendon and muscle of every living creature work very closely together, because the tendon units shorten and stretch variably depending on the motion, in ways that would be unfavorable for muscle fibers to do alone [Roberts;2002]. In addition to this, the sciatic nerve is important in any signal transport to the muscle. Without this, the frog’s legs would fail to function altogether. In this experiment however, the focus lies in reaction time and magnitude of the said reaction in the gastrocnemus muscle in a frog’s leg. Generally speaking, the threshold reaction must be large enough to theoretically advance the frog from point A to point B, therefore, certain reactions were not taken into account and the shock was reissued to the frog in a higher voltage. Not only is the basic threshold for the gastrocnemus muscle being measured, the experimenters administered lidocaine into the muscle as well and examined how the threshold changed in the experimental group. Their hypothesis was that by injecting the lidocaine (a sodium channel Edstro, they looked at the sciatic nerve as the reason for this difference in reaction and the effect that the lack of sodium to the nerve caused [Anderson;1973]. 

Materials and Method:
Prior to the experiment, a design plan was established and each group member had an understanding of what would be tested, measured, and how to use the equipment necessary for this experiment particularly. On the day of the experiment, they were provided with three frog legs, the machine to administer shocks and measure the reactions, pins, a tray, a pair of scissors, and the lidocaine to inject into the experimental legs. They began by testing the equipment to make sure everything was functioning properly, then began work on the leg to prepare it. The skin was pulled off, and the gastrocnemus muscle was removed partially so that it could be connected to the instrument which the leg was to be hung from. They proceeded to add ringer solution to the leg and administered several shocks of different magnitudes to test the original threshold. After finding the threshold of frog leg 1, .1mm of lidocaine was injected into the leg and after approximately 5 minutes, the threshold was tested again. This same process was repeated for the other two frog legs. After the experiment was completed, the group disposed of the legs and sanitized their station. All of the results of the experiment were recorded in a Google excel spreadsheet and shared with the group. 

Results:
In the above graph, “The threshold of Frog’s gastrocnemus muscle”, the legend indicates that series 1 (controll) is consistently lower than series 2 (experimental). The results of this experiment support the experimenter’s hypothesis that said the threshold of the experimental group would be greater than that of the controll. This shows that the sodium channel blocker that was inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog did, in fact lessen the reaction in the frog. Therefore, a greater voltage was needed in order to reach the threshold. 

Discussion:
In this experiment, the importance of sodium in muscle contraction in an organism is portrayed. The sodium plays an integral role in transport and diffusion which encourage muscle contraction. The hypothesis was ultimately supported, and it supports the notion of sodium in muscle contraction. The Department of Zoology at the University of California did a study in which they examined the muscle changes in volume in the muscles of a frog and ultimately, their experiment’s results matched the results in this experiment [Baskin;1967]. It is evident that the role of a frog’s legs play an important role in it’s life as a whole, and through this experiment, the primary physiology of the muscles involved are revealed.
