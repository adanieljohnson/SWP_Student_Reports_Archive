Title: Increased Amounts of Ecdysterone (E20) Inhibit Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators are common pesticides that affect young insects by preventing them from developing through the molting stage of their life cycle. These pesticides imitate the functions of developmental hormones such as Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone. It is important to understand how insect growth regulators are an effective pesticide so that we can safely utilize its function without harming crops, wildlife, and the human population. Due to the fact that ecdysterone is one of the main hormones affecting development within arthropods, we decided to conduct an experiment observing how an insect growth hormone that mimics ecdysterone affects the development of the Manduca sexta. In order to test this, we treated Manduca sexta with an insect growth regulator known as Azaguard. Prior to this experiment, we hypothesized that if increased levels of insect growth regulators ,that mimicked ecdysterone, were introduced to the Manduca sexta, the average mass and length of the insects would be lower than that of the control group. After conducting this experiment, the results supported this hypothesis through statistical evidence, with significant p values, that showed the average mass and length of the treated group was much lower than that of the control group. 


Introduction:
Hormones are used within organisms to control many major functions. They are chemical messengers secreted by endocrine glands into the bloodstream that bind to receptors on or within the cell to affect their function. Hormones control how the organism will function in response to external or internal factors that have been sensed by the brain. Within insects, such as the Manduca sexta, hormones have the ability to affect how the body is arranged. Insect growth regulators are effective pesticides through their ability to mimic these hormones by increasing or decreasing the amount of developmental hormones within an insect. Common pesticides in the agricultural industry focus on affecting an insect’s nervous system through the use of neurotoxins. This can negatively affect beneficial organisms and the human population. Graf states that even though IGRs are not as effective as conventional insecticides, further research in this topic can lead to a safer and potentially even more effective way of controlling pest populations [Graf: 1993]. This potential of IGRs’ effectiveness brings up the question of how IGRs’ are able to inhibit growth and end up leading to premature death. Ecdysterone, which is secreted in the prothoracic glands, regulates at what point biological changes such as molting occur. If an IGR is able to disrupt these hormone levels, this would be an effective way to control pest populations. Because of this, we decided to test how these insect growth regulators affect development in the Manduca sexta through a disruption of the ecdysterone levels. We hypothesized that if increased levels of insect growth regulators, that mimicked ecdysterone, were introduced to the Manduca sexta, the average mass and length of the insects would be lower than that of the control group.


Materials and Methods:
We were able to test the effects of ecdysterone on the development of the Manduca sexta by separating 8 random caterpillars into two groups. The treatment group of four caterpillars were placed into their own separate containers and fed 10 grams of food containing 5 drops of a diluted insect growth regulator known as Azaguard which imitates the hormone ecdysterone or 20E. The control group of the other 4 caterpillars were also placed in their own separate containers and were fed food containing 5 drops of water to eliminate external factors from the experiment. Boths groups were randomly placed in an incubator with even light and temperature. The caterpillars’ mass and length were measured each day for two weeks. At the end of the experiment, the masses and lengths of the caterpillars were averaged per group and per each day. Also, a 2-sample t-test was calculated to ensure that our results were significant. 


Results:
The results of of t-tests provided one-tailed p values far below the significant value of .05. The p values were 1.48E-5 and 6.43E-5. In figures 1 and 2, between day four and day five, there was a significant deviation between both the mass and length measurements due to a sharp increase of the control groups development. In figure one there was an increasing trend correlated to the control group while the treated group mass remained fairly level. In figure 2 there was an increasing trend in the control group until day 9. Also the treatment group showed minimal fluctuation throughout the two week period.  Around day 8 to day 9 on both mass and length values of the control group began to level and slightly decrease. 


Discussion:
The average masses  and lengths of the control group as the experiment was conducted is significantly higher than the average measurements of the treated group. Based off of our results, we can conclude that the insect growth hormone, ecdysterone, does inhibit growth within the Manduca sexta. This is proved through statistical data that had a p value below .05. This rejects the null hypothesis due to the fact that the treated data was significantly different than control data. The trends in our data support our alternative hypothesis that this insect growth hormone regulates growth is supported. This outcome was caused due to the fact that this insect growth hormone caused the ecdysterone hormone levels to remain high. The ecdysterone levels within a Manduca sexta that has not been treated first begin to increase after the last larval instar causing the insect to stop feeding and enter what is called the wandering stage until it finds a significant place to pupate. After this first pulse, the caterpillar is only able to produce a pupal cuticle when next exposed to a molting surge of ecdysterone [Nijhout: 2013]. This is known as the commitment pulse which induces pupation. Nijhout states that this hormone is secreted periodically to pinpoint when pupation should occur. If the levels of ecdysterone in a Manduca sexta are kept high, the caterpillar will not be able to pupate and remains underdeveloped. The insect growth regulator, Azaguard, effectively does this by mimicking the hormone ecdysterone. Due to the fact that the treatment group was given this additional insect growth regulator, this information supports the data recovered from this experiment. S.M. Ismail conducted a similar experiment which treated Lepidoptera with ecdysterone prematurely. This caused the larvae to stop feeding and attempt to molt before the last larval instar [Imail: 2000]. This experiment further supports our experiment, due to the fact that the increased levels of ecdysterone, which is mimicked by azadirachtin, caused premature development and little growth in similar insects. The next logical step for this study would be to increase the sample size of the experiment so that external factor have less of an influence on average development of the caterpillars. Also, multiple other group could be added with differing concentrations of hormones which could further show how increased levels of the hormone affect a Manduca sexta. In further studies the caterpillars access to food should be emphasized due to the fact that in this study food was not always fresh and abundant. This could eliminate many external factors that could affect the rate of which the caterpillars were growing. This experiment is significant due to the fact that insect growth regulators could be a safe and effective alternative to traditional pesticides that use neurotoxins. Insect growth regulators mimic natural hormones with the Manduca sexta that influence development. It is important to determine what regulators would be most effective at effecting insect growth rates.
