Title: Betta Splendens and their behavioral responses to other males with the presence of food

Abstract:
The underlying concepts of this experiment are observing the Betta Splendens and their behavioral responses and their resource allocation to specific stimuli. By adding other factors such as the food, one can see how behavioral responses to the other males decrease due to the preference of food and the habituation of the fish. In this experiment the factor of food compared to no food caused the Betta Splendens to act less aggressive towards the other male present. Overall, the experiment shows that the addition of food was able to significantly change the behavioral response of Betta Splendens to one another and show that habituation of the fish will cause an increase of food over fighting. With those results, the hypothesis was not supported significantly. The experimental results are important because the ability to see whether food would increase agnostic behaviors in animals such as Betta Splendens allows the idea of increasing food for other animals to see if their behaviors are affected. 

Introduction:
Animal behaviors have been studied for a long time are a very important aspect of the animal kingdom due to the many different species and the complex and changing environments that they live in. Behaviors are a resultant of an organism being exposed to a stimulus, which is a thing or event that evokes a specific functional reaction in an organ or tissue. One important concept is resource allocation, the Researching and reporting the many different behaviors is crucial to understanding how and why animals act the way they do. Ethology is the study of animal behavior and is a very critical area of biology because it allows scientists to culminate their skills of natural history, laboratory methods, and their theories from ecology. The area of behavior also helps scientists understand the physiological purpose for the exhibited behaviors and how those behaviors have changed or shaped be evolution or natural selection. The species being observed in the lab are the betta fish or Betta Splendens. They are excellent specimens for experiments detailing aggressive behavior because they are both a common fish as well as they exhibit multiple obvious behavioral responses. When in the presence of another male Betta Splendens exhibit aggressive or agnostic behaviors, which can be observed by their fins and movements. When exposed to different stimuli Bettas Splendens exhibit usually aggressive behavioral response but over time the fish are affected by habituation and due to the habituation of the Betta Splendens, they will prioritize their energy rather than fighting. The study of Rhoad, Kalat, and Klopfer also show that over time Betta Splendens due tend to decrease their aggressive behavior towards others with the presence of different stimuli [Rhoad 1975]. The results of this study could be important to the results of the proposed experiment because the Betta Splendens might choose to go for the food rather than fight. My hypothesis for the experiment is that with the introduction of food, the Betta Splendens will exhibit more aggressive behavior than without food because they will choose to expend energy in order to have complete control over the food they are provided with. With the stimulus present, the Betta Splendens will consider there is food to be fought over and thus choose to exert more energy to obtain and protect the food from the other male.

Materials and Methods:
The experiment had eight trials all of which had two male Betta Splendens that were either exposed to food first or not for five minutes and then five minutes of rest in between. We observed what the Betta Splendens’ reactions to food alone was like to establish a baseline and to make sure the observed behaviors were truly aggressive. We then took two different tanks which had both an opaque and glass partition. For this experiment we choose to only remove the opaque partition, so the behaviors of the fish were uninterrupted. Four of the trials started with Betta Splendens exposed to food first for five minutes with their behaviors recorded and then five minutes without food. The other four trials started without food first for five minutes, and then they were exposed to food for five minutes after. We recorded their aggressive behavior by timing the duration of the exhibited aggressive behavior. We choose two behaviors to record which were the red mane or opercular flaring and the pelvic fin flickering. We also choose to multiply the time spent flaring the operculum by two because that behavior is considered more aggressive than pelvic fin flickering. For consistency, the fish were fed around the same amount of food each time and we had one tank for food and one without food so that there was no at all of the food for the trials without food. All the data for the trials without food first and with food first were separated and we calculated the means and standard deviation. To portray the results of the experiment the statistical test chosen to compare the data was a paired t-test which tests the null hypothesis that means values of the measured variable was statistically different.

Results:
For there to be a significant difference observed, the group’s P values must be above 0.05 or p≥0.05. In figure 1 below, the data collected is displayed in graphs detailing the differences in means with the standard deviation applied. The data for the time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior shows root to that mean of the without food first data was higher than the with food first. (with food first: 178.7, ±130.7, without food first: 260.4, ±130.9) [Figure 1]. The data for fish four was omitted in the results because in both cases the time was zero. The results of the t-test show that the mean of the group without food first was statistically different. (t-stat = 1.65, df = 7, P = 0.15). The results show that the group without food first had a significant difference between the other group allowing for the interpretation to be significant.

Discussion:
The hypothesis proposed for the lab was shown to be not supported by the statics of the paired t-test. The Betta Splendens without food exhibited more aggressive behavior for a longer duration of time compared to the time of the Betta Splendens with food first. The results are understandable because during the trials with the food, there was some aggressive behavior present, but on most occasions the Betta Splendens were distracted by the food. In a study by Bols and Hogan, when comparing food and aggressive display as reinforcers the Betta Splendens would swim faster and act more aggressive towards the food, which could mean that food is inherently more attractive than the sight of another male fish [Bols 1979]. The results of Bols’ experiment relate to that this lab because in both the aggressive displays from another male are a weaker reinforcer than food. The Betta Splendens’ focus on the food actually makes sense because if they are not really threatened by the other male, they will go for the food. The habituation of going for food rather than fighting would be considering factor in the results, because over time the fish might have been conditioned to go after food if the threat is not viable. The results could be due to some limiting factors such as there being a little bit of food present in the tank without food. The presence of food was due to the switching of the Betta Splendens from the food tank to the non-food tank. Also, the imprecise timing of the aggressive behavior could allow for some error within the calculation of the total response time. In the future, the experiment could be improved by adding more trials and seeing how male Betta Splendens act with food in the presence of a female. This is important because their reactions with the females could affect their ability to mate.

The error bar for the group with food first ±130.7 and the error bar for the group without food first was ±130.9. The results of the t-test show that the mean of the group without food first was statistically different.
