Title: Effects of Caffeine on the Neuromuscular Control in the Gastrocnemius of a Rana pipiens specimen

Abstract:
This experiment tested the results of injecting the gastrocnemius of a northern leopard frog with caffeine. Specifically, whether or not the response (AMP) was stronger after the injection than before the injection. The hypothesis was proven correct and the muscle contraction was stronger after the injection. This conclusion was determined by comparing the average response (AMP) observations and finding a significant difference between the measurements. 


Introduction:
The northern leopard frogs, Rana pipiens, come from a genus that is considered to be one of the most intensively used amphibians in scientific research. Frogs from the Rana genus and family Ranidae are semi-aquatic animals, with strong legs that are ideal for jumping high and far distances. They are known to be the “frog of choice” in comparative anatomy research and musculoskeletal physiology education [O’Rourke: 2007]. Three legs of Rana pipiens were the subjects of this experiment, and they have muscles that are composed of various parts that aid in their contraction. Myofibers, which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused bundles of cells, are individually bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups that are also known as skeletal muscles. Motor neurons innervate skeletal muscles. The neurons’ axons branch out after reaching the muscle in order to innervate as many individual myofibers as possible. This innervation occurs at the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine is then released from the presynaptic nerve terminal after the nerve impulses hit the neuromuscular junction. Afterward​, acetylcholine binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic nerve, sodium channels open, an action potential generates, and the action potential runs through the muscle fiber. This process stimulates the release of calcium, which then contracts the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. This muscle activity will be observed in the lab by isolating the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog and applying an AMP stimulus. The control will be a muscle covered with the Ringer’s frog solution, and the treatment will be injected with caffeine. Electromyograms will be recorded and analyzed by a software called iWorx. The hypothesis of this lab is that the caffeine will cause the muscle of the frog to contract harder than when caffeine is not used at all. 


Materials and Methods:
The frog leg was placed on the dissecting pan and then skinned. The skin was pulled down from the top of the leg towards the foot. This process was executed very carefully to ensure that the muscle tissue and nerves were not damaged. Afterward, the inner thigh muscle was separated in order to expose the sciatic nerve, which was differentiated from the white connective tissue. The leg was moistened with Ringer’s solution and the gastrocnemius was prepared. The end of the gastrocnemius closest to the foot was cut specifically to leave a decent amount of the achilles tendon on the muscle. Then, a string was tied around the achilles and the muscle was suspended by tying the string to the transductor and pining the rest of the leg to the dissecting pan. The stimulation pin was poked into the gastrocnemius muscle and stabilized to ensure an accurate reading. A series of stimuli with different intensities was distributed by the BNC-banana adapter to the muscle and the response was recorded to establish a known baseline. Afterward​, the true experiment began. The AMP stimulus was applied three consecutive times before the caffeine was injected and the response AMP was recorded after each stimulation. The three pulses of the stimulus were repeated after the caffeine was injected and the response was recorded. This entire process was repeated two more times, with a total of three times on three different legs, because an increase in sample size increases the accuracy of the results. Once all data from the stimulus was collected, averages, standard deviations, and standard errors of the AMP responses before and after the caffeine injection were calculated. The summarized data was then analyzed to determine if there was any difference in the response AMP before and after the caffeine was injected. 



Results:
The measurements analyzed indicate that the caffeine produces a stronger muscle contraction. As seen in the chart and the recorded averages of the response (AMP) before and after the injection of caffeine, the records of responses after the injection are much higher. 

Discussion:
From the results of the experiment, we can conclude that the hypothesis was supported. The response (AMP) was stronger on average and with each individual recorded stimulus after the injection of caffeine, rather than before the injection. This response took place because the caffeine increased the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which caused the muscle to contract harder. Caffeine has been found to have a dose-dependent​ effect on the force of muscle contraction and duration of muscle contraction. The increase in calcium release is a result of physical coupling and conformational changes in the voltage sensitive dihydropyridine receptor [Olorunshola and Achie: 2011]. This increase in contraction force would account for a shorter contraction time until fatigue.
