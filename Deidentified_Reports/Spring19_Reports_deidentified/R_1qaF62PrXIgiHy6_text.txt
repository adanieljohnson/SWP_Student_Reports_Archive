Title: Enhancement of JH Levels in Manduca sexta Shows no Physical Deformities or Loss of Mass

Abstract:
As Juvenile Hormone (JH) is known to a be crucial in the development and maturation of the Manduca sexta, questions can be posed as to effects that would arise from changes in JH levels in these organisms. This particular experiment focused on the effects of a JH enhancer (Precor) on growth in weight for Manduca sexta before reaching pupation. It is known that JH drops off right before pupation, therefore it was hypothesized that if JH was enhanced in an experimental group, weight gain would decrease and physical abnormalities would arise. To test this hypothesis, a control group was fed a normal diet, while a test group was fed a diet that included a dosage of Precor. Over a two-week time period, the organisms were weighed regularly to collect data for statistical testing. This methodology found that the test group with enhanced JH on average outweighed the control organisms by over two grams, as the average for the experimental group was 7.63g and the control had an average of 4.9 g.  Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis. Although the JH enhanced organisms never reached pupation, our experimental question and hypothesis did not include this in the parameters, and therefore could only conclude that JH enhancing Precor does not cause any weight deficits or physical deformities. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, are a species under the Order Lepidoptera that are considered a model organism. As a model organism is an organism that has been studied widely and thoroughly, and thus can be used for experimentation with a solid base of knowledge on which to base hypotheses and results [Johnson: 2018]. A unique characteristic of this species is that it is considered holometabolous, meaning that it goes through four major life stages instead of the three that are seen in hemimetabolous species [Johnson: 2018]. The extra stage is the pupal stage, which comes in between the larval and adult stages, denoting it as a transition from youth into adulthood [Johnson: 2018]. As this transition occurs with a drop in Juvenile Hormone (JH) levels, many questions come to mind on how changes in JH levels could affect the development of this species. In further researching JH and the Manduca sexta, it has been noted that removing JH has been proven to shorten the larval stage and promote development into pupation [Kiguchi: 1978]. This is rational, as differentiation depends on the JH levels, and if they are not there then the organism will remain a “juvenile” organism for less time [Kiguchi: 1978]. Therefore, we used this knowledge to form a question of our own. If removing JH helps to advance growth of the organism, will promoting JH levels hurt the growth of the species?  In more specific terms, if we feed a treatment group food with a JH promoting compound called “Precor”, will the growth of the organisms, which we can measure by weight, be stunted before pupation? Thus, we will be measuring weight as our dependent variable, relying upon the independent variable, which is the presence of Precor. This question is important for many reasons, as it will help us better understand how experimenting with hormones works on an organism whose normal hormone function is already known. In a different sense, if such JH promoting compounds can be seen to stunt growth prior to pupating, then the implications for developing insecticides with JH enhancers can be further researched [Thompson: 2007]. Based off of prior knowledge and research, we expect that if Precor is introduced to a treatment group to increase JH levels, then this group will have decreased weight in comparison to a control group. We also predict that these treatment organisms may exhibit some physical abnormalities not seen in control organisms.

Materials and Methods:
In the lab, each group was given six individual organisms for testing, thus we split them into two groups of three so as to have enough data for significant testing. We placed the two groups into two separate containers, and within these containers each organism had its own section with its own food. To ensure that the organisms could breathe, holes were drilled into each section. To keep track over the course of the experiment, each container and organism was labeled. As we had decided already on Precor as our JH enhancer, we then determined that the test group would receive four drops of this compound each time that they were fed. The control group was given ten drops of water, which meant that the test group must receive six drops so as to keep total liquid content the same. Each respective liquid was mixed into the provided food for the organisms, of which 10 grams must be given each time they were fed. The organisms were then weighed on small lab scales to get an initial weight. Once all of this preliminary set up was completed, our group weighed the worms five times per week over the two week period, and feed the worms when they run out of food. During this time, the worms were kept at an incubator that kept them at an optimal temperature for the species. If any of the individual organisms began to pupate, their weights would no longer be measured. This is due to the fact that the research question was based solely before pupation occurs. For statistical significance testing with our results, a two-sample T-test with an alpha value of 0.05 was used to determine acceptance or rejection of our hypothesis.

Results:
In looking at the data for our experiments, a few trends are noticeable. In the beginning phases of the experiment, our control worms were growing at a much faster rate than our experimental group. However, this trend began to fade, and our experimental group began to outweigh our control group significantly. This trend continued through the end of the data collection. Once all data was determined, it was found that the average growth in weight over the time period was larger for the experimental group by over 2.7 grams more than the average for the control group, as the averages were 7.63 g and 4.9 g respectively (Fig. 1). Using a 2-sample T-test to test if our control group had significantly lower weights than the control group (Ha), a p-value of .986 was generated.

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis that the increase in JH levels would stunt growth in weight and cause physical abnormalities, as the experimental group actually gained more weight over the time period. As it turns out, our research question and hypothesis were not refined enough to fit perfectly with the data to describe it as accurately as possible. We used only weight as a parameter for growth, and did not include reaching (or failing to reach) pupation as a measure of growth and a completed cycle. Therefore, our alternative hypothesis that the average weights of the experimental group would be significantly less than that of the control group was disproven. The biological explanation for this is quite simple, as increased JH only keeps larvae from reaching the pupal stage, however does not keep these organisms from continuing to grow in their extended time as larvae. This can be seen quite clearly, as the test group did have an obviously higher average growth before pupation (Fig. 1). Our test group continued to accrue mass, whereas the control group began to pupate and lost significant mass during that process. This shows that although we were looking for quantitative data, the best data for our type of experiment would have been a bit more qualitative.  The 2-sample T-test that we conducted for statistical significance was based upon a null hypothesis stating that the growth (in grams) in a JH enhanced group would not be less than that of a control group before pupation, and an alternative hypothesis that stated the opposite. This test resulted in a large p-value, meaning that we would accept the null hypothesis with confidence. An argument to assess the organisms qualitatively can be further supported by a 1973 study on JH-esterase, and enzyme that breaks down JH and limits its bioavailability [Weirich: 1973]. This study found that the JH-esterase levels for Manduca sexta were at the highest levels right when the organisms committed to pupation [Weirich: 1973]. After what we have previously studied in our experiment, this would help to support the fact that experimental organisms with enhanced JH would not pupate, as JH-esterase would not be able to break it all down. On the other hand, the control group would mature much faster, as its JH levels would be diminished by the enzyme right as it begins to pupate [Weirich: 1973]. To better our experiment, we could reframe our research question, alter our methods, and repeat the study with a modified hypothesis. Therefore, our research question could be reframed to examine if JH inhibits the maturation of the organism, rather than just inhibits its weight gain essentially. Once this is changed, our modified hypothesis would be that we expect the JH experimental group to have inhibited maturation and reach pupation later than controls or not at all. In our methods, we would now be keeping track of days until pupation (or if pupation occurs), as well as taking better qualitative notes. When it comes to the significance of the study to real life application and the larger body of scientific knowledge, we are a bit limited in that our experiment was flawed in a few ways. However, we did still observe some important changes. We could still conclude that any pesticide focused around enhancing larval JH could still be effective and does have the potential to be studied further. If this were to be done on a large scale, this could improve agriculture, while also not directly killing the organisms. On an even broader scale, our study did effectively represent the way that hormones can work to alter not only the actions of an organism, but also to change genetic expression and halt entire life cycles.
