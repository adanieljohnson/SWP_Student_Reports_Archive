Title: The Effects of Insect Growth Regulator on Manduca Sexta Larvae in Progressing Towards Pupation Faster

Abstract:
Manduca sexta are moths that are deemed pests in the larval phase by farmers. Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) overactivated JH, a crucial hormone in the development of Manduca sexta larvae. If IGR is provided to the larvae, then the larvae should grow faster but never reach the pupation stage. Three larvae with IGR were compared to three controll larvae with regular food. The average change in weight from the initial weight to the final weight was greater in the treatment group, suggesting that IGR makes the larvae grow faster. However, a two-sample t_test proved that the result did not reject the null hypothesis. Due to errors with one larva, the experiment should be repeated with more larvae and more time to more accurately analyze the effects of IGR on the growth of Manduca sexta larvae. This experiment can help farmers in developing a solution to get rid of Manduca larvae since they are pests. 

Introduction:
Hormones play a crucial role in the development of the Manduca sexta especially in its transition stages. The Manduca sexta has a holometabolous life cycle characterized by its four major life stages: egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. At each major transition, the Manduca sexta must mold to change its morphology. These transitions are primarily controllled by three hormones: prothoracicotropic (PITH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). The PITH hormone regulates 20E being released from the prothoraic glands of the Manduca sexta. The JH hormone are primarily released from the corpus allata and together with 20E controll the growth of the Manduca sexta (Johnson; 2018).
	Throughout its life, the Manduca sexta relies on a specific amount of both 20E and JH to progress to its next phase. Without either of these two hormones, the Manduca sexta will die. However, since both are necessary, the regulation of both or of one can impact the rate at which an insect will mature. Agriculturally, the benefits of research and understanding how 20E and JH levels impact the development of Manduca sexta are tremendous. The larvae of Manduca sexta have a different diet than the adult forms. The larvae are deemed “pests” since they feed on solaceous plants such as tobacco [Hussa: 2012]. Studies concerning the size of Manduca sexta and their rate of development show that a faster growing insect will mature faster [Grunert: 2015]. Due to the necessity of JH and 20E, the molting of the Manduca sexta therefore should also correlate. Insect growth regulators (IGR’s) affect the development of insects by either inhibiting or over-activating hormones. Since a drop of JH is required for the insect to pupate, an increase should inhibit the maturation. In this experiment an IGR that will over-activate JH will be used. Therefore, if JH is overactivated, then the Manduca sexta larvae will become bigger faster but will stay in the larval phase longer.



Materials and Method:
The Manduca sexta were acquired in the larval phase and larvae with similar weights were chosen for the experiment. This is to make sure that the larvae would be in around the same larval stage and could be compared to each other. The larvae were separated into two groups: controll and treatment. A habitat with individualized compartments were created and labelled for each larva. The controll group was given 10 grams of Manduca food whenever needed whereas the treatment group was provided with 5 drops of IGR in their food as well. Every couple of days the larvae’s mass was recorded.
	With a two-sample T-test, the two groups can be compared. The mean change in weight from final to initial mass were calculated for each group of larvae. A bar graph with the mean value of change and error bars were created to show a visual of the experiment. A p_value from a one-tailed p_value test was also determined to prove or disprove the hypothesis.



Results:
Throughout the experiment, the larvae grew larger and began to eat more quantities of food each day. Near the end of the experiment, food needed to be given almost every day. Figure 1 shows the average change in weight for each group from the initial mass to the final mass. The treatment group had a higher average change (11.14). The larvae in the treatment group had a higher average change than the controll group. The standard deviation for the treatment group was relatively low as well (1.67), which shows that the larvae were relatively close to the mean. In contrast, the controll group had a lower average change (9.72) and a higher standard deviation value (6.51). The two-sample t_test compares the effects of one variable by using two data sets. If the p_value is less than 0.05 it rejects the null hypothesis. The p_value for this experiment was 0.366165.

Discussion:
This lab examined the effects of an IGR on the growth of Manduca sexta larvae. By providing 5 drops of IGR in the food of the larvae over three weeks, the growth was recorded and analyzed. The hypothesis was that by adding IGR to the food of the larvae, they would mature faster but would not reach the pupation phase. This would be due to the constant amount of IGR in the larvae which would not allow for a drop in JH for the larvae to pupate. Figure 1 provides data showing the average change in weight over the three-week period. The general trend showed that the treatment group had a higher average change in weight than the controll group. However, within the controll group there was a broader standard deviation. This occurred due to one larva that never grew as fast and therefore had a very low change from the initial weight to the final weight. This affected the mean and the standard deviation of the graph. 
	By conducting a two-sample t_test, the p_value can be determined and can therefore prove or disprove the hypothesis. In this case, the statistically significent result was out of the range and failed to reject the null hypothesis and therefore cannot state accurately that our hypothesis is verified. This suggests that the results could have been due to luck instead of a direct causation from the IGR. However, what the results do suggest is that the IGR may have made the larvae grow faster. Unfortunately, the three-week period was not enough to determine whether the pupation would be inhibited or not. The controll group never reached pupation and therefore we cannot accurately determine whether the treatment group would have been slower.
	 The experiment itself had a few errors that could contribute to the high p_value. As stated before, there was one larva that did not grow as fast as the others. We hypothesize that this larva was in a different larval phase than the rest and therefore was not ready to pupate as soon as the others. In general, all the larvae were roughly the same size when initially massed. However, it would be better to make sure that the larvae are all in the same phase to ensure equal comparison. This could be done by beginning by breeding the larvae all at once. Similarly, the experiment should be conducted over a longer period of time to more accurately determine the effects of IGR and should contain more larvae so that in the case that one does not react in the same way it will minimize the standard deviation and mean average. 
	The Manduca sexta larvae are deemed pests in the agricultural world [Hussa: 2012]. If IGR can manipulate the growth of the larvae and speed up the path to pupation, then it would allow a decrease in the amount of Manduca sexta pests. However, the correct timing as to when to remove the IGR would also be necessary. In the future, an examination of when to inhibit JH or over-activate JH would also be interesting to conduct since if the timing could be calculated then an IGR could speed up the process and then allow for the larvae to pupate at a good time.
