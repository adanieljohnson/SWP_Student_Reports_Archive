Title: The Effect of Increased Levels of Juvenile Hormone on Pupation of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
A study was conducted about the role of increases of juvenile hormone towards inhibiting pupation of the Manduca Sexta. The researchers strategically had an experimental group that received JH in their food and control group with only water to test how 6 drops of JH alter growth for the caterpillars in early larva stages. Each day, a team member monitored the progress of the 2 groups and recorded the resulting weights to measure how the manduca sexta have changed over the course of the experiment. After 12 days of experimentation, researchers aimed to discover the difference in averages of weight changes between the control and experimental group to determine the overall effect of the juvenile hormone on the Manduca Sexta’s metamorphosis.  Once completing a sample t-test, the researchers found their data to also be statistically significant and consistent with their hypothesis. Through the researchers experiment, they have found useful information towards understanding life cycles of Manduca Sexta’s and their lack of pupation based on inhibitory factors such as the juvenile hormone.

Introduction:
Juvenile hormones play key roles in the development process for Manduca Sexta species. Juvenile hormones are created by the corpora allata glands. These serve to inhibit growth therefore preventing adulthood. Due to this inhibitory factor, the insects in which they will remain in the nymph or larva stage [Subramanian:2016]. When it is the last larval stage, the corpora allata gland begins to stop production of the juvenile hormone which normally allows for growth as an adult or pupa. During an experiment in 1974 by Nijhout and Williams from Harvard University, they tested how the cessation of juvenile hormone secretion triggers pupation for manduca sextas. The experiments main objective was discovering the underlying cause for metamorphosis which the researchers believed represented declining levels of juvenile hormone in the insects.  Without the implementation of JH, pupation directly occurs, allowing for metamorphosis. This experiment also tested how the corpora allata activity and juvenile hormone titre contributed to the larva’s ability to maintain the critical weight of 5 grams.  As a result of this experiment, the researchers concluded that when a 5th instar larva reaches a weight of 5 grams, the corpora allata activity and juvenile hormone deactivates. Also, as the larva continues to increase in weight, the juvenile hormone declines and begins to release PTTH instead of pupation [Nujhout:1974]. Within the current study, researchers determined how 6 drops of juvenile hormone in their food affects the weight of two groups of Manduca Sextas in comparison to a control group that were treated with only water.  Based on understanding of how juvenile hormones disturb metamorphosis, an increase would essentially prolong the immature stages of the insects. The researchers predicted that if Manduca Sextas are exposed to an excess of juvenile hormone, their life cycles will not progress, causing them to remain in their juvenile stages for weight.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, the researchers ensured that each Manduca Sexta caterpillar lived in uniform environments, experiencing same room temperature and conditions such as being placed in an incubator daily. For the control group, the caterpillars were placed in containers where 6 drops of water were positioned in their food. As for the experimental group, these Manduca Sexta caterpillars had food with 6 drops of the juvenile hormone. Each of the groups were given 10 grams of food and the necessary treatment such as water drops for the control group and 6 drops of JH for the experimental group. For each caterpillar, the initial weight was measured (in grams) and those values were recorded in our Excel spreadsheet. The team members on their scheduled day, measured each caterpillars weight, recorded values and observed any changes between the experimental and control group. After collecting this information, the team member took the necessary steps such as cleaning the containers, resupplying their food or adding new drops of JH. The experiment continued for 12 days in which the same steps were followed as above. On the final day, the final weight of each caterpillar was measured and then each of the groups and the respective containers were disposed. After the study, the group collaboratively completed a 2 tailed, 2-sample T-Test to determine the statistical significance of the experiment.

Results:
As a result of the study, the researchers discovered the changes in weight between the control and experimental group. While the control group received only water in their food, the experimental group had 6 drops of JH in which each day, the researchers tested their changes in weight. Over the course of the 12 days of the experiment, each of the caterpillar showed considerable growth.  For the initial values, each of the masses for the caterpillar were below 4 grams, however by the final day, majority of the  caterpillars weight increased or were not measured based on its own termination. After analyzing the raw data, the group calculated the final mass values - initial mass values and placed the data into Figure 1. From calculating those changes, the group also calculated the average values of each groups overall weight changes, where the control groups average is 8.895 while the experimental group had an average of 3.193. After conducting a sample t-test, our data resulted in (2.660 , 1, 0.037).





Discussion:
Overall, the researchers hypothesis , which was that the increase of JH will directly cause no pupation for the Manduca Sexta insects,  was supported through the data of the experiment. Through this experiment, researchers were able to analyze the role of added JH in inhibiting metamorphosis. As examined by their data, the experimental group with increased JH levels produced an overall lower change in weight in comparison to the control group without the hormonal injection. This supported the idea that decreased levels of JH would contribute to metamorphosis, allowing the caterpillars to achieve adulthood.  By determining the average changes in weight between the control group and experimental group for Manduca Sexta’s, the researchers discovered a significant difference in their results.  The difference between those averages indicate that the experimental groups excess of juvenile hormone led to lack of pupation into the adult stage. Based on caterpillars from groups 3 and 4 dying before the end of the experiment, it is another indicator that JH halts metamorphosis process for Manduca Sexta insects. After producing statistically significant data through a sample t-test, the p value indicated that the experiment was only 3% due to chance which further emphasizes the supported hypothesis. As found by Nijhout and Williams, our researchers found that the lack of JH for the control group allows for normal pupation while increased levels led to limited growth and maintenance of the caterpillars juvenile stages. From this experiment, the current researchers concluded that it requires up to or less than 6 drops of JH for the Manduca Sexta to remain immature in weight. According to past research studies, this could be equivalent to about 3.3 JH to halt adult metamorphosis [Kiguchi:1978]. Also, as within Nijhout and Williams data, they found that once the larva attains 5 grams in weight, the secretion of JH stops and the CA activity is deactivated which helped us understand reasoning for the lack of mature growth in our caterpillars. For future references, researchers suggest completing the daily observation and laboratory tasks at the same time to avoid confounding variables and potentially skewed data.  The researchers concluded that their hypothesis was supported in reference to how the 6 drops of JH to each experimental group led to the least amount of overall change of growth compared to the untreated control group.
