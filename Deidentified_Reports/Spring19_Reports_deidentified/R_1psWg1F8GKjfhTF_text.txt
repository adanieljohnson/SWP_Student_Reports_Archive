Title: The size of the water tank has no effect on the amount of intraspecific agonistic behaviors that two Betta splendens males present

Abstract:
The experiment is designed to figure out the relationship between tank size and the amount of intraspecific agonistic behavior that two Betta splendens males present. Red “mane” is a high ranked agonistic behavior in aggressiveness presented by Bettas and it is selected as the representation for the intraspecific agonistic in this experiment. The insignificant differences got form the results reject the alternate hypothesis that the smaller the tank size, the longer duration of red “mane” that two Betta splendens males present and quicker the first red “mane” shows up. However, the results do show an inverse relationship between the tank size and the duration of intraspecific agonistic behaviors, and a proportional relationship between the tank size and the time required for the first red "mane" to appear. The failure in getting a significant difference reason from the high standard deviation.

Introduction:
In the study of animal behavior, ethology brings together observation skills from natural history, laboratory methods, and insights and theories from ecology, genetics and especially evolutionary biology [Johnson:2018] Core ethology is developed by European zoologist which can emphasize the study of instinctive behavior and stressed work under natural selection [Dewsbury: 1989]. Betta splendens are used in the experiment, the fighting fish originated in southwest Asia. Broadside movement and facing movements are two main types of intraspecific agonistic behaviors of bettas. Typical behaviors for each type are ranked in aggressiveness. For the broadside movement, in increasing order of aggressiveness, typical behaviors are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. For the facing movement, the three typical behaviors in increasing order of aggressiveness are fin erecting, gill covers spreading, and creating a red “mane” by protruding the branchiostegal membrane. To understand the relationship between the tank size and the intraspecific agonistic behavior of two Betta males, red “mane” is used as a representation the intraspecific agonistic behavior. There is supposed to be an inverse relationship between tank size and the amount of intraspecific agonistic behaviors. The explanation for this relationship is that Bettas may be able to detect the opponent more easily and may feel the stronger tension in small tank condition [Cain:1980]. Therefore, the hypothesis is the smaller the tank size, the longer duration of red “mane” that two Betta splendens males present and quicker the first red “mane” shows up.

Materials and Methods:
The experiment aimed to figure out the relationship between tank size and the amount of intraspecific agonistic behaviors that two Betta splendens males present. Two aquariums in different sizes were used in the experiment. The small tank was divided into three compartments and the large tank was divided into two compartments. And the size of each compartment in the small tank was 4inch×6inch and that in the large tank was 10inch×10.5inch. And three selected male Bettas which had been kept visually isolated from one another for several hours with white plastic dividers were used as samples in both small and large tank conditions. Every two male Bettas that were physically separated were introduced for each trail. They were timed for five minutes and their intraspecific agonistic behavior (red “mane”) were observed. Red “mane “is observed when branchiostegal membrane protrudes. In the five-minute interval, the time it took for the first red "mane" was recorded in second and the duration of red "mane" was recorded in second as well. Each two fish were introduced in both tanks; therefore, three trails were run for each condition. The fish were allowed to rest for five minutes in between trails with a white plastic divider between compartments for visual isolation. A paired t-test was run statistically after the experiment.

Results:
The mean time required for the first red “mane” to appear is 22.67±31.79s in the small tank condition. The mean time required for the first red “mane” to appear is 22.67±31.79s in the large tank condition. And the mean duration of the red “mane” in five minutes is 132.67±110.62s in the small tank condition. The mean duration of the red “mane” in five minutes is 101.33±92.12s in the large tank condition. Figure 1 compares the time required for the first red “mane” to appear in small and large tank conditions (t value=1.54, p value=0.21, degrees of freedom=2), and Figure 2 compares the duration of red “mane” in the five-minute interval in both conditions (t value=0.98, p value=0.43, degrees of freedom=2). Therefore, there are no significant difference between the time required for the first red “mane” to appear and the duration of the red “mane” in five minutes in different tank sizes.

Discussion:
The alternate hypothesis that the smaller the tank size, the longer duration of red “mane” that two Betta splendens males present and quicker the first red "mane" shows up is rejected. However, although there are no significant differences shown in these two measurements, the results show that Bettas need a shorter time to show up the first red "mane" in a small tank than in a large tank. Also, Bettas in the small tank shows a longer duration of red "mane" in five minutes than in the large duration. Therefore, the possible explanation for the insignificant difference might be the large standard deviation. As one of the three Betta does not respond at all either in a small tank or in a large tank. It becomes an exception in the experiment which makes the data inaccurate. There is supposed to e an inverse relationship between the tank size and the amount of intraspecific agonistic behavior in Bettas. As in a small tank. Bettas may be easy to detect the opponent and feel the stronger tension. And the different degrees of proximity, together with the species and responsiveness of an opponent, could act as a sign stimulus for intraspecific agonistic behaviors. To improve this experiment, more samples should be used to avoid extreme data.
