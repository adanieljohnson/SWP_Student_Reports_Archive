Title: The Effect of 2% Sevin Solution on the Average Threshold Voltage of Rana Pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle Twitching

Abstract:
The somatic neuromuscular system is an important topic in physiological biology. It is important to understand how the brain utilizes the nervous system to allow muscles to contract in response to environmental variables. Here we look at the effect of the chemical sevin on the voltage threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens. The expectation was that the average voltage threshold of the frog muscles injected with sevin would be greater than that of those not injected, to compensate for the lack of calcium being released, and the lower muscle membrane potential (due to the inhibition of acetylcholine). Our data showed significant difference in the two average voltage thresholds (p-value: 0.038). This significance suggests that the sevin solution inhibits the release of acetylcholinesterase that would cause the neuron to inhibit the release of acetylcholine, thus causing a lower membrane potential. The data supports this, as a higher voltage was needed after injection, to raise the membrane potential again, allowing acetylcholine to bind to receptors and let the muscle contract. This adaptation demonstrates a further understanding of insecticides (such as Sevin) and their effect on the neuromuscular control systems. 

Introduction:
A key process in muscle control is known as the Somatic Neuromuscular system. This is a system that utilizes nerve impulses in order to control muscles. The system uses multiple processes to achieve a desired effect. First, as a result of a nerve impulse occurrence, the presynaptic terminal releases acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter or chemical message that sends signals to cells). The acetylcholine (ACh) then binds to its receptor on the muscle fiber membrane. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is released by motor neurons in order to activate muscles [Cooper: 1965]. The action of ACh bindings triggers the opening of sodium channels, as the polarity of the membrane has now changed. The influx of sodium causes the generation of an action potential, or the change in electrical potential associated with the passage of an impulse along the muscle fiber membrane. Then, Ca2+ is released from a storage site known as the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. Finally, after all this occurs, the contractile mechanism of the fibers is activated. While this process is fairly organized, it is reportedly difficult to record changes in ACh and Ca2+. However, by analyzing the macroscopic effect of the myofibril contractions, one can obtain data pertaining to neuromuscular control. These contractions are either muscle contractions or muscle twitches. One commonly used model is the analysis of frog legs – specifically the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve within the leg. The procedure to collect data from this model involves “shocking” the nerve, attaching together a force transducer and the muscle affected, and recording the overall force generated (over time). Factors such as twitch threshold and direct stimulation, the effect of repeated stimuli on fatigue, the effect of stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude, and the presence/absence of a myoneural block can be determined from the different stages within a single muscle twitch. However, how can one increase the voltage threshold necessary for a muscle to contract? Sevin (carbaryl) solution is an insecticide that is a slow reversal inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. These inhibitors are similar to acetylcholine, but the enzyme’s travel through the final step of hydrolysis is slower (minutes), when compared to the enzyme generated by acetylcholine (microseconds). This solution can cause death, since the effects of ACh cannot be terminated by the carbamylated enzyme [Metcalf: 2014]. This solution, however, could create the necessity for a higher voltage threshold, as the ACh will take longer to bind to the muscle fiber membrane. Thus, injecting the Rana pipens with 2% solution of sevin will result in a higher threshold, due to the inhibition of Acetylcholine binding to its receptor on the muscle fiber membrane. 

Materials and Methods:
The independent variable was the amount of sevin injected into each frog muscle. The dependent variable was the minimum voltage needed to elicit a response. In groups of 3 to 4 people, a frog leg was given and placed in a dissecting pan. The frog skin was then grasped, using a pair of forceps, and the skin was pulled down towards the foot. Then, after all the skin was removed from its original location, the leg was moistened with Frog Ringer’s solution. Then, to further clear the area surrounding the muscle, a dissecting probe was used to separate the inner thigh muscles. This process was performed gently, in order to avoid damaging the nerve. Next, the nerve was dissected from the tissue, by use of pins and forceps. While this was happening, the leg was continually moistened with Frog Ringer’s solution. Then, to generate a myogram and determine the threshold voltage of the muscle, the muscle was stimulated or “shocked” via a single pulse from the force transducer. The program was then utilized to deliver a shock with an amplitude of 0.01. The amount was recorded if the muscle twitched. Then, the shock amplitude was increased in increments of 0.01, until a muscle twitch was observed. This allowed for the normal threshold to be determined. Next, the 2% sevin solution was injected into the frog legs. 0.02 mL of the solution were loaded into the syringe and carefully injected into the middle of the muscle. When the syringe was removed, it was not recapped, and it was disposed of in a sharp’s disposal bin. Next, the shocking of the sciatic nerve was repeated with an amplitude of 0.01. The shock amplitude was increased by 0.01, until a muscle twitch was observed. This was the threshold voltage required to illicit a response. After the data was collected, a paired t-test was performed, to measure the statistical values.

Results:
The mean of the threshold voltage for the frogs, before the sevin was injected, was 0.16 and the mean for the threshold voltage after the sevin was injected was 0.29 (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the threshold voltage before sevin injection was +/- 0.032 and was +/- 0.0702 after injection. We used a paired t-test to analyze our results. Both threshold voltage means were statistically significantly, since the p-value was below 0.05 (t-stat = 5.009, df = 2, P = 0.038). When observing the voltage threshold in the frog legs, all three frog leg thresholds were greater after injection. Additionally, as each muscle was shocked, the threshold difference kept increasing to a voltage that was “too high”. To fix this, each muscle was shocked at 5 volts, and then shocked again at 0.1 increments, to continue looking for the threshold again. Overall, all three frog legs demonstrated the same changes in threshold before and after injection.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that injecting the Rana pipiens with 2% sevin solution would result in a higher voltage threshold, was supported. We observed a significant different and the 0.05 level, suggesting that the presence of sevin in the frog leg muscle affects the release of acetylcholinesterase. Sevin solution (Carbaryl) is a chemical that inhibits the release of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down acetylcholine into acetate and choline. The sevin solution binds to the acetylcholinesterase and leaves the acetylcholine sitting on its receptor. Nothing else can bind to the receptor because the ACh isn’t being broken down. This causes a buildup of ACh in the synaptic cleft, which begins a backup system that forces ACh to start binding back to the presynaptic cleft receptors. The backup allows the neuron to sense that there’s a backup and it stops releasing acetylcholine. However, this causes there to be less Ca2+ released in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Because calcium is not being released as frequent as needed, the membrane has a low potential, and needs a higher voltage in order to make up for the decrease in membrane potential. Ultimately, the higher voltage gets the membrane potential to the same place, as if the acetylcholinesterase was not inhibited, thus allowing the muscle to contract. Thus, as proven by the data, the sevin solution caused an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, causing an increase in voltage to raise the membrane potential. This allowed ACh to bind to receptors and cause muscle twitches. In other words, the acetylcholinesterase limits the firing of the electrical impulses [Norris: 1988]. If the enzyme is inhibited, then the electrical impulses will keep firing and the ACh will build up, causing muscle spasms. Overall, this experiment could suggest that regardless of an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, the muscle can utilize electrical signals to still perform contractions. Understanding neuromuscular control can further our understanding of the adaptive functionalities in organisms, in regard to muscle contraction. Furthermore, this experiment helps further the understanding of sevin solution and how insecticides effect the neuromuscular control systems of different organisms.
