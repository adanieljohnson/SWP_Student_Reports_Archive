Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Growth of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta caterpillars rely on both Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) for growth and development. When either of these hormones are inhibited it can prevent the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the larvae. This lab tested the effects of JH regarding the development of Manduca sexta. Juvenile hormone was added to the food source of the experimental group. It was hypothesized that with the addition of JH into their diets, the average final weight of the caterpillars would decrease. The alternative hypothesis was rejected by the outcome of the experiment and statistical analysis. It was concluded that the experimental group’s average final weight did not decrease in comparison to the controll group’s average final weight.

Introduction:
This experiment is designed to test the resulting effects that take place when Manduca sexta caterpillars are given Insect Growth Regulators (IGR). These IGRs can lead to various abnormalities amongst insects and reduce survival rates. This experiment is focused on eight 11-12 days old Manduca sexta larvae and how they react to Juvenile Hormones (JH analogue). “JH plays a key role in the development of insects from embryo to adult” [Larry: 1975]. It regulates the type of molt that occurs during insect development by determining the level of maturation in the larvae’s growth cycle. Therefore, it is hypothesized that by increasing the amount of JH given to the Manduca sexta caterpillars, there will be a decrease in the average final weight.

Materials and Method:
Eight, 11-12 days old Manduca sexta Caterpillars were used for this experiment. They each weigh approximately 1.5 to 2.5 grams and were dived into two groups of four. The larvae were distributed into two 4-cell containers and kept in a controllled environment (incubator at 28˚C with constant light). The caterpillars were fed one of two diets. Diet one was directed towards the controll group which consists of four caterpillars that receive 10 grams each of Manduca sexta food with the addition of 60 microliters of water. Diet two was directed towards the experimental group which consists of four caterpillars that receive 10 grams of Manduca sexta food with the addition of 60 microliters of juvenile hormone analog (precor 1: 1250). The weight was recorded in grams and daily observations were taken over the 11 days of the experiment. The average growth was then calculated and a two-sample t_test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
The average weight growth for the controll group was found to be 0.7465 grams per day, whereas, the average weight growth for the experimental group was found to be 0.7425 grams per day. As shown in Figure 1, there was a  ± 1 standard deviation of data. A two-sampled t_test was taken in order to analyze these results. It concluded that due to the p_value being 0.475 which is greater than 0.05, the results are not statistically significent. This in turn means that the results from the average weight of the controll group was also not statistically significent from that of the average weight experimental group.

The statistical results and observations offered a significent number of trends throughout this experiment. Week 1 of observations showed that both controll and experimental groups were growing at a steady rate, with the controll growing slightly more on average. The caterpillars were a greenish-blue color and produced a large amount of feces daily. Week 2 of observations showed that the controll group started to slow down in weight gain and form an orange-brown color while wrapping themselves up. The experimental group continued gaining weight at a consistently slow rate and started turning a slight orangish color towards the last day of the experiment. They required more food replacement and cleanup during this week in comparison to the controll group.


Discussion:
The hypothesis stated that by increasing the amount of JH given to the Manduca sexta caterpillars, there will be a decrease in the average final weight. Based on the statistical results it can be concluded that the alternative hypothesis was rejected, and the null hypothesis was accepted. We observed no statistical significance at the 0.05 level, which suggests that the increase of JH did not significently affect the weight growth of the Manduca sexta. While the trends showed that the controll group increased at a higher rate than the experimental it was not a big enough difference and was not significent in the averages. We believe this occurred because there were not enough droplets of JH added to the food source of these caterpillars. Throughout the observational period of the experience, there was a slight inhibition in the growth weight between the two groups of caterpillars which was most likely due to JH. The Manduca sexta larvae were slightly affected by juvenile hormone through the inhibition of the commitment pulse and pupation. The controll group was found to have more larvae begin the molt period while the experimental group had barely begun molting. Therefore, we believe that our hypothesis would have had better success if the amount of droplets we used was increased from six to ten drops per caterpillar.
