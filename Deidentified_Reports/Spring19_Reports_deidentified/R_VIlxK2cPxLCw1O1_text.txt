Title: The Excitatory Effect of Caffeine on the Neuromuscular Control of Rania pipiens.

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system of the Rania pipiens frog functions due to a series of internal action potentials that release muscle contractions in the organism. These action potentials occur due to an opening of sodium channels followed by the release of calcium which activates the activates the contractile mechanisms of the muscle fiber that causes it to shorten.  This experiment tested the effect of caffeine on the muscular contractions of the Rania pipiens’s gastrocnemus muscle upon voltage stimulation. Muscle contractions were measured by a myogram before and after the injection of caffeine at 1 Hz. The lab hypothesized that if caffeine is injected into Rania pipien’s gastrocnemus muscle, it would experience greater contractions due to a prolonged activation stage (inhibition of calcium reuptake). The alternative hypothesis was accepted due to the statistically significent differences in average contractile strength as a result of caffeine. It was concluded that caffeine has an excitatory effect on the Rania pipiens’s neuromuscular system.

Introduction:
This experiment will examine the workings of the neuromuscular system as a complex component in stimulus-response. This system plays a critical role in an organism’s ability to quickly sense and respond to internal and external cues. Our objective is to demonstrate the basic properties of neuromuscular controll using the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of a Rania pipiens. This species of leopard frog, native to the US and Canada in a wide variety of habitats, is typically a slime green or brownish color [Stebbins: 1985]. There are thousands of myofibers, in the skeletal muscle of both invertebrates and vertebrates, like this frog. Those myofibers are bound together by connective tissues to form functional groups of skeletal muscle, which are innervated by motor neurons. The axons of these motor neurons extend into the muscular junction and cause the release of acetylcholine which then triggers the opening of sodium channels that generate action potentials. The subsequent release of calcium is what transmits the contractile mechanism of muscle fiber. These muscular contractions can be measured through the use of myograms by graphical renderings. The lab hypothesized that if caffeine is injected into Rania pipien’s gastrocnemus muscle, it would experience greater contractions upon voltage stimulation. The heightened response would be due to the inhibited reuptake rate of calcium, which is what activates the contractile mechanisms of the muscle fiber that causes it to shorten. 


Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens frog legs of the were used for this experiment. The skin on the frog legs was removed using forceps then placed separately from the exposed legs on the dissection pan. The gastrocnemus muscle was separated using a dissection probe, beginning at the upper thigh muscle and extending to the lower muscle. The sciatic nerve was separated from the attached connective tissue using a dissection needle and forceps. The exposed tissue of the frog legs was kept moist throughout the experiment using Ringer’s solution.
The first frog leg was connected to the Lab Scribe software. Using the simulator on Lab Scribe, the frequency was determined, and the threshold stimulus was set at 1volt. The stimulus parameters were also set to a frequency of 1 Hz, a pulse width to 5ms, and the amplitude to 1. A voltage was applied using a force transducer and results of contractions were recorded. The leg was then injected with .1 of 200mM of caffeine and the voltage was applied again with the same parameters. These previous steps were repeated for the remaining 2 frog legs Repeat these steps for all 3 legs as the controll group. 
The average voltage was then recorded and analyzed using a paired t_test.


Results:
We used a paired t_test to analyze the results of our experiment. The average strength of contractions was higher after caffeine injection for each leg with a difference of 0.385 for the first trial, 0.408 for the 2nd trial, and 0.685 for the third trial. Based on the statistical tests (t_stat=13.451416, d.f.=14, P=2.13 x 10-9),the average strength of contractions for the treatment group (post-caffeine) was statistically significently higher than that of the controll group (pre-caffeine). The p_value is also lower than .05, which suggests that the mean of the treatment being larger than the mean of the controll is very unlikely to be due to chance. 



Discussion:
The lab hypothesized that if the caffeine is injected into Rania pipiens’s gastrocnemus muscle, it will have a greater contraction than the previously untreated muscle in response to a stimulus voltage. Based on the statistical results it can be concluded that the alternative hypothesis was accepted, and the null hypothesis was rejected. We observed statistical significance which suggests that the effect of the caffeine injection on the muscle contraction was very unlikely to be due to chance. Only legs #2 and #3 reached chemically induced tetany upon caffeine injection which created a new baseline, but all of the legs experienced greater contractions after the caffeine. The physiological explanation for the bigger contractions lies in the neuromuscular junction of the organism. The injection of caffeine stimulated the myofibrils in the gastrocnemus muscle and also induced a higher release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 
These results point to a relevant discussion on the effects of caffeine and other stimulants on the neuromuscular systems across various organisms. Athletes are a particular point of discussion in regards to stimulant intake before critical athletic events for the purpose of enhanced performance.  Research has shown that caffeine’s mechanism of action is its ability to block adenosine which is a primarily inhibitory substance responsible for the inhibition of metabolism, decline in heart rate, and general nervous system inhibition. Caffeine's blocking of adenosine is particularly important during exercise “when adenosine levels rise dramatically because of increased consumption of ATP (the main source of energy to cells) and because oxygen delivery does not meet demand” [Sinclair:2000]. Further research on the caffeine as an effective (and sometimes harmful) agent on sports performance would be useful, particularly since athletes have continued to rely on its effects for over a decade.
