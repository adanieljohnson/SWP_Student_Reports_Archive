Title: High Temperature Environment Decreased Root:Shoot Ratio for Avena sativa

Abstract:
Resource allocation for plants is a method used to combat the problem of limited resources: being water, sunlight, or nutrients. These limitations often vary for different locations, as each environment brings different challenges for various plants. A root:shoot ratio can be calculated to measure the differences in where oat plants are prioritizing growth differently in different environments. A higher temperature environment was thought to cause these plants to grow larger roots in search for more water compared to a room temperature environment. From here, we hypothesized that the plants in a higher temperature environment would have a larger ratio. To test this, we measured both the weight and lengths of three plants from a high temperature environment and three from a room temperature environment. The results concluded that the plants in room temperature conditions had a larger ratio for both weight and length. Furthermore, a two-sampled t-test was run for both sets of data, deemed statistically significant. Because our hypothesis was not supported, various conclusions can be made to analyze our result trends. Finally, this can also be applied to large-scale crop harvesting, as farmers must assess environments suitable to plant in, temperature being one of these factors. 


Introduction:
In every ecological community, plants compete for resources to maximize their survival and reproductive success. There are a variety of factors that can impact the resources available or the ability for these plants to acquire them. These factors can either come from other living organisms known as biotic factors, or they can come from non-living organisms, known as abiotic factors. At the center of every ecological community it is the plants that provide the foundation for other organisms to grow and develop [Grime: 1979]. The type of plant, the interactions between plants and animals, and the lack of certain plants are a few examples of how these plants can shape these ecological communities. However, there are limitations of these resources for these plants that vary for different environments. These limitations prevent plants from having unlimited amounts of sunlight, nutrients, or water. Each limitation varies from location to location, as there are different limitations for different climates, environments, and for every community. To combat this problem of scarcity of resources, plants must allocate their resources that best promotes their survival. Meaning, plants adapt to the environment around them by prioritizing their growth in different regions to maximize the resources that are most scarce. This experiment will specifically look at how two different temperature environments attribute to varying development of Avena sativa roots and shoots. 
To measure this prioritization, a root:shoot ratio can be used to examine where plants are allocating their resources in a given environment. Typically, plants with large root:shoot ratios tend to live in environments that have higher temperatures, or have water as a scarcity [Passioura: 1983]. These plants have to maximize their root length and surface area to obtain enough water and nutrients from the soil, as water is evaporated quickly in these environments. Plants with a smaller root:shoot ratio tend to live in environments where lack of water is not a problem, but sunlight is [Mokany: 2006]. Two examples of these environments can either be large forestry or a rain forest. The same concept can be applied here, as these plants must compete for sunlight because the canopy is often dense and large. Meaning, their shoots would presumably be larger than their roots in this case, lowering their root:shoot ratio.
 Similarly, different induced temperatures can greatly impact this ratio, as it can simulate different environments; the relative environment that a plant is in changes this ratio. Specifically looking at the temperature impacts, a separate study offers evidence of the changes in root:shoot ratios. In this study, two species of arctic sedge plants were put in two temperature environments: one at 12 degrees Celsius and one at 22 degrees Celsius [Kummerow: 1984]. It was concluded that the biomass growth underneath the soil was substantially larger for the warmer condition and the lower temperature proved to have less growth [Kummerow: 1984]. This study enhances the claim that warmer temperature environments produce more growth of roots and serves as strong evidence for what our experiment seeks to elaborate off of [Kummerow: 1984].
For our experiment conducted, we observed how oat plantâ€™s root:shoot ratios would differ in two different environments: one in room temperature, and one in an incubator at a high temperature. This was done to compare the differences in allocation of resources for the two differing environments. From here, we hypothesized that the plants in the high temperature incubator would have a larger root:shoot ratio, than those in the room temperature environment. 


Materials and Methods:
Six pots were obtained and filled to the top with vermiculite and pre-watered with approximately 500 mL of water and 50 mL of Miracle Gro. Approximately 90 oat seeds were soaked in water for 30 minutes prior to planting them. After the seeds were fully soaked in water, they were planted in each of the pots, around 15 seeds per pot. The pots were then divided up into two groups of three. The first group of three was labeled as control and was put into the greenhouse at room temperature. The second group was labeled as experimental and put into the incubator to simulate a hot temperature environment which was kept at a constant temperature of approximately 30 degrees Celsius. These pots were both watered once a day with 500 ml of water for two weeks. After two weeks, data for each plant was collected. This was done by extracting the experimental group first into a bucket of water to separate each of the plants from one another. This was repeated with the control group afterwards. We collected three plants from both the experimental and the control. The total mass of the individual plant was first measured (in grams) on a scale. Then, the plant was cut above the oat to separate the shoots from the roots. Each root and shoot was weighed (in grams) and then measured for length (in cm). After data collection, the work area for data collection was cleaned up and wiped down. From here, a root:shoot ratio was calculated for both weight and length along with a standard deviation for each plant measured. This ratio was used to compare the different allocation of resources for the two groups. Lastly, a two-sampled t-test was calculated with the critical value at the 0.05 significance level.


Results:
The results of this lab concluded that the largest root:shoot ratios for both the weight and length were the oat plants in room temperature. This can be seen in Figures 1 and 2. The mean weight root:shoot ratio for room temperature was 0.459  0.0321 and the high temperature was 0.208  0.0598. For the mean length root:shoot ratio for room temperature oats was 0.948  0.119 and the high temperature mean was 0.336  0.146.  Along with that, a two-sampled t-test was run to determine statistical significance which gave the values for the weight group (t=6.41, df=4, p=0.003) and the values for the length group (t=5.63, df=4, p=0.0048). Both of these indicate significant difference from the control to the experimental.

Discussion:
After analyzing the results, it became evident that our original hypothesis was not supported. This is due to our results showing that the oat plants under hot temperatures had a smaller root:shoot ratio than those in a room temperature environment. However, as seen in our results, our statistical analysis serves to show that this was not due to chance, we had statistical significance for both the weight and length root:shoot ratios. Meaning that there may have been a confounding variable that altered our expected results of this experiment. 
This variable could have stemmed from the incubator itself. The environment that we intended for these high temperature plants to be in was aimed to simulate a more arid climate. While the temperature aspect of this was maintained, the availability of light present varied greatly. The incubator was dimly lit and was kept indoors which limited the amount of solar radiation that these oat plants were able to receive. This experimental group did indeed receive enough sunlight to successfully germinate, despite a few mortalities. Based off of our observations of the experimental groups, it indicates that there was larger growth in the shoots than the roots. Due to this, the resource that could have been limited was not water, which we initially thought, but sunlight. This would have caused the plants to compete more for sunlight than water, increasing their shoot lengths, and thereby decreasing the root:shoot ratio observed. The experimental group could have prioritized the growth of their shoots based upon the limited light available. 
This concept can be applied to dense canopy environments, as plants strive to get light and compete against other plants in their surrounding locations to attain it. Another study demonstrates this idea further. It describes how to qualitatively measure the amount of light a plant is attaining by measuring the foliage of various locations in a canopy environment with all other variables held constant [Ryel: 1990]. The results of this concluded that the denser the foliage of the plants tested indicated that there was more competition for light [Ryel: 1990]. While our experiment did not focus on the density of the foliage of the total experimental pot, it still offers evidence that a limited amount of light in an environment can cause plants to increase shoot length over root length. Also, this proves the point of how our incubator could have inadvertently caused light to become a resource that was most prioritized in our experimental group.
Lastly, this experiment can be extended to large scale farming, and could be helpful for those that are trying to profit on cultivating large amounts of this crop, which is abundant in much of the food that we consume. It should be taken into account the availability of both water and light in a given environment before choosing locations to plant, in hopes to promote the largest yield. All in all, regardless of the plant studied, this experiment can serve to illustrate how adjusting factors, such as the temperature, can greatly impact the root:shoot ratios of the plant. Beyond that, it shows the importance of resource allocation in plants and how plants have come to adapt to the various environments that they are in.
