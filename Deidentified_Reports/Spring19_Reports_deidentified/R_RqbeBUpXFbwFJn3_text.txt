Title: The Effect of Ecdysterone Inhibition on Manduca sexta Growth Rate

Abstract:
Hormones play an important role in growth and development in biology. Understanding how hormones function in the Manduca sexta helps us understand what specific roles hormones play in triggering pupation. Ecdysterone plays a major role in determining the timing of molting in the Manduca sexta. An increase in ecdysterone levels triggered by the commitment pulse causes the caterpillar to begin pupation. We looked at the role ecdysterone inhibition plays in the growth rate of the Manduca sexta. The expectation was that growth rate in caterpillars that had eaten food with ecdysterone inhibitor would differ from the growth rate in caterpillars that ate food with no inhibitor added. Our data showed no significent difference in the growth rate of the caterpillars. This significance, appears to run counter to our observations that controll caterpillars were larger and more fully developed than experimental caterpillars. This could indicate a need to repeat the experiment or that the growth rate remains constant in the Manduca sexta even when ecdysterone levels are uninhibited. While our data suggests that ecdysterone has no effect on growth rate in the Manduca sexta, this experiment allows us to look further into the effect of hormones on growth rate and development. 

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the impact of ecdysterone levels in the Manduca sexta and the effect that ecdysterone levels have on the insect’s growth rate. Ecdysterone, or 20E, regulates the timing of molting during insect development of the Manduca sexta, and has additional functions in adult insects [Johnson: 2018]. The Manduca sexta is an ideal model for hormonal effect on growth rate because the insects hormones have been widely studied and hormone levels within the insect are relatively easily raised or lowered [Hatem: 2015]. A small rise in ecdysterone levels during the 5th larval instar is called the commitment pulse. The commitment pulse indicates that the caterpillar is large enough to undergo pupation and form a normal size moth [Johnson: 2018]. How do ecdysterone levels affect the growth rate of the caterpillar? Would lack of ecdysterone prevent the caterpillar from undergoing pupation? These questions could help determine the importance of hormones during insect growth. Our experiment attempts to determine the role ecdysterone plays in Manduca sexta growth rate. We hypothesize that if we decrease the ecdysterone levels in the Manduca sexta prematurely, then the caterpillars rate of growth will be affected.



Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing were divided into two groups of four caterpillars each. Both groups were placed in plastic containers with one caterpillar in each compartment of the container. The two groups received the same diet of caterpillar food, but the controll group received food with 7 drops of water added. The experimental group received the same caterpillar food but with 7 drops of ecdysterone inhibitor added. All 8 caterpillars were kept in the same environment with temperature and oxygen levels the same for each of the 8 caterpillars. The caterpillars were then massed using a standard lab balance every day for two weeks and observations were recorded on the caterpillars appearance each day. A two-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine the difference in growth rate of the caterpillars that received 7 drops of water (the controll) compared to the group of caterpillars that received 7 drops of ecdysterone inhibitor (the experimental).

Results:
The mean growth rate for the controll caterpillars was 0.2649 grams per day while the mean growth rate per day for the experimental caterpillars was 0.0575 grams per day. We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean average growth rate of the controll group was not statistically significently different from the mean average growth rate of the experimental group (t_stat=1.927, d.f.=6, P=0.1021). The controll groups with the exception of C4 appeared upon observation much heavier than the experimental groups. C4 was similar in size to the four experimental groups. Two of the controll groups had begun to pupate while none of the experimental groups had done so. The controll and experimental groups had differing average growth rates with the exception of C4 [Figure 1]. C1, C2, and C3 had much higher growth rates than the experimental groups [Figure 2].

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the growth rate of the Manduca sexta would be affected by the inhibition of the hormone ecdysterone, was not supported. We observed no significent difference between the growth rate of the controll group and the growth rate of the experimental group, which suggests that ecdysterone has no effect on growth rate. It is possible that the dosage of ecdysterone inhibitor was too low to have an effect, which would have allowed the caterpillars to maintain their normal growth rates [Schwartz: 1999]. Past studies have found that ecdysterone inhibition does affect the mass of the caterpillars and also prevents them from pupating [Hatem: 2015]. This could suggest that there was a source of error in our experiment, and one possible error is the growth rate of C4 or “Freddie.” C4 had a much smaller growth rate than the other three controll caterpillars, and greatly decreased the mean growth rate for the controll group. This could have been the result of an issue with C4's food, as the water may have caused C4 to eat less, decreasing growth. Another explanation could have been potential cross-contamination between the controll and experimental groups when food was prepared. If C4 received ecdysterone inhibitor, his growth rate may have been decreased. The next logical step for this study would be to repeat the procedure but increase the number of drops of water and ecdysterone inhibitor. This would ensure that enough inhibitor was present to affect the ecdysterone levels of the caterpillars. The procedure should be repeated to determine if the decreased growth rate of C4 affected the results. The growth rates of C1, C2, and C3 were all much greater than the growth rates exhibited by the experimental groups, which could indicate that ecdysterone does have an affect on the growth rate. Ecdysterone’s importance in Manduca sexta growth demonstrates the influence of hormones on growth rate and development.
