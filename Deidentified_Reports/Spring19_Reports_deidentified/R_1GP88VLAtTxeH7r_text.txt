Title: The Effect of Acetylcholine Injection on Muscle Contraction Intensity in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The nervous system functions through the flow of information due to electrical impulses. Impulses that travel through motor neurons are responsible for the stimulation and consequential movement of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle is composed of individual myofibers, which when bound together by connective tissue compose the muscle. Nerves stimulate muscles through the process of excitation-contraction coupling. During the depolarization stage, Acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal. It then binds to the receptor on the membranes of the muscle fibers. In this experiment, the effect of injecting Acetylcholine into the gastrocnemus of Rania pipien legs was investigated. It was hypothesized that the injection of Acetylcholine would result in more intense muscle contractions when the leg was electrically stimulated. 3 Rania pipien legs were used, with both controll and treatment processes carried out. The levels of contraction at various voltages, when the sciatic nerve was stimulated, were recorded and statistically analyzed. The results were deemed statistically insignificent, and thus no significent connection between injection of Acetylcholine and more intense muscle contractions was found. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported by the experimental results.

Introduction:
Rania pipiens is a species of frog commonly known as the leopard frog, aptly named for the dark spots found on their “slim green or brownish” skin, with their size varying between “5 and 11 cm” in length (Fryer, 2001). This species is commonly used in experiments, as it is relatively commonly distributed across a wide-range of regions. This experiment served to investigate the effect of Acetylcholine on muscle contraction through the experimental stimulation of Rania pipien legs. In order to investigate this process, this experiment isolated the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve of a severed Rania pipien leg. The series of observations conducted served to show how muscles, when electrically stimulated, go through a latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period. The effect of stimulus frequency in muscle contractions was also investigated. Our hypothesis was that the Acetylcholine injection would cause the muscle to contract at a higher intensity. 

Materials and Method:
3 frog legs were obtained. One Rania pipien leg was set up in the dissecting tray. The skin was peeled off, gently tugged down if caught around the knee joint. The leg was then laid in the tray. Scissors were used to separate the connective tissue attached to the gastrocnemus. The gastrocnemus was then cut free, severing a significent portion of the Achilles tendon. The leg was then pinned down to the tray, using three pins to hold in securely in place. A piece of string was tied around the end of the gastrocnemus muscle closest to the foot. A loop was left at the end, and the loop was then attached to the needle stimulator machine. The tension was adjusted on the string so the gastrocnemus was suspended at approximately a 90 degree angle. In the Control portion of each leg’s testing, the thigh was pressed open to reveal the sciatic nerve.  The sciatic nerve was then placed across the electrode. It was ensured that the leg was kept moist by spritzing it with Frog Ringers periodically. The leg was stimulated at a width of 5 ms, with a frequency of 1 Hz, and levels of contraction were recorded from the nerve. In the Treatment portion of each leg’s testing, the thigh was pressed open to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was then placed across the electrode. The muscle was then injected with 10 mg/Ml of Acetylcholine. The leg was stimulated at a width of 5 ms, with a frequency of 1 Hz, and levels of contraction were recorded from the nerve. Both processes were undertaken on all three frog legs in the experiment.

Results:
 A 2-paired T-test was conducted on the data collected, and the alpha-value was found to be 0.520, far above 0.05. Thus, the effects of Acetylcholine on intensity of muscle contraction were not found to be significent. As seen in Figure 1, the results between the treatment and controll groups were relatively similar, both increasing until 0.4 Amp. was reached, and then slightly decreasing at 0.5 Amp.

Discussion:
The non-significent results completely contradict the hypothesis that injection of Acetylcholine would intensify the muscle contractions observed when the muscle was electrically stimulated. A potential reason for non-significent differences could be an inadequate period of time for the Acetylcholine to sink in, or the concentration of Acetylcholine could have been too low, thus undermining its potential effects on increasing muscle contraction intensity. The investigation into the effect of Acetylcholine in the neuromuscular system could be further explored by using Acetylcholine of a higher concentration or injecting at a different site. Injections at different sites in the muscle could have significent effects on the intensity of the muscle contraction, because it has been shown to be “difficult to measure the extent of extrasynaptic chemosensitivity in muscles of the frog because of variability in the length and branching pattern of the nerve terminals”(Peper, 1972). With such variability, Rania pipien legs may not be the most reliable specimen to use in experiments regarding Acetylcholine and muscle contraction. More studies could be conducted on other organisms with a more standardized system of nerve terminals to better determine Acetylcholine’s effect on muscle contraction intensity.

The averages were taken for each value of the controll as well as treatment processes for each of the three legs used in the experiment.*************************************************************************
