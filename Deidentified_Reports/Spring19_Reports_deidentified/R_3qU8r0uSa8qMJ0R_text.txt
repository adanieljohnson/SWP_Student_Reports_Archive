Title: The Effect of IGregulator Hormone on the Length and Weight of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
Hormones are an essential factor in the survival of not only humans but also insects and other organisms. Hormones are signaling molecules that controll many bodily functions such as development and growth in mammals and insects (Manduca sexta). However, certain hormones are released at specific times during development in order to have the maximal impact and the appropriate growth changes for your age. Similarly, in insects such as the Manduca sexta, growth hormones like the Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone play large roles in how these caterpillars develop and at which stages they will molt, go to the cocoon stage, develop prolegs or a compound eye, etc. The expectation we had going into this experiment was that the growth hormone used would speed up the process of development in these caterpillars and increase their lengths and weights earlier in their life cycles. However, we did notice a significent difference in lengths compared to the controll group leading us to conclude that it is possible that this growth hormone affects the development of these caterpillars at different stages.      


Introduction:
In this experiment, we were able to study the effects that different hormones have on the development of the Manduca sexta. Hormones are signaling molecules that are responsible for a number of activities and functions in our bodies along with different species’ bodies as well. In humans, hormones are responsible for the regulation of body temperature, hunger drive, sleep, sex drive, development, etc [Johnson: 2018]. These functions are essential for the survival of humans; similarly, insects such as the Manduca sexta possess specific hormones that are responsible for their development and are one of the key factors in their survival. The three hormones that are responsible for much of the development of these insects are: Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and the Juvenile Hormone (JH). PTTH/BH is responsible for the release of Ecdysterone by Prothoracic glands. 20E is responsible for regulating the timing of molting during insect development [Johnson: 2018]. Lastly, JH is responsible for regulating the type of molting that will occur during development [Johnson: 2018]. Molting is an essential part of the development and entails the shedding of the old cuticle in order for a new one to take its place and the insect to advance in its journey to becoming a pupa and adult — also changing not only the size of this insect but its morphology. In this experiment, we tested the effects of the “IGregulator hormone” on the development of these caterpillars for two weeks. IGR is a growth hormone that affects physiological processes that are essential to the development of insects [Siddall: 1976]. These growth hormones tend to alter a lot of the development of these larvae and promote an increase in both length and weight [Butter: 2003]. The Manduca sexta have four stages (egg, larvae, pupa, and adult) that are regulated mainly by the JH and 20E. The experiment we have conducted has treated the caterpillars with the “IGregulator” and the effects of this hormone on length and weight have been observed for 14 days. Our hypothesis suggested that if the IGR was given to the Manduca sexta, then it would significently increase their development in length and weight because it has been researched that growth hormones affect the stages of the Manduca sexta such as the fifth instar larval stage [Johnson: 2018]. Furthermore, we observed whether or not this hormone affected the speed at which the Manduca sexta developed during its specific stages by observing their size increase. 


Materials and Method:
Eight, 11-12 day old Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing 0.1-1 grams and 15-40 mm long were selected, and divided into two groups. We placed each caterpillar in its own separate rearing jar. We fed each caterpillar the same diet which consisted of 10 grams of the Manduca sexta normal food plus six drops of the “IGregulator” hormone. We mashed this food up in order to fully disperse the fluid and then clumped it back together as it was researched that clumped food is the optimal form for the caterpillars. All the caterpillars were then kept in the same incubator at 24.4 degrees Celsius for 14 days. These caterpillars were periodically checked on every day and observations were noted. After 7 days we recorded the final weight and length of each caterpillar and compared it to the weights and lengths for the controll group. After another 7 days (day 14) we looked at final weight and lengths of the caterpillars for both the controll and experimental groups and compared them once again to see whether the growth hormone had any effect on the lengths and weights. Our dependent variables were the length and weight of the Manduca sexta and the independent variable was the growth hormone - “IGregulator”. Statistical Analyses: after day 7 we ran a two-tailed t_test because our hypothesis was that the growth would change in general and not in one direction or the other. On day 14 we ran a two-tailed t_test to observe the differences between day 1 and 14 and to compare it to the controll group. 


Results:
The average weight for the Manduca sexta controll group was 4.95 grams, whereas the experimental was 11.08875 grams (Figure 2). The degrees of freedom for the weight was 14, the t-value was 4.967407, and the p_value was 0.000207 (Figure 2) which shows statistical significance. We noticed that the controll caterpillars did not grow nearly as fast as the experimental group did. When observing the lengths of the Manduca sexta, the average for the controll was 22.375 mm, whereas the experimental group average was 45.875 (Figure 1). The degrees of freedom was again 14, the t-value was 4.73952, and the p_value was 0.000317 (Figure 1) which again shows statistical significance. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis stated that after receiving the treatment of the IGR hormone, the Manduca sexta would show the effects of increased growth in both length and height as it has been researched that growth hormones tend to affect the developmental stages of insects such as these caterpillars. After observing the results it is evident that the IGR hormone’s effect is statistically significent and is not due to chance or other environmental factors. We noticed a significent increase in length and weight in the experimental groups compared to the controll group as our p_value was extremely low. Therefore, we could conclude that the growth hormone is responsible for having a metamorphic change on the Manduca sexta and that this was the correct stage at which this hormone should be given. Growth hormones can be difficult to evaluate as it is crucial to decide when they should be given. Many times there are specific periods in a lifetime for any organism where growth hormones should be given and based on this study we can assume that it is appropriate for the growth hormone to be given at this initial stage of the Manduca sexta. Biologically, we observed a large growth in both the height and weight as the “IGregulator” changed the metamorphic structure of the insect; during this phase, the caterpillar reorganized its internal and external structures contributing to the difference in appearance  [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, we can also conclude that this growth hormone was able to bind to the growth receptors of this organism instead of inhibiting growth. Furthermore, we could possibly conduct more experiments on different insects to see whether or not this hormone reacts in a similar way [Butter: 2003].
