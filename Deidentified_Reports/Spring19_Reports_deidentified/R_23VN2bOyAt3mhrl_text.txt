Title: Effects of Temperature on Resource Allocation in Pisum sativun Plants

Abstract:
A prominent environmental stressor today is higher temperatures that affect how plants are surviving in their changing environments. This experiment aims to generate information on how temperature affects the resource allocation in Pisum sativun. Resource allocation is how plants modify their growth patterns, applying more resources to either the roots or stems, to be successful in their environments. Previous studies demonstrate that plants with higher temperatures tend to have more resources allocated to roots than stems while plants in colder conditions have more resources allocated towards stems than roots. In this experiment, it was predicted that the plants in the incubator (32°C) would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the plants in room temperature (23°C) conditions. 20 field pea plants were grown for two weeks in the room and warm temperature conditions. After the two weeks, the root to shoot ratios were measured using the weight and length of each plant. It was determined that field pea plants in room temperature conditions had higher root to shoot ratios than plants in the warm temperature conditions.

Introduction:
Pisum sativun, or field peas are rapid growing domesticated crops that are grown in the western and southeastern United States. (Clark 2012) Field pea plants respond quickly to their environments making them useful plants of study for resource allocation. 
In ecological communities,​ there are two different types of factors, biotic and abiotic, that impact plants. Biotic factors are stimuli that originate from other organisms while abiotic factors, such as wind and water, are non-living stimuli that affect plants. Plants interact with both types of environmental stimuli to be successful in their communities. However, because essential nutrients are limited in an environment, plants have to adapt in different ways depending on the resources available in their communities. (Johnson 2016)
Plants use a process known as resource allocation to adapt their growth patterns to survive in their environments. Resource allocation is how an organism distributes limited resources for optimal survival. In plants, resources are allocated to the stems, roots, or leaves based on their environment and limiting resources, as a result the growth pattern of the plant changes over time due to a property known as phenotypic plasticity. (Johnson 2016) 
Temperature can greatly affect ways in which plants grow and survive. Previous findings found higher temperatures to be detrimental to plant growth. The effects of a higher temperature on plants were found to affect a plant’s ability to accomplish photosynthesis. (Weiss et al. 1988) Meaning that the plant may not be able to easily obtain needed nutrients, if it were grown in a high temperature environment. As a result, the plant may need to allocate more resources to their stems. High temperatures also were found to cause underdeveloped growth in plants, making them unsuccessful in reproduction. (Gulioni et al. 2003) Again showing that plants in higher temperatures may have to distribute more resources to their stems to have reproductive success in their environments as well.
The goal of this experiment is to understand how temperature affects resource allocation in Pisum sativun, the field pea. Multiple studies address how higher temperatures can cause plants to distribute more resources to their stems in order to be successful in their environments. Based on these studies, it was predicted that the field peas in the incubator (32°C) would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the plants in room temperature (23°C) conditions.  Meaning that in warm temperature plants, more resources would be allocated to the stems of the plants than the roots of the plant, while the room temperature plants would have more resources allocated towards the roots than the stems. 


Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, about 18 field pea seeds in four containers of vermiculite were planted along with 100Ml of miracle grow. Each container was watered with 100Ml of water. After that, two containers of field peas were put into an incubator at 32ºC and the other two containers were put near a window in the lab classroom to simulate room temperature (about 23°C). The plants were then watered every day​ with 100Ml of water for two weeks. After the two weeks, the field pea plants were harvested,10 room temperature and 10 warm temperature plants. Then the root to shoot ratio was measured using a scale and a ruler. First, the plants were separated by being cut at the pea junction. Then the roots and shoots were measured separately with a ruler (in cm) and weighed with scale (in grams). The root to shoot ratio was then determined by utilizing the root to shoot equation.  The data was then recorded and a two-tailed two-sample statistical test was utilized to determine the significance of the data.
 


Results:
	The results of this experiment were the average root to shoot ratio for the warm temperature (32°C) and room temperature (about 23°C) groups. Based on the two-tailed two sample t statistical test, there was a statistically significent difference in the means for weight between the warm and room temperature groups (t-value=3.02, d.f.=18, p_value=0.0037). The mean for length between the warm and room temperature groups was​ not significently different. (t-value=0.302, d.f. =18, p_value=0.383). Figure 1 displays a bar graph of the results of the average root to shoot ratios for length and weight.

Discussion:
As stated previously, the conditions of an environment can modify the ways in which plants grow. This happens because plants allocate their resources in different places, such as the stems or the roots. This experiment aimed to understand how warm and room temperature conditions affected resource allocation in field pea plants. This comparison was determined using the root to shoot ratio. Plants with longer or heavier roots compared to shoots had a higher root to shoot ratio, while plants with shorter and less heavy roots had a smaller ratio. Based on the t_test, there was a significent difference between the root to shoot ratios for weight. (Room temperature plants R:S=1.089 and warm temperature plants R:S=0.889) The Root to shoot lengths for the room and warm temperature plants were not significently different. 
Previous studies demonstrated that temperature negatively affected the stems of a plant, causing issues in performing photosynthesis (Weiss et al. 1988) and stunted growth (Gulioni et al. 2003). As a result, it was hypothesized that field pea plants in higher temperatures would have a higher root to shoot ratio, as they would distribute more resources to their stems than roots to have success in their environments. The results of this experiment rejected this hypothesis. 
This data may have happened because of the issues with stunted growth and photosynthesis in the warm temperature plants. Although the plant may have allocated more resources to make the stems healthy, this could have been ineffective. In the study conducted by Weiss et al, the experiment revealed that the root to shoot ratio for plants with chronic high-temperature stress had a lower root to shoot ratio than the controll (Weiss et al. 1988). This was explained by the lack of proper functioning photosynthesis causing plants to have trouble in development. These results are supported by the Gulioni et al article, as their experiment caused “stomatal limitation of photosynthesis” (Gulioni et al 2013).  This means that the stomata, which serve to open to take in Carbon Dioxide and release oxygen during photosynthesis, functioned improperly causing issues in photosynthetic activity. As a result, the warm temperature plants may have allocated more resources to their stems for survival, however,​ it was unsuccessful because of ineffective in photosynthesis, thus resulting in stems that were weaker and weighed less than the roots.
