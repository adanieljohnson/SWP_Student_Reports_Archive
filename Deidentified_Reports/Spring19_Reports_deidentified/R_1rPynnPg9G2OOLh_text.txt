Title: The Effect of Soil Salinity on phenotypic variation in radish plants

Abstract:
Available resources in an environment can have a large impact on how an organism translates its phenotype. Studying plant phenotypes depending on their ecological factors can help further understand the concept of resource allocation. For plants, roots and shoots are an integral aspect of their survival in any environment. However, they can use more energy one aspect over the other depending on their resources. This experiment studies the effects of salt salinity on phenotypic plasticity. It was hypothesized that there would be a difference in the root to shoot ratio between plant groups watered with salt water versus tap water. Using radish seeds, an experimental and control group were created over a two-week span, the former being treated with salt water while the latter was treated with tap water. A two-sample t-test showed statistical significance between groups. The data suggests that the plants watered with salt water expended more energy in growing their roots to obtain fresh water deeper in the soil while control group plants showed more similar lengths between their roots and shoots. These findings bring up the possibility of future research involving the effect of road salt runoff on the surrounding environments.

Introduction:
Resource allocation plays an important role in revealing a species’ limited resources. The process itself is a pattern in which a species distributes and uses the resources available in its environment. Depending on the biotic and abiotic factors in an ecological system, organisms will expend more energy to increase their ability to obtain resources that not are as easily accessible over others. The leaves, stems, and roots are some of the parts of a plant that can be affected, depending on ecological factors like soil nutrient concentration, sunlight availability, temperature, and rainfall. Particularly, salinity of soil is found to affect plant growth in general. Research on the effects of salinity stress on plant growth concluded that a plant’s growth, development, and quality are disrupted by high salinity concentrations within soil [Jouyban: 2012]. This experiment observes the effect of soil salinity on radish plants and how they use their available resources to adapt to salt water treatment. To effectively observe the impact of salinity on these plants, we measured the length of the roots and the shoots for each trial to understand phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of these plants to adapt its phenotype to its environment. Longer roots indicates that the plant used more of its available resources to grow the roots in order to obtain water. Looking at the root to shoot ratio between treatment groups will reveal whether salt has a physiological effect on the root and shoot growth on radish plants. We hypothesized that there will be a difference between root to shoot ratio of radish plants watered with salt water versus tap water.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, we planted four small beds of radish plants in trays with vermiculite. Two of these plant groups were watered with an NaCl concentrated solution (experimental groups) every other day over the course of two weeks while the other group received the same treatment with tap water (control groups). After two weeks, each bed of plants was pulled out of the tray and the roots were separated from the vermiculite in a tub of water. Ten individual experimental radish plants were separated from either of the two experimental plant beds. For each plant, the root and shoot to the tip of the tallest leaf was measured and recorded. This process was repeated for 10 individual control plants. The root: shoot ratio for length was calculated using the measurements recorded for each plant. We used a two-tailed two sample t-test to test the data for a significant difference between treatment groups. 

Results:
The data in Figure 1 shows that on average, the salt water treatment plants grew longer roots compared to their shoots, displaying a higher ratio of 2.94 +/- 0.742. The control group showed a ratio closer to 1 (1.47 +/- 0.406), meaning that the control group’s roots and shoots were, on average, closer to equal in length. The two-sample t-test revealed statistical significance between the R:S length ratios of the groups (t-stat = 5.507, df = 18, P = 3.14E-5).

Discussion:
The data collected supports the original hypothesis, predicting a difference between root and shoot length between treatment groups. The data supports the idea that in saltier ecological conditions, plants need to dig deeper into the ground to obtain fresh water. This idea is supported because we controlled for other environmental variables, like light availability and exposure and temperature for both of the treatment groups, accounting for the possibility that the difference between length ratios occurred because of a confounding variable. A study conducted on soil salinity found similar results, revealing that salt affected rates of photosynthesis and respiration in plants [Jouyban: 2012]. Expending more energy on root growth can limit the shoot growth, inhibiting maximal leaf growth, thus decreasing the potential for efficient photosynthesis. In the control group, the average ratio of roots to shoots was significantly lower (Fig. 1) because the plants had continuous access to fresh water, so it was not necessary for the plants to expend energy on growing their roots deeper into the soil and allowed them to grow their shoots more efficiently. The findings of our experiment bring up larger questions of application within society, specifically looking at the salt runoff resulting from our industrial use of the substance on our sidewalks and streets. Further research could examine the effects of salt runoff on larger populations within ecosystems. Similar findings in urban areas could indicate a detrimental impact of our actions on the photosynthetic rates of plants, leading to an overall decrease in oxygen production over time. Expending energy on root growth rather than shoot growth would also drastically change ecosystems for other organisms, possibly leading to increasing extinctions of species.
