Title: Use of the IGR Azaguard Negatively Affects  Development in the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar by Inhibiting the 20E Growth Hormone.

Abstract:
Insect hormones are an important topic in biology and agriculture. It is critical to understand the nature of effects on development that hormones have on insects as well as the possible ways to regulate it. In this experiment, we look at the effect of ecysterone inhibition in the the Manduca sexta caterpillar through the ingestion of an IGR.  The expectation was that the restricted ecdysterone would negatively affect the caterpillars' growth into adulthood, as measured by observations in height and weight.  Our data showed no significant difference in mean differences in length between the control and treatment group but did show a significant difference in mean weight between the two groups. This significance, in conjunction with our observation of the unhealthy state of the treatment group, suggests that our hypothesis was correct since the caterpillars unsuccessfully molted in response to ecdysterone inhibition. This outcome points to wider implications on the ability to regulate hormones on insects for the benefit of agriculture in a changing environment.  

Introduction:
Hormones are an essential component to the development of both insects and mammals. In insects, they mark the physical and chemical transition into adulthood through the process of molting. Molting is described as the change in an insect's morphology when its epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer of cuticle after the old layer of skin is shed. This process enables insects to progress from the larva to pupa and to adults stages. The Manduca Sexta are a prime model for this experiment since there is a great amount of research on its life cycle and hormone regulation. In the Manduca sexta, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are two important hormones involved in development. Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt that will occur and Ecdysterone, also known as 20E, regulates the timing of molting [Judy, 1972]. When the Manduca reaches 5th instar larva, there is a small rise in 20E which indicates that the caterpillar has stored enough nutrients to pupate. This experiment treats the caterpillars with a decreased amount of ecdysterone hormone through an insect growth regulator (IGR) compound called azaguard. With our knowledge of 20E, we believe that decreasing the amount of 20E hormone in Manduca sexta should prevent or delay the caterpillars from molting. Thus, they will not be able to create a new outer layer of cuticle to support new internal and external structures. We hypothesize that if the Manduca Sexta is treated with azaguard, a 20E inhibitor, they will stop molting. Restricting 20E will prevent the Manduca from molting and so they will be unable to support new structures and will have an unsuccessful growth into adulthood. We track the effects of the 20E inhibition by measuring their height, weight, and overall appearance as a reflection of their development.

Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were equally divided into the control group and treatment group. The Manducas were in the 2nd or 3rd instar larval stage at the beginning of the experiment. Each Manduca was measured for height (cm) and appearance (color and movement). 4 Manducas were housed into four-celled containers with air holes for each group. 10 grams of food was measured and placed into each of the 8 cells. 8 drops (10mL) of water was dropped into the food (Great Lakes Manduca) for the control group with a. 8 drops (10mL) of concentrated (1 to 1) azaguard was mixed into food) for the treatment group with a transfer pipette. The 2 containers of the control and treatment group were placed into an incubator (24 hour light, 25°C). Food was replenished with the same technique daily after measuring poop amount and cleaning container and container. The height and appearance of each control and treatment Manduca were measured daily for 13 days. After 13 days of experimentation, the final measurements were recorded and Manducas were placed into frozen body bags.  

Statistical Analyses:  A one-tailed two-sample t-test was used to determine differences in the average growth in, lengths and weights under constant intake of normal or hormone regulatory food.


Results:
We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results. The mean height was 6.68cm for the control group and 6.19 for the treatment group. The mean length of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the treatment group (t-stat = 1.06, df = 22, 12-tailed P= 0.30). The mean weight was 9.52g for the control group and 6.68g for the treatment group. The mean of the weight control group was statistically significantly different than that of the weight treatment group (t-stat = 4.47, df= 12, 2-tailed P= 0.000767). The directionality is in favor of the control group for the one tailed t-test. Based on the pvalue, the mean of the control group is statistically significantly larger than the mean weight of the treatment group. 

When observing the caterpillars on the final day, there was not much visible difference among the Manducas in their respective group. They appeared to be around the same height and appearance regarding color and luminosity. In terms of qualitative observations taken on the final day, #2 in both groups were the only caterpillars to have yellow-brown patches around the segments and #1 in treatment remained smaller than the rest of the caterpillars. As a result of this experiment, both the control and experimental caterpillars had around the same pattern of growth.



Discussion:
We hypothesized that treating Manduca sexta caterpillars with azaguard would prevent or delay molting due to its 20E inhibitory properties which would render them unable to successfully develop into adulthood. Our results were able to support this alternate hypothesis through quantitative and qualitative assessments. The weight measurements indicated a statistically significant difference between the control and treatment group, suggesting that the presence of azaguard the treatment caterpillars’ food decreased their weight by the end of the experiment. One reason for their lower mass could be that they did not create the new layer of cuticle to support new structures. However, it is possible that the treatment caterpillars stopped growing by around the 6th day because they became sluggish and stopped eating as much food. With the limitations and short time frame of our experiment, we have limited evidence to reject the null hypothesis and support the alternate one. The height measurement that we took actually did not indicate a statistically significant difference between the control and treatment group. We decided to focus on the weight rather than the height to answer our hypothesis since we learned it was a more reliable method of taking data. 
All of this data suggests that the inhibition of 20E did have a negative effect on the development in the Manduca sexta, since the treatment groups were not able to molt properly and thus have the proper skin to support structures that they would normally grow in their later instar larval stages as well as pupation. The significance and relevance of the data relate greatly with large scale agriculture, food science, animal science, and pesticide use. Understanding hormonal development in the Manduca sexta, as well as other species of insects, enables us to develop better methods and equipment for agriculture [Dhadialla, 1996].
We believe the significance of the height measurements is largely due to the inconsistency and innacuracy of measuring the heights of the caterpillars since they are stretched out some days and shriveled up on other days. Although height was the quantitative assessment that we chose to measure at the begin of the experiment, we realized its insufficiencies and decided to measure weight as well. Weight was a much better indicator of development becuase it was more accurate and consistent throughout the experiment regardless of the physical appearance of the caterpillars. We also knew that the Manducas were stored in incubators with the light on for 24 hours a day, which was inconsistent with their normal biological rhythm and may have had an effect on the outcome of their development. There was also a grave mixup in the experimentation when no members were able to come measure, clean, and feed the caterpillars on the 11th day, which resulted in a gap in the data. In future experimentations, we would stick to weight as a more reliable means of tracking development, provide a more suitable housing condition with the right amount of light, and plan a strict schedule to come in and check the caterpillars.
