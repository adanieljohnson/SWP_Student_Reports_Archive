Title: Caffeine's Calcium Influx Effect on the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens 

Abstract:
Muscle contractions rely on calcium channels letting calcium in and out of the cell from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Caffeine stimulates an organism’s central nervous system when it is ingested. This experiment was done to examine whether the direct injection of caffeine into a Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle would induce a tetanic contraction and increase the average voltage response to a shock. In order to perform this, researchers shocked unaffected Rania pipiens legs. Then, using the same Rania pipiens legs, researchers injected them with caffeine and shocked the leg again. The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis, as there was clearly a tetanic contraction caused by an influx of calcium into the neuromuscular junction. The researchers observed this both qualitatively and quantitatively.  

Introduction:
Rania Pipiens, more commonly known as the “Northern Leopard Frog” are amphibians native to the United States. The lower leg skeletal muscles in Rania pipiens are known as the gastrocnemus muscle. Many vertebrates contain this muscle within their bodies, including humans. Muscle contractions in muscles such as the gastrocnemus occur because of motor neurons sending signals in the neuromuscular junction. These contractions are also affected by calcium channels allowing calcium into a cell from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When an outside stimulant is present in a muscle, more calcium enters the muscle at the neuromuscular junction, and a state of tetany can occur. Tetany is the involuntary contraction of a muscle caused by an increase in the frequency of action potentials of muscle cells. This experiment’s design was based from a similar experiment that took place on Rania pipiens in 1961 at the National Institute of Health. The researchers injected caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant, into the sartorius muscle of Rania pipiens. They found that injecting caffeine in the Rania pipiens leg increased twitch height in the sartorius, a thigh muscle in Rania pipiens. Bianchi determined the reason behind this discovery was that caffeine increases the rate of resting calcium influx by three times as much as normal [Bianchi: 1961]. In effect, the addition of caffeine induced much stronger contractions in the sartorius muscle. Based on Bianchi’s experiment, this group decided to study the effects of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle. This laboratory experiment concerns the effects of stimulation from caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle’s contractions. If caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens, then the average contraction strength will increase significently during the muscle’s contraction, inducing a state of tetany.

Materials and Method:
To perform this experiment, researchers obtained three Rania pipiens legs and exposed the gastrocnemus muscle. The Rania pipiens legs were hung from the foot, providing a clear view of the muscle. Researchers placed two needles with electric currents in the gastrocnemus muscle of the controll group of Rania pipiens and applied three shocks at 1.0 V. These shocks were given without any outside stimulant. The same Rania pipiens were used for the treatment group and were injected with 0.1 Ml of 200mM caffeine. A similar procedure occurred for the treated Rania pipiens legs. Three shocks were applied to the gastrocnemus muscle, and the results were recorded in myograms to quantify the contractions. Myograms were used to quantify the velocity and intensity of the gastrocnemus contractions with velocity versus time (Figure 1). Figure 1 contains a myogram reading from a muscular contraction. In order to compare the controll to the treatment group, the researchers used a paired T-test since the same Rania pipiens legs were used as the independent variable and the controll group. The researchers also made qualitative observations based upon the visible strength of the contractions.

Results:
The mean voltage measured during the gastrocnemus contraction for the controll group Rania pipiens was 0.284 V +/- 0.14 (Figure 2). The mean voltage for the treatment group was 0.854 V +/- 0.22 (Figure 2). When the controll group was given the shock, there were simple gastrocnemus contractions. The myogram revealed parabolic peaks for these contractions. When the treatment group was given the shock, the caffeine created a more visibly intense contraction. This contraction maintained itself significently longer than the controll. On the myogram reading for the treatment group, one long peak sustained itself for over a minute and there were three small, parabolic peaks on top of the long peak. The average difference in voltage between the two groups was 0.570 V +/- 0.18. The paired t-value for the experiment was 10.03. The P-value was 0.009. The results contained 2 degrees of freedom. 

Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment, the hypothesis that there would be an increase in contraction strength measured in the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens after being injected by caffeine was supported. As the results suggest, the treatment group was significently affected by the injection of caffeine. The low p_value reveals the null hypothesis is rejected, as there is clear statistical evidence that the caffeine had an impact on the group of Rania pipiens that were injected with caffeine. When the myograms revealed the long, extended peak, this was the quantitative representation of the tetanic contraction. The small peaks atop this long peak were the shocks applied to the muscle. There was a noticeable physical difference in qualitatively observing the muscle, as it maintained a much stronger visible contraction for a significent portion of time. This is due to the effects of caffeine on calcium channels in the neuromuscular junction. This group of researchers found similar results to Bianchi’s team of researchers. Similar to Bianchi’s results, the average contraction strength was, on average, just over three times as strong in the treatment group. This was due to caffeine rushing into the muscle cells quickly through the calcium channels and significently increasing the strength of the muscular contraction [Bianchi: 1961]. This influx of calcium into the gastrocnemus induced a state of tetany in the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus. There are vast opportunities for further study on the effects of injecting a skeletal muscle with a chemical. For example, researchers could attempt a similar experiment with ethanol, calcium channel inhibitors, or sodium inhibitors. Researcher Evert Knutson researched the effects of injecting ethanol in frog muscles to measure the changes in membrane potential [Knutsson: 1961]. A tweak in this experiment, such as measuring the voltage response of a Rania pipiens’ skeletal muscle injected with ethanol would be a great idea for further study on the matter. This could give researchers insight as to how consuming ethanol affects skeletal muscle contraction.
