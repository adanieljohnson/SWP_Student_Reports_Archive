Title: The effect of proline on photosynthesis rates in salt-stressed plant cells

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a vital process in plant cells that allows them to produce useable sources of energy. Without a sufficient photosynthetic rate, plants are less able to grow and survive. Various external stressors influence a plant’s ability to photosynthesize. Moreover, external proteins, such as proline, have been shown to aid photosynthetic rates while the plant is under stress. In this experiment, we tested the role of proline on photosynthesis rates in salt-stressed spinach. By suspending chloroplasts and measuring the absorbance of salt-stressed samples with varying concentrations of proline, we anticipated that the higher the concentration of proline, the higher the rate of photosynthesis. However, our data did not display a statistically significent difference and failed to support our hypothesis. This suggests that there may have been an error during the experiment, or that higher concentrations of proline are needed to induce a significent effect.

Introduction:
This experiment examines the role of proline on cellular response to stress. Particularly, it looks at how proline affects photosynthesis rates in a cell with salt stress. Within plants, photosynthesis is the process used to convert light energy into a more usable form of energy. The process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and happens in several stages. The first two stages are light-dependent reactions that use sunlight to excite electrons, culminating in the production of NADPH. The next stages are light-independent stages that use ATP to create glucose molecules that can be broken down later. This experiment focuses on the light dependent reactions. Within this system there are two photosystems: Photosystem II and Photosystem I. Both of these systems create proton gradients in the thylakoid membrane by hydrolyzing water and producing NADPH and ATP. Chloroplast activity can be measured by isolating the organelle using a centrifuge and then examining factors such as oxygen production. Photosystem II activity can be measured by passing electrons to alternative electron acceptors instead of plastiquinone. This is called a Hill Reaction [Johnson AD: 2016]. One such alternative electron acceptor is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP). When DCIP is oxidized it is dark blue. In contrast, the more reduced it is the clearer it becomes. Therefore, a lighter color means more activity. Additionally, various factors affect the rate of oxidation. Specifically, various stressors can impact photosynthesis rates, and simultaneously, oxidation rates. As a response to stressors such as salinity, drought, and heavy metals, many plants produce the amino acid proline [Ashraf: 2007]. While still unclear, it is thought that the production of proline is a result of its highly beneficial roles as a signaling molecule and an antioxidative molecule. Moreover, it can increase stress tolerance by maintaining osmotic balance [Hayat: 2012]. This experiment seeks to analyze whether the presence of proline aids the process of photosynthesis in plant cells when they are under salt stress. In order to do so, the effect of salt on photosynthesis must first be measured and then contrasted to the photosynthesis rates with the presence of proline. We predicted that the presence of greater proline amounts would increase rates of photosynthesis in salt-stressed spinach. 


Materials and Method:
A mortar, pestle, and medium beaker were cooled on ice while the central vein of five spinach leaves was removed and thrown away. The leaves were then rinsed and added to the mortar with 10Ml grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in a tricine buffer with a pH of 8). The mixture was ground until it was a paste and then an additional 10Ml of grinding buffer was add and mixed. The entire mixture was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. The strained liquid was transferred into a chilled 50Ml centrifuge tube labeled “A” and spun at 200xG for three minutes at 4°C in a centrifuge. The supernatant was then poured into a second chilled 50Ml tube labeled “B” while the debris pellet was left in “A.” Tube “B” was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000xG at 4°C. The supernatant was poured into a 50Ml tube labeled “C.” 20Ml of grinding buffer was then added to pellet “B” where it was suspended by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. 19 test tubes were then labeled and the spectrophotometer was turned on and set to 600nm. Three replicates of each of the following reaction mixtures was then prepared the following mixtures. 

Each tube was mixed after adding the chloroplasts and then the samples were transferred to cuvettes and their absorbances were measured. They were then placed in the sun and absorbance was measured every 10 minutes for 30 minutes.


Results:
In order to test the beneficial role of proline on photosynthesis in spinach cells under salt stress, we isolated chloroplasts using centrifugation and measured absorbency of various samples using DCIP.  We found that higher concentrations of proline correlated with higher absorbance levels. After a large positive increase in the first ten minutes, the general trend showed gradual decreasing in absorbance levels in all samples. However, as a whole, the samples with higher proline levels in combination with salt stress had higher absorbances. This data suggests a correlation between proline and a chloroplast’s ability to photosynthesize while under salt stress. A one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to calculate statistical significance. The difference between the 20mM proline and the salt stress with no proline was not statistically different (P=0.465, d.f.=6, t-value=0.0909). The difference between the 20mM proline and the 40mM proline sample was not statistically different (P=0.412, d.f.=6, t-value=0.2323). Finally, the difference between the 60mM proline and the 40mM proline sample was not statistically different (P=0.4614, d.f.=6, t-value=0.1011).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis–that the presence of greater proline amounts would increase rates of photosynthesis in salt-stressed spinach–was not supported. We expected to see a large difference in absorbance between the controll sample of salt-stressed chloroplasts and the various samples with concentrations of proline in addition to salt stress. Moreover, we anticipated that higher levels of proline would result in higher absorbance rates. Since absorbance is directly correlated to rates of photosynthesis because of proton transfer to DCIP, we expected higher levels of proline to show increased rates of photosynthesis. While our results do show a general trend where the higher the concentration of proline, the higher its absorbance, the differences between the samples were not statistically significent. This implies that, though proline may have some effect on chloroplast photosynthesis rates while under salt stress, it is not enough to make significent change in the ability of the cells to cope with external stressors. As a whole, salt stress leads to the accumulation of NaCl in chloroplasts, which can impair photosynthesis by targeting the water-oxidation complex and the PS2 reaction centers [Sudhir: 2004]. In the previous study that was done by Hayat mentioned in the introduction, it was shown that proline aids cellular response to stress by stabilizing the electron transport complex-II as well as enzymes like RUBISCO. Additionally, it significently mitigates the effects of salt stress in tobacco plants [Hayat: 2012]. Based on the results of previous studies, exogenous application of proline should have made a significent difference on the absorbance levels of our samples. One explanation for our results is that there was not a high enough concentration of proline to induce a large change. This would explain why, though there was some difference, the change was not big enough to be significent. Another possibility is personal error throughout the experiment. In the future, the experiment could be improved by changing the amount of time the samples spend in the sun or by testing a wider range of proline concentration values. In the future, fully comprehending the role of proline on the ability of plants to cope with salinity stress could lead to a deeper understanding of potential solutions for dealing with the reduced crop yield that results from excessive salinity.
