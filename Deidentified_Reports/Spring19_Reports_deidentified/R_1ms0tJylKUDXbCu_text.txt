Title: The Effect of Precor on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment is to determine whether or not Precor, substituting in for Juvenile Hormone, has an effect on the size of Manduca sexta caterpillars. This will be tested in terms of the caterpillars’ heights and weights collected during the experiment, with a Two-Sample T-Test being conducted to test both. Here, Precor is acting as a substitute for Juvenile Hormone, which is a hormone that controls the molting of the caterpillar larvae. The hypothesis of this experiment was that the group treated with Precor-soaked food would be larger, in weight and length, than the control group would be. This hypothesis was not supported by the results obtained, proving that further expanding on this particular experiment or on other similar studies needs to be done.

Introduction:
This experiment is designed to test the effect of Precor, a Juvenile Hormone substitute, on Manduca sexta caterpillars. Juvenile Hormones “are long chain organic molecules that are produced mainly by glands located on either side of the fore-gut, called the Corpus Allata” (11). Juvenile Hormone, or JH as it will be referred to in this experiment, controls the molting during the caterpillars’ development. It plays a crucial role in the cycle of metamorphosis in a Manduca sexta as it transitions into a fully grown caterpillar. It is known that a rise in the level of JH could cause faster or greater levels of molting into a larvae in these caterpillars. This experiment has been designed to test the question- “Would Precor, a JH supplement, have an effect on the size of the Manduca Caterpillars?”. The experimenter’s hypothesis for this was that if a group is treated with Precor-soaked food would be larger, in weight and length, than the control group, proving that Precor would increase the size of the test subjects.

Materials and Methods:
Puncture holes (2) in each cell of the container and label/number each cell (1-8). Measure out 40 g of the food.  After measuring it out, the food must be stirred and separated into 4, 10 g sections. These will be given to each of the control caterpillars. After the food is added to each cell, they will be given 100 mL of water. This will be repeated for the other caterpillars, except this time they will be given Precor (1:1250 concentration). Take the height and weight of each caterpillar and record all measurements in lab notebooks. Next, the caterpillars should be placed in their cells and the container will be placed in a 24-hour-light incubator. For the duration of the experiment, the caterpillars will be measured daily and they will be given a replacement of food if their food is dried out. After all data is collected, two One-Sample T-Tests will be done, one for height and one for weight to determine if there is a significant difference between the control group and the group treated with Precor.

Results:

All of the caterpillars that were tested started off weighing between 0.5-1.0 grams and being between 3-4 centimeters in length. For the control group, they gained between 0.9-10.07 grams in weight and between and between 1.2-4.5 centimeters in length (as seen in Table #1). For the test group, they gained between -0.47-7.04 grams and between -0.5-3.2 centimeters (as seen in Table #2). With the data collected and averaged, a Two-Sample T-Test was conducted to determine whether or not the test group was significantly heavier than the control group. It was concluded that it was not. Another Two -Sample T-Test was also conducted to determine whether or not the test group was significantly longer than the control group. It was determined that it was not. Also observed was one caterpillar (#8) that died during the experiment and another caterpillar (#2) that also appeared close to death. There also appeared to be outliers in both the control group and the test group.


Discussion:
First off, the results of this experiment did not support the experimenter’s hypothesis. This could be due to many reasons, particularly that the concentration of the Precor that was used in the experiment was not enough to make for a noticeable or significant effect in the weight or length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. There are also many other possible explanations for the hypothesis not being supported. One, of course, being that Precor and JH itself does not increase the size of the caterpillars no matter its concentration. Other potential reasons for this could include that the experiment was not done for a long enough period of time or that the JH was not introduced to the caterpillars at the right point in their development. Also, the experiment could always have resulted in this way due to unrecognized experimenter error(s). All of these bring into question the what the next step is in this experiment. I believe that the best thing to do next would be to expand the experiment. It should be done with larger numbers of subjects and trials and it should be done for a longer period of time to rid the experiment of any outliers. After that, the next best thing to do would be to test different concentrations of Precor. This experiment has a lot of room for improvement and for taking the next step, so it could move forward in multiple different directions besides the ones listed. The results that were obtained in this experiment were not the same as what other experiments had discovered. In one case, however, a study published in The Journal of Insect Science also had their Manduca sexta caterpillars gaining large amounts of weight during this period which is what happened in our experiment (Browder, M.H., D’Amico, L.J., Nijhoot, H.F.).
