Title: Effects of Diquat Dibromide on the Photosynthesis of Spinach Leaves at Different pH Values

Abstract:
Herbicides affect photosynthesis activity of plants under different conditions, depending on the chemical composition of the herbicide. Since diquat is a general herbicide that breaks down in alkaline pH, the group hypothesized that the chloroplast activity in those spinach leaves would be higher than the plants that were treated with a more acidic pH. Using a spectrometer, the absorbances were recorded, thus providing a direct correlation with activity. A one-way ANOVA test was performed and had insignificent differences between results. These results could be due to the freshness of the spinach leaves or the time constraint of the experiment.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a three-stage process in plants that occurs inside the chloroplasts. Through this process, light is absorbed and produces NADPH which is used to drive the Calvin cycle. Glucose produced by the Calvin cycle is used by the mitochondria to power the cell [Alberts: 2014]. It is possible to measure chloroplast activity by measuring oxygen production, glucose production, or carbon dioxide absorption. Absorbance allows photosystem II activity to be measured because electrons are passed through using the hill reaction. Research has shown that factors that can affect photosynthesis in leaves include light exposure, temperature, and potassium movement across the inner membrane of the chloroplast and therefore the pH of the plant. For example, exposure of spinach leaves to a high concentration of potassium ions decreases the pH of the plant, thus significently altering photosynthetic activity in the leaves [Berkowitz]. Herbicides also have been known to have effects on photosynthesis because they inhibit the hill reaction from occurring. Diquat dibromide is an herbicide found in common weed killers, such as Round Up and Triple Strike. This herbicide is non-specific, so it has the same effects on all plants with which it makes contact. While potent, the herbicide is broken down in an alkaline pH [Morgan: 1982]. This means that the herbicide is most active at lower pH values. Diquat has been found to have reduced eutrophication of algae in acidic lake water in a study that lasted 21 days by decreasing the activity and respiration of the algae in the freshwater microbial community [Melendez: 1993]. Based on this research, if the chloroplasts of spinach leaves are exposed to diquat, then they will have lower absorbances than those that were not exposed to diquat. Due to the chemistry of diquat, if the samples are treated with lower pH values, then will have lower absorbance than those with that were treated with higher pH values.

Materials and Method:
First, the main stem of 4 medium-sized spinach leaves were removed, and the remaining leaves were rinsed with water and blotted Dry. The leaves and 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer, 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0, were added to a chilled mortar and pestle and grinded into a thick paste with no large chunks of leaf remaining. Then, an additional10 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the paste to mix into a slurry. The mixture was filtered through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. The liquid in the beaker was transferred to a 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun in the centrifuge at at 200 x G, 1200 rpm, at 4 C for 10 minutes. Next, the centrifuged supernatant was divided into three tubes. The first tube, tube “A” was not changed. Tube “B” was treated with pH 4 and Tube “C” was treated with pH 10. All three samples were spun again for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. The supernatant, which contained the pH residue, was poured off of the sample, and the pellet was rehydrated with reaction buffer, 100 mM solution of pH 6.5, and kept cool. To prepare for the test, 26 large test tubes were labeled and prepared. Five replicates of each of the following reaction mixes and one blank solution were prepared for testing. Using 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP (excluding the blank sample, which was treated with 7 Ml of water), 5 Ml of reaction buffer in each test tube. Tubes 11-25 were treated with 1 Ml of Diquat. The diquat was a concentration of 2.30% in the name brand week and grass killer called Triple Strike. 100 μl of chloroplasts from the appropriate tubes were added to the prepared test tubes, mixed, and then the absorbances of the samples were recorded using a spectrometer at 600 nm to be used as the time zero data points. The samples were placed under a light and the absorbances were recorded every five minutes for fifteen minutes. The percent change was calculated for each sample after each five-minute period and a one-way ANOVA test was used to determine significance.

Results:
The average total percent change in absorbance at 600 nm for the sample with no chloroplasts was 0.0748 ± 2.212 %.  For the sample with chloroplasts, it was 43.065 ± 12.552 %. The sample with Chloroplasts had an average percent change in absorbance of 11.069 ± 3.893 %. The pH 4 sample had an average total percent change in absorbance of 11.095 ± 0.801 %, and the pH 10 sample had an average total percent change in absorbance of 10.717 ± 0.669 % [figure 1]. The overall p_value for the total dataset was 7.64E-9.


Discussion:
Based on the results of the ANOVA test, our hypothesis, that the samples that were treated with herbicide would have different absorbances, was supported because tests 5, 6, and 7 were statistically significent. However, the hypothesis that the samples with a lower pH would have a higher absorbance than those with a higher pH was not supported because tests 8-10 were statistically insignificent. Compared to the mean values, the standard deviations for some of the percent changes of absorbance were relatively large. This is because the samples required a couple of minutes to be made, so not all of the photosynthesis activity was able to start at exactly the same time. The group expected the final sample group to have a lower absorbance than those with a lower pH because of the chemical structure of Diquat. However, possible reasons why the results did not have this outcome could include that the test was run for only fifteen minutes. A longer period of time may have been necessary for this outcome to have occurred. In a test in eastern Australia, several herbicides were tested for effectiveness in neutral to alkaline soil, and Diquat had lower effectiveness than others tested. However, this test was run on four large fields over an entire growing season [Pederson: 1999]. The chemical composition of Diquat was the basis of our hypothesis, but the breakdown may not have been able to fully occur during lab. Additionally, the data did not correlate to the data from the Berkowitz experiment because those leaves were still attached to the root up until the time of the experiment where the leaves tested during the lab were purchased from a grocery store. The potassium ion concentration in the chloroplasts is not likely to fluctuate while the spinach is dying. For future experiments, the time frame could be longer than the duration of the lab and the photosynthesis activity could be measured every day or twice per day for several days. This would give more data to study. Tests like this one are important because they can help researchers to develop fertilizers or herbicides that work well under certain conditions.
