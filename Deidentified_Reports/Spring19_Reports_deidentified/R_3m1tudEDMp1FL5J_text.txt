Title: The effects of varying pH levels on Diquat herbicide in Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts

Abstract:
Herbicides are commonly used to prevent plant growth. Herbicides work through various means to inhibit cellular function. Diquat is a commonly used commercial-use herbicide, and inhibits cell function via dehydration. Diquat is thought to perform best under neutral or acidic conditions, and to decompose in alkaline environments. In this lab, we tested whether pH affects the efficiency of Diquat on Spinacia oleracea, spinach, chloroplasts. Our results proved a significant difference between chloroplasts left untreated and chloroplasts treated with Diquat. However, our results did not show a significant difference in Diquat efficiency in varying pH levels. This information may be used in the future by geologists, agriculturalists, or individuals.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants turn light energy into chemical energy, allowing plants to survive and grow. Chloroplasts are the organelles that carry out these photosynthetic processes. Chloroplasts trap light energy in chlorophyll pigments and convert this energy to sugar, releasing oxygen gas as a byproduct. Herbicides are used individually and commercially to destroy unwanted vegetation. These toxins inhibit chloroplast efficiency in a variety of ways. Diquat dibromide is a general herbicide that functions by dehydrating plants’ cells, including chloroplasts [Cornell: 2019]. This dehydration prevents chloroplasts from operating efficiently. Diquat tends to function best in neutral or acidic environments, while it decomposes in alkaline environments [Cornell: 2019]. Spinacia oleracea—spinach—is a common leafy green grown all over the world, native to central Asia. As a darker green, spinach contains a high volume of chloroplasts. In this lab, we will test the effects of Diquat on the photosynthetic activity of Spinacia oleracea in various pH levels. If we are to add Diquat to chloroplasts treated with pH 6.5, pH 4, and pH 10 solutions, then the recorded absorbances of the pH 10 treated chloroplasts will be significantly greater, as the Diquat won’t inhibit chloroplast activity as efficiently in an alkaline environment. 


Materials and Methods:
We removed the central veins from four medium-sized spinach leaves. We then combined these leaves with grinding buffer in a mortar and pestle to created a paste. We filtered this paste through cheesecloth and centrifuged this mixture for ten minutes at 1200 rpm at 4C. We then divided the centrifuged mixture into three equal parts. To one part we added a 6.5 reaction buffer, to another we added a pH 4 solution, and to the last we added a pH 10 solution. We allowed these mixtures to incubate for ten minutes before centrifuging again for ten minutes at 3000 rpm at 4C. After the second centrifuge, we poured off the supernatant of all three mixtures. To the remaining pellet, in all three tubes, we added a reaction buffer in order to reconstitute the pellet. In 25 test tubes we combined varying amounts of chloroplasts (from one of the three tubes), water, reaction buffer, 130 mM DCIP, and Diquat. We assayed the test tubes at zero minutes and recorded the results. We the allowed the test tubes to incubate for five minutes, after which we conduct a second assay, recording the absorbances and calculating the percent change. We repeated this step two more times, for a total of fifteen minutes. At the conclusion of the assays, we used an ANOVA test to determine whether or not our results were significant.


Results:
The results of this experiment proved that there was a significant difference in the percent change of the test group with only chloroplasts when compared to every other test group. There was no significant difference between any of the other test groups. The standard deviation and average percent changes at five, ten, and fifteen minutes—of each group—are listed below in Table 1. These results are shown on Figure 1. The results of the ANOVA test are noted in Table 2.


Discussion:
The results of our experiment lent significant results only when comparing the chloroplast test group to other groups. There was a significant difference between chloroplasts and no chloroplasts, and between chloroplasts and each group of chloroplasts with herbicide, regardless of pH level. There was no significant difference when analyzing the effects of pH on Diquat efficiency. In this respect, our hypothesis was rejected and the null hypothesis supported. There was no evidence supporting the statement that Diquat works best in neutral or acidic conditions. However, our study paralleled others in that Diquat had a significant effect on the productivity of chloroplasts [Melendez et. al: 1993]. Our lack of significant results may be attributed to the pH treatment method employed. By centrifuging the pH solutions with the chloroplasts for only ten minutes, there may not have been enough of a difference in the final pH of our assayed solutions. Using varying pH reaction buffers in the future, instead of treating the chloroplasts with pH solution, may provide significant results. Our lack of results may also be attributed to too short incubation periods between assays. The incubation periods’ limited time may not have been long enough to develop a significant result in terms of Diquat efficiency. The information gained from this experiment may prove valuable to farmers, agriculturalists, and/or geologists that wish to use the properties of Diquat for research purposes or applications.
