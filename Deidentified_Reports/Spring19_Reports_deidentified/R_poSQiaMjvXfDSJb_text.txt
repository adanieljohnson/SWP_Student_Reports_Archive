Title: The Effect of Nitrogen-Rich Solution on the Root to Shoot Ratio in Pisum sativun

Abstract:
The uptake of nutrients is a key process in plants that allows them to obtain the resources they need to grow and produce energy.  In order to maximize their efficiency, plants can adapt to their environment and alter the allocation patterns of their resources.  One method that plants can use to increase their chance for survival is by altering their root to shoot ratio.  In our experiment, we studied the effect of a nitrogen-rich fertilizer solution on the pea plant (Pisum sativun).  We predicted that the experimental group supplemented with Miracle-Gro solution would have a decreased root to shoot ratio in comparison to the controll group that was only given water.  We gave each group their respective solution every day for 14 days before we began taking data.  After the plants had grown over this two-week period, there were obvious observations to be made about the difference between the two groups.  Our data for the root to shoot ratio of the mass was statistically significent, but our data for the root to shoot ratio of the length was insignificent.  The null hypothesis can be rejected however, since the ratio was increased in general in the experimental group for both mass and length.  More studies on the effects of too much nitrogen being added to soil could be beneficial i

Introduction:
In nature, there are biotic and abiotic factors that affect many different aspects of a plant.  Since there are limited resources, plants must fight for sunlight, nutrients, and water just as animals fight for what they need.  One of the most important aspects that plants can alter is the allocation of resources.  Since the different parts of plants have different functions, the allocation patterns can be altered based on what specific environment they live in.  The roots of a plant are below ground, while the shoots (leaves and stems) are above ground.  The root to shoot ratio is especially important in plants since they each have separate functions, and both are necessary for survival.  Plants can slightly alter their root to shoot ratio allowing them to maximize their allocation of resources.  Depending on which resources are sparse or abundant, plants adapt to their environment and are more efficient with their energy.  If there is a high availability of resources in the soil, the plant will allocate a larger percent of its biomass into the roots in order to uptake these nutrients [Shemesh: 2011].  A vital part of the soil that helps plants to grow is nitrogen.  Nitrogen is a nutrient that can come in many different forms or ions in the soil but is necessary for the different processes of a plant.  In this lab we will test the effects of adding large amounts of nitrogen on the root to shoot ratio in the Pisum sativun plant.  If we add extra nitrogen to the soil, the plant will grow larger and the root to shoot ratio will decrease.

Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis, we first planted 18 seeds inside of two pots.  We carved out nine holes in the soil and placed two seeds in each hole in order to start our experiment.  After planting the seeds, we labeled the containers as controll and experimental and placed them in the greenhouse.  We gave the controll plants 50 Ml of water and the experimental plants 50 Ml of a nitrogen-rich Miracle-Gro fertilizer solution every day for a total of 14 days.  The Miracle-Gro contained a large amount of nitrogen, which allowed us to test our hypothesis against the controll group.  After two weeks, we harvested 10 plants from each container by dumping them in a tub of water and separating the roots from the vermiculite.  We sprayed the roots with water to get rid of all the extra soil that was still stuck and then dried the plants with paper towels. We then cut the plants at the junction of the roots and stem, right above the seed.  This allowed us to effectively separate the plant into its root and shoot portions.  After we distinctly had two parts of each plant, we used a ruler to measure the length and an electronic balance to measure the mass.  We recorded values for the length and mass of every root and shoot in a table and used this data to find the root to shoot ratio.  We then were able to perform a statistical analysis of our experiment based off the average root to shoot ratio per plant for both the controll and experimental group.

Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the average root to shoot ratio for the controll group was 1.023 for mass and 0.676 for length.  The average root to shoot ratio for the experimental group was 1.830 for mass and 0.822 for length.  We were able to complete a two-sample t_test for both length and width to test for a significent difference between the controll group given just water and the experimental group treated with a nitrogen-rich Miracle-Gro solution.  We found that the mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group for length (t_stat = 1.09176, d.f. = 18, P = 0.289337).  However, the means were statistically significently different for mass (t_stat = 3.375149, d.f. = 18, P = 0.003372).  Some of the observations we made while conducting this experiment were that after the two weeks the controll and experimental group plants definitely looked different from each other.  The experimental group was much shorter and had much less stems and leaves, while the controll group was more fully grown and larger in size.

Discussion:
Based on our results, we can see that our data for mass is statistically significent but our data for length is insignificent at an alpha level of 0.05.  While we predicted the root to shoot ratio to decrease, it actually increased, so we can reject our null hypothesis.  Based on the observations we took during lab however, we can see that the nitrogen solution that we gave to our experimental group had a negative effect on our plants.  Not only were they much shorter and less healthy, the root to shoot ratio increased in general.  Nitrogen is a nutrient that is necessary in plants and they couldn’t live without it. The uptake and transport of nitrogen is a process affected by many different factors and is controllled by many different processes within the plant [Pate: 1973].  It makes sense that the root to shoot ratio increased because the extra nitrogen present in the soil would have caused the plants to allocate their resources more into the roots, causing the biomass of the roots to increase.  However, since there was such a large amount of nitrogen present, it must have had some unpredicted negative effects on the plants’ growth.  It seemed as if this abundance of nitrogen caused the plant to “burnout”.  This can be applied on a larger scale to fertilizer.  Most fertilizers, such as the Miracle-Gro formula we used, contain some form of nitrogen to help the plant grow.  Based off our experiment though, it seems that too much nitrogen is bad for plants.  More experiments can be completed to find the perfect amount of nitrogen for the Pisum sativun plant, as well as other plants, to benefit from the addition of this nutrient to the soil.
