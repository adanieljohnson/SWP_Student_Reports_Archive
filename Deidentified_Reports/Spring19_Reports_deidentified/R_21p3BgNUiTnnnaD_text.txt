Title: The Effects of Tank Size on Aggressive Behavior in Betta splendens

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to determine how changing the size of the environment would impact the aggressive tendencies in Betta splendens (betta fish). We hypothesized that betta fish placed in small tanks would display their red manes for longer periods of time than when placed in large tanks. Three betta fish were paired with each other and the duration of red mane flares were recorded, in seconds, for each betta fish. The difference in the amount of time that the fish displayed their red manes in the large tank and small tank was recorded. An increase in the duration of red mane flares was noticed in each pair of betta fish as they were placed in the small tank versus the large tank. The significance of these results was proven using a one tailed, paired t-test (t-stat = 2.926, df = 6, P = 0.033), thus supporting our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
All animals exhibit behaviors of varying types that are required for the organism’s survival. Whether it is behaviors towards members of their own species or animals of different species, these individuals interact in a plethora of ways that can be influenced by their environment. Betta splendens (betta fish) typically exhibit aggressive behaviors when interacting with members of their own species (also called intraspecific behaviors), which can be observed through visual cues such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, pectoral fin erection, gill cover spreading, and branchiostegal membrane protrusion (commonly known as a red mane flare) [Johnson AD: 2018]. These aggressive behaviors can be exacerbated due to stressors introduced by the environment, as shown by an experiment conducted in which food, competitors, and environment size were manipulated to measure changes in aggressin in Amphilophus citrinellus fish. The study found that aggression was significantly lower in larger aquariums [Oldfield: 2011]. These results made us question how aggressive tendencies in betta fish may change when two fish are forced to be in a close proximity with one another. With the results produced by the Amphilophus citrinellus experiment, we hypothesize that betta fish placed in smaller tanks will display their red manes for longer periods of time than when placed in larger tanks. 


Materials and Methods:
Three betta fish were placed in a singular tank with three solid barriers so that they were each in their own small tank. The three betta fish were numbered and paired with each other betta fish for five minutes in both a smaller tank (15*11*19 cm) (where the barrier was simply removed) and a larger tank (25*7*50 cm). For the five minutes while the fish were in the same environment together, the amount of time each fish displayed their red manes was recorded. Each fish was given a resting time of at least five minutes between periods of exposure, where the fish were returned to their solitary tanks. The differences in duration of red mane flares in the small and large tank for each pair of betta fish were averaged and tested for significance using a paired t-test at the 0.05 significance level. 

Results:
Each pair of betta fish was observed to have an average increase in the duration of red mane flares in the smaller tank when compared to that of the larger tank, as seen in figure 1 where the average length of time for red mane flares increased from 26.16 +/- 47.04 seconds to 93.23 +/- 90.78 seconds for the duration of red mane flares and proved to be significant (t-stat = 2.926, df = 6, P = 0.033).

Discussion:
Considering that statistical testing produced a p-value below the 0.05 significance level, we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported, and that betta fish placed in small tanks displayed their red manes for longer periods of time than when they were placed in large tanks. These results are similar to findings produced in a study conducted by Maryville College, where the amount of physical space allotted for betta fish was inversely related to the occurrence of aggressive behavior [Dolan A: 2015]. This conclusion implies that with a decrease in environment size, there was an increase in the presence of aggressive behavior in these betta fish. One possible explanation for this result can be attributed to the simple reality that as the environment size decreases the betta fish are more likely to be in a closer proximity to one another, causing more interactions and perhaps increasing the occurrence of aggressive behavior as the fish are forced to interact in their smaller environments. Another reason behind the increase in aggressive behavior that was observed could be attributed to territorial and aggressive tendencies of certain fish within the betta fish used in this experiment. The change in environment from the betta fish’s original tank to a new tank may have triggered territorial and aggressive behavior as a stress response. However, this explanation requires further testing as a competitor betta fish could be placed in another tank that is already occupied by a betta fish that is not moved from its own tank. Perhaps by manipulating the size of the environment in this experiment, territorial tendencies can be measured in concert with differences in tank size to determine a definite cause for increases in betta fish aggression. Regardless, these results can be extrapolated to the daily lives of betta fish owners as they must determine what size fish tank is appropriate for their betta fish, and how having multiple betta fish in a tank impacts the size of tank needed in order to keep their pets happy.
