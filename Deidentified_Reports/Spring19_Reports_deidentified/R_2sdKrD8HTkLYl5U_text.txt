Title: Effects of Calcium Activator A23187 on Muscle Contraction in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Neuromuscular communication can be manipulated by many factors including calcium. This mechanism is fundamental in preserving and maintaining life and therefore deserves to make known all of the possible ways to influence it and make it more efficient. By injecting a calcium activator called A23187, muscles in Rania pipiens can reveal how calcium affects the frequency and intensity of muscle contractions. Muscle contractile force was measured before and after injection of A23187. Although the calcium activator was expected to increase the intensity and frequency of the muscle contractions, the statistical test showed that, with a p_value below 0.5, the calcium activator had no effect on muscle contraction. The results suggest that the waiting times between injection and measurement were either too long or too short.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles work together to help the body perform daily, necessary tasks and react to stimuli. Receptors in the muscles send signals to the brain informing it on what actions to take and what to tell the body to do. The brain also controlls the muscle contractions in response to stimuli [UW 2016]. In order to further examine communication between nerves and muscles, the species Rania pipiens, commonly known as the Northern leopard frog, will be tested using calcium activator injections of A23187 in its leg muscles as a model. R. pipiens are a large type of frog that reside in swamps, marshes, and streams [Nevada: 2015]. The R. pipiens leg serves as a useful test subject because the skin layer is very thin so it is easy to expose the muscle. Calcium serves as a useful independent variable because of its role in muscle contraction. When calcium is released into a muscle as a result of an action potential, it binds to a molecule called troponin, which then exposes myosin-binding sites. Actin, a filament, binds to myosin, another filament, and the myosin heads pull the actin, fueling muscle contraction. With more calcium in the muscles, more muscle contraction occurs. The voltages will be observed from a myogram, a visual representation of the different stages of a single muscle twitch: the latent period, the contraction phase, and the relaxation phase. 
The experiment aims to test the efficiency of communication between the nervous system and the muscular system. Examining neuromuscular communication can provide information about curing diseases such as muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. When a calcium activator is injected, the leg muscle in the R. pipiens will respond with a higher voltage than in would without a calcium activator injection.

Materials and Method:
In order to prepare the frog leg for measurement, the leg was de-gloved by removing the skin layer. The sciatic nerve was exposed by pulling it away from the muscle. The gastrocnemus muscle was detached and isolated by separating it from the leg and cutting it off as well as the Achilles tendon. A string was tied around the disconnected end of the gastrocnemus and attached to the force transducer. An electrical probe was inserted into the gastrocnemus. Stimuli between 0.0-0.5 amps and 1.0-1.5 amps were applied to the muscle to stimulate the three phases of the muscle twitch. The corresponding voltages were recorded. The procedure was repeated, except with the probe resting under the sciatic nerve. The procedure was repeated again, but with injections of 0.1Ml of 100mM of A23187. For each frog leg, two minutes passed after injection until action potentials were fired. The corresponding voltages were recorded. After collecting the data, a paired t_test was conducted using the results.

Results:
According to Graph 1, the trials in which the three R. pipiens leg muscles were not injected with the calcium activator had a higher average voltage in muscle contractions than the trials in which the three R. pipiens leg muscles were injected with the calcium activator at a stimulation of 0.2V. The 0.2V stimulation was near the threshold value of the contraction. The muscles that were injected with the calcium activator responded with a voltage that was 0.153V higher than the response that the muscles not injected with the calcium activator produced. The paired t_test produced a p_value of 0.188, indicating that the data was not significent. The data has a whole did not show notable differences in data.

Discussion:
The calcium activator injections were expected to increase the voltage in muscle contractions compared to that of the muscles without calcium activator injections. The averages of voltage responses from both testing groups show that the hypothesis was not supported. The statistical test revealed that the differences in data between the controll group and the experimental groups were likely due to chance, not because of a change in calcium activator injection. The controll group and the experimental group shared no difference in data according to the paired t_test. The calcium was unable to increase the muscle contraction response because the times between the injections and the stimulations were either too long or too short. If the waiting period was too long, the calcium activator would have ceased its activation before the contraction response value was recorded. If the waiting period was too short, then the calcium activator would not have been able to activate in the muscle before recording the contraction response value. 
In a similar study conducted in 1994, scientists also examined calcium and muscle contractions. For this study, the scientists examined the effect of voltage on the amount of calcium that naturally activated within the muscle. The researchers noted that the certain voltages resulted in high amounts of calcium, but the two extreme voltages resulted in low amounts of calcium. [Garcia: 1994]. This experiment shows the difference between how the calcium activator worked in our experiment and how natural calcium responds to a stimulus. The naturally-occurring calcium increased the muscle contraction response because of calciumâ€™s fundamental role in the cell biology of muscle contraction. Although the data suggests that a calcium activator does not increase muscle contractions, the known role that calcium plays in muscle contraction suggests that it should. For a future experiment, it would be wise to determine the ideal waiting period to discover the optimal amount of time to wait to record voltages after injection. This way, the most significent results could be produced. In order to carry out this experiment, the voltage would be tested between one-minute and three-minute intervals.
