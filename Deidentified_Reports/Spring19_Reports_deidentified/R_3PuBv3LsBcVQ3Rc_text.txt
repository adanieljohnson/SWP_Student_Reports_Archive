Title: Photosynthesis Activity Change in Kale with the Presence of Extra CO2 in Environment

Abstract:
Carbon dioxide is an increasing element in environmental polluting, and the major causation of the greenhouse effect. Meanwhile, it is also an indispensable factor to produce energy in the photosynthesis process of the plant. Carbon dioxide production will be increasing dramatically in the next few decades, and the reuse of carbon dioxide is critical in relieving the global polluting crisis. Thus, the purpose of this experiment is to test whether the increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the environment can increase the activity of photosynthesis. Since the majority of photosynthetic plants are the green and leafy plant, kale is used as the subject in the experiment. Chloroplast from kale leaves is purified and extracted, and its photosynthesis response to elevated [CO2] is tested in four environments with different [CO2]. 

Introduction:
The greenhouse effect is an increasing crisis that is confronting the human race and every living being on earth, which increases the surface temperature of earth gradually by absorbing more radiation from the sun. [Schneider: 2001] The main reason that is causing the greenhouse effect is carbon dioxide, which is mostly emitted from industry and transportation.[Kiehl: 1997] Although, carbon dioxide is a waste in almost all of the combustion reaction, it is actually valuable in another chemical reaction that can generate energy and nutrition: photosynthesis.[Shevela: 2012] It is predicted that the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide will be increased from the concentration now which is approximately 390 μmol mol−1 to between 730 and 1020 μmol mol−1 by 2100.[Canadell: 2007] And if the increase of the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere can be utilized in the photosynthesis of plants, the greenhouse effect can then be assuaged which can benefit to the global environmental equilibrium. Moreover, the increase of carbon dioxide in the environment can speed up the growth of plants.[Poorter: 2003] The increase in the growth rate of plants is closely related to the photosynthesis activity rate. Thus, with the knowledge of carbon dioxide is one major factor for the photosynthesis to occur, the hypothesis for this experiment is whether the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide can increase photosynthesis activity. 

Materials and Method:
        This lab is focusing solely on the analysis of PS-II activity by using Hill reaction, which takes advantage of photosystem II passes its electrons to an alternative electron acceptor which its activity can then be measured. The alternative electron acceptor for the Hill reaction in this experiment is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP). Because its property that can change color, it can be measured by the spectrometer and then determine the absorbance. The less color is shown, the more photosystem II activity. Kale leaves will be used as the subject to produce chloroplast solution and be tested on. Kale, Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, is green and leafy, which contains chlorophyll and can be representative for green leafy plants. Kale was crushed and ground into a thick paste with no large chunks mixed in it. Then, it was diluted by adding the additional grinding buffer. The purification of kale was done by using differential centrifugation, and the pure chloroplast solution from kale is then collected and ready to be used as a subject. The carbon dioxide as we know is about 400 ppm in the atmosphere. In this experiment, the environment that exposed to the kale chloroplast solution is differentiated in 400ppm, 500ppm, 600ppm and 700ppm of carbon dioxide. The 500ppm, 600ppm, and 700ppm environment were prepared by adding 0.005Ml, 0.006Ml, and 0.007Ml of carbonated water into the 10Ml solution which contains water, 130mM DCIP, and the chloroplast. 130mM DCIP expresses a dark blue color, however, as the photosynthesis activity increases, the color is lightened. The absorbance of the color of the solution was measured right after adding the carbonated water in each environment by using the spectrometer. Then, repeatedly measured the absorbance after every 10 minutes, until a total of 30 minutes lapsed by. Compare the change in absorbance. ANOVA test is used for analyzing the data. The percent change of the absorbance of the color at the beginning and after 30 minutes is compared in each group. 

Results:
In the solution without addition carbonated water, the absorbance changed from the average of 0.3237 at the beginning to 0.2433 after 30 minutes and has a mean percent change in absorbance of 26.20%. In the solution with 0.005Ml carbonated water added, the absorbance changed from an average of 0.3473 at the beginning to 0.2103 after 30 minutes, gives a 38.38% mean change in absorbance. In the solution that has 0.006Ml carbonated water, the absorbance changed from 0.3413 to 0.2037, which gives a 40.01% mean change in mean/photosynthesis activity. In the solution with 0.007Ml carbonated water, the mean change in absorbance is 49.40%, which the change is from 0.3370 at the beginning to 0.1707 after 30 minutes. According to the ANOVA test, the p_value is 0.413.

Discussion:
The result shows that the change in absorbance increases along with the increase in the carbonated water added to the chloroplast. Therefore, the photosynthesis activity increases as the increase of the concentration of carbon dioxide presented in the environment. However, according to the ANOVA test, the result is insignificent. Several other studies supported the hypothesis that the increment of carbon dioxide in the environment can increase the photosynthesis activity. One study in 2004 used 19 different concentration of carbon dioxide to test the photosynthesis response to the increase of carbon dioxide. [Kirschbaum: 2004] However, this experiment only used three different concentration of CO2 to test the response of photosynthesis. Another study in 2004 used 16 species to test the response of not just photosynthesis, but also carboxylation and leaf nitrogen response to elevated carbon dioxide concentration in three circumstances: forest, grassland, and dessert. [Ellsworth et al.: 2004] In contrast, this experiment only studied on a single species (kale), under a singular circumstance (lab setting). Although the hypothesis is rejected, a clear trend of increasing photosynthesis activity can still be seen from the data and graph. To obtain more supportive data, the future experiment should include more diversity of species at various carbon dioxide concentration. If allowed, performing the experiment under several circumstances can also improve the inclusiveness of the result.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Summarized data of the percent change between average absorbance at time 0 and time 30 minutes in each group. 

Figure 2. A clear trend that chloroplast in 700 ppm has a greater improvement in percent change in of absorbance at each 10, 20 and 30 minutes after the carbonated water is added. The solution in 600 ppm has a slightly higher percent change of absorbance than the solution in 500 ppm in each 10, 20, and 30 minutes after the carbonated water is added. But overall, the 3 solutions that have added carbon dioxide added express more percent change of absorbance than the plain chloroplast solution in any time during the 30 minutes period tested. ANOVA test (p=0.413). 

Figure 3. The solution in 700 ppm has the most percent change in absorbance compare to the rest condition. The 600ppm environment provides a condition for a slightly more percent change in absorbance than 500ppm environment does. Without addition chloroplast, the percent change in absorbance is shown to be the least. ANOVA (p=0.413). *************************************************************************
