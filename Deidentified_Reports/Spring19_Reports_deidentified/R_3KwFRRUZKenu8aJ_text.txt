Title: The Impact of Tubocurarine on Stimulating the Gastrocnemius of Frog Legs

Abstract:
Neural impulses sent through the sciatic nerve allows for the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle within the leg of a frog. In order to understand how the nervous system is affected by drugs inserted into the gastrocnemius muscle, an experiment with the addition of tubocurarine was performed. The experimental hypothesis stated that if tubocurarine is added to the frog leg, then the threshold of the voltage that will excite the leg will increase. 1 mL of 1 m of tubocurarine was inserted into the frog legs and the threshold of the legs with the drug were compared against the threshold of the same frog legs before the insertion. After the addition, two of the three groups showed significance between the two groups. 

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is used by animals in order to respond to stimuli within milliseconds, crucial to the survival and homeostasis of the animal. Each body has three major muscle groups cardiac, smooth and skeletal muscle. In order to contract a muscle, the central nervous system sends electrical signals through motor neurons that cause an action potential to flood the muscle with calcium, which causes the contraction (Johnson: 2018). In a frog leg, the sciatic nerve is responsible for the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle. When the sciatic nerve is stimulated through electrical pulses, the muscle twitches. The accumulation of twitches, also known as summation, allows for a larger contraction (Johnson: 2018). However, muscles can be affected by excitatory and inhibitory drugs within the muscle itself. Tubocurarine is a drug that when inserted into the muscle, will block ACh from binding to its receptors and therefore block the action potential from being sent. This blocks the muscle from receiving the impulses from the motor neurons and therefore won’t twitch. Many experiments have been done that follow the impact of tubocurarine on skeletal muscle. In a study from the Japanese Journal of Physiology, experimenters isolated rabbit and frog skeletal muscle and observed how both caffeine and tubocurarine affected the muscle. The experimenters noted that the tubocurarine “significantly inhibited” the “peak tensions of twitch, tetanus and potassium contracture” (Takauji: 1975). The objective of this lab is to explore the properties of the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog when stimulated with differing voltages in order to find its threshold, then observing how the addition of tubocurarine affects the threshold of the frog leg. The experimental hypothesis states that if tubocurarine is added to the frog leg, then the threshold of the voltage that will excite the leg will increase. 

Materials and Methods:
Using a frog leg, the sciatic nerve was isolated and in contact with the tips of an electrode. The gastrocnemius was also isolated through dissection and kept taught and at 90 to the leg in order to clearly see any movement from the electrical impulses. The control group consisted of 3 frog legs, each stimulated with a range of volts until their threshold for excitement was found. Then the same frog legs were used as a treatment group, by adding  1 mL of 1 m of tubocurarine to the gastrocnemius muscle and waiting five minutes. Using the same legs for both treatment and control was important because each leg has a different threshold for excitation, and so to maintain clear and accurate results, we must use the same legs and compare thresholds on each. After waiting five minutes for the tubocurarine to diffuse throughout the muscle, the threshold for excitement in the treatment leg was found. A paired t-test will be used to compare the threshold of excitement for the control frog legs to their respective treatment legs and determine the mean difference between the two groups in order to understand if there was a statistically significant difference between them. 

Results:
It was possible to see excitation of the frog legs both before and after through twitches of the legs. For the first frog leg, the individual p-value was 0.00018, the t-value was 74.49 and the degrees of freedom was 2. The second frog leg had a p-value of 0.269, the t-value being 1.51 and the degrees of freedom was 2. Finally, the third leg had a p-value of 0.000325, t-value of 55.42 and degrees of freedom as 2. When the frog leg’s times were each averaged and combined to one paired t-test, the average difference between the frog legs excitement before and after the tubocurarine was -0.00411. The p-value calculated for the combination of all frog legs presented was 0.867 with a degree of freedom of 2 and a t-value of 0.189.



Discussion:
The experimental hypothesis states that when the tubocurarine is added to the frog leg, then the threshold of the voltage needed to excite the leg will increase. In the individual results, we can reject the null hypothesis for the first and third legs because both p-values are less than 0.05, and therefore accept the significance of the difference in excitement of the gastrocnemius due to the addition of tubocurarine. However, for the second leg and the combination of each leg, the p-value calculated for the data presented was higher than 0.05 and so we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the threshold of the control and treatment groups. This does not support the experimental hypothesis and while for some legs, the voltage needed to be increased, it was not increased to a statistically significant result. The combination of results is less important than the individual legs data because each leg responds differently to different amounts of voltage, and so while the combination is important, it does not give as much information as the data from the individual legs. The frog legs in this experiment followed a similar pattern to that of the frog legs studied in Effect of Dantrolene Sodium on Excitation/Contraction coupling in Frog Skeletal Muscle. In this experiment, dantrolene sodium’s effect on the skeletal muscle was compared to that of both caffeine and tubocurarine. The frog legs injected with tubocurarine showed to have inhibited ability to function in comparison to the legs before they were impacted by the drug (Takauji: 1975). The research done in 1975 having similar results to those found in the experiment performed in this lab is important because it shows our data is giving reliable information to the audience. The results of this experiment provide the experimenter with further research questions such as what would happen if the same amount of tubocurarine was added, but the waiting period to let the drug set in was increased. Would the frog legs show more significance between results? This experiment provides an excellent example to show how impactful the nervous system is within the animal kingdom. They allow for the muscle movements and responses needed to maintain life each and every day.
