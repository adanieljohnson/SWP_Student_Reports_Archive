Title: Reduced contractions of Raina pipiens’ sciatic nerve when treated with lidocaine

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to examine how the introduction of Lidocaine in the leg of a Raina pipien frog would effect the neuromuscular response. The hypothesis that we tested was if Lidocaine is used to block Na+ channels, then the voltage of the maximum contraction will decrease. We determined the twitch threshold for 3 different frog legs and then tested the frog leg at 0.1 V more than the threshold. The individual frog legs were stimulated 3 times without Lidocaine and 3 times with Lidocaine, and the separate trials for the controll and treatment groups were averaged out. Our results showed that the introduction of Lidocaine does produce a smaller response when the voltage was applied as the controll group had a greater response than the treatment group by an average of about .306, but we could not support our hypothesis because our p_value was not significent. The results from our two-tailed t_test gave us a p_value of .089957. We did not reject the null hypothesis because while our data shows that there is a difference when Lidocaine is injected into the frog leg, our p_value was greater than .05. Based on our results, we were not able to determine that the addition of Lidocaine into the leg of a frog does reduce the neuromuscular response when a voltage is applied

Introduction:
The Raina pipiens was used in this experiment. This frog is a good choice because they produce very distinct reactions when the stimulus is applied and the legs are small and easy to handle. The neuromuscular system is what allows organisms to respond to their environment based off of a certain stimulus they encounter. The somatic neuromuscular system consists of skeletal muscle, which is made up of myofibers. In order to stimulate contractions, motor neurons innervate skeletal muscles by attaching to neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. The excitation of the muscle can be measured through the use of a myogram, which shows the amount of force generated over time. The different stages of muscle twitch include the latent period, which is a short time lapse between the time of stimulation and start of contraction; the contraction phase, which is when muscles shorten; and the relaxation period, which is when muscles return to the relaxed state [Johnson: 2018]. Another important factor is summation, which is the force generated by multiple motor units added together to produce muscle tension [Johnson: 2018]. The two types of summation are spatial summation, which is accomplished by increasing the voltage used to stimulate the nerve. Temporal summation occurs when axons are stimulated repeatedly. The hypothesis that we tested was if Lidocaine is used to block Na+ channels, then the voltage of the maximum contraction will decrease. The dependent variable in this experiment was the voltage response that was measured and the independent variable was the stimulus applied to each frog leg. An experiment such as this is performed because it is important to understand how the neuromuscular system is able to respond to certain stimuli in a very quick amount of time. The speed of the reaction allows the organism to react quickly to potentially dangerous situations.

Materials and Method:
We took 3 frog legs and skinned them using forceps and moistened the legs with frog Ringer’s solution. The inner thigh muscles were spread using a dissecting probe, which revealed the sciatic nerve. The leg was pinned to the examination tray and the myogram probes were connected to the sciatic nerve so that a current could stimulate contractions. A string was attached to the end of the gastrocnemus muscle and tied to a hook in order to make the leg stand vertically. The twitch threshold was determined for each individual frog leg by indirect stimulation. Each frog leg was administered 0.1 V above their respective thresholds three times without Lidocaine and then three additional times with Lidocaine injected. 0.1 Ml of Lidocaine was injected into each frog leg. The voltages for each frog leg were averaged and we then used a two-tailed t_test to find our p_value and determine if our results were significent.

Results:
When the experiment was performed, it was observed that there appeared to be a greater twitch response when the sciatic nerve was not yet treated with lidocaine. The results from our one-tailed t_test gave us a p_value of .089957. The stimulus applied to each frog leg was .3 V as the threshold was .2 V for each frog leg. The average responses for the respective controll groups were .367, .745, and .101 while the average responses for the respective treatment groups were .115, .129, and .052. It can be observed from figure 1 that each controll group had a greater response than the treatment group by an average of about .306.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if Lidocaine is used to block Na+ channels, then the voltage of the maximum contraction will decrease, was not supported. We did not reject the null hypothesis that states there is no difference between the the controll and treatment groups because the results clearly indicate that the response in the controll group was much higher than the response in the group treated with Lidocaine. We could not reject the null hypothesis because our p_value was greater than .05. This data does not support our experimental hypothesis that the addition of Lidocaine to the R. pipien would reduce the response observed in the twitch of the muscle. Sodium plays an important role as it is one of the main components allowing for the contraction of muscles [Ellis: 1972]. The addition of Lidocaine blocks Na+ channels, which reduces the action potential thus producing a smaller response. The resting membrane potential is influenced greatly by sodium, and so the fact that the Na+ channels were blocked played an important role in reducing the overall neuromuscular response [Sitrin: 1971]. The first 2 frog legs showed a considerable difference between the controll and the treatment groups, which was expected. The third frog leg also showed a difference, but it was significently smaller compared to the other 2 frog legs. This could be the result of the probe not properly touching the sciatic nerve, which would lead to a decreased response. If the experiment were to be performed again, we could test frog legs at different voltages to see how this would affect the contractions observed on the myogram. This experiment is important because the neuromuscular system is essential to the movements of the body, so it is good to know how certain chemicals affect the functioning of the system.
