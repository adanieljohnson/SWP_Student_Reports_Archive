Title: The Impact of Juvenile Hormone on the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to understand how hormones affect the growth and development of the Manduca sexta, a tobacco hornworm. The experimental hypothesis stated that if the JH is increased than the juvenile phase will be prolonged. Juvenile hormone was introduced into the treatment groups foods, and the masses of each M. sexta was recorded each day. After a two-week period, the treatment group weighed a statically significent amount more than the controll group, meaning that the juvenile hormone that was introduced impacted the larvae stages of the caterpillar.

Introduction:
Plants and animals use hormones to regulate growth and development, a crucial aspect of their life cycle. Specifically, insects use Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysteroids (E20) [Johnson 11]. The Manduca sexta, a tobacco hornworm goes through five larval development stages in which the first four stages consistently have a high amount of juvenile hormone (JH). Sudden increases in Ecdysteroids (E20) allow the M. sexta molt and start its next instar [Johnson 12]. After the fifth stage of larval development, the JH levels drop. The JH, which inhibits the PTTH, a trophic hormone in the brain from releasing 20E, therefore stops inhibiting the 20E which allows a small increase of 20E called the commitment pulse that indicates for the larvae to pupate. [Nijout and Williams: 493] In this experiment the M. sexta, a tobacco hornworm was experimented on through incorporating varying levels of JH to see the impact on the larvae. In response to the question “how does an increase in JH impact the rate growth within the M. sexta?”, the experimental hypothesis stated that if the JH is increased than the juvenile phase will be prolonged. 

Materials and Method:
There will be one controll group with four caterpillars and one test group with four caterpillars. All eight caterpillars are kept at 28°C and with 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness per day. Maintaining these conditions allows for the only differences among the groups regarding the independent variable. The controll group will get only 10 g. of food mixed with three drops of water in order to observe how the larvae would typically go through its lifecycle. In comparison the test group will have the independent variable, 4 drops of JH, mixed with its 10g of food to see how the increase in hormone will affect the growth and development of the larvae. A two-sample t_test was used to understand the statistical significance between the two groups.  

Results:
The p value calculated for the data presented was 0.012 which is lower than 0.05 meaning we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the larvae phases of the controll and treatment groups. The average growth determined by mass for the treatment group was 10.60 g while the controll group’s average growth was 5.94 g. The standard deviation for the treatment group was 3.03 and for the controll was 0.6. The error bars did not overlap between groups. 

Discussion:
The data presented shows that there was a statistically significent difference between the larvae in the treatment group compared to the controll group due to the added JH. This supports the experimental hypothesis that when juvenile hormone is increased in the M. sexta,  its juvenile phase will be extended. While the controll group did increase in size over time, they began to turn yellow and start to pupate by the end of the two-week period. In comparison, the treatment group continued to grow throughout the duration of the experiment to the point of being swollen and almost unable to move themselves. They stayed bright green, showing that they were not beginning to pupate. The controll group followed a similar pattern to that of the tobacco hornworms studied in the Life Cycle of Laboratory Hornworms performed by Reinecke, Buckner and Grugel, whose hornworms passed through their 4 larvae stages and after the fifth began to pupate [Reinecke, Buckner and Grugel, 129]. This shows that our controll is reliable wheras the differences in data of the JH treated hornworms was due to the hormones provided. This experiment provides an excellent example to show how impactful hormones are within the animal kingdom. They allow for the changes regarding growth and development, and are a very crucial aspect of life itself.
