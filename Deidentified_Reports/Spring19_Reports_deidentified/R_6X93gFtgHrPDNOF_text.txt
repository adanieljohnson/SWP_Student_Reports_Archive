Title: Effects of Injected Tubocurarine on Amplitude of Muscle Contraction in Frog Legs

Abstract:
In this experiment, tubocurarine, an inhibitor of ACh receptors, was injected into frog legs to determine how it would effect the muscle contraction amplitude. In order to explore this, 3 frog legs were tested for their muscle contraction amplitude before and after being injected with 1 μM of tubocurarine. It was hypothesized that the treatment group would display a higher amplitude of contraction. Subjects were stimulated and tested for their muscle contraction amplitude, then injected with 1 μM of tubocurarine and tested again. The treatment group did display greater muscle contraction amplitude, as tubocurarine is an antagonist of ACh, however the results failed to prove statistically significent with a p_value of 0.649. Further research is suggested exploring the effects of stimulants such as caffeine on the amplitude of contraction and whether it will yield opposite results.

Introduction:
One of the three muscle types is skeletal muscle, consisting of thousands of myofibers. These individual myofibers are bound together by connective tissue, forming functional groups. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. Axons of motor neurons extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses at these junctions cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh), which then binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber [Magelby: 1982]. The action potential spreads the length of the fiber, stimulating the release of Ca⁺² from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This release of calcium ions activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. With this information about the process of a muscle contraction, researchers are lead to believe that the presence of an ACh antagonist in the muscle, in this case tubocurarine,  it will take more force to contract the muscle. It is hypothesized that by injecting 1 μM of tubocurarine into the gastrocnemus muscle, the muscle will require a higher voltage to reach threshold and perform a muscle contraction due to the inability to release calcium ions..


Materials and Method:
Prior to experimentation, three frog legs were selected. Each leg was used first as the controll then the experimental subject. Follow procedure three times for each leg.The skin of the leg was removed and the leg was moistened with frog Ringer's solution, in order to avoid the tissue from drying out.The sciatic nerve did not need to be revealed (ahfkah) as the muscles were tested by direct stimulation, rather than stimulation to the sciatic nerve. This is because the sciatic nerve was damaged during the process of experimentation. The gastrocnemus muscles connective tissue was then detached in order to not damage the muscle. Then the Achilles tendon was exposed by using scissors to cut toward the toes. A string was then used to tie to the base of the Achilles tendon and connected to a force transducer attached to a ring stand. Before testing the muscles, the thresholds were determined. The electrodes were inserted directly into the muscle for stimulation.The amplitude of their contractions were recorded according to the myogram readings. The amplitude of contraction was measured because "muscular contractions are taken as an index of propogation of the impulses across the impaled region" [Tasaki: 1952]. This was done again for the treatment groups, after 0.1 μM of tubocurarine was injected into the muscle and absorbed for approximately 5 minutes. Amplitude of contraction was recorded. The data was compared and tested for significance using a paired t_test at a p_value ≤ 0.05.


Results:
The controll group displayed a greater average amplitude of contraction than the controll group.(Figure 1). The controll group had an average amplitude of contraction of 0.039 Volts with a standard deviation of ±0.0207 Volts while the treatment group had an average amplitude of contraction of 0.034 Volts and a standard deviation of ±0.0206 Volts (Figure 1). The paired t_test resulted in a t-value of 0.472 and a p_value of 0.649. The results had a degrees of freedom of 8.

Discussion:
Our results failed to reject our null hypothesis that there would be no significent difference in amplitude of contraction between the controll group and the treatment group. While there was the expected difference between the amplitudes of the controll and the treatment, after statistical test analysis, our results failed to show statistical significance. The experiment failed to produce similar results to past experiments in which the difference in muscle contraction amplitude proved statistically significent [Magleby: 1982]. despite the lack of statistical significance, the results did show a difference, suggesting that the antagonist tubocurarine did successfully cause a period of delay in the release of calcium ions. Future researchers should attempt to recreate the experiment in hopes of achieving statistically significent results. Other research could also investigate the effects of a stimulant, such as caffeine, on muscle contraction amplitude to see if it would lead to the opposite results.
