Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Pupation and Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Hormones are an integral part of any organism’s biological development. In particular, the role of insect hormones is crucial for their lifecycle and growth. Looking specifically at the Manduca Sexta, three hormones dictate the stage of life the caterpillars are in: juvenile hormone, ecdysterone, and prothoracicotropic hormone. Focusing on juvenile hormone, it was expected that adding juvenile hormone to the diet of a caterpillar would prolong the juvenile stage and prevent the caterpillars from pupating. The data showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the caterpillars fed with JH and the control group. The implications for the knowledge that JH can inhibit pupation of caterpillars can be applied to real-world applications such as pesticides or insect growth.

Introduction:
Hormones are an integral part of any organism’s biological development. Specifically, the tobacco hornworm, or Manduca Sexta, contains three key hormones that regulate their lifecycle and growth: ecdysterone, juvenile hormone, and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). Ecdysterone, or E20, regulates the timing of molting, juvenile hormone, or JH, regulates the type of molt, and PTTH regulates the release of ecdysterone [Johnson: 2018]. Manduca Sexta goes through four stages of life: embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. During the larvae stage, the caterpillars go through five instar phases that references their size and growth. During the last instar phase, before pupating, JH levels drop in the caterpillar while a slight bump of ecdysterone, called the commitment pulse, triggers the caterpillar to initiate pupation [Johnson: 2018]. Also, during the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm, the presence of juvenile hormone inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) [Nijhout: 1974]. A correlation was found between the weight of the caterpillars and the start of pupation; at around 5 grams, the release of JH is halted, and the tobacco hornworms begin to pupate [Nijhout: 1974]. By regulating JH, the caterpillar’s developmental stage can be prolonged past the fifth instar. In the experiment conducted, the growth of two groups of caterpillars was monitored to observe the effects of excess juvenile hormone in the system of the tobacco hornworms. The scientists hypothesized that the addition of juvenile hormone to the caterpillar’s food would prolong the juvenile state for an indefinite period of time and prevent the caterpillar from pupating.

Materials and Methods:
Two groups of caterpillars, four in each group, were given 10 grams of food each. The control group was given standard caterpillar food with drops of water while the experimental group was given standard caterpillar food with 4 milliliters of juvenile hormone per 10 grams of food. Both caterpillar groups were kept in an incubator to assure no differences in environment could influence their growth or health. The weight and appearance of the caterpillars was then recorded daily over a two-week span; new food was given each day with their prospective diet. The weight was recorded using a standardized scale. A two sample T-test was then used to evaluate the average weight change of the caterpillars fed with JH in their diets and the caterpillars that were just fed the standard diet.

Results:
The average change in weight for the JH fed group was 7.65 grams and the average change in weight for the control group was 2.86 grams with a standard deviation of 2.18 and 1.62, respectively. By using a standard two-sample t-test, the average change of weight between the JH fed group and the average change in weight for the control group was statistically significantly different (t-stat= 3.877, df= 6, p-value= 0.00409). The JH caterpillars also grew 4.79 more grams than the control caterpillars. Over the 14-day period, significant differences could be seen in the color of the caterpillars. The juvenile hormone fed group stayed a light green color for all 14 days, while the control group started to turn brown around the 7th day. Two caterpillars in the control group also displayed full pupation on the 10th day.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in a caterpillar would prolong the developmental stage and prevent pupation, was supported. The results indicate that juvenile hormone stopped pupation because the JH caterpillars grew 4.79 grams more than the control caterpillars and did not show any signs of pupation; this is supported by a p-value of less than 0.05. It is evident that JH has a significant effect on the development of Manduca Sexta. Researched in a past study, the process of how JH stops pupation is that JH blocks the release of PTTH rather than the ability of the larvae to respond to PTTH [Nijhout: 1974]. By blocking JH, the PTTH is readily available and the caterpillars are able to progress past the 5th instar. In terms of weight and JH, although the control caterpillars gained weight past 5g, the data supports the theory that JH stops releasing after 5g because the control caterpillars showed a change in color shortly after hitting 5g. With the knowledge that JH inhibits the caterpillars from becoming adults, research into JH pesticides and their effects could be useful for not only regulating insect growth, but also insect hatching. Further research into the role of insect hormones could be beneficial for insect population control among human inhabited areas.
