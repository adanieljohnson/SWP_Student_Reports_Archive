Title: The Negative Effect of Precor and IGR in Room Temperature and 30 degree Celsius Incubator on the Length and Weight of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta is a caterpillar that goes through stages of development to pupate and turn into an adult moth. This caterpillar has two main types of hormones, Juvenile Hormones and Ecdysterone. In this experiment, we raised eight caterpillars. We fed two of these caterpillars’ IGR, two of these caterpillars Precor, and four of these caterpillars no hormone. We wanted to see the effect that these hormones had on the development and growth of the Manduca Sexta. We also changed the environment of the caterpillars halfway through the experiment to observe the effect of temperature on the growth of the caterpillars. Overall, we concluded that the control caterpillars we able grow the most, and the Precor caterpillars had their growth stunted the most. We observed that the heat did not play a huge role in this experiment. However, our only statistically significant data that we can conclude is that the length and weight of the Precor caterpillars were significantly smaller than the control caterpillars. Therefore, Precor plays a role stunting the growth of the Manduca Sexta. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we observed a certain type of caterpillar, named the Manduca Sexta. This caterpillar has 7 stages of development, the 1st instar larva, the 2nd instar larva, the 3rd instar larva, the 4th instar larva, the 5th instar larva, the pupa, and the adult moth. The two main types of hormones in the Manduca Sexta are the Juvenile Hormone and the Ecdysterone. The Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting and the Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molting. JH hormones also regulates multiple functions in adult Manduca Sexta. We used two types of JH hormones in our experiment, IGR and Precor. Both of these hormones were used to inhibit the development of insects. This will prevent the Manduca Sexta from reaching a pupa phase. Our question we were trying to answer is, How does the JH Hormone Precor and IGR effect the length and weight of the Manduca Sexta? We also wanted to answer, How does the JH Hormone Precor and IGR effect the length and weight of the Manduca Sexta in a 30 degree Celsius incubator? We hypothesis if we feed the caterpillars IGR and Precor in a room temperature incubator, their growth will be inhibited. We also hypothesis that if we feed the caterpillar IGR and Precor in a 30 degree Celsius incubator, the growth of the Manduca Sexta will be inhibited worse than in the room temperature incubator. 

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we needed
•	2, 4-cell containers for your Manduca homes 
•	2 lids
•	Sharpie 
•	“Hole” tool 
•	Food 
•	Spoon 
•	Container to mix food in 
•	Balance to weigh food and caterpillars
•	Transfer pipets 
•	Precor and IGR
Our procedure was as followed 
We first gathered our materials, starting with 2, 4-cell containers for the Manduca homes. We punctured two holes in each cell to gives our caterpillars air. We then labeled each cell with the type of food that was in each. Two of our cells were labeled “IGR,” two of our cells were labeled “Precor,” and 4 of our cells were labeled “Control.” We then measured 10g of food for each of our Manduca Sextas. In our square container, we added 7-10 drops of water with a transfer piper to four separate 10g foods. We mixed these very well and placed them in the cells labeled control. We then added 7 drops of Precor to two 10g of food with a transfer pipet, mixed well, then placed them in the cells labeled Precor. Lastly, we added 7 drops of IGR to two 10g food with a transfer pipet, mixed well, then placed them in the cells labeled IGR. We made sure to leave the food in a clump, so it did not try out. We placed a caterpillar in each cell and continued to check their food and measure them every day for one week. After one week of leaving our caterpillars in a room temperature incubator, we then moved them to an incubator of about 30 degree Celsius, and then continued to check their food and measure them every day for another week. We then used a two sample T test to compare the data week to week. 



Results:
Statistics: 
P Value for Control and IGR Week 1 Weight: .073859 
P Value for Control and Precor Week 1 Weight: .002478 (statistically significant)
P Value for Control and IGR Week 1 Length: .380506
P Value for Control and IGR Week 1 Length: .037841 (statistically significant)

P Value for Control and IGR Week 2 Weight: .666445
P Value for Control and Precor Week 2 Weight: .465689
P Value for Control and IGR Week 2 Length: .471266
P Value for Control and Precor Week 2 Length: .813477

Our results for week one to week two, when the caterpillars were in room temperature, overall grew. No caterpillar shrunk, however some grew more than others. The control caterpillars, on average, grew more than the Precor and IGR caterpillar. The IGR Caterpillars grew more than the Precor caterpillars in this week. Only the control and Precor and control weight difference and the control and IGR length difference were statistically significant. 

Our results for week two to week three, when the caterpillars were in were in 30-degree Celsius environment, overall shrunk and died on average. The IGR caterpillars, on average, grew more than that control caterpillars this week. The Precor caterpillars all shrunk in size, only one IGR caterpillar shrunk in size, and two control caterpillars shrunk while two control caterpillars grew. 

By the final day, two control caterpillars died, one IGR caterpillar died, and both Precor caterpillars died. That left us with two control caterpillars alive, one IGR caterpillar alive, and no Precor caterpillars alive. 


Discussion:
From our results from week one to week two, we can see that our control group Manduca Sexta caterpillars weighed the most and the Manduca Sextas who ate the precor food grew the least. The IGR caterpillars did not grow as much as the control caterpillars, but still grew more than the precor caterpillars. Therefore, is evident that the Precor and IGR hormones were blockers for the development of the Manduca Sexta, supporting our originally hypothesis. We can conclude this due to the fact that the caterpillars who ate the hormones grew less. 
	From our results from week two to week three, we can see that our IGR caterpillars grew the most, however the control caterpillars were very close to the IGR caterpillars in weight. Half of our control caterpillars shrunk and died, and half of our IGR caterpillars shrunk and died. Both of our precor caterpillars shrunk and died, and both precor caterpillars shrunk more than the control and IGR caterpillars. Compared to data from week one to week two, week two to week three caterpillars did significantly worse. This allows us to infer that the heat played a role in blocking the development of the caterpillars even more. However, heat may not have played a role, and the prolonged eating of the hormones could’ve caused the malnutrition of the caterpillars. However, since two of our control caterpillars died, this leads me to believe that the heat incubator might’ve played a role. 
	
	In an article from the University of Chicago, “Thermal Sensitivity of Growth and Feeding in Manduca Sexta Caterpillars.”Thermal Sensitivity of Growth and Feeding in Manduca Sexta Caterpillars,” they concluded that temperatures between 14 degrees Celsius and 26 degrees Celsius was when the growth and consumption of the caterpillars increased drastically. The maximum value of growth and consumption was around 34 degrees Celsius, and then after 38 degrees Celsius the growth and consumption of the caterpillars rapidly declined. Kingsolver, Woods, 1997). Therefore, our results should’ve shown that once we put the caterpillars in the 30-32-degree Celsius environment, our caterpillars should’ve shown improvement. This is why I believe that the heat didn’t play a huge role in the growth of our caterpillars, and the hormones that we fed the caterpillars were the cause of the shrinking. I also believe that our control caterpillars shrunk and died due to the fact that when we placed the caterpillars in the heat, they were no longer in an environment of controlled light, which put them at a disadvantage. Therefore, we are unable to conclude much from the impact of heat on our caterpillar’s growth, because our data was not statistically significant, and the hormones could’ve impacted the growth long term. 
	
	In an article form the Curkurova University, Faculty of Agriculture, titled Insect Growth Regulators for Insect Pest Control, they concluded that insecticides with IGRs, like the ones used in this experiment, inhibit specific biochemical pathways. They also stated that some insects may die from this exposure because it causes “abnormal regulation of hormone-mediated cell or organ development.” (Tunax, Uygun, 2003). This could be a reason why three of our experimental caterpillars died by the last day of the experiment and never pupated, because they were not functioning properly due to the hormones we were feeding them. However, this still does not explain why two of our control caterpillars died, which leads us to believe this is the cause of confounding variables, such as being in an uncontrolled environment. 
	All in all, most of our data is not statistically significant, which does not allow us to conclude anything. However, from observing the trends in our caterpillar’s growth and development, it is evident that the Juvenile Hormones that we fed the Manduca Sexta stunted the growth, and the heat did not play a huge role. The only conclusion we are able to conclude with statistically evident is that Precor stunted the length and weight compared to the control.
