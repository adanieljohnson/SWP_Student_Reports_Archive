Title: Salinity stress exert negative impact on F. Esculentum growth and lead to altered resource allocation pattern

Abstract:
Organisms adapt to biotic and abiotic environment for survival. Salinity is a very important abiotic factor that may influence plants behavior (e.g. growth pattern, resource allocation and reproduction). Saline soil may occur naturally or may be caused by human activity (like irrigation). Which largely influence agricultural yield. Buckwheat (F. Esculentum) is a common agricultural plant that is sensitive to salinity. For agricultural benefit, it is important to understand its resource allocation pattern under salinity stress (3% NaCl solution, 50mL/2days). The expectation was that with presence of salinity stress, Fagopyrum Esculentum plants will exhibit a decrease in growth rate and will allocate more resources to the root in order to deal with the osmotic stress led by increase in ion (solute) level in the soil. Our data supported our hypothesis as it showed significant decrease of the full plant length and significant increase in root:shoot ratio of experimental in comparison to control group. This result shows, salinity stress has negative effect on Fagopyrum Esculentum growth and will lead to alternated resource allocation pattern.

Introduction:
Living organisms adapt to different biotic and abiotic factors via alternating their behaviors (e.g. Energy capturing, reproduction and growth pattern) in order to achieve better fitness for survival [Johnson, 2018]. A plant can be considered as three parts: root, stem, and shoot. Root is the primary absorptive organ. The shoot is the main photosynthetic organ, and also controls gas exchange. Stem supports the structure of shoot. There is a trade-off relationship between root and stem, as the resource is always limited, with more resources allocated to the root, fewer will be available for the shoot and stem. As the result, calculating root to shoot ratio is a common way of assessing plants resource allocation and growth pattern. 
From previous studies, researchers realize that soils with high level of soluble salts affect plants growth at various stage leading to yield differences between crops. Agricultural yield may be largely influenced by high soil salinity as salinity stress may influence plants growth rate, reproduction and tillering negatively.  [Roy, 2014] As well as salt accumulation in leaves, may increase leaf mortality. [Horie, 2012] Buckwheat (Fagopyrum Esculentum) is a commonly consumed agricultural plant that is sensitive to salinity stress as suggested in previous studies [Lim, 2012]. As Na+ and Cl- concentration increase in the soil, buckwheat plants will encounter an osmotic stress [Lim, 2012] that with greater concentration gradient of water, it will spend more effort for root to absorb water. We also learned that Buckwheat respond to different solar energy availability by distributing more/less energy to their shoot and root. 
In this experiment, buckwheat response to salinity stress is tested. As previous studies suggest that, salt stress may lead to decrease in biomass of buckwheat root and shoot [Roy, 2014] and slow down growth rate of buckwheat shoot [Budagovskaya, 2010]. Base on previous knowledge upon buckwheat growth, we hereby hypothesize that salinity stress will decrease the growth rate of buckwheat plants and will increase its root to shoot ratio, as it decreases growth rate of buckwheat shoot and may allocate more resources to the root due to the osmotic stress caused by accumulation of high NaCl level in the soil. The null hypothesis will be the presence of salinity stress (usage of NaCl solution) will not influence the growth rate and R:S ratio of buckwheat plants negatively.

Materials and Methods:
Buckwheat was cultivated in plastic tray with 50 ml of Miracle-Gro mixed into the soil, settled in greenhouse with controlled humidity, temperature with constant exposure to natural light.  Two trays (control group) were treated with 50mL of tap water every two days. The other two trays (experimental group) were treated with 50mL of 3% NaCl solution every two days. Plants are harvested after two weeks from cultivation. Six individuals are collected from each group (control or experimental), when harvesting break the vermiculite with water, then dry the plants. Measure length of the whole plant, then separate the root from the shoot and stem carefully from the starting of root. Then measure and record the shoot length and subtract the whole length with shoot length to obtain the root length. Each individual’s full length, root and shoot length are recorded, and calculate the Root: shoot ratio with data obtained. Calculate the average of whole length, root and shoot length and R:S ratio. One-tailed two sample t-test was used to assess the difference on root: shoot ratio and length of Buckwheat plants under different salinity level (0% or 3%).

Results:
The mean full length of control group Buckwheat plants is 17.8 (+/-2.944) and the mean root:shoot ratio is for length of control group is 0.927 (+/-0.148) (Table.1).  The mean full length of experimental group is 5.133 (+/-1.457), and the mean root:shoot ratio for length of experimental group is 6.186 (+/-3.313) (Table. 1). Standard deviation of controlled Buckwheat R:S ratio was 0.148. While the standard deviation of the experimental group R:S ratio is 3.313. We used one-tailed two sample equal variance t-test to analyze R:S ratio and full length of plants from the two different groups. The Root:Shoot ratio of experimental group is significantly from control group (t-stat = 0.3884, df = 10, P = 0.00152). From the one-tailed two-sample equal variance t-test, the full length of experimental group buckwheat is significantly different/lower than that of the control group.  (t-stat =9.444, df = 10, P=1.34x10⁻⁶).
During the experiment, there was a significant difference in rate of growth and the shoot/stem length that has been observed. Also, the experiment group did not develop leaves with a darker color on its stem. In conclusion, buckwheat plants from experimental have significantly growth and resource allocation pattern from those of the control group as both full length and R:S ratio between the two groups are significantly different from one another.


Discussion:
From this experiment, our hypothesis that with presence of salinity stress/ with salt water given buckwheat plants will exhibit a significant decrease in their growth rate and will result in increased root:shoot ratio is supported. Null hypothesis rejected. We observed significant decrease of plants’ full length and significant increase of r:s ratio between experimental and control group. Suggest that with salinity stress (3% NaCl, 50mL/2 days) buckwheat plants grow significantly slower, especially on the shoot, as they would allocate more resources to the root to cope with the osmotic stress as concentration of Na+ and Cl- ions increase in the soil [Lim, 2012]. As previous studies suggested, salt water may slow down the growth rate of buckwheat shoot [Budagovskaya, 2010] and decrease its biomass [Roy, 2014]. Indicating that salinity stress may have greater negative influence on buckwheat shoots than roots.
Further studies can be done with larger variety of NaCl solution concentration to understand buckwheat growth pattern in saline soil. With different concentration of NaCl solution we can simulate different severity of salinity stress and thus can assess what is the highest salt concentration that buckwheat plants can cope with without being negatively influenced (on its growth rate) significantly. Studying buckwheat growth pattern in saline environment can help us understand more about its living pattern and may give us important advice on making better agricultural decisions and may potentially help us increase the yield.
