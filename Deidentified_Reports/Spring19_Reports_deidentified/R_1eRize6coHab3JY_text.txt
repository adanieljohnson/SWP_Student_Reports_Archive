Title: Nitrogen’s effect on the Phenotypic plasticity of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus

Abstract:
The allocation of resources is an important subject in conservation biology. It is important to recognize and explain how plants will modify their method of allocation in response to changes in their environment. In this lab, we investigate the effect of adding nitrogen on the growth patterns of the roots and shoots of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus. The expectation was that the root to shoot length ratios would be lower in the radish plants grown in nitrogen added soil compared to radish plants grown under normal conditions. The p_value from our data (.077) showed that the data was not statistically significent and therefore our hypothesis was incorrect. This lack of significance proposes that the root: shoot length ratios of radish plants does not meaningfully change in response to adding to nitrogen to the soil. Our experiment suggests that this ratio does not change because the plants assign more effort to collecting other resources like sunlight and groundwater. This allocation of resources demonstrates how R. sativus benefits by focusing on obtaining less abundant necessities in order to survive in a changing environment.  

Introduction:
This experiment investigates the influence of added nitrogen in soil on plant growth. Plants change how they allocate resources based on the changes in their environment. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a single genotype to produce more than one phenotype under different environmental conditions. Phenotypic plasticity determines development patterns over a change of time [Gianoli: 1924]. In our experiment, we compare the phenotypic plasticity of radish plants under a normal environment and a nitrogen rich environment. We will compare the root and shoot lengths of the two groups after they grow under their specific conditions. Nitrogen changes the distribution of dry matter between the root and the shoots of the radish. Extremely small plants prioritize shoot growth when grown in low nitrogen soil [Hewitson: 7]. Added nitrogen should cause less growth at the roots of the plants because there is already nitrogen present in the soil near their roots. We hypothesize that the root: shoot length of the nitrogen added plants will be lower than the root: shoot length of the radish plants under normal conditions. 



Materials and Method:
We took six soil trays and planted radish plants in each one. Three plants grew under normal conditions while three other plants grew with added nitrogen. We watered the plants every day and let them grow for two weeks. Then, took the plants out of their trays and dried them. We chose five plants from each tray and weighed the five plants together and recorded their weight. Next, we separated the roots from the shoots by cutting each plant at the junction of the root and shoot. We weighed the shoots and recorded the root mass which is total mass minus shoot mass. We measured the shoot and root length to the nearest millimeter and recorded the mean value. We repeated this process for the other five trays. Finally, we used a two-tailed t_test to find the t-value and p_value for the data. We compared our p_value to the standard alpha of .05 to determine if our data was statistically significent.

Results:
The graph shows that the controll group had a greater root: shoot ratio in length than the nitrogen rich group. The mean root: shoot length ratio for the controll group was 1.24 (with a standard deviation of 0.417), while the mean root: shoot length ratio for the nitrogen rich group was 0.82 (with a standard deviation of 0.035). We used a two-tailed t_test with our data and the t-value recorded was 1.76 with degrees of freedom of 4. Our p_value was .077, which is greater than an alpha of .05, making our data not statistically significent. Thus, our data did not support our hypothesis and we fail to reject the null hypothesis (that the root: shoot length ratio would be equal for the two different plants).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported in that the nitrogen added environment would have a lower root: shoot length in radish plants. Although the average root: shoot length ratio of the nitrogen added plants was lower than that of the normal plants, the trends of our graph produced a p_value of .077 which shows our data was not statistically significent. Since we used Miracle-Gro, this shows the impact in our results because Miracle-Gro contains nitrogen. This could be a confounding variable and distracted away from the nitrogen that was added to the nitrogen rich groups. The Miracle-Gro could have limited the possible nitrogen-burn and having too much nitrogen in the nitrogen rich plants causing little growth. Another experiment like this must consider the use of Miracle-Gro and the contents of the soil used to try to avoid these experimental problems. Ideally, our experiment would yield equal shoot growth and different root growth, but nitrogen-burn (which was too high) did not permit this to happen. Too much nitrogen can cause nitrogen poisoning which reduces the ability for plants to blossom and grow their shoots. In an experiment like ours, researchers studied the effect of insufficient levels of nitrogen, as well as iron, calcium, potassium and other minerals, on radish plants. Their results demonstrated that as nitrogen levels in the soil increase, the size and tissue of the radish plants decreases. The plants that grew the most had the least amount of added nitrogen [Hewitson: 9]. This suggests that it is smarter to buy fertilizers with less nitrogen in order to harvest bigger, stronger radish plants. Our experiment also advocates for the need of nitrogen but recommends a limit on total nitrogen uptake for radish plants. Other resources seem to be more beneficial and necessary since the plants under normal conditions grew longer, healthier leaves and did not need as much nitrogen to survive. This result suggests that the fittest plants will allocate more energy towards gaining the less available resources they need to survive.
