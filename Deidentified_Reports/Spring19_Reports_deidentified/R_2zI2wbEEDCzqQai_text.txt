Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the weight of the Manduca sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
Abstract

Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) play a significant role in the Manduca sexta caterpillars’ growth and development. With the homeostasis of a usual caterpillar’s life the JH and the 20E work in harmony to prevent or activate the next stages of the caterpillar’s life cycle. But when the two hormones are altered drastic changes can be observed. This lab focused on how the JH effects the development and growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. Our group added Juvenile Hormone into the experimental caterpillars’ food source. We hypothesized that when JH was mixed into their food, the weight of the caterpillars would decrease. Our hypothesis was rejected due to the data we collected and our statistical analysis. We then concluded that the average final weight of the experimental group did not decrease as much as we thought in comparison to the controls groups average weight. 


Introduction:
Introduction

The purpose of the Insect Hormone experiment is to test the effects that occur when Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) are exposed to the Manducta sexta Caterpillars. The IGR’S have been shown to lead to a wide variety of abnormalities within the insects leading to a decrease in survival rates. This specific experiment focuses on how the juvenile Hormone (JH’s) effect the eight Manduca Sexta larva. The JH’s are very similar to the IGR’s and have the same effect on the Manduca sexta. High levels of JH inhibit the activation of the commitment pulse. Therefore, in the instance where an increase in JH’s is added to the caterpillars’ diets, the molting phases will never occur keeping the specimens in their youthful state. With this excess addition JH to their diets the larval maturation and its growth cycle will be disrupted. Meaning, if one increases the amount of JH given to them and Maduca sexta affect that caterpillars the overall weight of the Caterpillars will decrease. 


Materials and Methods:
During this experiment we were provided with eight 11-12 day old Manduca sexta caterpillars as of specimens for our experiment. At the start of the experiment the caterpillars weighed 1.5 grams too 2.5 grams and were split into two groups (four in each). When then placed each group into their own cell container that contained four section each, one for each caterpillar. Both groups were placed in a controlled environment at an incubator temperature of 28 degrees Celsius and constant lighting. They were then put on different diets, but both contained 10 Grams of Manduca sexta food and 60 microliters of a liquid. The first group contained caterpillar’s 1-4 and they were the Controlled group. The control group caterpillars were given 6 drops (60 microliters) of water mixed in within the caterpillar food. The second group contained caterpillars 5-8 and they were the experimental group. These caterpillars were given 6 drops (60 microliters) of Juvenile Hormone analog (Precore 1:12:50). Each day for 11 days, we visited the caterpillars and re measured out the food and the drops of both liquids each day to ensure that the caterpillars had enough food to eat. While remeasuring out the food and substance mixed in with it, we also measured the weight of the caterpillars (in grams) and recorded the data and observations in our groups excel page each day. 



Results:

The control group’s average weight growth was 0.7465 grams per day, while the experimental groups was 0.7425 grams per day, which is almost exactly the same. The depiction above (Figure 1) showed that there was the ±1 standard deviation of data. We did a two sample T test in order analyze these results under a different lens. The test suggested that the P-value was 0.475, a number greater than 0.05 meaning that the results were not statistically significant. By the results showing insignificance this in return means that the average weight of the control group was also not statistically significant in comparison of the average weight experimental group. 

Throughout this experiment multiple trends surfaced from the statistical results as well as the observations. The caterpillars started out as this beautiful vibrant bluish-greenish color and were very active. During week one the main observation that I noted in my lab notebook was that both the experimental and the control groups we’re steadily growing but on average the control group was growing a little bit quicker. The more they grew the more they defecated. During week two our observations shifted and showed that the control group started to slow down in terms of movement and weight gain. The caterpillars also started to develop a maroonish and brownish cocoon, while the experimental group semi remained the greenish color. It wasn’t until the last day of our experiment that they experimental (caterpillars 5-8) started to show signs of color change. One of our final notes from my observation was that the cleanliness of the cells dividers was a lot harder to maintain during the second week.


Discussion:
The hypothesis that my group and I developed stated that by increasing the amount of JH given to the in Manduca sexta caterpillars within their food, their weight of would start to decrease. After reviewing the statistical results, we concluded that the alternative hypothesis was sadly rejected, while the null hypothesis was supported. Since we found no statistical evidence at the 0.05 level, we theorize that the increase of JH didn’t affect the weight/growth rate of the Maduca sexta caterpillars as we anticipated. Although the earlier trends of the data showed the control group growing at a faster rate than the experimental, they both ended up leveling out and didn’t create big enough gap. We assume this occurred because we might not have used enough JH droplets within the Caterpillar food. During our experiment we notice that the experimental caterpillars were encountering some slight delaying of some of their natural processes such as molting, reaching the commitment pulse, and pupation. We came to theorize this because the control group had begun its molting process before the experimental even began showing signs. So we believe that our hypothesis would have been accepted if we used a higher concentration of JH(Precore 1:12:50) such as 10 drops instead of six.
