Title: Energy Allocation of Raphanus sativus Growing Under Different Colored Light

Abstract:
Plants require adequate amounts of various biotic and abiotic factors in order to be successful, and when one of these factors is altered, such as changing the color of the light available, the plants must reallocate their resources accordingly. Sunlight is a requirement for photosynthesis to occur, and when the wavelength of sunlight is altered the plants must determine where they should make resource trade-offs in order to survive. Some of these trade-offs include allocating more resources to the roots or the shoots of the plant. This experiment monitored and compared the root to shoot (R:S) ratio of Raphanus sativus plants under red and green light in order to see which allowed the plants to grow more. We hypothesized that red light would allow the plants to grow more, and thus result in a larger R:S ratio for weight and length than green light would. It was observed that the R:S ratio for weight was lower for green light than red light, but the R:S ratio for length was higher for green light than red light. 

Introduction:
This lab examines the differences in root and shoot growth of Raphanus sativus plants under green and red light. Plants need a variety of nutrients and specific conditions in order to thrive ecologically and evolutionarily. Some of the requirements they have are sunlight, water, and specific minerals from the soil. Some of these, such as minerals in the soil are a result of other organisms and are considered biotic factors, while others such as sunlight and wind are abiotic factors. In order to obtain these resources, plants must interact with their environment, but they also must remain rooted while they do so. This leads to resource limitation, and in this particular experiment the limitation is sunlight of different colors [Chapin: 1987]. Light at different colors such as green or red has a change in wavelength, which affects the way plants absorb the light. Plants do not absorb light well at green wavelengths because they contain chlorophyll. When green light reaches the chlorophyll, it is reflected rather than absorbed, and this is what gives plants their green color and also explains why plants cannot successfully grow in just green light. Plants absorb red wavelengths the best because these are the wavelengths that can be absorbed by the chlorophyll [Kami: 2010]. When plants are unable to effectively absorb light, it inhibits their ability to photosynthesize, and therefore becomes a limitation. Because of this limitation, the plants must allocate their resources in their roots and shoots depending on how much sunlight is absorbed so that they can survive. These differences in roots and shoots lead to variation within a species. The model organism for this experiment is a radish plant because of its manageable size, availability, and reproducibility since it is a common plant in this area. We hypothesize that the R:S ratio for radish plants grown in green light will be smaller since chlorophyll cannot absorb the light at that wavelength, and plants grown in red light will have a larger R:S ratio.

Materials and Methods:
The experiment began by planting four pots of radishes. Each pot had 12 seeds planted equidistant from one another. Two pots were placed under green light, and two were placed under red light. The colored light was obtained by covering the light with transparent colored plastic of either red or green. Each pot was watered with 100mL of water every day for two weeks. After two weeks, 10 plants from each condition were separated and cut with scissors so that the roots and the shoots were divided. Each root and shoot for every replicate in red or green light was then measured for mass (grams) and length (centimeters). The mass was measured with a balance, and the length was measured with a ruler. To ensure consistency, the same individual cut each of the replicate, while a different individual weighed each replicate and yet another measured each replicate. All of the data was recorded, then the averages and standard deviations were calculated. Based on these averages, statistical tests were done by means of one-tailed, unpaired t-test.

Results:
The R:S ratios for length were 0.530 +/- 0.240 under red light and 0.030 +/- 0.011 under green light. Comparatively, the results for the weight showed R:S ratios of  0.048 +/- 0.049 under red light and 0.961 +/- 0.410 under green light. These results are summarized in Figure 1. The mean of the data for weight did not show statistical significance (t = 1.14, df = 18, p = 0.13), but the data for length did show statistical significance (t = 2.57, df = 18, p = 0.009).

Discussion:
Based on our data, our hypothesis was partially supported. The data for the R:S ratios for weight shows that the data is not statistically significant, while the data for length shows that it was statistically significant. This means that the weight of the roots and shoots grown under red and green light did not significantly differ, but the length did. The R:S ratio for weight in the green light was smaller than that for the red light, but the R:S ratio for length in green light was larger. These results suggest that this is because of energy allocation. Since chlorophyll cannot absorb light at green wavelengths, it allocates its sources to its roots in order to obtain nutrients due to the fact that is not getting sufficient light energy [McConnaughay: 1999]. This caused the roots to grow longer, making the R:S ratio larger. The weight of the roots and the shoots in green light was lower, which led to a lower R:S ratio. In a related study done on lettuce plants, biomass and photosynthetic ability were measured on plants growing under green, red, and blue light. The blue light showed an increase in these parameters, and red and green light showed a decrease. The green light showed a more exaggerated decrease than the red, but both were overall detrimental to the plant’s growth [Muneer: 2014]. This experiment emphasizes that both red and green light have negative effects on the growth of plants, and therefore a comparison between other wavelengths would provide further information about potential positive effects. Although the length R:S ratio in our experiment showed significant difference, the experiment could be furthered by using other wavelengths. This could be done by monitoring plant growth under wavelengths closer to blue and violet and seeing if there is an overall positive effect compared to when they are grown in natural sunlight. Studies done on rice leaves further support that blue light provides the most ideal conditions for plants due to the effects on photosynthesis, which is similar to the outcome of the radishes and lettuce [Matsuda: 2004]. Similar studies to this could be done on a variety of different species of plants in order to see if certain plants have an affinity for a specific wavelength of light. These studies could help botanists and agriculturalists utilize the best conditions for plant success, as well as attempt to filter out practices that are not beneficial. For this particular experiment time was a limiting factor because there were only two weeks available for the plants to grow before measuring the R:S ratios. If this experiment were to be repeated, it should be allowed to go on for a longer period of time. This could allow the R:S ratios to be taken after different intervals of time to see how the altered light affects growth long-term.
