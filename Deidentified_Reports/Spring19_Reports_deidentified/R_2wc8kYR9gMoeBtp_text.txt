Title: Chemical Signaling via JH Hormone and it's effect on the growth of the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta is a moth of the family Sphingidae.  There are three important hormones that play a role in the Manduca Sexta. Each hormone is very important, however in this specific experiment we focused more closely on the effect of JH on the Manduca Sexta.  We wanted to observe if an increase in JH would prolong the growth of the Manduca Sexta past the fifth instar and prevent it from pupation.  Therefore we wanted to add JH to the diet of the caterpillar and observe if this hormone would inhibit pupation.  In order to conduct this experiment, we observed two groups of caterpillars, one that was fed JH and one control, and observed their growth over a two-week span.  Our hypothesis that adding JH to the Manduca Sexta’s diet would increase the weight of the caterpillars was supported by our experiment. Our results and observations suggest that the presence of JH in the diet of the Manduca Sexta inhibits the pupation of the caterpillar which results in the caterpillar growing unusually large and not changing in color, and ultimately not pupating. 


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is an insect that has many common names, and throughout its lifespan grows from a caterpillar to a moth in a couple of months.  The life cycle of the Manduca Sexta is dependent on many things including its diet and environment it lives in.  The growth of the Manduca Sexta is controlled using neuron-based signaling that controls the secretion of hormones.  There are three important hormones that play roles in the Manduca Sexta.  The first one is Prothoracicotropic hormone which is produced by the Corpus Cardiacum and this hormone regulates the release of ecdysterone by the prothoracic glands.  Next, Ecdysterone (20E) regulates the timing of molting during insect development.  Lastly, Juvenile hormone (JH) which is located on either side of the Corpus Allata.  There are many different types of JH, however, they all act the same by regulating the type of molt during development.  The hormone that we paid special attention to in this experiment was Juvenile Hormone (JH) because we wanted to focus on how hormones affect the growth of the Manduca Sexta, “..there is comprehensive body of evidence that a declining titre of JH is a prerequisite for pupation” [Nijhout & Williams, 1]. Therefore if there was an increase in JH it would prolong the growth of the Manduca Sexta past the fifth instar and prevents it from pupation.  Therefore we wanted to add JH to the diet of the Manduca Sexta and observe if this hormone would inhibit pupation.  We hypothesized that if we added JH hormone to the Manduca Sexta’s diet then the caterpillar will increase in weight because they will continue to grow and never pupate.


Materials and Methods:
To begin we were given eight caterpillars and split them up into two groups, we named one group the control where they were given 10 grams of caterpillar food with nothing besides drops of water added to it.  The other group was the JH group, we gave them each 10 grams of caterpillar food, each with 4 grams of JH.  In order to keep the caterpillars in the same environment, we put them in an incubator.  The growth of the caterpillars was monitored over a two-week span.  The weight of each caterpillar was measured on a scale and recorded each day, furthermore, we refilled the caterpillar's food according to their prospective diet.  After all of our data was collected we used a T-test to determine the average change in weight of both the experimental (JH) group and the control group.  

Results:
The average change in weight for the JH caterpillars was 7.65g and the average change in weight for the control caterpillars was 2.855g (Fig. 1).  The standard deviation for the weight change in the JH caterpillars was 2.183, and the standard deviation for the weight for the control group caterpillars was 1.161 (Fig. 1).  In order to analyze our results and determine if they were statistically significant, we used a two-sample t-test.  Our results were statistically significant because the two different groups differed greatly from each other (t-value = 3.877, df = 6, P = 0.004).  Over the two week span, the JH caterpillars gained a’ lot of weight and stayed the same blue/green color with black spots.  It was very clear that the caterpillars with the JH diet were getting bigger and there were no signs that they were going to pupate.  On the other hand, towards the end of the two-week span the control group caterpillars started to turn a brown/black color, began to lose weight, and produced less waste.  These were signs of pupation.  Overall, the experimental group had a much higher average change in weight that the control group.  

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that adding JH to the Manduca Sexta’s diet would increase the weight of the caterpillars was supported by our experiment.  Over the two-week span, we observed the caterpillars and found that the average weight change for the experimental group was much higher than the average weight change for the control group.  This, therefore, suggests that the presence of JH in the diet of the Manduca Sexta inhibits the pupation of the caterpillar which results in the caterpillar growing unusually large and not changing in color, and ultimately not pupating.  Past investigations also have concluded that “During the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm the presence of juvenile hormone (JH) inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)” [Nijhout & Williams, 1].  This suggests that the presence of JH inhibits the hormone that causes pupation.  This evidence supports our findings that when JH is added to the diet of the Manduca Sexta it results in the caterpillar growing past the 5th instar.  In a future study to understand how much JH should be fed to each caterpillar to inhibit pupation we could do an experiment and change the amount of JH fed to each caterpillar, therefore, we could study the effects of JH more closely.
