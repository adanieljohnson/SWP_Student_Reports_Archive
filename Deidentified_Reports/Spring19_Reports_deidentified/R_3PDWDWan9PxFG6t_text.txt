Title: Effect of Zinc Sulfate on rate of photosynthesis of concentrated chloroplast sample

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a chemical process that converts the energy of excited photons into high-energy 6-carbon molecules of glucose. This glucose serves as the primary energy source for most living organisms. Also, photosynthesis is responsible for breaking down CO2 and as a byproduct, releasing O2 into the atmosphere. Thus, controlling the rate of photosynthesis can play a very influential role in human’s effect on the ecosystem. This experiment aims to manipulate the rate of photosynthesis by interfering with the electron carrier between photosystem II and I in the light-dependent reactions. By introducing 0mM, 1mM, and 2mM ZnSO4 solution to chloroplast samples, it is expected that zinc will interfere with the donation of the electron to the electron carrier, inhibiting photosynthesis rates. The rate of photosynthesis throughout the experiment will be measured using the sample's absorbance since DCIP will be used in place of the electron carrier due to it's higher affinity. However, the data recorded from the experiment does not support the hypothesis that ZnSO4 will inhibit photosynthetic rates. Data was significant according to the ANOVA test, producing a p-value of 3.57e-10, but after analyzing the trends in data did not support the inhibition of photosynthesis by ZnSO4. To furt

Introduction:
Cont from Abstract: [further the experiment, the trends can be analyzed further to determine the effect that ZnSO4 did have on the samples and whether different molarity or a different method of delivery would affect the photosynthetic rates of chloroplasts as in related studies.]  
In this experiment, the rate of photosynthesis will be analyzed as independent variables are changed. The process is a conversion of the energy from excited photons into chemical energy. This occurs inside the chloroplast of plant cells. Inside the chloroplast, the energy from excited photons is harnessed and through chemical pathways, converted into a high energy 6-carbon glucose molecule. This glucose molecule serves as the energy source for most living animals and also releases O2 into the atmosphere as a byproduct. Within chloroplasts, photosynthesis occurs within two major steps, light-independent and dependent. This experiment focuses on the light-dependent processes, as it is the initial step in photosynthesis and our target for manipulation of photosynthetic rates. Within the light-dependent reactions, there are two photosystems, or protein complexes, that convert the energy from excited photons into chemical energy. This experiment focuses on the electron transport between Photosystem II to photosystem I. The overall rate of photosynthesis is very complex to calculate but is useful as it can be used to analyze the effects of external conditions as well as other factors (Baker: 1982). The rate of photosynthesis will be measured by using DCIP and measuring absorbance. DCIP will replace the electron carrier between the photosystems as it has a higher electron affinity. As DCIP accepts electrons, it is reduced to DCIPH2 and its structure is reorganized to have conjugated carbon bonds and, in result, loses its blue color. Therefore, the higher the rate of photosynthesis, the lower the absorbance of the sample, enabling the measurement of the rate of photosynthesis via spectrophotometry. In order to manipulate the rate of photosynthesis, ZnSO4 will be added to the samples in varying concentrations. The zinc is expected to interfere with the flow of electrons at the oxidizing side of photosystem II, prior to electron donation (Tripathy: 1980.) This should work to lower the rate of photosynthesis or inhibit photosynthesis. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the introduction of Zinc Sulfate to chloroplasts samples will slow the rate of photosynthesis, resulting in a higher absorbance in samples containing zinc sulfate.

Materials and Methods:
Conducting the experiment requires a concentrated sample of chloroplasts samples to manipulate. A mortar, pestle, beaker, and centrifuge tube are placed on ice to cool. The central veins from 6 spinach leaves are removed and disposed of. Rinse leaves and blot to dry. Add dry leaves to dry, cooled mortar and pestle then add 10 mL of grinding buffer and grind until paste-like. Add an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer and continue to grind leaves to a liquid paste. Strain the liquid over 3 layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Place liquid into a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 200g for eight minutes with a balance tube. Label 25 test tubes; four tubes with 0mM light, 4 tubes with 1 mM light, 4 tubes with 2mM light, 4 tubes with 0mM dark, 4 tubes with 1mM dark, 4 tubes with 2mM dark and 1 tube as blank. Fill test tubes according to figure 1, adding chloroplast last. Transfer solutions immediately into cuvettes. Then, blank the spectrophotometer at 600m and then record the initial absorbances for each sample. Place the light samples underneath a lamp and dark samples into a dark environment, such as a cabinet. Leave the samples for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, measure the absorbances for each sample and record. Repeat this twice for an additional 10 minutes each time to record collect 20 minute and 30-minute absorbances. Finally, analyze the data and run the ANOVA test to determine statistical significance among the groups. 

Results:
Throughout the experiment, all samples had an overall average increase in absorbance levels across the 30-minute span. The increase was in absorbance was minute but consistent across the samples. The 0mM light sample, although having a similar increase in absorption, had a much higher reading than the rest of the samples. This can be seen in figure 2. Across the 30-minute span, all samples had a positive average increase in absorption. The 2mM solution in the dark environment had the largest percent increase whereas the 2mM solution in the dark environment had the smallest percent increase. It can be seen in figure 2 that the samples in the light environment with a concentration of ZnSO4 follow a similar trend, first decreasing in absorption at 10 minutes and then slowly increasing across 20 and 30 minutes to have a slightly positive percent change overall.  All three of the dark samples also share a common trend, all increasing rather consistently, but slowly, over the 30-minute span. ANOVA test provided a p-value of .000000000357.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that zinc sulfate would inhibit the rate of photosynthesis cannot be supported by the data resulted from the experiment. The ANOVA test reported the data as significant but after analyzation, the data is insignificant within the context of the experiment. It was expected that absorbances of the samples would decrease as photosynthesis reduces the DCIP and it loses its blue color or would even stay consistent if photosynthesis was inhibited or stopped. However, all samples resulted in an overall average positive change in absorbance, including the control samples. After analysis of the trends of the data, it can be seen that when ZnSO4 is added to a sample exposed to light, a unique drop in absorbance occurs in the first 10 minutes and then slowly increases in absorbance after 20 minutes. This indicates that the ZnSO4 solution did have an effect on photosynthetic rates, however opposite to what was expected. This could be due to adding incorrect concentrations of ZnSO4 to the chloroplast samples. The ZnSO4 solutions were diluted to 1mM and 2mM samples from a powder form. Mistakes could have easily been made in the molarity concentrations or weighing the minute samples. Also, these unexpected results could be due to a mistake in the assay. The spectrophotometer may have been set to the wrong wavelength explaining a consistent, yet unexpected, reading. Another possibility is that the ZnSO4 could have unexpected interactions with the buffer solution used in the experiment (Assche: 1986). Although our data did not support our hypothesis, despite significant statistics, this data could be used in future modified experiments. It can be seen that the addition of ZnSO4 did have effects on the data trends when exposed to light. This information could be used to better understand the mechanisms of photosynthesis, enabling humans to control such an important biological process. By studying the data trends this experiment produced, a new experiment can be produced that alters the independent variable, ZnSO4, in such a way that the data is scientifically significant. To do this, more research needs to be conducted on how metals, such as zinc, affects the transfer of an electron from the photosystem. With this info, the molarity can be adjusted to better effect the transfer of electron or a different independent variable can be introduced to effect the transfer of the electron more to the point of inhibition.
