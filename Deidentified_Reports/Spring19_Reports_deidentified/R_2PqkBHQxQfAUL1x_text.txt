Title: The Impact of Juvenile Hormone on the Development and Pupation of Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Diets are crucial to our growth and development as organisms, however what occurs when hormones that regulate development are delayed. Manduca Sexta, otherwise known as Tobacco Hornworm, have a life cycle of 39 to 48 days and go through 5 stages of instar as larvae prior to pupating and transforming into a pupa. It was observed whether an increase in JH in the M. Sexta diet leads to an impact in the weight and growth compared to others who had not received it. It was found that there is no significant difference in the weights of those treated with JH and those who were not. It was concluded that while additional JH does delay the commitment pulse from occurring, it does not lead to an increase in weight while still a larva.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes insects from butterflies to moths Their life cycle lasts approximately 39 to 48 days with several stages throughout its life cycle [Reinecke: 1980]. They begin as eggs before eventually maturing through 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th instar larva stages prior to becoming a pupa. During the first 5 stages the M. Sexta has high levels of Juvenile Hormone (JH), however an increase in Ecdysterone (20E) begins the commitment pulse and thus the molting as it begins its transformation into a Pupa. However, in order to trigger the commitment pulse and begin changing it into Pupa stage, there must be an increase in 20E [Jesudason: 1990]. But what occurs if 20E is not released within the body? What happens if the M. Sexta was left only producing JH? JH is found prior to pupation and prevents the commitment pulse when at high levels, thus with an increase of this hormone in the M. Sexta diets through the use of Precor, a 20E inhibitor, an impact in weight and growth of the caterpillars fed with this hormone will be observed to have a significant difference in comparison to its non-treatment counterparts.

Materials and Methods:
In order to test for our hypothesis, we increased the JH hormone with the addition of Precor to the M. Sexta diet. Six Manduca Sexta were chosen for this experiment, three for control and three for treatment. Each caterpillar fell in the relative range of 0.7 to 1.2 grams for their initial weight. Two containers were prepared for each of the groups, and 60 grams of their food, a premade mixture provided by the lab, was measured out. From there, 10 grams of the premade food was measured out and placed in each of the six compartments, three in each container. For those in the control container, 6 drops of water were added to each of the 10 grams of food already placed in the container. For those placed in the treatment container, 6 drops of Precor was added to each of their 10 grams of food. Both containers were then placed into a refrigerator set to 25 degrees Celsius. In order to measure progress, the caterpillars were weighed every other day on a digital scale. Data was recorded from each time the caterpillars were weighed. If the food in the container was dried out, it was replaced with a new 10 grams of food, following the same process detailed above. The M. Sexta was observed and data was recorded over a 14-day period. After those 14 days, a final measurement was recorded as well as observation before the experiment was cleaned up and discarded. A two-sample t-test was used to evaluate the data in order to compute the data of both groups as well as the progress they have made since initial weighing. The t-value shows the calculated difference from what is the predicted value and the actual value recorded. The p-value found was 0.638, thus larger than 0.05 and failing to reject the null hypothesis of there being a significant difference in weight of the M. Sexta which received Precor in comparison to those who did not.

Results:
The average weight for the two groups was recorded after the 14-day period. The control group had an average weight of 6.75 grams with a standard deviation of 3.28 grams (Table 2). A percent change of 791.04% with a standard deviation of 272.95% was recorded from the initial weight to their final weight (Figure 1). For the treatment group, an average weight of 6.17 grams with a 3.11 grams standard deviation was recorded (Table 2). The percent change from initial weight to final weight was 833.679% with a standard deviation of 302.77% (Figure 1). With this, a computed t-value of 0.474 was found with 40 degrees of freedom (Table 1). The p-value found from the data set was 0.638, showing no statistical significance in the data.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that M. Sexta who receive Juvenile Hormone would exhibit greater weight due to inability to pupate, was not supported. We observed no significant difference in the weight and growth of those in the treatment group at a .05 level, thus suggesting that an addition of JH does not lead to an increase in weight from their delay in pupation. It was believed that due to the commitment pulse being delayed, the additional nutrients from the food will go towards additional weight gain, rather than being used as energy for the pupation pulse to begin, however this was not supported. Past investigations have found that JH has impacted the pupation of a M. Sexta however weight has never been significant enough to observe [Kiguchi: 1978]. In addition, how timing changes in development did not appear significant as well in the differences of growth [Vince: 1977]. This suggests that weight does not have a significant change when the M. Sexta is going through its commitment pulse, as seen by the p-value above. When looking at the average weight, it appears that the treatment group is similar, but yet smaller than the control group that was going through a commitment pulse. This could have been altered and improved as a result of consistent feeding and measurements of length in addition to that of weight. From here it would be ideal to repeat the experiment however this time with a larger amount of Precor place in the M. Sexta diet. Another option is delivering the hormone at differing stages of the M. Sexta life cycle and observing the changes it has on the organismâ€™s development.
