Title: Altering Ecdysterone levels in Manduca Sexta caterpillars to change their life cycle

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillars were threatened by decreasing the level of Ecdysterone (20E) hormone to determine if they grow more or less than the controll Manduca sexta that were observed without altering their normal hormonal cycle. We split up eight caterpillars into two groups: a treatment and a controll group. The treatment one received aza-guard, an ecdysterone inhibitor, while the controll did not. I hypothesized that the treatment group would have not develop into an adult stage because I assumed that the elevated concentration of aza-guard would cause the range of 20E to be outside its normal range, resulting in abnormalities. Our p_value for the experiment was 0.068, which allowed us to conclude that it was not statistically significent, though visibly the experimental group, at the end of the experiment, was significently smaller than the controll. The aforementioned outcomes of this experiment can be proven useful to fields of industry such as agriculture to form pesticides. 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera [Johnson:2018], also known as tobacco hornworms [Cymborowsky: 1981], that undergo holometabolous development [Johnson:2018]. Hormones are important for a Manduca Sexta’s development because the Manduca Sexta has two hormones that regulate its life cycle: Ecdysterone and Juvenile hormone. Juvenile Hormone drops off in production after the 4th larvae stage while Ecdysterone (20E) temporarily rises. At the 5th larval instar, Juvenile hormone levels drop very low. When the caterpillars are large enough, they produce a commitment pulse, signaling that they are ready to pupate into a moth. The commitment pulse occurs when there is a second, smaller rise in 20E. Adverse conditions affect the life of many insects [Cymborowski: 1981]. Aza-guard is an ecdysterone inhibitor because it decreases the levels of 20E hormone when introduced. How will adding aza-guard lead to different development of the caterpillar life cycle? Moreover, will they still develop into the adult stage? We are studying this because in the future, it may be helpful to limit a species from developing into adulthood by employing this strategy in order to eliminate pests in an agricultural environment. My hypothesis is: if we add 10 drops of aza-guard, an ecdysterone inhibitor, to 10 grams of food for the manduca sexta, then hormone levels will alter, causing the Manduca Sexta to not develop the adult stage.

Materials and Method:
We selected 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars, each weighing between 0.63-1.94 grams. We then divided them into two groups. These two groups were put into two plastic containers, which both contained four different, separated areas (one for each caterpillar). Moreover, to allow the caterpillars to breath, we punched holes in the containers for proper air flow. In order to accomplish the experiment, we proposed two diets for the caterpillars, one that would be fed to the controll group and one that would be fed to the treatment group. The diet for the controll group consisted of ten grams of food (compacted and shaped as a sphere) with ten drops of water, and the diet for the treatment group consisted of ten grams of food (compacted and shaped as a sphere) with ten drops of Aza-guard. The caterpillars were numbered and all of them were kept in the same incubator at a constant temperature in a 12 hour dark and 12 hour light cycle. The caterpillars’ boxes were regularly cleaned and their food was replaced every time it became dry or ran out. To calculate if our test was statistically valuable, we used a one-tail two-sampled t_test. We compared the mean of the rate of change of the controll group with that of the experimental group.

Results:
Overall, the mean rate of change for the controll group was higher than the mean rate of change for the experimental group (figure 2). Specifically,  the values demonstrate that the experimental mean of the rate of change was almost 12 times lower compared to the mean of the rate of change of the controll group. The standard deviation for the controll group was large, which means that the observations were far from the mean (figure 2.).  The p_value that we got for the experiment was determined by applying a one-tail two-sampled t_test. The p_value was 0.068, which is greater than 0.05, meaning that our results were not statistically significent. On the other hand, the graph (figure 1.) showed a big difference in the growth trend between the controll group and the experimental group, in which the experimental group did not gain as much weight as the controll group did. Moreover, it shows that at the end of the experiment, the experimental group caterpillars died while the subjects in the controll group were still alive. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not statistically confirmed, meaning that our null hypothesis was accepted. As we stated in the results section, our hypothesis was not statistically significent, but the trends shown in the graph (fig.1) seem to support our experimental hypothesis. This is because the experimental group did not gain a lot of weight and actually all of the components of the experimental group died before the end of the experiment.  We need to take into consideration that the assumptions and the results we had may be just a case. The null hypothesis is supported from the results of the experiment, meaning that ten drops of aza-guard per ten grams of food does not have (statistically speaking) a significent effect on growth. Though, based on empirical observation we would say the opposite. Since the experimental group did not pupate, and the adult body size of a larva is determined by the size of the Manduca Sexta when it begins to pupate [Grunert:2015], we would say that the experimental group did not enter into the adult stage. This suggests to us that a way to redo the experiment, in order to make it statistically valid, is to increase the number of tobacco hornworms [Cymborowsky: 1981] that we use for the experiment. In this way, it reduces the chance to classify our experiment as a case. We know that one of the goals of hormones is to regulate growth. Hormones that regulate the growth of the Manduca Sexta are JH and 20E. By knowing that adverse conditions affect the life of many insects [Cymborowski: 1981], we need to find out which conditions are going to affect the hormonal level of the Manduca Sexta. This knowledge may lead to many important applications. For example, it may be applicable in the field of agricultural industry.
