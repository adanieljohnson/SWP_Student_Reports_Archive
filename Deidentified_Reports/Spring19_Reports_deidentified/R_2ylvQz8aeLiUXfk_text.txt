Title: The Effects of Added JH Hormone to Manduca Sexta Caterpillar Diet

Abstract:
Insect development is fueled and coordinated by many hormones within the insect. One of the most prominent hormone is the juvenile hormone (JH). JH levels signal a caterpillar when to begin growing in preparation for pupation. The purpose of the experiment was to measure the weight and growth rate in accordance with JH increase in Manduca Sexta caterpillars diets. Researchers hypothesized that the caterpillars that were fed JH would be larger than the control group of caterpillars. Researchers took a control group of Manduca Sexta caterpillars and another identical group and fed the second group a diet that had a 4% increase in JH. It was discovered that the hypothesis was correct and that JH stifles the juvenile phase and causes caterpillars to grow at a much higher rate than they would naturally grow.


Introduction:
Insect’s growth and life stages are highly regulated by different hormone systems that regulate hormones all throughout their bodies. There are many hormones that flow inside insects, one of these hormones is the Juvenile Hormone (or JH), which controls when an insect pupates or when an insect receives the Commitment Pulse and begins to change. The commitment pulse is a moment in a caterpillar when the JH levels drop and the caterpillar loses water in preparation for pupation. A similar experiment was already conducted by Roger K. Vince and Lawrence I. Gilbert where they gave Manduca Sexta JH and tried to predict the outcome (Vince, Roger K, and Lawrence I. Gilbert: 1977). As Vince and Lawrence elaborate on, Manduca Sexta are easily influenced by hormones so they make them prime insects to test. Researchers conducted an experiment on Manduca Sexta to see how diets (specifically diets containing JH) affected size and growth rate. I hypothesized that our 4% JH diet increase will prolong the juvenile stage and will result in a large growth in the caterpillars, and therefore JH fed caterpillars will be larger than the control group of caterpillars.


Materials and Methods:
Researchers conducted hormone experiments on eight caterpillars. Four caterpillars were made into the control group whereas the other caterpillar’s food was tinted with 4% JH. The JH amount was the independent variable in the experiment and the caterpillars were the dependent variable. For this lab, my statistical test was a two-sample T-Test because we needed to see if there was a significant difference between the two groups of caterpillars. Researchers fed the Control Group 10g of plain caterpillar food per week. The JH group was fed 10g of caterpillar food per week with 2% JH added.  Data was collected every day for a week and weight and color were recorded. Weight is the most important attribute to test because unlike color or length, it can be measured with more clarity and represents a greater change in an insect’s physiology.


Results:
The JH caterpillars were all larger than their normal diet counterparts. For the first couple days, the JH fed caterpillars actually were growing slower than the control group and I thought that the second part of my hypothesis would be incorrect. But about day 3, the JH fed caterpillar’s weight just grew exponentially and by day 5 they each weighed at least 2 grams more than the control group. For about 5 days, the caterpillars all looked healthy and they were all continually gaining weight. About day 6, two of the caterpillars began looking unhealthy and their food seemed not to be touched and there was a serious lack of faeces. None of the caterpillar’s had identical growth. For Carter, the JH caterpillar was smaller the entire time except at the very end. In figure’s 1 through 4, the red line is the JH caterpillar’s and the blue line is the control caterpillar. On average, the control caterpillars grew 2.8g over the two weeks and the JH caterpillars grew 7.65g. The trends for the control group was +/- 1.3 and the trend for the JH group was +/- 1.9. The p-value was 0.2 and the t-value was 1.41 with 6 degrees of freedom.

Discussion:
My hypothesis was supported. The caterpillars with the JH diet were much larger and grew much faster than the control caterpillars. The p-value was 0.240 so that indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so I reject the null hypothesis because there was clear physical and statistical data showing a difference between the control and JH groups. Carter’s caterpillar was a relative anomaly; I do not know why his control caterpillar was larger than his JH caterpillar. Maybe he just had a hungry caterpillar. It is clear the JH effects growth. The JH caterpillars were on average 3.98 grams heavier than the control caterpillars. This supports Roger K. Vince and Lawrence I. Gilbert’s experiment where they also saw increases in growth when giving different percentages of JH (Vince, Roger K, and Lawrence I. Gilbert: 1977). An interesting topic in the future would be to determine what the optimal amount of JH would be to elicit the most growth in Manduca Sexta. We used a 4% increase in their food, but it would be interesting to consider what would happen if there was a 6% or 8% increase in the JH.
