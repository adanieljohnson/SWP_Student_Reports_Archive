Title: The effects of food incentive on the aggressive displays of Betta splendins

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effects of the presence of food on the aggression levels of Betta splendins (Siamese fighting fish). Betta fish are well-known aggressors, with their most aggressive behavior being the “red mane” display. We calculated the duration of this display in the presence of and absence of food to determine if there was any significent difference in aggressive activity. Previous studies have proven that food does affect aggression level. However, our results proved there was no significent difference between aggression with and without the presence of food. The results of this experiment may provide helpful data to marine biologists, individual owners, and researchers who utilize ethology, the study of animal behavior. 


Introduction:
Ethology—the study of animal behavior—allows us to understand the physiological context of organisms’ behaviors. Aggression is one of these behaviors that is easily studied. Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are well-known aggressors. Males are prone to aggression, and frequently engage other males in agnostic behaviors when present in the same environment. One of Bettas’ most aggressive displays is known as the “red mane,” during which the fish flare their operculum to expose expanding branchiostegal membranes. The presence of food may affect the aggressiveness of Betta splendins. Previous studies have shown that Betta fish choose food over aggressive interactions when presented with both options [Bols et al: 1979]. If we add food to the environment of Betta fish during exposure to other Betta fish, then the duration of the “red mane” behavior will decrease when compared to the same exposure without food. 


Materials and Method:
We first observed two isolated male Bettas, for three minutes each, and recorded the observations. We then removed the partition (allowing the two Bettas to see each other) for three minutes. During these three minutes, we recorded the duration, in seconds, of the red mane display. We replaced the partition and allowed the Bettas to rest for five minutes. We repeated this process with the same fish, but added one scoop of food to each Betta’s environment. We then recorded the results. We repeated this entire process (both with and without food) with two new Bettas and recorded the results. We calculated the average and standard deviation, in seconds, of the responses of each fish. Finally, we used a paired two-sample t_test to determine whether or not our results were significent.


Results:
The first Betta test group displayed more aggressive behavior than the second Betta test group, both with and without food present. The second Betta test group displayed very little aggression in both tests. Our t_test proved our results were not significent (t-value=2.55, d.f.=3, p_value=0.174). The average and standard deviations of the duration of the red mane behavior are referenced in Table 1. These results are graphed on Figure 1. 



Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis, as there was no significent difference between aggression in the presence of food and aggression in the absence of food. These findings contradict previous studies that have shown a decrease in aggression in Betta splendins when food is an incentive [Bols et al: 1979]. However, other studies have shown that food acts as a reinforcer for aggressiveness, the results of which more closely resemble ours [Fatino et al: 1972]. In this experiment, the fish tested simply may not have been hungry and the food may not have provided much of an incentive over aggression. Or the aggression levels of our fish may have been so strong that their desire for food was overridden by their territoriality. In the future, it may be helpful to run more tests and increase the sample size in order to obtain more significent results. This information may be beneficial for biologists, aquarium owners, or individuals who have a need for ethology when teaching, for personal use, or for research purposes.
