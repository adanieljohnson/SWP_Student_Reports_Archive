Title: The Effect of Ecdysterone Inhibitors on the Pupation of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta regulates its development through the use of hormones that controll the growth of the organism. We measured the effect that the insect growth regulator Azaguard, a 20E inhibitor, has when it is added to the food of the insect. We hypothesized that if the ecdysterone is kept constantly low, then the M. sexta will develop at a normal rate but will not pupate. To test this, the insects were divided into controll and experimental groups, and their length and weight were measured everyday over a fourteen-day period. The experimental group grew rapidly, while the controll group showed an average, steady growth. A two sample T test was used to measure the significance of the data. Our hypothesis was rejected because the pupation stage was never reached, and the M. sexta did not develop at a normal rate compared to the controll group.

Introduction:
 The M. sexta, commonly known as tobacco hornworm, use hormones as a method to regulate processes that occur within various body systems. The purpose of this lab was to determine the effect that insect growth regulators (IGRs) have on the physiological regulatory development that is vital for the development of the insect. Prothoracicotropic, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone, are natural hormones found in the insects and the IGR’s manipulate these hormones and can lead to abnormalities that reduce the chances of survival by blocking or overacting the hormones. [Tunaz: 2004] It has been found that the inhibition of certain hormones can lead to swelling in certain regions, cuticular lesions, the body wall rupturing, and death. [Hughes 1989] We speculate that the pupation will not occur because the commitment point will not be reached, due to the inhibition of the ecdysterone. In this experiment, an ecdysterone inhibitor was used to determine the effects it had on the growth and pupation of the M. sexta. This information will show how ecdysterone inhibitors affect these insects as well as how certain hormones aide or hinder their development. Our hypothesis is that if the ecdysterone is kept constantly low, then the insect will develop at a normal rate, but will not pupate.

Materials and Method:
In order to carry out this experiment eight M. sexta of relatively the same size and age were obtained and divided into two groups of four. The M. sexta were then place in separate containers and two holes were poked in the side to supply adequate air flow. The controll group was fed ten grams each with ten drops of water. The experimental group was fed ten grams of food with ten drops of the Azaguard. Each insect was weighed in grams and had their length measured in millimeters in order to obtain starting data. They were then kept in an incubator at 28°c in a twelve-hour dark and twelve-hour light cycle. Measure the M. sexta’s length and weight every day for a total of fourteen days and replace the food once it is starting to get low and clean out the containers as needed. On the fourteenth day place all of the recorded data into an excel spreadsheet to find the results for the two sample T test, in order to determine if the data is significent.

Results:
Throughout the course of the experiment we found that the controll group of M. sexta continued to grow but remained relatively small in comparison to the experimental group. The exception to this was insect number one in the controll, which decreased in size, and died. The experimental group displayed rapid growth, as seen in figure 2 and 3, particularly insect number two which swelled in size and turned a light green color. In figure 1, which depicts the length, the controll and experimental groups trends mimicked each other, but the experimental group was longer overall. This swelling also occurred in insect number one, but it remained a light blue color. We also observed that within the last four days of the experiment the amount of feces in the container decreased. We used the two sample T test and found that for length our data was significent (t_stat=3.892, d.f.=28, P=0.00028). The same test was completed for weight, and that data was also found to be significent (t_stat=4.819, d.f.=28, P=0.0000227).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that if the ecdysterone is kept constantly low, then the M. sexta will develop at a normal rate but will not pupate was not supported by the statistical test. While the insect did not pupate, the experimental group did not develop at a normal rate. The pupation did not occur because the 20E was inhibited, thus preventing the commitment pulse from occurring therefore the process of pupation could not take place. Due to the significance of our results, the insect did not develop at a normal rate because it grew larger than the controll group. The increase in size in the experimental group was because the ecdysterone inhibitor potentially caused the receptors to have an inability to connect to the hormone that regulates the negative feedback to the commitment pulse. The average weight for the controll group peaked on the second day at a high of 2.5 grams, while the average weight of the experimental group peaked on day six at 5.4 grams. The average length for the controll group peaked on the third day at a high of 48.75 millimeters, while the average length of the experimental group peaked on day six at 62.25 millimeters. This data represents why the hypothesis was not supported and shows how the experimental group did not grow at a normal rate. The experimental group showed dramatic swelling particularly in insect one and two, this has to do with the effect of hormonal controll on the insect’s body walls. [Hughes: 1989] Both the controll and experimental groups made it to the fifth instar larva stage, but never reached the pupa stage. For future studies the recommended suggestion is that the insects should not be placed on top of one another and that the containers be cleaned daily as well as the food be replenished. This research shows how IGRs impact the growth and development of the M. sexta and how their pupation was affected. This information can be used to deepen the understanding of the life cycle of the insect and use this information to manipulate its growth. By controllling the M. sexta development, scientists can diminish the harm they cause to plants, thus benefiting farmers and the environment.
