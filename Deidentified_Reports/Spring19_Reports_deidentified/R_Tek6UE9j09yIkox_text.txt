Title: The neuromuscular response effect of the addition of acetylcholine to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The unique process in which the neuromuscular system of Rana pipiens can respond to environmental changes within milliseconds allows for the manipulation of neuromuscular control. The expectation was if acetylcholine was added to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response would be increased until it reached the point of tetanus or fatigue. Three Rana pipiens legs were used as both a control and treatment group in order to determine the effects of the addition of acetylcholine, specially on the maximum voltage and visual appearance of the organisms. The statistical data showed no significant difference between the two groups, but some of the biological changes illustrated differences in neuromuscular response. Rana pipiens leg #1 exhibited an increase in neuromuscular response with the addition of acetylcholine, but leg #2 and leg #3 displayed a decrease. While it was unclear the exact significance of the addition of acetylcholine in the Rana pipiens, due to varying threshold voltages and human error, other chemical components, such as sodium, calcium, and acetylcholinesterase, also play a role in action potential propagation and the rate at which acetylcholine binds to its receptors, and so by understanding the

ABSTRACT CONTINUED: optimal amounts of these chemicals, it could be possible to advance the knowledge of neuromuscular response in Rana pipiens.
INTRODUCTION: Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments in similar ways as hormones do, except the neuromuscular system can respond within milliseconds, rather than responding in seconds or days like hormone-based systems do [Johnson: 2018]. This system of rapid intercellular communication of nerves is unique to animals as plants and fungi do not have comparable systems [Johnson: 2018]. Various chemicals, such as sodium, calcium, acetylcholine, and acetylcholinesterase, can be added to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens, or Northern Leopard Frogs, to create unique neuromuscular responses that can be recorded on electromyograms. The skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates contains thousands of cylindrical myofibers bound together with connective tissue and innervated by motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. When nerve impulses arrive at a neuromuscular junction, they cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal [Johnson: 2018]. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic neuron to allow sodium to enter, causing depolarization, and generating an action potential to be carried into the muscle cell’s interior [Johnson: 2018]. The action potential propagates throughout the muscle fiber, causing calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and activating the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, a change in the amount of acetylcholine present would affect the neuromuscular response. The depolarization produced by acetylcholine at the endplate of the motor neuron is increased in the presence of increased acetylcholine [Ciani: 1963]. Acetylcholine can “desensitize” the postjunctional membrane, initiating an increased neuromuscular response [Ciani: 1963]. If acetylcholine is added to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response will be increased until it reaches the point of tetanus or fatigue.

Materials and Methods:
Three Rana pipiens leg preparations, including the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve, were used for both the control and treatment groups. For the times in which each Rana pipiens leg preparation was used as the control group, no acetylcholine was added, but for the times in which each Rana pipiens leg preparation was used as the treatment group, 0.1 mL of 10 mg/mL acetylcholine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle for direct stimulation. To isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of the Rana pipiens leg, forceps were used to remove the skin, and Frog Ringer’s solution was used to moisten the leg before the inner thigh muscles were separated. The white sciatic nerve was freed from the connective tissue, and a string was tied around the achilles tendon, suspending the gastrocnemius muscle at approximately ninety degrees as the string was attached to the FT-302 force transducer. The probe was attached to the muscle, connecting it to the LabScribe computer system to record electromyograms. The control group of Rana pipiens leg preparations did not receive any injections, but after a leg was used as a control, it was also used as a treatment group in which a syringe was used to inject the muscle with 0.1 mL of 10 mg/mL acetylcholine. By using the computer to send electrical pulses to the Rana pipiens leg apparatus, resulting in muscle twitches, the threshold, or the membrane potential that must be reached in order to open voltage-gated sodium channels and generate an action potential, for each leg was determined, and then three electrical pulses were sent at that voltage in order to determine the neuromuscular response for the control. After the addition of acetylcholine, and waiting for approximately three minutes, three more electrical pulses were sent at the same voltage, and the resulting neuromuscular response was compared to the control. Qualitative visual observations were also recorded, and one leg was tested at a time. Measuring the muscle twitches based on voltage is a good proxy for Rana pipiens neuromuscular response because it is relatively easy to measure with electromyograms, and the data can be readily compared in order to determine the overall effect of the addition of acetylcholine. A paired t-test was performed to analyze the differences in neuromuscular response of Rana pipiens within the control and treatment groups, and to compare them. This data was transformed by finding the average voltage for both the control and treatment groups for each Rana pipiens leg, and this data was used to compare the differences.

Results:
A paired t-test was used to analyze the average maximum voltage of each of the three Rana pipiens legs in both the control and treatment groups. The threshold voltage for leg #1 was 4.4 volts, for leg #2 it was 9.3 volts, and for leg #3 it was 5.0 volts. The mean maximum voltage for the control group of leg #1 was less than that of the treatment group, but for leg #2 and leg #3, the mean maximum voltage for the control group was greater than that of the treatment group (Fig. 1). Therefore, leg #1 exhibited a greater neuromuscular response with the addition of acetylcholine compared to no addition of acetylcholine, while leg #2 and leg #3 exhibited a lesser neuromuscular response with the addition of acetylcholine. The average muscle contraction amplitude of the control group of the three Rana pipiens legs was 1.040 volts, while that of the treatment group of the three Rana pipiens legs was only 1.011 volts, displaying a slight difference. The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the treatment group (t-stat = 0.551, df = 2, p-value = 0.637). Upon recording qualitative visual observations, leg #1 appeared to twitch similarly in both the control and treatment groups, and when acetylcholine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle, the muscle appeared to be fattened. For leg #2, when the sciatic nerve was separated from the muscle, the muscle twitched a great amount, but then once electrical pulses were sent to it, it did not twitch nearly as much. For leg #3, the twitch appeared to be stronger than it had been previously as both the gastrocnemius muscle and the frog toes twitched a great amount. As a result of this experiment, there were a variety of neuromuscular responses for both the control group and the treatment group of Rana pipiens legs.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that if acetylcholine is added to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response will be increased until it reaches the point of tetanus or fatigue, was not supported. Since the means of the control groups for each of the three Rana pipiens legs were not statistically significantly different than those of the treatment groups, statistically, the hypothesis was not supported (Fig. 1). Although, for leg #1, there was an increase in the neuromuscular response when acetylcholine was added, but for leg #2 and leg #3, the neuromuscular response decreased when acetylcholine was added (Fig. 1). There are multiple reasons as to why this discrepancy could have occurred, and one of them is that for leg #2, the threshold voltage was determined to be 9.3 volts, which is rather high. Therefore, when multiple electrical pulses were sent to the leg, the nerve and muscle had to work harder than they did in the other two legs, possibly causing the muscle to fatigue quicker. Additionally, when the sciatic nerve was isolated before the electrical pulses were sent, there was a lot of human manipulation involved because the nerve was difficult to isolate. This issue caused the muscle to twitch prematurely before the actual experimentation, which could have led to an earlier fatigue. If this muscle reached tetanus or fatigue faster than the other two legs, this could account for why the maximum voltage values for both the control group and treatment group for this leg were lower than those of the other two legs. Furthermore, the maximum voltage differences between the control and treatment groups for all three of the legs did not differ significantly. This could cause it to be inferred that not enough acetylcholine was added in order to cause a significant change in the neuromuscular response. Therefore, it is possible that the addition of acetylcholine affected the treatment groups by increasing the neuromuscular response, but due to premature fatigue or using too little acetylcholine, the statistics reveal that the control and treatment groups were not significantly different. Additionally, in past investigations, it has been determined that at high concentrations of acetylcholine, more ion channels at the neuromuscular junction open, increasing the uptake of acetylcholine and the rate of depolarization [Colquhoun: 1988]. The neuromuscular junction is desensitized, and the action potential can be propagated more quickly [Colquhoun: 1988]. This suggests that biologically, an increase in acetylcholine should also increase the neuromuscular response due to the increase in depolarization rate. Although, many past studies involved another chemical component with the purpose of altering the rate at which acetylcholine bound to its receptors, and so to further this experiment and better understand the overall effect of acetylcholine, other chemical components could be incorporated. Understanding the relationship between acetylcholine and other chemicals involved in action potential transmission, such as sodium, calcium, and acetylcholinesterase, as well as other chemicals that could be manipulated, could further scientists’ knowledge of the proper amounts of each chemical that need to be present in order to result in optimal muscle contraction in Rana pipiens, as well as in other organisms.
