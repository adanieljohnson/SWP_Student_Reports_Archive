Title: Effect of the Addition Methoprene (a Juvenile Hormone Analogue) in the Diet of Manduca Sexta Development & Pupation 

Abstract:
In the group’s experiment, the exposure to excess Juvenile Hormone (JH) during development through the additive of PreCor (a chemical that has the active ingredient of methoprene, a JH analog) [ZOECON: 2019] was used to study the growth and develop of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. To gain an understanding of how the abnormal levels of JH affect a caterpillar’s development, an experimental group of caterpillars was given food containing methoprene, and another control group was given regular caterpillar food. Both the growth and qualitative condition of development of the caterpillars studied were monitored over eight days. The group’s hypothesis that the caterpillars that consumed the food containing methoprene would never reach pupation but would continue to grow in size and weight, while the caterpillars in the control group would develop naturally and pupate was supported by the results. Additionally, the data collected was also significant through the two-sample t-test. This significant and supported idea, in conjunction with the qualitative data collected, suggests that an increased amount of JH present in the organism results in larvae that cannot pupate and therefore repopulate their population. The results show a beneficial result as population can be controlled long term. 

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta caterpillar, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is from the class Insecta, order Lepidoptera, family Sphingidae, genus Manduca, and species Sexta. Manduca Sexta caterpillars have a holometabolous life cycle lasting between 39-48 days [Johnson: 2016]. A holometabolous life cycle is one that has an organism undergo metamorphosis after completing their larval stages, and before developing into an adult moth. The development of the organism being studied is dictated primarily by two hormones: Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). JH is a hormone that is produced by the corpus allata (located on each side of the foregut ) and controls the type of molt during development. 20E is a hormone that is produced by the prothoracic glands (located in the head and thorax) controls the timing of molting during insect development. 20E plays a vitally important role in a Manduca Sexta Caterpillar’s commitment impulse which marks the start of pupation, and thus metamorphosis [Johnson: 2016]. During the organism’s life span, these hormones guide the organism development through typically five instar larvae stages (where the weight of the organism increases with the increasing number of stages) before a spike in 20E initiates the onset of the commitment impulse and later pupation [Johnson: 2016]. [see 20E hormone levels (depicted in figure 8 (page 12) of the lab manual)]

During the group’s experiment, which consisted of 8 days of data collection, the group wanted to determine and understand what occurs when these two hormones are altered in their concentration and amount present in the organism. More specially, can the group control development of the caterpillars by modifying JH levels through the use of PreCor (which contains the active ingredient of methoprene: a JH analog)? The group wondered if increasing JH levels through PreCor could make the onset of commitment impulse impossible (as a commitment pulse requires a sufficient decrease in JH levels to initiate metamorphosis and become a pupa). Finally, the group wants to understand how this knowledge of the hormones, relating to development, could practical and useful in commercial means (most likely agriculturally) along with the potential continuation of development if commencement pulse was not reached.

If an IGR that increases JH levels (PreCor), the organism will not pupate and reach adult-hood as increased levels in JH will increase both the weight of the caterpillars along with the number of larvae instars and therefore result in the in the absence of pupation. The caterpillars that are given the IGR effected food will continue to increase in weight and mass as the JH will induce eating habits that facilitate growth and development. The caterpillars that do not consume the supplemental IGR will undergo regular growth and development.




Materials and Methods:
To verify the result of the hypothesis presented in the lab, the group first decided to create two groups made up of four organisms each. The first group would be the control group to verify the lab’s results. The second group of four caterpillars is also present to reflect the results of the effect of increased, unnatural concentration of JH in the organism. At the start of the lab, each group was placed in separate containers where each caterpillar as their own cell along with two punched holes for air flow. After cells were created, the caterpillars were selected. The group was sure to choose caterpillars that were healthy (green, plump) and lacked a black stripe running down their back which would indicate the caterpillars have developed too much for the lab’s hypothesis. Once the caterpillars were selected, they were each given they were each given the appropriate food. The non-control group was presented with 40 grams of feed with 20 drops of PreCor added so that each caterpillar received 10 grams of food with five drops of PreCor added. PreCor was the ingredient used to increase JH levels as it contains an active compound of methoprene which is an analog of JH [ZOECON: 2019]. This same food allotment process was used for the control group, but instead of PreCor added, water was added to the food to control for the desirability of food relating to wetness. Before feeding, however, each caterpillar was first weighed then food was added. 

The weight (the measured variable of the lab) along with brief qualitative data regarding the health of the subjects was added to lab notes. Additionally, the caterpillar’s food was taken out, replaced with correct reagent daily. With regards to the statistical test used to interpret data, the group used the two-sample t-test to compare the means of weight and growth of the two caterpillar groups through the eight days of data collection. This test works well with one measurable variable being compared along with the categorical variable (presence or lack of PreCor). Additionally, the one-tailed version of this test was used as the experiment does have directionally of difference in the hypothesis thus the one-tailed test is appropriate.


Results:
The mean growth of the caterpillars of the control group in grams from day 1 to day 8 was 5.625 +/- 2.13448667 grams while the mean for the group being fed the food that was supplemented with PreCor was 8.47 +/- 1.13 grams (Fig.1). The standard deviation for these respective mean values was +/- 2.13448667 for the control group and +/- 1.13 for the experimental group (Fig.1). The group used the two-sample t-test to analyze the results collected. The mean of the change in growth measured in grams over eight days of data collection proved to be statically significant between the two groups (t-stat: 2.06608, dF= 5, P= 0.046853). After looking at the two groups of caterpillars on the final day of collection, there were significant differences in both groups. With regards to the control group, through the eight days, each caterpillar grew a noticeable amount and began to change colors to that of caterpillars approaching their commitment impulse (black stripe forming on back, paler green color). For the experimental group being treated with PreCor, signs of the approaching of a commitment impulse were absent. Increased numbers in instar larvae stages easily identified as caterpillars increased in size and volume clearly without the formation of black stripes or pale green color [Riddiford: 2003].

Discussion:
The group’s hypothesis of if an IGR that increases JH levels that leads to an organism not pupating was both supported and proved significant through the data collected over the eight days.  The results of the experiment proved significant according to the p-value calculation (one-tailed p-value = 0.046853, P-value &lt; 0.05 is considered significant). Additionally, and worth noting, the mean change in weight of the experimental group was significantly greater than that of the control group (as our hypothesis predicted). The group concluded that this change in weight was attributable to the fact that ¾ of the caterpillars in the control group began pupating by day eight, which also indicates the end in an increase of weight as organisms began losing weight during pupation [Riddiford: 2003]. Pupation was able to be achieved as a spike in 20E was able to occur as a result of normal JH levels in the control group [Safranek: 1980]. With regards to the experimental group, the increased number of larvae instar stages resulted in greater weight and overall size of organism along with the inability to pupate as a result of increased weight. 

Looking deeper into the data collected, the larger average growth of the caterpillars in the group with added JH makes sense as the increased number in larvae instar stages as a result of the absence of commitment impulse leads to larger sized larvae[Johnson: 2016]. Furthermore, the initial rise in weight leading to a slight decrease in weight as the control group approached day 8 reflects the approaching of the commitment impulse and thus pupation. Pupation in the control group was able to be reached as normal JH levels allow for a spike in 20E and therefore onset of commitment impulse and pupation [Safranek: 1980]. 

With regards to error identified in the lab, there were no significant errors identified in the lab outside of the need to exclude the data for one outlier caterpillar in the treatment group. Caterpillar #3 of treatment group died after the 8th day of data collection: most likely as a result of not being fit for the experiment before the start of data collection. All statistics reported in the lab report were calculated with the absence of the data provided from this organism as the presence of the outlier data resulted in results that were not significant. 

As far as next steps go with regards to the data collected in the lab, the group’s supported and significant conclusions from the original hypothesis cause for there to be two resulting phenomenon that relates to the agricultural application of the understanding of caterpillar development. For one, as increased JH levels are present in the organisms, their increased size and weight results in an increased amount of feed taken in during a short-term period. For agriculture, this means that crop intake could be affected negatively short term if a JH IGR were to be introduced to a pest population. Long term wise, however, with the increased levels of JH, this same population of larger larvae would also have the inability to pupate and repopulate the population. Meaning, long term crop yields would see little harm from pest populations as the caterpillars would not be able to reproduce.
