Title: Effect of Turbulent Water on Agonistic Behavior in Betta Splendins

Abstract:
This experiment studies the effect of water turbulence on intraspecific competition among Betta splendins. Betta splendins in the wild avoid turbulent water as much as is possible because they see it as unsuitable for defensive procedures (against other bettas). We tested two groups of two bettas each, recording what percentage of their total time together was spent displaying agnostic behavior when the water was still, and when the water was turbulent. The data showed that among groups of two betta fish exposed to turbulent and still water, the difference in the percentage of total time in contact with another fish spent displaying agnostic behavior was not significent. This lead to the rejection of our hypothesis and the acceptance of the null hypothesis that water turbulence does not affect agnostic behavior among betta splendins.

Introduction:
Betta splendins will exhibit natural docile behavior around any other species of fish, but when confronted with another member of their species, Betta splendins will display several signs of aggression including facing and broadside maneuvers, and flared operculums. Betta splendins (betta fish) display high levels of aggression and are prone to attacking other bettas when housed together (especially evident in males who seek to protect their territory to secure resources and mates). These aggressive males will exhibit a tell-tale flared operculum when stressed, frightened or otherwise agitated by the presence of another fish [Wiley: 1983].  Bettas in the wild usually avoid turbulent water as they perceive it to be unsuitable for defense, so this type of water is unfamiliar to them [Bronstein: 2013]. The hypothesis was that betta fish will spend a greater percentage of time displaying agnostic behavior when the water is turbulent versus when the water is still.

Materials and Method:
We began by putting two bettas together (group 1) in a tank with removable dividers and observed their interaction in still water for five minutes. We recorded the duration that each fish spent displaying aggressive behavior (flared operculum) with a stopwatch and divided it by their total time spent together. We repeated these steps for group two. After letting the fish rest for five minutes, we repeated the same experimental design for groups one and two, with a toothbrush in the water to create turbulence. We inputted our raw data into excel and used a statistical paired 2 sample t-Test to test for significent difference. 

Results:
The percentage of time spent displaying agnostic behavior in still water was 0.629% +/- 0.193% and in turbulent water it was 0.741% +/- 0.242%. (t Stat=-2.317, d.f.=3, P=0.104) More agnostic behavior was displayed in turbulent water, but the difference was not statistically significent (Figure 1). 

Discussion:
While there was more agnostic behavior observed from bettas in turbulent water, the difference was not statistically significent leading to the rejection of our hypothesis and instead accepting the null hypothesis that the turbulence of water has no effect on agnostic behavior in betta fish (Figure 1). We had initially hypothesized that under environmental stress, bettas may experience heightened responses to factors including other fish. Since this was not the case, we can assume that betta fish are not affected by changes in their environment when confronting opponents. A possible limitation was that we only tested two groups, a sample size which may have been too small for the results to be representative of the species.
