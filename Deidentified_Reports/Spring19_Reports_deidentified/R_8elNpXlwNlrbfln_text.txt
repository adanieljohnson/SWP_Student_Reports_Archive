Title: Effects of tank size on the display of agnostic behaviors in betta fish

Abstract:
Betta splendins, or betta, is a species of freshwater fish known for exhibiting aggressive behaviors when two males come in contact with each other. An agnostic behavior is displayed when two individuals of the same species experience conflict. The most aggressive display of a betta is known as red mane which is a type of forward facing display. We predicted that since smaller spaces would cause the males to be closer together, the amount of time before an agnostic behavior was displayed would be shorter in a smaller tank in comparison to both medium and large tanks. This prediction was tested by placing a pair of three betta fish in each of three different sized tanks and measuring the time before an aggressive behavior was exhibited. Our results compare the means of these three test conditions. Overall, our data was found to not be statistically significent and cannot support our hypothesis. Two outstanding data points could possibly be the cause of this result as well as a lacking number of replicates. However, observation of agnostic behaviors can act as a lens to consider animal behavior on a broader scale. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins, or betta, is a type of freshwater fish that can be used to analyze animal behavior that can be applied to a variety of topics. A display of easily observable agnostic behaviors are exhibited when two males come into contact with each other, and in some cases also when males come in contact with females. Agonistic behaviors are adaptive and displayed when conflicts arise between two individuals of the same species [Barratt: 2001]. In betta fish, agnostic behaviors can be displayed in multiple ways but the most detectable, and also most aggressive, behavior is called red mane. Red mane is a facing display that includes a protrusion from under the operculum and is caused by the expansion of the branchiostegal membrane. Other types of agnostic behaviors include tail beating, pelvic fin flickering, and erect pectoral fins [Johnson: 2018]. Male betta fish are provoked by the detection of stimuli that are observed within a body length’s area, creating conflict between the two organisms. Therefore, the time leading up to and the intensity of the aggressive behavior depends greatly on the range or distance between the fish and the detected stimulus [Bronstein: 1983].   Betta fish were used in this experiment because they are accessible, small enough to keep in the lab, are fairly easy to keep alive, and can be easily observed and manipulated. A study similar to the one conducted in this report found that Sargo fish exhibit a greater number of agnostic behaviors in pools rather than in open areas and the number of occurrences of displays and attacks in those open areas are significently lower than in aggregated or more populated areas [Gonçalves: 2015]. Pairs of three betta fish were tested in three different sized tanks, small, medium, and large, and the time that passed before an agnostic behavior was displayed by either fish was noted. This time period was then used to determine if the size of a tank has an effect on how quickly agnostic behaviors are exhibited. Because stimuli are detectable within a body length of the organism [Gonçalves: 2015], we predicted that it would take less time for agnostic behaviors to be displayed when two male betta fish were placed in a small tank in comparison to the time it takes behaviors to be displayed in both a medium and large tank.

Materials and Method:
Three different colored betta fish were used and classified by their tail color as blue, purple, or red. Two tanks were used during the experiment, but one was used only to hold the fish that was not under observation. Behaviors in each of three differently sized tanks (16 sq. inch = small, 32 sq. inch = medium, and 48 sq. inch = large) were observed in replicates of three by testing each fish against each other; red:purple, purple:blue, blue:red. The testing tank had two partitions that separated the tank into three equal parts which acted as one holding area for each of the three fish. The fish could not see each other through the partitions.   For the small tank testing conditions, both partitions were placed and each of the three fish were placed in an individual holding area to begin. One fish was moved by net into the individual area of another fish and a timer was started as soon as the fish was out of the net. As soon as aggressive behaviors were observed, the timer was stopped, and the fish were separated back into individual holding areas for a five-minute rest period. The time before aggressive behaviors were exhibited was counted in seconds on an iPhone stopwatch. The fish that exhibited aggressive behaviors first was also noted for qualitative purposes.  For the medium tank, each fish started in their individual holding areas and then one of the partitions was removed so that the area was equal to two thirds of the entire tank (two combined individual holding areas). The same testing procedure as the small tank was carried out. The two fish being tested were placed in the individual holding areas farthest from each other, and both partitions were removed so that the area was equal to the entire size of the tank, or three combined individual holding areas. The same testing procedure as the small and medium tanks was carried out. The statistical test used to analyze the significance of the results was an ANOVA test because the means of the three test conditions were compared to determine significent differences in the amount of time before an aggressive behavior is displayed in varying tank sizes. 

Results:
The mean value (54.99 +/ 32.44) for the time before aggressive behavior was exhibited in a small tank was less than that of the large tank (96.00 +/ 83.62) and less than that of the medium sized tank (69.33 +/ 95.86). Replicate number three of the medium tank testing showed no result and was recorded as the maximum recording time, three minutes. The large tank had the highest average time in seconds before aggressive behaviors were exhibited while the small tank had the shortest average time (Fig.1). There was not a significent difference (P=0.835, F=0.186) in the average time before aggressive behaviors were observed across the three test conditions. Further ANOVA testing indicates that there are not significent differences between small:large, small:medium, and medium:large tanks. 

Discussion:
The ANOVA test results lead us to accept the null hypothesis, that the size of the tank in which two male betta fish are placed has no effect on the time it takes for agnostic behaviors to be displayed, because our data was not statistically significent in showing the difference in the means of the three experimental groups. Therefore, as observed in this experiment, the amount of space that two male betta fish are confined in does not affect how quickly agnostic behaviors are displayed. Betta fish are known to be extremely aggressive, so it is possible that the amount of space between competing males has no effect on their level of aggression, agnostic behaviors could be more of a constant rather than a variable. Although not significent, our data does show that, generally, as the area of the tank increases, the time before an aggressive behavior is displayed also increases. Furthermore, the time at which agnostic behaviors are exhibited is also related to the dominance of one male over the other. Because the tanks varied only in twelve square inches, it is difficult to determine whether the findings of this experiment are not significent in the wild, as the opportunity for much larger spaces between two fish is more easily obtained. There were two results that could have possibly skewed the data. The third replicate of the medium tank test yielded a result of 180 seconds because no agnostic behaviors were displayed. The third replicate in the large tank yielded a result of three seconds before agnostic behavior was displayed which is much quicker than the other two replicates. This quick display was likely due to the fact that this fish was exhibiting an aggressive behavior when it was in its individual holding area, separated physically and visually from the other test subjects. Because this fish had been exhibiting agnostic behaviors prior to coming in contact with another fish, it is likely that this premature display was atypical due to the large area of the tank. The fact that both of these occurrences happened in the third replicate and also in the second and third testing conditions leads us to believe that five-minute rest periods might not have been sufficient to completely calm the fish.   If these two data points had been left out of the calculations, it is possible that the results would have supported our initial hypothesis that smaller tank areas would lead to faster displays of agnostic behavior, a result which was found in a similar study researching agnostic behaviors of Sargo fish [Gonçalves: 2015]. The results of this experiment were expected to line up with those of the related study. However, the significance cannot be calculated without these two points because of the limited number of replicates. Therefore, in order to determine whether our initial hypothesis can be supported, the experiment should be redone with more replicates and possibly an increased difference in area of the space being tested. The observation of agnostic behaviors of male betta fish allows researchers to apply these adaptive displays to other areas of animal behavior including interactions with mates and how these displays can attribute to territories or alpha males in the wild. Furthermore, animal behaviors such as these can also provide information as to how it is possible for competing males of the same species to coexist in the same habitat and what that means for the entire population.
