Title: Influence of IG Regulator on Manduca Sexta Caterpillar during Life Cycle

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of insect growth hormones on the manduca sexta organisms. After preparing the experiment with plastic containers and food prepared with water (the controll) or the IG regulator (the treatment), it was observed that the hypothesis of the experiment was supported. With p_values and graphs created from the raw data that can be found under the results section of this report, a significent statistical difference was found between the controll and the treatment. This means that the IG regulator made a significent impact on the growth and development of the manduca sexta. 

Introduction:
The manduca sexta organisms, also known as tobacco hornworms, are considered pests and are heavily used in scientific research. In this lab, they will be observed and measured in order to analyze how hormones affect the growth cycle of insects. Manduca sexta, along with the beetles, ants, bees, wasps, flies, and mosquitos, undergo a complete metamorphic change. (Reinecke). Manduca sexta have distinct life cycles, which include the five larva instar, pupa, and a moth. Insect growth regulators (IGRs), which typically inhibit the life cycle of a pest, will be used to determine how different hormones affect the natural growth of the organism. The specific hormone used will be in the IG Regulator, which is known to speed up the development cycle. Testing will be used to see if the growth stimulants will reverse the effects of the growth inhibitors that were used during the first week. Specifically, the group will be looking for a distinct difference between day 1 weight and length of the organism and day 7 weight and length of the organisms. The hypothesis is that the growth stimulants will cause the manduca sexta to weigh and grow in length significently. 


Materials and Method:
2, 4-cell containers for the manduca sexta homes 
2 lids 
“Hole making” tool
Spoon
Electronic scale
Transfer pipette
Sharpie
Food 
Square tupperware
Reagent
Water
IG Regulator

Puncture 2 small holes per small cell in your manduca sexta home containers to allow air flow. To do this, place the black took behind the plastic and puncture the plastic with the orange puncture tool--pushing the orange tool fully through and into the black tool. Label each container with group names, TA, section, treatment (including controll groups), and a number to determine which organism is which when in the home. Measure 10g of food for each cell. They should be stirred and formed into small ball once their appropriate reagent is added. There will be four controll group caterpillars and they should receive 8 drops of water with their 10g of food. The other four caterpillars should have 8 drops of IG regulator with their 10g of food. After drops are added, continue to clump and mix the food. Place the newly mixed food into their respective container. Record the masses of the food, mass and length of all the caterpillars, and the cell each component was placed in. Check on the caterpillars each day to ensure food is present and moist. If not, replace the food and record the new measurements. 


Results:
The results of the t_test found this data to be statistically significent, as the p_value was .046514 for Graph 1 and .569714 for Graph 2.


The results of this lab can be seen in the tables above. Apart from the two caterpillars that died, the majority of the caterpillars significently grew in both length and weight. 


Discussion:
After executing the experiment, taking observations, and making measurement, our initial hypothesis was partially supported. As seen in the figures above there were significent changes in both weight and length of the organisms that were tested. However, two organisms died. This is suspected to be due to the fact that these to caterpillars were very weak and close to death at the beginning of this experiment. This weakness is due to the growth inhibitor used on them during the first portion of the lab. They were unable to jump back to a healthy state after their growth cycle was drastically altered. The other caterpillars were plump and healthy. The only difference between the caterpillars in the controll group and the live caterpillars that received IG Regulator was the color. This difference in color was most likely due to the growth inhibitor that a portion of the caterpillars received in the first portion of the lab that is not outlined in this report. Overall, apart from some outliers, all of the caterpillars grew in the expected way. The general knowledge of how IGRs affect insects is important to understand pest controll. For example, some insecticides have IGRs that disrupt the biochemical pathways and processes that are essential for insect growth and development. (Tunaz and Uygan)
