Title: The effect of fake fish on the agonistic behavior of Betta Splendens

Abstract:
In the experiment, we used three male betta fish both as the control and the experimental group to study the effect of fake fish on the agonistic behavior of Betta splendens. Betta fish always exhibit agonistic behaviors like tail beating and pectoral fins erect with the presence of another male betta. In order to quantitatively assess these behavior, in the experiment we measured the duration of the red mane to make comparison between real fish group and fake fish group. As the real fish could get habituation to the fake fish and also because of the lack of reinforcement from the fake one, the fish could present weaker or less behavior. We hypothesized that the duration of red mane would decrease in the interaction between one real and one fake compared with the interaction between both real fish. The result showed the duration of red mane when the fish was facing a fake fish decreased but the difference was not significant. Further study on behaviors could be made to get more accurate result and understanding of betta fish. 

Introduction:
In ecology, we bring together observational skills from natural history, laboratory methods, and insights and theories from ecology, genetics, and especially evolutionary biology. Ethologists seek to understand physiological purpose of behavior by learning actions of animals in its world [Johnson: 2018]. In the experiment we used Betta Splendens, the fighting fish originated in southeast Asia. During intraspecific interactions, male betta fish display obvious agonistic behaviors such as fin flickering, red “mane” with the presence of another male betta fish. We observed and studied the intraspecific behaviors of bettas including both the broadside movements and facing movements. Three main facing movements ranking in order of aggressiveness are pectoral fins erect, spread its gill covers or protrude the branchiostegal membranes, creating a red “mane” [Johnson: 2018]. In the experiment, we compared the agonistic behavior of three betta fish physically separated from the real fish with the behavior of the fish when it was facing the fake fish according to the quantitative variable of the average duration of red mane. A study suggested that the average agonistic duration for the fake fish is supposed to be shorter because of habituation and lack of reinforcement [Frances: 1968]. Habituation is a learning mechanism that functions to decrease the amount of energy and attention focused on certain stimuli [Lauren: 2006].  Also, without the reinforcement, like the flight of the opponent or the mutual interaction between two rivals, as the fake fish does not perform active movement, the betta may reduce the frequency and intensity of agonistic behavior [Frances: 1968]. We hypothesized that the male betta fish would present red mane at a shorter duration while facing a fake fish comparing with a real male betta fish. 

Materials and Methods:
We prepared a small aquarium which was divided into three compartments. Three male betta fish were placed in each compartment, and they have been kept visually isolated from one another for several hours with white plastic dividers. We observed the behaviors of the isolated males quietly for 5 minutes. Then two clear pieces of glass were placed between each betta fish. First we removed the opaque partition between Fish 1 and 2 for 5-minute observation. We counted the number of times Fish 1 showed red mane and the duration of each red mane to calculate the average duration. We repeated the same experiment with the other two fish and between each trial, we let the fish rest for 5 minutes. After that, we put the opaque partitions back and replaced one fish with a fake fish. We waited for another 5 minutes to let the fish rest. We repeated the same experiment between Fish 1, Fish 2 and Fish 3 with the fake fish respectively and recorded the average time. A two sample paired t-test was used to see whether there was any significant difference between the average duration of red mane between two groups.

Results:
According to our observation, when the fish were visually separated, they were more likely to stay in the corner of each compartment and there was no agonistic behavior. However, after we removed the opaque partition and as soon as both fish were facing each other, they displayed most of the agonistic behaviors including pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and especially, red mane. Also, all of the three fish started to move alongside the glass back and forth as soon as they got visual interaction with each other. Each betta fish had its own characteristics as if one had the shortest duration facing a real fish, then it had the shortest duration facing a fake fish as well. For the real fish the average duration = 15.0±11.9 and for the fake fish the average duration = 10.1±10.4. The paired t-test showed there was no significant difference between the fish facing a real fish and also facing a fake fish as shown in Fig. 1 (p = 0.166, t = 2.14, degree of freedom = 2). 

Discussion:
We rejected our hypothesis but the average duration of the fake fish was actually smaller than the duration of red mane facing another real fish. This result could be due to the habituation, known as a simple and basic form of learned modification of behavior, because the experiment was long or it could also be due to the lack of reinforcement from the fake fish could also contribute to the shorter duration of red mane[Harman: 1970]. The most possible reason of having habituation is to beneficially conserve energy. In the experiment, as the fish were getting used to the environment and if there was no physical harm on them, they would reduce their behaviors no matter if their opponent was a real fish or a fake fish so that they could save more energy for their metabolism. In addition, another reason could be there was no reinforcement as the fake fish did not move much. Even though the fake fish had similar appearance, it may lack some characteristics or consequences necessary to maintain the display at its initial level [Frances: 1968]. The fake fish was not able to present any movement in response to the real fish so that there was no reinforcement from the fake fish towards the real one which was more easily to weaken the extent of behavior. In the experiment, we used the average duration of red mane in order to weaken the effects of situations like a fish exhibiting red mane for a long time or very frequently within a short period. For further study, we could also combine other behaviors into this study as we could only use quantitative variables to study animal behavior objectively. For example, we could measure the frequency of tail beating or tail flashing as components of the aggressive display habituate at different rates [Harman: 1970]. We could combine all the changes in behavior and get a more accurate and specific result.
