Title: The Effect of pH on Photosynthetic Activity of Brassica oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is one of the most important processes in plant cells because it allows energy to be captured from the sun. Photosynthetic activity can be measured by using alternative electron carriers, which change color as activity  increases. We measured change in absorbance with a spectrophotometer to calculate percent change in Brassica oleracea chloroplasts. pH was manipulated, and our hypothesis was that chloroplasts exposed to various levels of pH will have altered levels of PS-II activity. We found a significent difference in activity in basic pH, though the highest activity was observed in neutral condition).  Plant growth can be altered by the photosynthetic rate in plants, which is affected by environmental factors such as pH. Further experimentation could be done on full-grown plants respond to change in pH in their soil.

Introduction:
In plant cells, chloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis, which is the capture and storage of energy from the sun. This energy is then used in cell respiration to generate used by the whole cell. Without a working photosynthetic process to convert energy, plants would not have the energy to power other processes necessary for life. The first step in photosynthesis are the light-dependent reactions on the thylakoid membrane. Photosystems on the thylakoid membrane transport electrons using electron carriers such as NADP+ [Trebst: 1973]. By using an alternative electron carrier, the activity of a photosystem can be measured. Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) is the electron carrier used in this experiment to measure activity of PS-II. DCIP turns from blue to colorless after being reduced because it becomes conjugated, leading to a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. This is known as the Hill reaction [Trebst: 1973]. A proton gradient is also made along the thylakoid membrane due to the transport of electrons from photosystem to photosystem. Hence, we suspect that PS-II activity could be affected in acidic or basic conditions. In  this experiment, we are examining the photosynthetic process in Brassica oleracea, collard greens. A separate study found that pH 8.9 was the optimal condition for electron transport in spinach chloroplasts [Thaler: 1973], so we are testing 2 basic conditions and 1 acidic condition compared to a neutral controll, and absorbance is measured with the spectrophotometer. Our hypothesis is that chloroplasts exposed to various levels of pH will have altered levels of PS-II activity measured by percent change in absorbance, heeded by the presence of DCIP.

Materials and Method:
We performed an enriching of chloroplasts by differential centrifugation. We ground 4 leaves of Brassica oleracea using 20 Ml grinding buffer, then centrifuged to isolate the pellet. 5 Ml were put into 4 centrifuge tubes, which were then treated with various levels of pH. The pH’s tested were 5, 7, 9, and 11. The tubes were centrifuged again, then a decolorization assay was run to observe the percent change in absorbance for each pH condition at 600 nm. 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP was added to each test tube other than the blank, along with 2 Ml of reaction buffer and 6 Ml of water, which were added to all tubes. Each pH trial was run 3 times to obtain an average absorbance, and then percent change was calculated at intervals of 10 minutes for a duration of 30 minutes. A 2-sample t_test was used to analyze the difference in percent change for each pH compared to the neutral controll.

Results:
As seen in Figure 1, pH 7 (neutral) had the highest average percent change. pH 5 was almost as high as pH 7, while pH 9 and 11 were significently lower. pH 7 served as the controll in our experiment. The 2-sample t_test yielded the following p_values per each pH trial.   pH 5 p_value: 0.276 pH 9 p_value: 0.0106 pH 11 p_value: 0.0167

Discussion:
The results provide us with sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference based on pH the mean percent change in absorbance at pH 9 and pH 11. Both p_values are below 0.05 for pH 9 and 11, which indicates that photosynthetic activity is significently different when chloroplasts are treated in basic pH. The percent change for basic pH is lower than neutral pH, so there is actually less photosynthetic activity in basic pH. While we hypothesized that photosynthesis would be affected by pH, we expected to see higher percent change for basic pH because the optimum pH range for other plants, such as barley, was estimated between 7.8 and 8.2 [Huber: 1979] This lead us to believe that basic pH treatment could increase the photosynthetic activity. However, this range is actually closer to neutral pH, which could explain why we observed that neutral pH had the highest recorded percent change. As far as the lowered activity in basic pH, it could be because we changed the pH in the stroma of the chloroplast, less protons may have been available to be pumped into the thylakoids, which would decrease photosynthetic activity. We believe the decreased percent change in basic pH absorbance could be attributed to this reason. It’s important to understand the effects of pH on photosynthesis because pH can easily be altered in a plant’s environment. Plant growth can be altered by the photosynthetic rate in plants, which is affected by environmental factors such as pH. Plant growth is important to the world because autotrophs like plants are among the only organisms able to transfer energy from the sun. It would be interesting to test how full-grown plants respond to change in pH in their soil as a next step.
