Title: The Effects of Insect Hormones

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment was to measure the weight and growth rate in accordance with JH increase in Manduca Sexta caterpillars diets. We hypothesized that the caterpillars that were fed JH would be much larger than the control group of caterpillars. It was discovered that the hypothesis was correct and that JH stifles the juvenile phase and causes caterpillars to grow at a much higher rate than they would naturally grow.

Introduction:
Insect’s growth and life stages are highly regulated by different hormone systems that regulate hormones all throughout their bodies. There are many hormones that flow inside insects, one of these hormones is the Juvenile Hormone (or JH), which controls when an insect pupates or when an insect receives the Commitment Pulse and begins to change. A similar experiment was already conducted by Roger K. Vince and Lawrence I. Gilbert where they gave Manduca Sexta JH and tried to predict the outcome (Vince, Roger K., and Lawrence I. Gilbert. "Juvenile hormone esterase activity in precisely timed last instar larvae and pharate pupae of Manduca sexta." Insect Biochemistry 7.2 (1977): 115-120.). We conducted an experiment on Manduca Sexta to see how diets (specifically diets containing JH) effected size and growth rate. I hypothesized that our 2% JH diet increase will prolong the juvenile stage and will result in large growth in the caterpillars. Also, I’m guessing that the JH fed caterpillars will be larger than the control group of caterpillars.


Materials and Methods:
	Each group of four people was given eight caterpillars, so each individual had two caterpillars. One caterpillar was made into the control group whereas the other caterpillar’s food was tinted with 2% JH. The JH amount was the independent variable in the experiment and the caterpillars were the dependent variable. For this lab, my statistical test was a T-Test because we needed to see if there was a significant difference between the two groups of caterpillars.
Control Group: Fed 10g of plain caterpillar food per week
JH Group: Fed 10g of caterpillar food per week with 2% JH added
Data was collected every day for a week and weight and color were recorded.

Results:
The red line is the JH fed caterpillar and the blue line is the control caterpillars.
Days as the X-axis and weight as the Y-axis
Each of these graphs cover a two week period with measurements taken  every day

Discussion:
My hypothesis was supported. The caterpillars with the JH diet were much larger and grew much faster than the control caterpillars. The p-value was 0.0040 so that indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so I reject the null hypothesis because there was clear physical and statistical data showing a difference between the population. Carter’s caterpillar was a relative anomaly; I do not know why his control caterpillar was larger than his JH caterpillar. Maybe he just had a hungry hungry caterpillar. It is clear the JH effects growth. The JH caterpillars were on average 3.98 grams heavier than the control caterpillars. This supports Roger K. Vince and Lawrence I. Gilbert’s experiment where they also saw increases in growth when giving different percentages of JH. An interesting topic in the future would be to determine what the optimal amount of JH would be to elicit the most growth in Manduca Sexta. We used a 2% increase in their food, but it would be interesting to consider what would happen if there was a 4% or 8% increase in the JH.
