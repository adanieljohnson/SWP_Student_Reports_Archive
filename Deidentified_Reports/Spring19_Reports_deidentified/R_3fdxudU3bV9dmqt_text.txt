Title: The Effects of Glyphosate on Photosynthesis in the species of Spinacia oleracea (spinach), Brassica oleracea var. sabellica (kale), and Brassica oleracea, var. acephala (collard greens).

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants obtain energy from light to power their functions. In this experiment we tested the effects glyphosate, the active ingredient in Round-Up, on photosynthesis, specifically if it would inhibit the reaction occurring within Photosystem II. Using DCIM decolorization and the Hill reaction measured the absorbance of an assay to determine if glyphosate is statistically significent in inhibiting the photosynthetic processes of Spinacia oleracea (spinach), Brassica oleracea var. sabellica (kale), and Brassica oleracea, var. acephala (collard greens).

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some protists, and certain bacteria obtain energy from the sun. Organelles called chloroplasts house the process of photosynthesis, more specifically, photosynthesis takes place in the protein complexes Photosystem I and Photosystem II which are located in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast [Johnson: 2016]. Using this knowledge there are a wide range of experiments that can be done to see how photosynthesis can be affected by outside factors. For example, you could test to see how pH affects photosynthesis production, or who exposure to different light sources, or herbicides will affect photosynthesis. For the purposes of this lab we tested the effect of the herbicide Round-Up which uses glyphosate as it’s active ingredient on the enriched chloroplasts from the leaves of Spinacia oleracea (spinach), Brassica oleracea var. sabellica (kale), and Brassica oleracea, var. acephala (collard greens). Round-Up should target the activity that occurs within Photosystem II where enzymes capture the light to energized electrons. We hypothesized that the greener the leafy vegetable was the more photosynthesis would occur and the less it would be inhibited by the herbicide. As kale and collard greens come from the same species, we expect them to be similarly affected by the herbicide tested. Similar studies in which glyphosate has been tested for its effects on photosynthesis have shown that in low concentrations photosynthesis is stimulated while if the concentration is higher it shows significent inhibition of photosynthesis in freshwater green alga, Scenedesmus quadricauda Berb 614 [Wong: 2000]. It should be noted the Round-Up is a type of herbicide that is commonly used in North America to kill weeds and grass and it is often marketed to safe to use around gardens and vegetables, which is why we predict that it will do little to inhibit photosynthesis in the vegetables we are testing.

Materials and Method:
We extracted the chloroplasts from three types of leafy greens. Using the leaves from spinach, kale, and collard greens respectively we removed the central vein and crushed about 4 medium leaves with a mortar and pestle in 10Ml of grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in tricine buffer pH 8) until no large chunks remained. Once that was done, we added more grinding buffer to create a slurry that was drained and then centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Once it had been centrifuged the supernatant was drained and an additional 20Ml of grinding buffer was added to resuspend the pellet. Once we had extracted and enriched the chloroplasts, we performed a Hill Reaction and DCIP decolorization. We use DCIP because the chemical starts out blue but as the bonds rearrange within the molecule the structure that determines its blue color is removed. We started with 22 test tubes labeling one as blank, and three in each of the following categories no chloroplasts, spinach no herbicide, kale no herbicide, collard greens no herbicide, spinach with herbicide, kale with herbicide, collard greens with herbicide. The blank tube had only 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Each of the tubes for the no chloroplasts and chloroplasts without herbicide contained 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml DCIP, and 2 Ml reaction buffer. Finally, in the tubes set aside for the herbicide we used 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of 1.06M glyphosate (Round-Up). One we were ready to begin the assay we add 100 micro liters of the chloroplast noted on the test tube to each tube, transferred to cuvettes and recorded the absorbances from a spectrophotometer set at 600nm. The results which you can see in Figure 1, were obtained using the average percent change of the samples at each time point, where they were tested for statistical significance using a two-sample two tailed t_test with 0.05 being the cutoff value for significance.

Results:
In order to test the effects of glyphosate on photosynthesis in the 3 types of leafy greens we performed an assay and tested the absorbance at 600nm, we then noted the absorbance at an initial time 0, the absorbance after 10 minutes after 20 minutes, and after 30 minutes for each type of green with and without herbicide. From there we were able to calculate averages and the percent change after each time the absorbance was measured, the results you see displayed in Figure 1. Using a two-sample, two-tailed t_test it was determined that collard greens is the only group to show statistical significance as it is the only one with a p_value less than 0.05. The biggest general trend from this experiment would be that when the herbicide is present production seemed to increase rather than decrease. Another trend to note is how similar the results from the spinach chloroplasts and the kale chloroplasts both when the herbicide is present and when it is not. The treatment of collard greens is interesting as the result show without herbicide present photosynthesis is not as high as it is in the samples of spinach and kale however, with glyphosate present the photosynthesis of collard greens seems to increase the most.

Discussion:
As briefly mentioned in the results our experiment shows a general trend of no inhibition from the herbicide rather than decreased production when the herbicide Round-Up is present, yet we only found statistically significent values within the results from the chloroplasts of collard greens. Although this result was not initially accounted for in our hypothesis, current scientific literature seems to be in agreement with this result. In one study where glyphosate was tested on different plants and confirms the results that glyphosate if applied in low doses can stimulate plant growth [Cedergreen: 2010]. This is confirmed by another study performed by Wong which tested glyphosate at concentration greater than 2.0M among other herbicides effects on photosynthesis in freshwater algae show that when used at a lower concentration such as the 1.06M concentration we used in this experiment, photosynthesis would be stimulated rather than inhibited [Wong: 2000]. Additional current scientific research not only confirms our results that in low doses glyphosate won’t inhibit photosynthesis but shows that it increases due to effects on the rates of carbon dioxide assimilation, stomatal conductance and transpiration [Nascentes: 2017]. One thing that was not accounted for in the planning of this experiment was that kale and collard greens have a film like cover that makes them hard to grind with mortar and pestle. While the initial hypothesis is rejected due to the lack of statistical significance shown it can be amended to say that it can be expected that with a concentration over 2M glyphosate would inhibit photosynthesis of the leafy greens used in this experiment perhaps with the greenest of the vegetables being the least inhibited. Therefore, if this experiment were to be redone it should be done either with a greater concentration of Round-Up or with a different herbicide entirely. The information gathered from this experiment is not without importance because it shows that Round-Up with the active ingredient glyphosate, increases photosynthesis in crops that we consume. As Round-Up is generally thought to be safe, farmers could potentially use the herbicide to produce better crops, however as current scientific literature shows glyphosate most be used in small doses to have this effect. In closing I would say that while we did not get the results we expected, our findings align with our current knowledge of the effects of glyphosate on photosynthesis and knowing this information has the potential to change the way farmers grow their crops.
