Title: Title: The Effects of Saltwater on the Root to Shoot Length Ratio of Raphanus sativus L.

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to determine how regularly introducing saltwater to a plant’s watering regimen impacted the root to shoot length ratio. We hypothesized that there would be a difference in the average root to shoot length ratio between radishes watered with tap water and radishes watered with saltwater. 4 total containers of radishes were used, 2 containers watered with 150 Ml of tap water and 2 with 150 Ml of saltwater. The plants were watered every other day for two weeks. At the experiment’s conclusion, there was a clear increase in the average root to shoot length ratio for radishes watered with saltwater than those watered with tap water. Statistical testing yielded significent results (t_stat = 5.508, d.f. = 18, P = 3.14E-5) that supported our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Plants are complex organisms that require many different types of chemicals, substances, and other abiotic factors in order to survive, grow, and reproduce. Sunlight, water, nitrogen, and other plant nutrients are just a few examples basic necessities that plants need. When one of these essential factors is limited or altered in a plant’s environment, the plant will alter its resource allocation techniques [Johnson AD: 2018]. This often results in the plant either increasing or decreasing the length/weight of its roots and shoots, in a process known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson AD: 2018]. Considering that water is one of, if not the most, essential nutrients in order for plants to survive, what would happen if the chemical composition of water used by plants was altered? More specifically, what would happen if plants were watered with a NaCl solution (saltwater) rather than freshwater (tap water)? According to a study completed by the Research Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility, Raphanus sativus L. (radish) plants grown at increasing salinity levels reported an increase in their tuber/shoot weight ratio [Marcellis LFM, Van Hooijdonk J: 1999]. Considering the results of this experiment, we hypothesize that there will be a difference in the root to shoot length ratio of radish plants that are watered with tap water versus those watered with saltwater. 


Materials and Method:
Four plastic containers approximately 4-6 inches in depth were filled with soil, leaving about 1 inch between the top of the soil and the brim of the container. Raphanus sativus L. (radish) seeds were generously sprinkled across the top of the soil in each container and buried approximately ½ of an inch below the surface of the soil. Two containers were designated as the controll group and were watered with 150 Ml of tap water, while the other two containers were designated as the experimental group and watered with 150 Ml of saltwater. The containers were watered every other day. After two weeks, 10 individual radish plants from each group were extracted, ensuring that the root and shoot stayed intact. The root and shoot of each radish plant were measured in centimeters, and from these measurements the root to shoot length ratio was calculated. The average root to shoot length ratio was determined for each group. These averages were tested for significance using a two tailed, two sample t_test at the 0.05 significance level. 

Results:
In the experiment, the radishes watered with saltwater experienced a higher average root to shoot length ratio than the radishes watered with tap water, as seen in figure 1. The controll group displayed an average root to shoot length ratio of 1.468 with a standard deviation of 0.385, while the experimental group reported an average root to shoot length ratio of 2.941 with a standard deviation of 0.704. The difference in average root to shoot length ratios was 1.473 units, which proved to be a significent difference upon statistical testing (t_stat = 5.508, d.f. = 18, P = 3.14E-5).

Discussion:
Considering that statistical testing yielded a p_value that was well below the 0.05 significance level, and there were observable differences in the average root to shoot length ratios for the controll and experimental groups, we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported and that there was a difference in the average root to shoot length ratio for radishes watered with tap water versus radishes watered with saltwater. These results are not surprising considering that a similar experiment conducted with Brassica Napus L. (Canola) plants resulted in an average increase in the root to shoot length ratio when exposed to salt solutions instead of pure water [Farzin A, Leila J: 2012]. One possible explanation for this phenomenon was explained in another similar study on oak seedlings that saw an inhibition of root growth in plants that were exposed to salty conditions, therefore increasing the root to shoot length ratio in these seedlings. It was noted that an explanation for this result was possibly due to the fact that the plant decreased resource allocation to its roots in order to prevent the translocation of salt ions to the shoot [Epron D, Toussaint M, Badot P: 1999]. These findings are significent for researchers that are tasked with formulating new and improved fertilizers in order to maximize beneficial plant growth. More testing should be done with varying concentrations of saltwater, in concert with other vital plant chemicals (nitrogen, phosphorous, etc.) in attempt to determine any possible beneficial chemical combinations. By testing multiple chemical combinations/concentrations, plant growth can be maximized to bear more edible products thus assisting in alleviating worldwide starvation issues.
