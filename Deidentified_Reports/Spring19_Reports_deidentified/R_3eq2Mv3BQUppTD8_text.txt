Title: The Effect of Ecdysterone Production on the Weight of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
Hormones are essentially chemical messengers that influence growth and functions within an organism. Varying certain hormones in specific organisms can show the effect of those hormones and how they may be used and manipulated to produce a variety of desired outcomes within that organism. In the experiment the main goal was to determine whether or not adding ecdysterone inhibitor to the Manduca Sexta’s food would affect the growth rate compared to just adding water to the food of the Manduca Sexta. Ecdysterone is the hormone that is responsible for the timing of when the Manduca Sexta molts and pupates. Ecdysterone can be seen as having this function because when the Manduca Sexta is about to pupate a large rise in ecdysterone levels is seen. The major results from the experiment were that the null hypothesis was failed to be rejected and the alternative hypothesis was rejected. The data shows that there was no significance between the growth rate of the experimental and controll groups. The controll group grew much better than the experimental group which was not expected. It was expected that ecdysterone would cause premature pupation in the growth of the caterpillar since the levels only rise when close to pupation. The logic was that if high testosterone levels were present in 

Introduction:
The general biology being evaluated during experimentation was the addition of Ecdysterone inhibitor into the Manduca Sexta’s diet, resulting in higher ecdysterone levels in the organism itself. The focus of study in the experiment was to see how the growth of the Manduca Sexta was impacted by the addition of ecdysterone inhibitor its diets. The Manduca Sexta is also known as a tobacco hornworm caterpillar. The life cycle of the Manduca Secta, from egg to adult month, usually ranges from around 30 to 45 days. Since the Manduca Sexta is a caterpillar that goes through larval stages to pupation before becoming an adult moth, the caterpillar has a lot of hormones that help trigger certain needed bodily responses. The hormone focused on during experimentation was Ecdysterone, which is secreted by groups of cells in the prothoracic glands. Ecdysterone levels in the caterpillar primarily controll when the caterpillar is ready to molt. Levels of ecdysterone seem to peak before the molting and then suddenly drop to non-detectable levels [Locke: 1997].  The biological question being asked in experimentation is will the feeding and movement behavior of the Manduca Sexta change when ecdysterone levels are varied? Knowing the impact of the variation of ecdysterone levels on the caterpillar can let scientists know how to slow or stimulate the growth and development of the caterpillar if needed. In the model system, the caterpillar's diet will have additional ecdysterone inhibitor compared to caterpillars with a normal food source. It is expected that if the caterpillars have additional ecdysterone inhibitor in their diet, then the growth of the caterpillar will be different than the caterpillars with a normal food source.


Materials and Method:
Before experimentation, two four-quadrant boxes were each poked with two holes in each quadrant to give fresh air to the caterpillars while they were tested. During experimentation, there was a controll group which consisted both consisted of four caterpillars, one in each quadrant of the box. The controll group and experimental group varied in what was added to their food source. For the controll group, seven drops of deionized water were added to 10 grams of caterpillar food. For the experimental group, seven drops of ecdysterone inhibitor were added to 10 grams of caterpillar food. There was 10 grams of food in each cell for the controll and experimental group. Both the controll group and the experimental group were kept under the same conditions. The weights of the caterpillars were observed for two weeks. The caterpillars were weighed in grams using an electronic balance, and the weights were recorded. The caterpillar's cells were cleaned when there were large amounts of waste. Food was replaced when low, and the appropriate drops of water/ecdysterone inhibitor were added depending on the caterpillar. To analyze the data, a two-tailed two-sample t_test was used. This statistical test was used to determine the difference in growth rate between the controll group and the experimental group.


Results:
The mean weight for the caterpillars in the controll group was 4.51g, and the mean weight for the caterpillars in the experimental group was 1.43g (Table 1). The mean growth rate for the controll group was 0.2649g, and the mean growth rate for the experimental group was 0.0575g (Table 2). The p_value for this experiment was 0.1021, which is greater than 0.05, showing that the data between the weights of the controll group and the experimental group was insignificent leading to rejection in the alternative hypothesis (Table 3). From the beginning of experimentation, the caterpillars with the ecdysterone inhibitor present in their diet ate much less and weighed much less than the controll group. As time when on the movement of the experimental group was also much less than the controll group. Towards the end of experimentation, two of the caterpillars in the controll group were starting to pupate, while the caterpillars with added ecdysterone showed minimal movement and weight gain. General trends seen through experimentation were that the experimental group ate, moved, and weighed less than the controll group.


Discussion:
The hypothesis, that if ecdysterone inhibitor is added to the Manduca Sexta’s food source, then the growth rate of the Manduca Sexta would be affected, was not supported. The statistical tests gave a P-value of 0.1021, which is greater than 0.05, suggesting the difference between the weights of the controll group and the experimental group was insignificent leading to the rejection of the alternative hypothesis. General trends through experimentation consisted of the controll group outweighing the experimental group. The reasoning for this could have been that introducing ecdysterone prematurely does not leady to pupation right away; the hormone must naturally occur for pupation to occur. It can also be assumed that levels in weight trigger the release of ecdysterone in the caterpillar, due to caterpillars only pupating once heavy. One subject that could have skewed the data of the experiment was subject “C4”. C4 was a controll caterpillar who did not seem to grow at all while the other three controll caterpillars grew quite well. C4 could have been an oddball in the experiment forcing the data to be slightly skewed and the statistical results to be different than what they should have been. The overall data from the lab suggests that addition of ecdysterone to the Manduca Sexta regulates its growth. The presence of ecdysterone is supposed to prevent hormones from causing a switch in the differentiative program from larval to pupal or from pupil to adult.[Riddiford: 2003]. This suggests that the artificial introduction of this hormone could affect transition stages for the caterpillar, possibly why no caterpillars in the experimental group pupate. The controll group was able to grow steadily and in some cases even pupate while the experimental group weighed much less than the controll group throughout experimentation. The controll group went through constant growth, and the experimental group began to grow and then started to flatline and then even slightly decrease.
