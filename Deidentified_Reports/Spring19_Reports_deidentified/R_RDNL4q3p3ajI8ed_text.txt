Title: The impacts of creatine on the muscle threshold level of Rania pipiens 

Abstract:
Understanding how the neuromuscular systems works and can be altered is important to help us understand how animals react and interact with their environment. Recent research has looked at how solutions, such as caffeine, can be injected to the muscle to change the muscle threshold voltage. Our experiment hypothesizes that if we inject the gastronomic muscle of a frog (Rania pipiens) with the workout solution Creatine, then there will be a change in threshold voltage compared to the controll trial. We recorded the controll threshold voltage and the threshold voltage after Creatine injection with an electromyogram. We analyzed the data using a paired t_test. After analysis, we determined our hypothesis was not supported and that further experimentation is needed to reject the null hypothesis. Further research on the effects of workout solutions on muscle contractions will help us better our understanding on how our bodies react to the environment and how we can alter these responses with external substances. 


Introduction:
Neuromuscular controll is important for animals because it allows them to react and interact with their environment. It is comprised of both the muscular system and the nervous system. Skeletal muscles have a complex structure and are composed of myofibers.  Myofibers are a cylindrical, aggregates of cells that have both actin, a thin filament protein, and myosin, thick filament protein [Frontera: 2015]. Motor neurons connect to muscles at the neuromuscular junction. When a nerve is stimulated it releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction to depolarize the muscle. The sliding filament theory states that when the muscle is depolarized, calcium is released into the myofiber and causes actin to get pulled and slide over the myosin resulting in the shortening of the myofiber to cause full muscle contraction [Squire: 2016]. Muscle contraction does not occur if the muscle does not reach threshold and depolarizes. The term threshold refers to the lowest amount of stimulation that a muscle will depolarize and produce a contraction [Squire: 2016]. We can measure threshold through the use of an electromyogram. The electromyogram allows you to stimulate the muscle or a neuron through voltage shocks that can be altered in strength. The threshold for muscle contraction can be increased or decreased by many different solutions like: saline, nicotine and aMlodipine. Previous studies have looked at how these solutions impact the gastronomic muscle contraction of a Rania pipiens. For example, in one study it was found that by injecting caffeine into the muscle, the threshold of the muscle was lowered and a longer/stronger contraction was produced [Behrens: 2015]. An Rania pipiens is ideal to use in experiments like this because it behaves in the same manner as a human muscle, helping findings to generalize to humans. Rania pipiens also have a very prominent sciatic nerve that innervates the gastrocnemus muscle and is easy to stimulate using an electromyogram. Although many studies have looked at the effect of different solutions on muscle contractions, few have studied the effect of workout supplements on human contractions. Supplements such as Creatine are promoted to the public to help stimulate muscle strength and growth; with no understanding of the direct effect on the muscle. This stimulates the question of how does Creatine affect muscle contraction. With this question in mind we developed an experiment where the threshold voltage was recorded before and after Creatine injection. We hypothesized that, if we electrically stimulate the gastronomic muscle of a Rania pipiens after the injection of Creatine then there will be a change the muscle’s threshold level. 

Materials and Method:
We randoMly selected three different legs harvested from the Rania pipiens. Each leg will experience both the controll and experimental conditions. The first data set was taken from the muscle exposed to no manipulation. This group acted as a controll comparison group to our experimental manipulation group. The second data set was taken from the same three legs after they were injected with Creatine. To begin the process, we skinned the leg of the Rania pipiens, separated the gastrocnemus muscle from the lower half of the leg and exposed the sciatic nerve. Second, we attached the leg to an electromyography machine to and placed two electrodes on the sciatic nerve to stimulate muscle contraction. We used a computer program to discover and record the voltage levels of muscle contraction threshold in the controllled condition. For the third step of discovering the threshold, we started to stimulate the muscles at .00mV and increased the voltage by a hundredth of a millivolt until an action potential was detected. Once the controll threshold was detected we injected the gastronomes muscle with three milliliters and waited three minutes for the solution to take effect in the muscle. We then repeated the three steps for detecting the threshold and recorded the voltage from the manipulation group. After the data was gathered, we calculated the differences between the threshold voltages. Finally, a paired t_test was used to determine if there was a significance difference between the voltage of muscle threshold with no manipulation and after an injection of Creatine.  

Results:
The controll group possessed a mean threshold voltage of 0.09 mV while the experimental group possessed a mean threshold voltage of 0.11 mV (Figure 1). The standard deviation of the threshold voltage for the controll group was 0.09 and the standard deviation for the experimental group was 0.08 (Figure 2). We used a within subject paired t_test to analyze the results.  There was no significent difference in threshold voltage between Creatine injection (M = 0.11, SD = 0.08) and non-Creatine injection (M = 0.09, SD = 0.06, MDiff = 0.02, SDDiff = .03), t_stat = 0.95, d.f. = 2, P = 0.444. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that after the injection of Creatine in the muscle there would be a difference in muscle threshold, was not supported. Our recorded p_value indicates that our results were not statistically significent and were largely due to probable chance. We should retain our null hypothesis that Creatine has no effect on muscle threshold level. Many factors may contribute to these insignificent findings. One possible explanation is that there was too much solution injected into the muscle, inhibiting its' function. Another possible explanation is that we did not have a long enough wait period between injection and retesting; the solution did not have enough time to diffuse across the muscle. The alternate explanations for the insignificent findings are supported by previous studies. For example, one study addressed the effects of creatine that was administered orally on the muscle resistance to fatigue [Coelho: 2017].  The study by Coelho and others found that creatine significently increased muscle resistance to fatigue. These results suggest that injection of a creatine solution may not impact the muscle and it also suggest that muscle threshold was not an ideal operational measure. However, our insignificent results are important to note because it is a preliminary study for determining the effects of Creatine on muscle contraction. It provides a starting point for future studies on injection of creatine and effects on muscle threshold. Further research is important because it helps us to better understand the impact of Creatine and other workout supplements have on our body. It will allow us to see if the supplement actually helps or is just a placebo. Future studies will also help better our understanding of how our bodies react to our environment and how this reaction time can be altered.
