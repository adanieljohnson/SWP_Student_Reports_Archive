Title: Effect of Caffeine on Muscle Contraction Amplitude

Abstract:
Animals use hormones and nerves to produce responses that allow their bodies to react to their environment. When nerves are stimulated, muscle contractions occur and progress through a typical contraction cycle. In order to view contractions, three frog legs were dissected and hooked up to a probe to stimulate contractions. After data was recorded, each leg was injected with 0.2 Ml of 200 millimolar Caffeine in order to test the period of amplitude of the contractions. The idea was that the treatment group would produce a greater period of amplitude than the controll group. The statistical data did not support the hypothesis and showed that the treatment group did not have a significently greater period of amplitude on average. 


Introduction:
All organisms have hormones that controll chemical processes in the body. However, only animals have nerves as well as hormones. When combined together, animals are able to sense the environment that they are in and react to their internal and external interactions. The neuromuscular system is able to respond within milliseconds to produce a reaction. Within an animal, millions of myofibers work together to create the skeletal muscular system. The myofibers form together by connective tissues, making up the skeletal muscles proper. When a nerve is stimulated, a muscle contraction occurs due to the excitation-contraction coupling process. By using a myogram from hooking up a muscle to a force transducer, a muscle’s entire cycle of contraction may be seen and analyzed. There are three main sections of a muscle contraction: latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase. The latent period is a very brief stage between when the signal is fired and when the muscle actually contracts, occurring for approximately 10 milliseconds. When the muscle contracts, it shortens based off of chemical changes that quickly occur within the muscle. Once the muscle has reached its maximum contraction point, relaxation occurs and the muscle returns to its normal length. In order to view muscular contractions, researches took a first step in using frog legs that were dissected and hooked up to a stimulator, and recorded through the online program iWorx EP to view and analyze the three phases of contraction [Johnson: 2018]. When exposed to caffeine, there is an increase in Calcium, which produces a stronger and longer contraction, as well as delays the release time as the rate of decay of Calcium in the muscles. This delay causes tetany to occur in the muscles [Fryer: 1989]. To advance the process and test effects of stimulators, when three frog legs are injected with caffeine, the added caffeine should produce an amplitude that is longer than the amplitude of the controll group. 

Materials and Method:
Three different frog legs were used in order to evaluate the effects that 0.2 Ml of 200 millimolar injected caffeine would have on the amplitude of contractions of each leg. To begin, each leg was worked on one at a time. The leg was placed in a dissecting pan in order to properly work with the leg. The skin at the top of the leg was pulled down towards the foot, removing the outer layer of skin and exposing the muscle and bone. The gastrocnemus muscle was separated and the bottom portion as well as the achilles tendon were cut, leaving the gastrocnemus in tact with the knee. A string was attached to the achilles tendon and attached to a hook, creating a 90 degree angle with the rest of the leg, which was held down with pins. A probe was poked into the gastrocnemus and hooked up to the iWorx EP program in order to measure the period of amplitude of the contractions. The program was set so the amplitude was 1, the pulse was 3, and the Hz was 0.5. These settings were chosen in order to keep a controll steady between all of the legs and to have enough data to record from each leg. After the period of amplitude was measured for the controll leg, 0.2 Ml of caffeine was injected directly into the gastrocnemus muscle and the contraction began immediately. The same process was repeated with the other two legs, with the controll of each being the normal legs, and the treatment being the legs after they were injected with caffeine. In order to test the results once the experiment was completed, the paired t_test was used because each leg served as both a controll and treatment after the caffeine was injected. This made the paired t_test the most accurate to compare the data of the period of the amplitude of contraction. 


Results:
Observations showed that, in general, the frog legs injected with caffeine had a much larger value for the period of amplitude. The treatment group, at an average of 0.884 +/- 0.0729, showed a larger difference in the amplitude than the controll group, at an average of 0.572 +/- 0.212, as shown in Figure 1. Based on the paired t_test, the sample was not significently different as data showed (t-value = 2.586, d.f. = 2, p_value = 0.123). When looking at each individual frog leg before and after the injection of caffeine, all of the legs produced a greater number of volts when comparing the amplitudes. Although each leg began at a different amplitude, all of the amplitudes increased after the addition of caffeine. When injected with caffeine, there was a visible difference in the texture of the muscle. The muscle became very hard and sustained that position for an extended period of time. 

Discussion:
Based on the t_test results of greater than 0.05, the experiment failed to reject the null hypothesis, so the difference in results was not statistically significent. There was not enough of a significent difference to determine that caffeine injected into the gastrocnemus had effect on the amplitude of the contractions. The hypothesis that the amplitude would be larger was not supported by the data collected. According to other studies performed by researchers, the increase in Calcium would induce a sustained contraction, producing tetany, with slow decay in the presence of Calcium, meaning a slow decrease in contraction [Fryer: 1989]. The results from this experiment seemed to produce a similar result. Each of the frog legs went into a tetany induced state of contraction, as shown by the amplitudes of the treatment group; however, the results must not have shown enough of a difference in the amplitude of contraction compared to the controll group to support the null hypothesis. In the future, the same experiment should be done more with more frog legs to be able to see if further directions can support the hypothesis that the period of amplitude would be increased after caffeine is injected.

Figure 1. The average of the periods of amplitudes between the controll and treatment group. The treatment group had a greater average of amplitudes than the controll group. The error bars represent standard deviation among the numbers that went into the averages, but the statistics show that the results were not statistically significent.
