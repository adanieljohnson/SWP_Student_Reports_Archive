Title: Effects of AzaGuard on the Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
As the life cycle of Manduca sexta can be viewed as stages passage by molting and metamorphosis that controllled by hormones, it is important to study the effects of different reagent that regulates its growth. The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effects of AzaGuard, a kind of IGR, on the growth of Manduca sexta. This experiment sets the presence of AzaGuard as independent variable and the lengths and weights of caterpillars as dependent variable in order to operationally define the growth of caterpillars. Two-sample t tests are conducted for both changes in lengths and weights, which indicates the inhibiting role that AzaGuard plays on the growth of Manduca sexta. However, this experiment cannot determine the exact alternation of physiology on Manduca sexta and accompany with rearing and systematic errors. Therefore, further study needs to be done to determine the specific effect of AzaGuard on the growth of Manduca sexta.

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, months, and skippers. The development of controllled laboratory rearing techniques and its large size have promoted this insect as a general representative for many biological studies [Reinecke: 1980]. 

Manduca sexta undergoes holometabolous life cycle that constitutes by four life stages: embryo, larvae (1st to 5th instar), pupa, and adult. In order to passage from one life stage to the next, Manduca sexta experiences molting. Such development of life cycle and other physiological behaviors are based on both hormone and neuron signaling, which requires the coordination of the brain and endocrine gland. Therefore, the life cycle of Manduca sexta can be viewed as a series of hormonally silent periods that trigger molting and metamorphosis [Safranek: 1980]. There are two major hormones, Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH), determine the time and type of molting during development. Normally, up to the 4th larvae instar, JH level stays high and starts to drop at the end of 4th larvae instar along with a temporary rise of 20E. During the 5th larvae instar, JH drops to lower level and 20E occurs a smaller rise called commitment pulse. It indicates that the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate. However, if the relative level of either hormone is disturbed during the larvae stage of the insect, whether or not the caterpillar will pupate is affected [Liu: 2009]. As a result, the hormone effects on the development of the caterpillar raises the question that if certain regulation of the hormone will impact the physiology of Manduca sexta. 

Due to the negative impacts of pests, there has been an emerging approach to adversely affects the growth and development of pests by using substances called Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) in order to controll its increasing number [Tunaz: 2004]. Previous researches suggested that its effect has been significent although these substances lack of properties of current controll agents such as toxicity [Staal: 1975]. Hence, our experiment wants to investigate: what are the effects of AzaGuard, a 3% Azadirachtin formulated IGR, on the growth of Manduca sexta at larvae stages? Based on the past effects of IGR on the development of caterpillar, our experiment set the biological null hypothesis as AzaGuard has no effect on the growth of Manduca sexta; and biological alternative hypothesis as AzaGuard has effects on the growth of Manduca sexta. In order to observe whether or not the growths of caterpillars are affected, lengths and weights are examined. Accordingly, for statistical hypothesis, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the average values of lengths and weights between groups of caterpillars with AzaGuard and the groups without AzaGuard; and the alternative hypothesis is there are difference between average values of lengths and weights between groups of caterpillars with AzaGuard and the groups without AzaGuard. 


Materials and Method:
First, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing from 0.2 to 0.6 grams (g) and from 25 to 30 millimeters (mm) long at larvae stages were randoMly selected as the treatment group, and another eight caterpillars weighing from 0.5 to 1.2 and from 35 to 45 long were as the controll group. Second, each caterpillar was reared separately in 4 four-cell containers with lids, which were punctured with 2 holes on the wall of each cell, allowing air flows. Then, 8 packs of 10 g food are weighed for each caterpillar for both the controll group and treatment group. With a transfer pipet, each pack of food for the treatment group was added 6 drops of AzaGuard. After that, we placed the food in to corresponding cells and keep the food in a big clump, which helps the food to stay moist. Last, we kept track of the lengths and weights for caterpillars every day and recorded the data. Besides, we checked the food to make sure they were not dry and replaced the old food with new 10 g blob using the same treatment before when it was dried out. The material used in our experiments are 4 four-cell containers, 4 lids, sharpie, hole tool, food, spoon, square container, scale, transfer pipets, and AzaGuard reagent. A two-sample t test was used afterward to compare the mean change of length and weight for Manduca sexta.

Results:
The two-sample t test conducted for lengths shows that the mean difference in length for controll group is 23 mm with standard deviation of 5.34 and standard error of 2.31; the mean difference in length for treatment (AzaGuard) group is 0.75 mm with standard deviation of 10.38 and standard error of 3.22 (Figure 1.). The two-tailed p_value is calculated as 9.59E-5 (degrees of freedom =14, t-value = 5.39). For weights, the mean difference equals to 4.92 g for controll group with standard deviation of 0.58 and standard error of 0.76; and the mean difference for treatment (AzaGuard) group is 0.24 with standard deviation of 0.37 and standard error of 0.62 (Figure 2.). The resulting two-tailed p_value equals to 1.95E-11 (degrees of freedom = 14, t-value =19.14). The general trend of data showed in Figure 1. indicates the relatively small change in length for treatment group, even negative numbers appear, which represents decreasing in lengths for particular caterpillars. Figure 2. also indicates similar trends in weights as Figure 2. shows. Besides the statistical data, the eight samples of caterpillars for our treatment group were all dead at the end of the second week. 

Discussion:
According to the p_values suggested by both two-sample t test for lengths and weights, there are statistical significances for both the mean difference of lengths and weights.  These data help us reject our null hypothesis that AzaGuard has no effect on the growth of Manduca sexta and support the alternative hypothesis that AzaGuard has an effect on the growth of Manduca sexta. Furthermore, by comparing the direction of change for both length and weight of Manduca sexta, we can conclude that AzaGuard has an inhibiting effect on its growth since the changes in treatment group are significently smaller than the controll group. 
Since AzaGuard is a certain type of IGR, the results of our experiment correspond to previous researches that IGR adversely affects insects by regulating or inhibiting specific chemical pathways essential for the development of insects. The deaths of caterpillars can also be explained that the explosion of such chemical compound causes the regulation of hormone mediated cell development according to past experiment. Our results can also be alternatively interpreted that AzaGuard may mimic JH or 20E, which altered the late development stage of Manduca sexta larvae, because most currently known IGR compounds are substances that either block or over-activate processes regulated by JHs, 20Es and other insect hormones [Tunaz: 2004]. However, our experiment was unable to determine the causation of growth inhibition, thus conducting further experiment focusing on the functions of AzaGuard that alternate the physiology or biochemistry for Manduca sexta is necessary. 

Moreover, our experiment still consisted errors that should be modified when conducting the experiment again. Although the results suggest a large significent difference between mean growth of controll group and treatment group, errors that occurred in rearing the caterpillars are likely to facilitate such difference. Because our group did not change the food for caterpillars for several days, the dry food might prevent caterpillars from eating the food, thus making them hard to grow larger. Besides, systematic error such as the environment factors may act as confounding variables for this experiment, so further study should address environmental factor like temperature in order to determine the exact statistical significance that AzaGuard has [Tunaz: 2004]. As a result, the experiment should be done again with careful rearing procedures in order to increase the validity of this experiment. 

In conclusion, our experiment procedure should be modified, and further study should be conducted to explore the altered physiology of Manduca sexta exerted by AzaGuard. In this way, the function of AzaGuard can be fully understand, thus applying into real-life experience, such as regulating the growth of pests and so on.
