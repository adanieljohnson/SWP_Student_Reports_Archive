Title: Effects of Increased Soil Nitrogen Quantity on Root:Shoot Ratios in Secale cereale

Abstract:
The growth of plants is largely influenced by resource availability, and the allocation of those resources to different structures within an organism. Phenotypic plasticity is the embodiment of the change in growth over time in response to changing environmental conditions, and optimal partitioning theory deducts that in response to differences in resource availability, plants will adjust the allotment of biomass to procure their most limited resource. In this experiment, we analyzed the phenotypic plasticity of Secale cereale (Rye) plants in response to increased soil nitrogen content. Our hypothesis that plants grown in soil with more nitrogen, the experimental group, would have a smaller root:shoot ratio than plants grown in soil with no added nitrogen was supported by our data. After two weeks of watering the control group with 100mg of water and the experimental group with 50mg water/50mg Miracle Grow daily, our data showed an average root:shoot ratio for both mass and length to be smaller in the experimental group. 


Introduction:
Resource allocation in plants concerns the way plants utilize available resources; specifically, where they disperse energy in the growth of structures like roots, shoots, and leaves. Since a plant will not have the perfect environmental conditions for growth in any ecosystem, it has to make trade-offs in the prioritization of certain areas over others. Although the allocation of resources is genetically determined, external conditions and limiting factors have influence in a plant’s response as well. This change in growth pattern over time based on environmental conditions is called phenotype plasticity [Biology 113 Lab Manual: 2019]. 
This experiment evaluates the influence of soil nitrogen quantity on the root:shoot ratio of Secale cereale (Rye). Assessing the root:shoot ratio will demonstrate the relative allocation of biomass in Rye plants grown in soil without added nitrogen and with added nitrogen (in the form of Miracle Grow). “In general, when nutrient availability increases, plants allocate relatively less to their roots, which is consistent with a resource optimization hypothesis as increasing nutrient availability means that less effort is required to acquire this resource” [Agren: 2003]. With the concept of resource optimization in mind, my hypothesis is that Rye plants grown in soil with more nitrogen will have a smaller root:shoot ratio than the same plants grown in soil with less nitrogen. 


Materials and Methods:
Rye seeds were planted in 4 total pots of vermiculite; 2 were labelled as the control group, and 2 as the experimental group. All of the pots were placed in a greenhouse for 2 weeks, and watered daily. The control group was watered with 100mg of water, and the experimental group with 50mg water/50mg Miracle Grow (nitrogen). At the end of the 2 weeks, we measured root and shoot weight/length in the control group and then in the experimental group (measurements came from 10 plants in each group, 5 from each pot). In order to obtain these measurements, a plastic container was filled with water, and gently separated each individual plant from the soil. Each plant was washed, and then their roots and shoots were carefully separated at the same point in each individual. We then weighed and measured each root and shoot, and recorded the corresponding mass/length. An unpaired one-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine the differences in average root:shoot ratios (length and weight) of Rye plants grown with the addition of Miracle Grow (nitrogen) compared to plants grown with no added nitrogen. 


Results:
Our results show that the average root:shoot ratio of Rye plants grown with added nitrogen was smaller than that of the control group. The mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of the control plants was 1.10g, compared to 0.81g in the experimental group. The average root:shoot ratio for length in the control group was 1.08g, and 0.87g in the experimental. The standard deviations for mass in the control and experimental groups, respectively, were 0.284 and 0.1203. For length, the standard deviation for the control group was 0.268, and 0.095 for the experimental group (Fig 1). We used an unpaired one tailed t-test to analyze our results. The mean of the length in the experimental group was significantly different than the length of the control group (t-value = 2.3078, df = 18, P-value = 0.0166). The mean of the weight in the experimental group was also significantly different than that of the control group (t-value = 2.979, df = 18, P-value = 0.008). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that Secale cereale (Rye) plants grown in soil with higher nitrogen content would have a smaller root:shoot ratio than the same plants growing in soil with less nitrogen was supported by our results. We observed a significant statistical difference in both mean length and weight at the 0.05 level. This is explained by the critical nature of nitrogen to plant growth in general. In a study done regarding the effect of nitrogen supply on Zea mays (corn) and Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf) growth, similar results were obtained. “The root:shoot ratio decreased over time for both corn and velvetleaf as a result of normal plant growth and as N supply increased” [Bonifas, 2005]. Bonifas explains these results with optimal partitioning theory, which “predicts that, in response to a resource gradient, plants will optimize overall growth rate by making all resources equally limiting and adjust their biomass partitioning patterns to obtain the most limiting resource. Plants that encounter limited nutrient or water supply are expected to partition more biomass to their roots and less to their stems and leaves” [Bonifas, 2005]. Thus, plants that encounter more than sufficient nutrient supply would be expected to have a smaller root:shoot ratio - as seen in the Rye plants in this experiment with increased soil nitrogen content.
