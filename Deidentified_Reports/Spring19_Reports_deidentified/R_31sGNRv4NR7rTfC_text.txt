Title: The effects of Nitrogen on the Root to Shoot ratio of Fagopryum esculentum

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an important topic in conservation biology. Nitrogen in particular is a resource found in soil that will cause plants to reallocate themselves with respect to it. Here we look at the effect of nitrogen on the growth patterns of the root and shoot tissues of Fagopyrum esculentum. The expectation was that the root to shoot length and weight ratios would be much greater in plants grown in a nitrogen rich environment compared to plants grown in more standard soil. Our data showed a significant difference in both the length root to shoot ratio, and the  weight root to shoot ratio. The differences observed with our observation of shorter roots per plant grown in nitrogen rich environments, suggests that in response to a more nutrient rich soil, F. esculentum grows shorter roots in an attempt to harvest more nutrients from the nutrient rich soil. This adaptation shows a beneficial change in resource allocation that allows F. esculentum to best thrive in a changing environment. 

Introduction:
In nature, resources are limited. Water, healthy soil, and even sunlight are fixed quantities for plants. In order to maximize the amount of resources a plant receives, it will allocate energy and metabolic resources among their different parts [Johnson: 2016]. For example, a plant will have a shorter root system if there is more water nearby or the soil is richer [Johnson: 2016]. The plant has shorter roots because it does not need longer roots to absorb more nutrients. Nitrogen is the biggest influencer of how a plant allocates its resources [Johnson: 2016]. In previous experiments, nitrogen has been observed to decrease the length of the root system [Agren: 2003]. The way a plant responds to nitrogen in the soil is by allocating less resources to its roots, thus letting the plant grow taller and therefore changing its root to shoot ratio (R:S ratio). The R:S ratio is defined as the length of the root of the plant divided by the stem, or shoot of the plant [Johnson: 2016]. This experiment was designed to observe the relationship between the amount of nitrogen available to the plant, and the R:S ratio. The presence of nitrogen in the soil of the plant would decrease the R:S ratio for weight and length of the plants by making the plant allocate less of its resources to its roots and less to the stem.

Materials and Methods:
Using F. esculentum, we planted seeds into four separate trays containing regular soil. Two of the trays acted as a control group, and the other two were our experimental group. Each of the two trays for the control group were watered with 100 ml of distilled water. The water was measured out in a beaker. This process was repeated everyday for two weeks. For the experimental groups, we repeated the process but the distilled water was substituted for water mixed with 50 ml miracle grow, a substance containing high amounts of nitrogen that is primarily used for plant growth. We then measured out to 100 ml with a beaker. At the end of two weeks, we uprooted the buckwheat from the soil, washed off the dirt, and picked five samples from each of the four trays. We then took the 10 experimental plants and 10 control plants and separated the root from the remainder of the plant using scissors. The weight of the roots and the shoots were measured using a scale and recorded. We then measured out the roots in centimeters and repeated the process for the shoots, stopping the measurement where the shoot parted to form leaves. Using the data, we calculated the R:S ratio for each plant and found the mean R:S ratio for the weight and length of the experimental and controlled groups. We then calculated the standard deviation of each mean. A one-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine differences in the mean root:shoot ratios, lengths and weights of the buckwheat grown with the distilled water compared to the buckwheat grown with the nitrogen rich solution.

Results:
The mean and standard deviation of the R:S ratio for the weight of the control group was .04 +/- .048 , and the mean and standard deviation of the R:S ratio for the weight of the experimental group was .49 +/- .306  (Fig. 1). The mean and standard deviation of the R:S ratio for the length of the control group was .486 +/- .160, and the mean and standard deviation of the R:S ratio for the length of the experimental group was 1.486 +/- .492 (Fig. 1). We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results. When the plants were observed on the final day, the control group had noticeably larger stems and leaves than the experimental group.This observation was confirmed by the results, which showed that the mean of the R:S ratio for the weight of the control group was significantly different from the mean of the R:S ratio for the weight of the experimental group (T-value = 4.587, df = 18, p-value = .000229). The results also showed that the mean of the R:S ratio for the length of the control group was significantly different from the mean of the R:S ratio for the length of the experimental group (T-value = 6.105, df = 18, p-value = .00001). 

Discussion:
Based on these results,we can conclude there was a significant difference between the control and experimental groups. However, the directionality of the significance was the opposite of what was originally expected. This means that our findings showed that the plants had on average, larger root to shoot ratios in the experimental groups. These results are not consistent with our initial hypothesis that the exposure of nitrogen would cause the R:S ratio to increase via a larger root system. Past experiments testing the relationship between the R:S ratio and the amount of nitrogen present in the soil found results that were consistent with the original hypothesis proposed, by measuring R:S ratio of plants receiving nitrogen using formulas and comparing them to a control group using the same formulas [Agren: 2003]. Our results are inconsistent with past studies on the subject, so more experimentation is needed.
