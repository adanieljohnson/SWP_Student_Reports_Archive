Title: The Effect of Singular and Multiple Imitation Fish on Agonistic behaviors in Betta splendens

Abstract:
This study was designed to examine agonistic behavioral responses to increasing numbers of stimuli. Betta splendens were exposed to plastic imitation fish, and the duration of the red mane facing display was measured to determine the intensity of their response. However, the hypothesis that they would display longer in the presence of two as opposed one or no imitation fish was not supported. This is possibly due to the fact that the imitation fish were unresponsive, providing no social cues to the living fish, and it would be energetically inefficient to threaten an unresponsive opponent. 

Introduction:
Communication between animals of the same species, or intraspecific behavior [Johnson:2018], is as complex and diverse as animal species themselves. Sometimes, this takes the form of agonistic, or aggressive behavior [Johnson:2018]. Male Betta splendens, or siamese fighting fish, are excellent subjects with which to study such behavior, due to their dramatic agonistic response to other males [Johnson:2018, Johnson:1973] These displays can be divided into two types, broadside and facing, and involve the spreading, beating, and flashing of fins and tails. However, one of the most extreme behaviors, often called the red mane, entails the opening of the opercula (gill covers) and the extension of the branchiostegal membrane [Johnson:2018]. In this experiment, three Betta splendens males were exposed to, first one, and then two imitation fish that resembled their own species. It was hypothesized that the duration of the red mane display would be longer when individuals were exposed to two imitation fish.  

Materials and Methods:
The subjects of this experiment were three male Betta splendens in separate, identical tanks divided by opaque barriers. The individuals were exposed to three treatments for three minutes each, with a 10 minute rest period in between while the other fish were being observed. The control was simply the fish by itself. The two experimental treatments included the presence of a plastic imitation betta in the tank, and then the presence of two simultaneously. After three minutes, the stimuli were removed. To quantify the agonistic behavior of the fish, the duration of the red mane display for each of the treatments was measured in seconds. The data from each individual was averaged. To analyze this data an ANOVA test was then performed. 

Results:
The mean durations of the red mane for the control group, the first treatment group, and the second treatment group respectively were 7.33 seconds, 7.31 seconds, and 1.67 seconds. The calculated p value was 0.717, with insignificant Tukey-Kramer test results for each group. Thus, it was not evident that any treatment group (no exposure to stimulus, one imitation fish, or two imitation fish, as shown in figure 1) demonstrated a significantly longer red mane duration than another group. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the duration of the red mane display in Betta splendens would increase when individuals were exposed to an increasing number of imitation fish is not supported. Whether the fish were alone or exposed to one or two plastic imitation Betta splendens, the duration of their aggressive displays remained constant. However, according to previous experiments, this species is more likely to react to a moving stimulus than a stationary one, and that shape itself does not typically provide an adequate stimulus to trigger aggressive behavior [Johnson:1973]. This might help account for our results, as the imitation betta was largely stationary. When confronted with another male’s display the competitor may elect to match the display, flee, submit, or escalate the situation [Johnson:2018]. Regardless of how much the imitation looked like another Betta splendens, it did not behave as such. Thus it is probable that the individuals simply chose not to waste precious time and resources on an unresponsive opponent. Display behavior is extremely energetically costly, and often high-risk as damage sustained after escalation into combat can be crippling or fatal. If this were not so, the behavior would no longer maintain its signal value in communication [Castro, Ros, Becker, Oliveira:2006]. Thus it is beneficial to the Betta splendens, or any animal, to be able to discern when it would be prudent or imprudent to express this manner of agonistic behavior.
