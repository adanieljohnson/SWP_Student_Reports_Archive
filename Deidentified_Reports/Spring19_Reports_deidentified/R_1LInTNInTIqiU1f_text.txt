Title: The Effect of Curare on Muscle Contraction in Frog's Legs

Abstract:
Hormones, nerves, and muscles allow organisms to respond to stimuli and adapt to changes in their environment. Understanding the many connections between the nervous system and the muscle system allows us to understand how the two systems communicate and coordinate their functions. Curare, a plant extract originating in South America, affects the transmission of signals in the neuromuscular system. Curare prevents the binding of the hormone Acetylcholine to muscle cells, which weakens and even prevents muscle contractions. Often used as a poison, Curare prevents the transmission of action potentials from the nervous system to the muscle system. We looked at the effect of Curare on the amplitude of muscle contractions in frog’s legs. The expectation was that Curare would decrease the amplitude of muscle contractions. Our data showed no significant difference in the amplitude of the muscle contractions. Our data, however, runs counter to many experiments performed using Curare in previous years. This could indicate a need to repeat the experiment or could indicate that larger amounts of curare need to be used to have an effect. Curare’s lack of effect on muscle contraction’s in frog’s legs highlights the fragile balance that allows the neuro-muscular system to function.  

Introduction:
The delicate balance that allows the neuro-muscular system to function is easily disrupted by the presence of a neuro-muscular blocker. This experiment evaluates the impact of the injection of curare into frog's legs and the effect that curare has on the amplitude of muscle contractions in the frog's legs. Curare, a plant based extract often used by South Americans as a form of poison, affects the neuromuscular junction and prevents an action potential from being transmitted from the nerve to the muscle [Colquhoun: 2007]. More specifically, curare prevents Acetylcholine from binding to the muscle cell and triggering the action potential [Raghavendra: 2005]. The frog's leg (Rana pipiens) is an ideal model for demonstrating the relationship between the nervous system and muscle contraction because contractions are easily visible to the naked eye and it is relatively simple to stimulate the contractions of the frog's leg using voltage probes. The effect of curare on muscle contraction could tell scientists more about how neuromuscular blockers function and how much voltage is required to overcome the effects of curare, if there is any such voltage. Our experiment attempts to determine the effect of curare on the amplitude of muscle contractions in frog's legs. We hypothesize that if we inject curare into frog's legs, then the amplitude of the muscle contractions will decrease.



Materials and Methods:
Three different frog legs were skinned and the sciatic nerve as well as gastrocnemius muscle were made visible. Then we determined the threshold stimulus of each of the three different frog's legs using different voltages of stimulus beginning at 0 V and ending with 5 V or until the threshold stimulus was determined. The amplitude of the muscle contractions was monitored using iWorx software. The frog’s three legs we tested were considered to be the control group. For the experimental group, we injected 0.1 mL of the poison Curare into the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog's legs. We then waited 5 minutes after injecting, then determined the threshold stimulus of the frog's legs using the same method as for the control group. We took care to record the amplitude of the contractions as well. We used a paired t-test to analyze the amplitude of the contractions for both the experimental and control groups. 



Results:
The mean threshold stimulus amplitude for the control frog leg’s was 0.13 Volts while the mean threshold stimulus amplitude for the experimental frog leg’s was 0.143 Volts. We used a paired t-test to analyze our results for this experiment. The mean threshold stimulus amplitude for the control frog leg’s was not statistically significantly different from the mean threshold stimulus amplitude for the experimental frog legs (t-stat= 1.511858, df= 2, P= 0.269703). The contractions of both the experimental and control groups were clearly visible to the naked eye, and very little difference in the strength of the contractions was visible. After skinning, all three legs were very similar in size and had similar muscle construction. The mean threshold stimulus amplitude for the experimental group was actually higher than the amplitude for the control group (Figure. 1). The similarities in the mean amplitude for both groups supports the outcome of the paired t-test.



Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if we inject curare into frog's legs, then the amplitude of the muscle contractions will decrease, was not supported. We observed no significant difference between the threshold amplitude of the control group and the amplitude of the experimental group, which suggests that curare has no effect on the threshold amplitude of muscle contractions. It is possible that the dosage of Curare, 0.1 mL, was too low to affect the threshold amplitude, or Curare needs to be injected into a different part of the frog leg to affect the threshold amplitude [Raghavendra: 2005]. Past studies have found that Curare does affect the threshold amplitude and should prevent the muscle from contracting. In past studies Curare has inhibited the flow of action potentials across the neuromuscular junction as a blocker [Colquhoun: 2007]. This could suggest that there was a source of error in our experiment, since the experimental group actually had a higher mean threshold amplitude than the control group. One potential source of error could be the method of injection for the poison. For Curare to affect the threshold stimulus amplitude, it must be injected directly into the bloodstream. The myelin sheath that protects nerve cells is impermeable to lipid-insoluble compounds, and Curare is one of those lipid-insoluble compounds. As such, Curare has no effect unless it is directly injected into the bloodstream of the organism. The next logical step for this experiment will be to inject the curare directly into the bloodstream of an organism to determine if it then has an effect on the threshold stimulus amplitude of an organism. Curare’s use as an anesthetic could also show that it does have positive effects when used in the correct manner. The importance and fragility of the communication between nervous and muscular systems is highlighted in Curare’s ability to affect the communication between the two.
