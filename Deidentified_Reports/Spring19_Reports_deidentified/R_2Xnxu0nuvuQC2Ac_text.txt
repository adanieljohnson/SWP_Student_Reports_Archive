Title: Agonistic intraspecific behavior of starved Betta splendens in the presence of food

Abstract:
The goal of this study was to observe the change in the intraspecific agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens in the presence and absence of food. We hypothesized that if a male Betta splendens is exposed to another betta male with food, then both of the males will express more intraspecific agonistic behaviors than when there is a lack of food. This experiment was done by quantifying the aggressive behaviors of both male betta fish when placed in the same tank with, and without food. After conducting this experiment, we observed a statistically significant increase in agonistic behavior of male betta fish in the presence of food compared to the aggressive behavior in the absence of food. This supports our hypothesis of an increase in intraspecific aggressive behavior when exposed to another male and food.


Introduction:
When resources are limited, all species will go to extreme lengths to require that needed resource. If there is intraspecific competition for that resource, then that individual has to outcompete the others for that resource. One way individuals can outcompete the others is to be more aggressive and show more aggressive behaviors to the other individuals in order to scare away the competition [Johnson: 2018]. This behavior between two individuals is called intraspecific agonistic behaviors. In one study, they recognized that there are many specialized traits that serve specifically for transmitting a communicative signal from one individual to the other [Doutrelant: 2001]. In this study, we wanted to observe these intraspecific behaviors of starved Betta splendens, aka betta fish, and see how they would change in the presence of food. Since food is a limited resource, we hypothesized that if two male Betta splendens were exposed to each other in the presence of food, then they will display more intraspecific agonistic behaviors than in the absence of food. We also chose to starve these betta fish in order to increase motivation for the food and therefore increase their agonistic intraspecific behaviors. Lastly, we chose to use betta fish because past studies have shown that male betta fish display highly aggressive behavior towards other males [Braddock: 1955]. This allows us to clearly observe these aggressive intraspecific behaviors, which makes it easier for us to track and record their behaviors.


Materials and Methods:
In order to get the Betta fish to be more motivated to display agonistic behaviors, the fish were starved for four days prior to the experiment. We designed a way to quantify the displayed agonistic behavior was created where each behavior was given a number that correlates to the level of aggression displayed, displayed in Figure 1. Then two betta fish were placed in the same tank, where we quantified the level of aggressive behaviors, using the established number system. After five minutes, the fish were separated and the sum of the aggressive behaviors was calculated for each betta fish. Each fish was given a five-minute rest where they were given food within the last minute of their break. After the break, the partition was removed and more food was added to the area that now contained both of the betta fish. The aggressive behaviors were again quantified using the established number system and after five minutes, the sum of the aggressive behaviors was calculated for each fish. We repeated this process for two more pairs of fish to have a total of six betta fish’s quantified behavior. The average and standard deviation of the sum of aggressive behavior for each of the betta was calculated for the absence and presence of food. A paired T Test was then used to determine if our results were statistically significant.


Results:
Prior to this study, we conducted a pilot study to observe the intraspecific agonistic behaviors in well fed Betta splendens. Compared to the pilot study, we observed a lower amount of aggressive behaviors during this study.  However, we did observe a clear difference in the number of agonistic behavior when the betta fish were in the absence of food and the presence of food. The betta fish expressed more and higher level agonistic behaviors in the presence of food compared to the absence of food. As seen in Figure 1, we quantified the agonistic behavior in the absence of food and the average was 8.67 +/- 5.47 and in the presence of food, the average was 22.5 +/- 7.12. After conducting a paired T test, we determined that the results were statistically significant (t-value=9.00, df=5, p=0.0003).


Discussion:
We determined that the data from this experiment supported our hypothesis because the results from a paired T test showed that our data was statistically significant. This means that our data supports the idea that male betta fish show more aggressive behaviors in the presence of food than in the absence of food. This is because food is a limited resource and the individuals have to compete for it. If one fish displays more aggressive behavior than the other individual, than the dominant individual will have scared off the submissive one and will have the authority to eat. Our results were supported by another study where they found that the total number of responses, aggressive behaviors, increased per session in the experiment with food than the experiment without food [Hogan: 1970]. Additionally, another study found a 0.2 percent increase in male betta fish’s agonistic behavior in the presence of a female than the absence of a female [Dzieweczynski: 2005]. This reflects our results where the betta males display an increased number of aggressive behaviors in the presence of a limited resource, a female in Dzieweczynski’s study and food in ours. For future experiments, I would lower the number of days we starved the fish prior to the study, from four to only two days. We observed a decrease in the usual agonistic behaviors and we think this is due to possible starvation side effects. A separate study found that fasted Betta splendens showed a decrease in overall activity, agonistic included, because of a lack of lipids and amino acid needed for energy [Haller: 1989] Instead, I would starve the fish for only one day prior to the study in order to increase motivation for the food but decrease the starvation side effects. Lastly, this experiment is relevant because we are able to understand how intraspecific behaviors change in the presence of limited resources. This experimental data can be extrapolated past betta fish to show that every species on this planet will go to extreme lengths, displaying more agonistic or sexual behaviors, when having to compete for limited resources.
