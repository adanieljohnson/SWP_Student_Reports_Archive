Title: Voltage response port treatment with tubocurarine  

Abstract:
This lab is designed to test the effects of tubocurarine on the voltage response on frog legs. This was tested by dissecting a frog leg in a manner that exposed the gastrocnemus and sciatic nerve of the frog leg. Once the frog leg was set up, a controll test would be run to test the standard voltage response in a frog leg. After the controll test was run, the leg was treated with 1 mM of tubocurarine, and the voltage test was run again. This was run on three separate frog legs. Our results caused our hypothesis to be rejected. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates consists of thousands of myofibers, which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregate of cells. (Johnson). The myofibers are all bound together to form functional groups which cause movement in the skeletal system. The myofibers are controllled by motor neurons, Which have cell bodies located in the gray matter of the spinal cord (Johnson). The motor neurons are activated by electrical impulses sent by the brain through the nervous system that carry a signal for the muscle to contract in a particular way. These electrical impulses arrive at a neuromuscular junction causing the release of ACh. ACh then binds to its receptor causing the sodium channels to open which generates an action potential. This action potential spreads throughout the muscle fibers causing the release of Calcium from the SR. The release of Calcium activates the contraction mechanism in muscles. In this lab, this process was manipulated by injecting a frog leg with Tubocurarine at a concentration of 1 mM. This chemical is a receptor blocker, meaning that ACh will not be able to bind to its receptor resulting in the lack of movement of the muscle.We hypothesised that if Tubocurarine is injected into the leg, the leg would not move in response to any electrical current that is applied. 



Materials and Method:
In this lab a frog leg was dissected and pinned to a examination tray. The sciatic nerve was exposed and the achilles tendon was detached from the foot. The end that was detached was then strung to a stand in order to make observing movement easier. After the leg was prepared two probes were attached to the leg so that an electrical current could be applied and the contractions could be recorded on computer software. Before injecting the leg with Tubocurarine, a few tests were run to find the threshold at which the frog leg will begin to contract. The (Tubocurarine was then injected into the leg and the same test was run. This procedure was run on three different legs. The independent variable in this experiment is the concentration of tubocurarine that was injected into the frog leg and the dependent variable in this experiment was the voltage reading on each contraction.. After all three legs were tested, the data was run through a one tailed p test. 


Results:
The average voltage response in each of three frog legs at 0.9, 1.5, and 0.5 volts were 0.6, 0.02, and 0.029. The average voltage response in each of three frog legs treated with 1mM concentration of tubocurarine at the same voltage were 0.0126, 0.021,  and 0.061. The average muscle contraction for the controll group visually higher only in the first frog leg, but when the contraction was measured in the second two frog legs the treated group had a greater contraction than the controll group. The one tailed P- value was 0.4. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis stated that when the frog leg was treated with tubocurarine, an action potential would not be created therefore the muscle would not have a voltage response. Our statistical analysis produced a P - value of 0.4 causing us to reject our hypothesis and fail to reject the null hypothesis. Throughout the lab there was some difficulty with the frog legs. After injection the last two frog legs the muscles visually contracted more than when they were untreated. The chemical tubocurarine is an ACh blocker meaning that prevents ACh from bonding with its receptor thus inhibiting the signal to create an action potential (Ferry CB) . If there is no action potential than the muscle will not contract. The concentration that was injected into the frog legs was thought to be high enough because a concentration of 1 mM has been tested to completely inhibit an action potential. (Lunko) This is important because it is the concept that describes all the muscle movements that occur. Potential errors that could have occured, are failure to inject a high enough concentration or failure to put the probes in position to allow for an accurate reading. In future experiments a higher concentration of tubocurarine could be used to test its effects on the muscle.
