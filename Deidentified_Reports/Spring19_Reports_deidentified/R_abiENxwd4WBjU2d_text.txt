Title: The effect of nitrogen fertilizer on Pisum sativum length and weight root: shoot ratio

Abstract:
The way plants allocate their resources is an important topic for biology. It is necessary to understand how plants obtain limited, essential resources and allocate them differently based on environmental conditions. In this experiment, the effect of nitrogen on weight and length root: shoot ratio in Pisum sativum was observed. It was hypothesized that plants in soil containing nitrogen will have a smaller root: shoot ratio than plants in nitrogen deficient soil because plants in soil without nitrogen will allocate their resources to their roots. The data proved to have no significant difference for length root: shoot ratio but did show a significant difference in weight root: shoot ratio. However, the significant difference in weight root: shoot ratio was in the opposite way than hypothesized. These results show that even though nitrogen is an essential nutrient, too much nitrogen can be harmful to plant growth. This is important to know for plant fertilizer, to give plants the best chance to survive in their environment.


Introduction:
There are many environmental factors that determine how an organism uses its resources. Plants interact with abiotic and biotic factors that affect reproduction, fitness of the plant, and energy capture ability. Abiotic factors include nonliving stimuli such as wind and temperature, while biotic factors are living organisms such as animals. Essential resources such as nitrogen, sunlight, or water are necessary for a plants survival; however, they are limited. This limitation affect what plants are present in a certain environment. A species will allocate their resources differently based on conditions from the environment. Resources can be allocated to leaves, stems, or roots and this effects the plant root: shoot ratio. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient, which means plants need nitrogen to survive, however it is also a limited nutrient in the environment. It is an abundant ingredient in fertilizer that helps plants grow, which can be added into the soil to increase plant growth. In one experiment, nitrogen and phosphorus were used to test the effect on Acer mono seedling growth. The experiment concluded that with optimal amounts of nitrogen fertilizer there was a statistically significant increase in the plant growth than those plants not treated with the nitrogen [Razaq: 2017]. In our experiment, root: shoot ratio was calculated in Pisum sativum in nitrogen rich and nitrogen poor soil. It is hypothesized that the root: shoot ratio for plants exposed to nitrogen will be smaller than the root: shoot ratio for plants in nitrogen poor soil because roots for plants in nitrogen deficient soil will grow longer to obtain nitrogen, and allocate more resources to their roots.


Materials and Methods:
Pea plants were obtained and split into 2 groups. Three pots were the experimental group and three pots were the control group. For two weeks, the plants were watered every day. The experimental group was given 50 mL water and 50 mL of a MiracleGro solution that contains 24 percent nitrogen. The control plants were given 100 mL water. After 2 weeks, the root: shoot ratio was calculated for length and weight. One plant was separated, making sure to separate the entire plant from the rest. The root was cut off to separate the shoot from the root. The root was measured from the top to the bottom of the longest root in cm and the shoot was measured from the tip to where the leaf started. This was repeated for all ten of the control plants. Then the shoot and root were weighed in grams. The root to shoot ratio was calculated for all of the plants. This process was repeated for all ten of the experimental plants. Then an unpaired two tailed two sample t test was performed.


Results:
When observing the plants there was difference in the overall look. The experimental plants given nitrogen looked very short, were a light green, and had not grown. The control plants with only water were very tall, a vibrant green, and looked healthy. When compared to an alpha value of 0.05 the p value of 0.289 showed not significant results for the length root: shoot ratio, and the p value of 0.00337 showed significant results for the weight root: shoot ratio. The length root: shoot ratio for the pea plants in nitrogen was 0.822 +/- 0.405 and the length root: shoot ratio for the control pea plants was 0.676 +/- 0.1242 (Fig 1). The weight root: shoot ratio for the pea plants in nitrogen was 1.81 +/- 0.7395 and the weight root: shoot ratio for the control pea plants was 1.023 +/- 0.1541 (Fig 2). An unpaired two tailed two sample t test was used to analyze the results. The results were not significant for length root: shoot ratio (t value = 1.092, degrees of freedom = 18, p value = 0.289). The results were significant for weight root: shoot ratio (t value = 3.375, degrees of freedom = 18, p value = 0.00337).


Discussion:
The hypothesis that the root: shoot ratio for pea plants exposed to nitrogen will be smaller than the control pea plants was rejected. The root: shoot ratio for plants exposed to nitrogen was larger for weight and height. Furthermore, the results for the length root: shoot ratio was not significant and the results for the weight root: shoot ratio were significant. However, even though there was a significant p value, it was significant in the opposite way than hypothesized, with the root: shoot ratio for nitrogen plants being larger than the root: shoot ratio for control plants. These plants were given 50 mL of a MiracleGro solution that contains 24 percent nitrogen, which is a large amount of nitrogen for two weeks. While nitrogen is an essential nutrient, and is in fertilizer to help plants grow, an excess of nitrogen can affect plant growth in negative way. It is important to have this essential nutrient in small amounts, but when there is an excess it is bad for the plant. This can explain why the root: shoot ratio was higher in nitrogen rich soil, and why the results obtained were opposite than hypothesized. These results display an important environmental concern happening now. The overload of added nitrogen through fertilizers and fossil fuels are causing runoff into rivers and lakes and affecting plant growth and overall health [Moffat: 1998]. One plant ecologist examined how excess nitrogen is damaging forests. One possible explanation they found was that the excess of negative nitrate ions were attracting the other positive ions and from taking them from the plant [Moffat: 1998]. It is important to think about the environmental concerns for plants as we continue to add more nitrogen into the soil.
