Title: The effect of Carbaryl on the threshold amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipien

Abstract:
The effect of an insecticide on different organisms is important when deciding whether regular use of this insecticide should be allowed. Sevin, an insecticide containing Carbaryl, is a widely used insecticide that could have potentially harmful effects on the ecosystem. In this experiment, the effect of Carbaryl as an Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was tested by comparing the minimum average threshold of a gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipien with a 2% Sevin solution injected with the average minimum threshold of a regular gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipien. The hypothesis that the gastrocnemus muscle injected with the 2% Sevin solution would have a higher threshold was supported because it had a threshold of .293+/-.07 volts while the regular gastrocnemus muscle had a threshold of .1567+/-.032 volts. The p_value calculated was .037622, indicating that the data found was significent. These findings continue to paint a broader picture of carbamate insecticides and how they could potentially affect the living organisms that they inadvertently target.

Introduction:
This experiment tests the minimum voltage needed to illicit a contraction in the Gastrocnemius muscle in Rania pipiens. This minimum voltage needed to illicit a contraction is called the threshold. The contractions of the muscle are the result of motor neurons binding to muscles in the neuromuscular system. The neuromuscular system allows organisms to respond to their environment within milliseconds. The somatic neuromuscular system involves skeletal muscle which consists of myofibers. Motor neurons innervate skeletal muscles by attaching to the neuromuscular junctions, ultimately stimulating muscle contraction. When motor neurons attach to the muscle, Acetylcholine (ACH) is released and binds to the Acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. When Acetylcholine (ACH) binds, Calcium (Ca2+) is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, creating an action potential. This ultimately causes the muscle to contract. This process can be altered by a variety of drugs such as Sevin. Sevin is an insecticide that contains Carbaryl, which inhibits Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and commonly used in agriculture [Zinkl: 1987]. Under normal circumstances, after Acetylcholine (ACH) binds to its receptor, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) breaks it down into Acetate and Choline. When carbaryl, a molecule that resembles Acetylcholine, binds to the Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), it prevents Acetylcholine (ACH) from being able to be broken down by the enzyme [Extension Toxicology Netowrk: 1993]. Because of this, the Acetylcholine (ACH) will remain in the Acetylcholine (ACH) receptor, preventing any other Acetylcholine (ACH) molecule from binding to the receptor and creating a larger action potential [Extension Toxicology Network: 1993]. This causes a buildup of Acetylcholine (ACH) in the synapse. The excess Acetylcholine (ACH) molecules then bind to receptors in the presynaptic neuron, causing the neuron to stop producing more Acetylcholine [Extension Toxicology Network: 1993]. The Carbaryl in Sevin slows down the binding and breaking down of Acetylcholine (ACH), resulting in a lower action potential. More voltage is required to illicit the same response from the muscle because the action potential is lower than that of a normal muscle. For these reasons, if the Rania pipien legs are injected in the gastrocnemus muscle with a .2 Ml of a 2% solution of Sevin, then they will yield a higher threshold (V).

Materials and Method:
The steps for preparing the Rania pipiens’ gastrocnemus muscles were followed in order to begin the experiment. The gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve were isolated from the rest of the frog leg and moistened using frog Ringer’s solution. The gastrocnemus muscle was tied up and the prongs were inserted directly into the muscle. After this, the twitch threshold could be determined using direct stimulation of the gastrocnemus muscle. The program was used to deliver a .01 V shock directly to the gastrocnemus muscle and the muscle reaction was recorded. The shock amplitude was then increased by .01 V increments until a muscle twitch in observed. This initial muscle twitch was recorded as the threshold. Then, the gastrocnemus muscle of the same frog was injected with .2 Ml of the 2% Sevin solution. The gastrocnemus muscle was then directly shocked with an amplitude of .01 V. The amplitude was increased by .01 V increments until the initial muscle twitch was observed. The amplitude for that threshold was then recorded. These steps were repeated for two more frogs and the threshold voltages were recorded both with and without the presence of Sevin. Then, a paired t_test was conducted in order to compare the average threshold with and without the 2% Sevin. The presence of 2% Sevin solution in the experiment was the independent variable and the resulting threshold voltage was the dependent variable.

Results:
In this experiment, the threshold, or the minimum voltage required for a muscle response, was calculated through an observable twitch in the gastrocnemus muscle. One observational difference that occurred with the group that had been injected with .2 Ml of the 2% Sevin solution was that the muscle did not react to any amplitude at first. In order to see any result, the muscle had to be shocked with an amplitude of 5 V. Then, the shocks were decreased to see the minimum threshold that resulted in a muscle twitch. A paired t_test was conducted because two sets of data were being taken from the same frog: the threshold for a single frog before the injection of a 2% Sevin solution and after. The average threshold for the frogs with 0 Ml of the 2% Sevin solution injected was about .15667+/-.0321455 (figure 2). The average threshold for the frogs with .2 Ml of the 2% Sevin solution injected was about .29333+/-.07023769 (figure 2). A two-tailed p_value was calculated to be .037622. The t-value was calculated to be 5.008947. The degrees of freedom, which measures how many variables can be subject to change, was determined to be 2.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that injecting the Rania pipien legs in the gastrocnemus muscle with a .2 Ml of a 2% solution of Sevin will result in a higher threshold (V) was supported because there was a significent difference between the controll and experimental group, with the average threshold of the muscle containing the 2% Sevin solution almost twice as large as the average threshold when the muscle did not contain Sevin. This means that the null hypothesis that injecting a 2% solution of Sevin would have no effect on the threshold was rejected. The two-tailed p_value found was less than .05 and the standard deviations did not overlap, meaning that the data collected during this experiment was significent. This means that there is a high likelihood that the difference found was not due to chance. Because the data was significent, it can be inferred that the presence of Carbaryl in the form of Sevin in the neuromuscular junction requires a higher minimum voltage to obtain the same twitch as a muscle that was not injected. This occurred because the binding and breaking down of Acetylcholine (ACH) was slowed down by the binding of Carbaryl to the Acetylcholinesterase (AChE). If the organism was alive when injected with the Carbaryl, there would have been a drastically different result. The electrical impulse continues to fire until it is limited by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [Extension Toxicology Network: 1993]. If the Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is inhibited, it cannot limit the firing of electrical impulses, resulting in uncontrollled muscle twitches and sometimes even death [Extension Toxicology Network: 1993]. This is concerning because carbamates such as Carbaryl-containing Sevin are some of the most popular insecticides used for pest controll [Zinkl: 1987]. According to previous studies, Carbaryl and other pesticides are present in both freshwater ecosystems due to runoff and chemical spills [Eichelberger: 1971] and even in some of the food that humans consume [Johnson: 1963]. While the small amounts in food and water may not be lethal to humans, many other fish, amphibians, and small mammals are put at risk as a result. In order to determine the true danger of carbamates, especially Carbaryl, more studies have to be conducted on smaller animals living in the ecosystems that are affected.
