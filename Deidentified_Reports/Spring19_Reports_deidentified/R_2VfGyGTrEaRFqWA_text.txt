Title: Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibitor in Manduca sexta Larva

Abstract:
Keeping insects out of crops is tremendously important for the agricultural business. The most common way to do this is through the use of insecticides. Insecticides, however,  can sometimes be dangerous to crops or humans, so many companies are beginning to use insect growth regulators (IGRs) to safely prevent insects from destroying crops. For this experiment we investigate the affect an ecdysterone (a growth hormone in insects) inhibitor in Manduca sexta caterpillars. The expectation was that this would result n the caterpillars growing and developing slower. Our data showed a significant difference in the average weights of caterpillars with and without the hormone inhibitor. This suggests the ecdysterone inhibitor we used could be used as an IGR to safely prevent the reproduction of insects in crop fields.

Introduction:
Hormones are important chemical components in all multicellular organisms that stimulate actions in certain organs and cells. Hormones regulate many bodily processes and are important for growth and development. Many organisms experience certain times of high hormone activity as a stage of growth. In humans, this is puberty. During puberty humans develop into reproductive adults similar to molting in insects. Molting is when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer of cuticle and the old layer of skin is shed [Johnson: 2018]. During molting insects fully change form and develop a new morphology and transition from larva to pupa to adults. This experiment assesses the effects of hormones on insect growth in larva of the insect Manduca sexta. These caterpillars are used as the model organism in this experiment since they have been thoroughly studied and can easily be manipulated and studied. They have four developmental stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and reproductive adult. This study focusses on growth and hormones during their larval stage. Manduca sexta have two primary growth hormones, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone used for development [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment will treat the caterpillars with a substance that inhibits ecdysterone to monitor their weight and appearance as a reflection of their development with a suppressed amount of this growth hormone. Because ecdysterone is a growth hormone, decreasing the amount of it in Manduca sexta will cause the caterpillars treated with it to weigh less than those of the control group.

Materials and Methods:
Two groups of four caterpillars were fed an average diet of Manduca sexta food supplement. One group served as the control group and was fed an average diet treated with 5 drops of distilled water. The second group served as the experimental group and was fed an average diet treated with 5 drops of ecdysterone inhibitor. Both groups were monitored and weighed using a standard lab electronic balance daily over a period of 15 days. The weights were recorded with each weighing. Food was replaced and the cells were cleaned as needed. A one-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine differences in the average weights of the caterpillars fed a normal diet compared to the caterpillars fed a diet with ecdysterone inhibitor.

Results:
The mean weight for the control group over the 15 day period was 3.57 g and for the experimental group the mean weight was 1.83 g (Fig.1). The standard deviation for mass in the control group was 1.16 and the standard deviation for mass in experimental plants was 1.18 (Fig.1). We used a one-tailed two-sample t-test to analyze our results. The mean weight of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 2.10, df = 6, P = 0.039). As the experiment progressed, the control group appeared to grow larger than the experimental, particularly caterpillars one and two. Caterpillar two in the control group actually grew past the larva stage and pupated. Caterpillar three of the experimental group died. Overall, the control group appeared to grow more than the experimental group. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that decreasing the amount of ecdysterone in Manduca sexta will cause the caterpillars treated with it to weigh less than those of the control group was supported. We did observe significant difference at the .05 level, suggesting that the reduction of ecdysterone levels does cause lower growth rates and weights. Understanding the effects of ecdysterone, a common insect growth hormone, inhibitors could help lead to the development of IGRs which could serve as a safe alternative to pesticides. If IGRs can prevent insects from leaving the larval stage or weaken them, they can replace toxic pesticides as a way to protect crops. Today, ecdysterone inhibitors like the one used in this experiment are used as IGRs in the agriculture industry [Johnson: 2018]. Our results support their use as IGRs.
