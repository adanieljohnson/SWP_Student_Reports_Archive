Title:  Neuromuscular control of Rana pipien via electrical stimulation Experiment

Abstract:
An action potential is triggered by opening sodium channels; ergo, when the channels are blocked an action potential can’t be triggered. In this experiment the lab used a sodium channel blocker (lidocaine) to affect the muscle contraction and action potentials in the Rana pipien frog’s gastrocnemius muscle. Muscle contractions were measured before and after the injection of the sodium channel blocker at .4 volts. The lab hypothesized that by inject sodium channel blockers (lidocaine) than it expects a decrease to an eventual cessation of the action potential in the nerve. The experiment and data determined that the lidocaine did cause a decrease in action potential; thus, the alternative hypothesis was accepted due to the analysis of the statistical outcome.

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment will analyze the stimulus response, work, summation, and tetanus in the leg of a Rana pipien frog’s muscle and nerve. The goal is to demonstrate basic properties of neuromuscular control via stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle and the static nerve of the Rana pipien’s leg. Both vertebrates and invertebrates possess thousands of myofibers, cylindrical multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells. The myofibers binds together forming skeletal muscles proper, which are inverted by motor neurons. The motor neurons axons extend and branch outs to the neuromuscular junction. “During sustained stimulation of motor neurons, a release of acetylcholine by the neuron sufficient to maintain tetany of skeletal muscle is maintained by stimulation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors by synaptic acetylcholine.” Ergo, the nerve muscle releases acetylcholine at these junctions which binds to receptors releasing sodium channels and triggering action potentials that release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Please transmit the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber. These contractions can be measured via a myogram, graphical recording of muscle activity, (the lab will use an electrophysical recording device). Ergo the lab hypothesized that by inject sodium channel blockers (lidocaine) than the lab expects a decrease to an eventual cessation of the action potential in the nerve.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were used for this experiment. The skin on the legs were removed using hands and forceps then placed separate from the frog legs on the dissection pan. Using the dissection probe carefully separated the inner thigh muscle and extending to the lower thigh muscle. Then carefully free the nerve from it attached connective tissue using dissection needle and forceps. The exposed tissue of the frog legs was kept moist using frog ringers (did not drench tissue). Then the frog’s leg was attached to the electrophysiology (EP) recorder and Lab Scribe. Using the simulator on Lab Scribe the amplitude was determine and the threshold stimulus was set to .4 volts. The parameters of the stimulus were set to a frequency of 1 Hz, pulse width of 5ms, and 1 pulse. For the experimental section .1 mL of lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle with 1 drop added to the sciatic nerve. Once set up the lab waited three minutes before measuring voltage and then record results with prior set parameters. These steps were repeated for all of the legs as control and experimental. Then the average voltage was recorded and analyzed via a two-tailed paired t-test.

Results:
The results determined an average control amplitude of 1.396 volts; whereas, the average amplitude for the experimental group was determined as 0.2493 volts (Fig 1). A two-tailed paired t-test was ran to determine and analyze the results. It concluded that the results were significant because the p-value was 0.02531 which is less than 0.05. The statistical results and observation showed numerous trends throughout the experiment. Once injected with sodium blockers the frogs’ legs experimental voltage would decrease and the muscle twitch last longer. Another trend present was seen in the various sizes of the legs. Larger legs displayed a higher amplitude in the controls and experimental groups because the lidocaine was not as concentrated as it was in the smaller legs.





Discussion:

Based upon the results of the experiment the lab determined that the alternative hypothesis that if sodium blocker lidocaine was added that we would expect a decrease to a possible cessation of the action potential in the nerve, so, the alternative hypothesis was accepted, and the null hypothesis was rejected. The voltage was decreased in the action potential because we blocked the sodium. The sodium acts as a “tugboat” to transport neurotransmitters across neurons. Ergo, without sodium the action potential is limited because it can’t travel down the neurons and signal an action potential. The lab determined statistical significance at the 0.05 level. This suggests that the increase of sodium channel blockers significantly affected the action potential and amplitude of the Rana Pipien Frog. “The reason why we used the muscle contraction amplitude was because muscular contractions are taken as an index of the propagation of the impulses across the impaled region” [Tasaki: 1952]. The experiment also determined that the frog legs that were larger had a higher voltage than the smaller legs because the lidocaine wasn’t as concentrated in the larger legs. Since the alternative hypothesis was accepted and statistically significant the experiment will need to be redone due to the varying differences in the data.
