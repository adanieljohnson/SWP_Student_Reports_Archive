Title: Nitrogen enriched environment shows Inconclusive effects on the phenotypic plasticity of Raphanus Raphanistrum:

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity directs resources to the specific parts of the plants in need based off of the environmental conditions. This experiment focuses on the allocation plasticity of the Raphanus raphanistrum (radish) plant. Nitrogen is an important resource that all plants need to grow and mature, playing a large role in a plant’s metabolic processes. Local root growth is stimulated by a high concentration of nitrogen, however the increased local root growth leads to a decrease in the growth of the root system as a whole. With this understanding, it is hypothesized that the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil will be lower than the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown under normal conditions. We grew and measured the root:shoot ratio of radish plants in 6 pots (3-normal conditions, 3-nitrogen-rich). After running a two-sample t-test, a p-value of 0.077 was found, meaning that the data was not statistically significant. These findings may be contributed to the use of Miracle-Gro, resulting in nitrogen burn seen in the nitrogen-rich conditions. Future directions could test the effect of different concentrations of nitrogen on plant root:shoot growth to give farmers a better idea of the growing patterns of their plants. 

Introduction:
Ecological communities are never stagnant, rather, they change over time. To keep up with the environment around them, resident plants and animals must interact with and adapt to each other. This environmental stimuli is known as biotic factors. Likewise, abiotic factors are nonliving sources that also encourage adaptation, such as water, air and the focus of this experiment, soil. Both factors play a large role in everything from reproduction to energy capture. As environments constantly change, the availability of resources found in a specific environment, known as limiting resources, change as well. Limiting resources can act as a selection force on certain species as some individuals within a population pass on fit traits that allow them to better obtain said limited resource. Through a process known as resource allocation, plants have the ability to modify root and shoot growth based off of environmental stimuli. Resource allocation can be measured by examining the root to shoot length ratio in a plant. In response to their environmental conditions, plants can change where they focus their energy, known as phenotypic plasticity, where growth patterns are seen to change over time. 
In this experiment the phenotypic plasticity of plants will be tested by comparing the growth of Raphanus raphanistrum (radish) plants in different environmental conditions. Radish plants are an ideal plant to test as they are fast growing and exhibit high plasticity [Agrawal:2002]. Part of the Brassicaceae family, the edible root prefers a soil pH of 6.5-7. A similar study conducted by Yang works to explain how nitrogen rich soil affects root growth. Plant growth, when utilizing resource allocation, has to be balanced. That being said, when an individual root finds itself in nitrogen rich soil, it increases its growth. In response, other roots in the root system decrease their growth even though their environmental conditions have not changed [Yang:2005]. In a study conducted by Zhang, he explores the effect of varying nitrogen levels on thale cress plants [Zhang:1999]. It was found that even though the high nitrogen levels stimulate local root growth, the nitrogen-rich soil inhibits growth in the root system as a whole due to the fact that the roots do not need to grow as far to find the nitrogen [Zhang:1999]. 
These experiments, as well as the one discussed here, are relevant to many agricultural farmers. In order for them to plan out where and how far apart the seedlings should be placed to allow for enough room to grow and mature, they must understand the growth patterns of their crops. Further, nitrogen is a very common ingredient in all fertilizers as all plants need nitrogen to survive. Nitrogen is so vital to plants because it is a major component of chlorophyll which  is directly involved in converting sunlight energy to sugar using water and carbon dioxide. Additionally, it is a major component of amino acids which are used to make proteins. Without nitrogen, plants cannot create proteins and will eventually wither and die. By observing plants in two different environments, a better understanding of nitrogen’s effects on plant growth can be obtained. With the knowledge that nitrogen rich soil may cause an inhibitory effect of the root system of plants, it is hypothesized that the root to shoot length ratio of radish plants will be smaller in the nitrogen rich environment than those grown under normal conditions.


Materials and Methods:
Before setting up the experiment, around 60 radish seeds were gathered and soaked for 20-30 minutes. Of the six pots obtained, three were filled to the brim with vermiculite and watered. The other three were filled halfway with vermiculite and then a scoop of nitrogen was spread across the pot. After the nitrogen was added, the pots were also filled to the brim with vermiculite and watered. All 6 pots were given 25mL of Miracle-Gro (less than the suggested 50mL). Nine holes, about 1inch x 1inch, were then made in each of the 6 pots and filled with 5 radish seeds per hole. The holes were then covered with vermiculite and watered again. The pots were all placed in the green house and watered daily for the next 2 weeks.
After two weeks, the radish plants were taken out of the pots and the roots were carefully separated in a tub of water and dried. For each of the 6 pots, 5 plants were selected and measured. The roots were separated from the shoots at the root shoot junction by cutting at the band where a change in color from white to green is observed. For each of the 5 plants selected per pot, the maximum root length and the maximum shoot length was measured to the nearest millimeter and recorded. The mean value of root and shoot length was calculated by comparing the maximum lengths for each of the three “control” pots. The process was repeated for the three “nitrogen rich” pots. After all calculations were made the root to shoot ratio for the statistical significance between the different environmental conditions were compared using a two-sample t-test, giving a critical value of p=0.077.


Results:
Figure 1 illustrates that the average root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in normal conditions is higher than the radish grown in the nitrogen-rich soil.  The mean root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in normal conditions is 1.24 with a standard deviation of 0.42. On the other hand, the average root:shoot length ratio of radish plants grown under nitrogen enriched conditions is 0.82 with a standard deviation of 0.035. After further calculations, the difference between the two groups was shown not to be statistically significant after conducting a two-sample t-test (t=1.75, df=4 p=0.077).




Discussion:
Overall, the data did not support the hypothesis that the radish plants in the nitrogen rich environment would have a smaller root to shoot length ratio than those grown under normal conditions. While the data was not statistically significant, one can still interpret the results found as the trend in figure 1 supports the original hypothesis. When observing the two groups it was clear that the shoots of the radish plants under normal conditions appeared healthier as the shoots were taller and had a deep green color. Further, there were more seeds that sprouted and grew under the normal conditions in comparison to the nitrogen-rich conditions where not all the seeds germinated. This difference could possibly be attributed to something known as nitrogen burn [Lui:2014]. Due to the fact that Miracle-Gro, which contains nitrogen, was added to all pots, it was difficult to directly compare the two groups since they both had nitrogen in the soil. Further, since both Miracle-Gro and a scoop of nitrogen were added to each “nitrogen enriched pot” it is possible that too much nitrogen surrounding the plant had a negative effect on the shoot growth. Nitrogen burn was tested in an experiment conducted by Lui in 2014 that showed excess nitrogen that accumulates in the soil may result in a decrease in yield [Liu:2014]. Extreme levels of nitrogen increase the soil’s mineral salts, thus taking water away from the plant and leaving the salts behind. As a result, the leaves take on a burnt look from dehydration [Lui:2014]. Observations showed that the nitrogen-rich plants exhibited this nitrogen burn as the leaf edges were a yellowish brown color and wilting. To take in water from the surrounding environment, plants utilize an osmotic pressure gradient. When the roots are located in soil containing a high level of nitrogen, the water moves out of the roots, from an area of high pressure to low pressure, in order to reach an equilibrium. This dehydration may result in stunted root growth if nitrogen levels remain high. This confounding variable stresses the importance of controlled fertilizer use. Too much nitrogen given to plants can result in negative health effects for both the plants, humans and surrounding environment. Consuming high levels of nitrate in plants have harmful effects on human health [Liu:2014]. Further, excess levels of nitrogen lead to more run off since the plant cannot absorb all of the nitrogen present in the soil. The nitrogen left behind slowly leaches out of the soil through water runoff and can result in environmental damage seen through eutrophication. An additional experiment that could be run would be to test different levels of nitrogen in plants to see what concentration is the best for plant root growth. This information would give fertilizer companies a better idea of how much nitrogen to put in their product and give farmers a better understanding of how much nitrogen to give their plants in order to efficiently space out the seedlings to ensure maximum growth.
