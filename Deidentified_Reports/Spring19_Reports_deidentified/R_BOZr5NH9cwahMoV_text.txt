Title: Neuromuscular Effects of Caffeine on the [Rania pipiens]

Abstract:
Neuromuscular stimulation in the [Rania pipiens] is largely based on myofibers that release Acetylcholine, causing the release of Ca2+ and the contraction of the muscle.  The goal of this experiment was to test the effects of caffeine on the gastrocnemus of the [Rania pipiens].  We predicted that electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemus with caffeine will create a larger threshold in the muscle, causing tension.  To test this hypothesis, we injected caffeine into the gastrocnemus, and fired electrical impulses and recorded the amplitude response using LabScribe software.  Our results revealed that caffeine did create a higher threshold voltage than without caffeine.  These results are due to caffeine prolonging the action potential during stimulation, therefore creating tension and a suppressed rate of Ca2+ release.

Introduction:
The [Rania pipiens] is an amphibian more commonly known as the northern leopard frog.  Neuromuscular controll to the animal is similar to humans, as nerve impulses are used to stimulate the muscles of the [Rania pipiens].  They occur at the neuromuscular junction with the release of acetylcholine.  ACh binds to receptors that open sodium channels that creates an action potential, releasing Ca2+ [Johnson: 2018].  Therefore, our experiment aimed to discover how this process is altered with the injection of caffeine in the calf muscle of the frog.  Similar experiments have shown that injecting caffeine into a [Rania pipiens] muscle prolongs the action potential when stimulated and created tension due to the suppressed rate of Ca2+ release [Poledna: 1983].  We also decided to use the leopard frog for its ability to easily isolate its gastrocnemus, and its similarities with the neuromuscular system of humans.  We hypothesized that stimulating the gastrocnemus with caffeine would create tension and a larger threshold response than without.  



Materials and Method:
First, the legs of three frogs were isolated and dissected to expose the Achilles tendon and suspended it with a string to stimulate the gastrocnemus.  Each leg was first used as a controll without caffeine, using a ringer solution to hydrate the legs as needed.  The legs were stimulated three times at an amplitude of 0.5 V and averaged the stimulus response from the myogram on the LabScribe computer software. Next, each leg was stimulated three times with electrical impulses from the software at 0.5 V while caffeine was injected by a syringe into the gastrocnemus. The caffeine was inserted while electrical impulses were fired.  Each stimulus response shown on the computer was averaged.  We also performed a two tailed T test to determine the statistical significance of our results.  

Results:
Table 1 shows the summarized data of each response before and after the injection of caffeine.  The first [Rania pipiens] leg was physically bigger and has the strongest stimulus response with and without caffeine, with amplitudes of 0.786 V and 1.470 V, respectively.  Legs two and three were both smaller and resulted in lesser amplitude responses of 0.471 V and 0.483 V before, and 1.256 V and 1.315 V after the injection (table 1).  The only statistical test performed was the mean and standard deviation of the responses.  The final average for non-caffeinated responses was 0.565 V, compared to 1.347 V.  These results were graphed in figure 1.  The standard error was also recorded in table 2 and figure 1 for the non-caffeine and caffeine responses of 0.4225 and 0.3325, respectively.  Finally, we had an overall average difference of 0.767 V and a T value of 17.56.  The final P value was shown to be p= 0.0032, or statistically significent.  



Discussion:
From our experiment, we can infer that the injection of caffeine increases the muscular stimulus response in the Rania pipiens, with the average response amplitude being higher than the non-caffeinated response. Comparing these results to other experiments, we can infer that the biological reason is due to the inhibited response of ryanodine, the Ca2+ releaser in skeletal muscle. With the delayed release of Ca 2+, the muscle creates more tension with a prolonged action potential, which increases the threshold response overall [Hendricson: 2002].  Our final p value of p= 0.0032 is statistically significent.  Therefore, the null hypothesis can be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis can be supported. However, some sources of error could be due to computer software glitches or misuse in the readings of each amplitude.  For future experiments, we could use caffeine to stimulate the gastrocnemus to determine if an increased number in injections would decrease the amount of stimulation needed to fatigue the muscle.  We could test both the gastrocnemus and the sciatic nerve to observe the difference between thresholds in different areas of the Rania pipiens.
