Title: The influence of wavelength of light on the photosynthesis rate of spinach leaves.

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process done by the plants to do the carbon fixation. Photosynthesis helps the plants to turn the solar energy into chemical energy as well. It is separated into two parts, the light-dependent part, and the light independent part, and Electron transport is an important procedure that exists in the light-dependent part of the photosynthesis. Electron transport is an essential step in photosynthesis, and its rate indirectly increases the rate of photosynthesis. In this paper, the relationship between the wavelength of the light of the environment and the rate of electron transport is discovered. Green, red and sunlight are tested. From the experiment, the result is not statistically significent. But after further researching, I conclude that a longer period of the experiment should be conducted to make the experiment more precise.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process done by the plants to do the carbon fixation. Photosynthesis helps the plants to turn the solar energy into chemical energy as well. It is separated into two parts, the light-dependent part, and the light independent part, and the waste of photosynthesis is oxygen, which is the essential material for cellular respiration. In other words, photosynthesis consumes the waste of cellular respiration and re-produce the material needed for photosynthesis. Electron transport is an important procedure that exists in the light-dependent part of the photosynthesis. A higher rate of electron transport indicates a relatively high rate of photosynthesis. Since the photosynthesis is that important to the lives on the Earth, and the electron transport rate is essential for the photosynthesis rate, the question is that what natural factors would influence the rate of electron transport and as well as photosynthesis. In fact, for an electron to be transported, it need to be activated first. The activation of an electron is led by the absorption of a photon which would bump the electron to a higher-energy orbital. (Black, 1973) Only a photon with just the right amount of energy to bump an electron between orbitals can excite a pigment. In addition, a photon’s energy can be shown by its wavelength, which is indicated by the color of the light. In our experiment, we’ll use the light of three wavelengths that represents green(520~610nm), red(610~720nm), and sunlight to test the amount of photosynthesis plants can do under the light of different wavelength. All green-leave vegetables could be used as the source of observing the rate of electron transport. Spinach is used in this experiment. So, the Biological Question of this experiment is: How the wavelength of the surrounding environment affects the rate of electron transport in spinach leaves? The initial hypothesis of this experiment made in this experiment is the green light would make least difference in photosynthesis and the red light would make most.

Materials and Method:
First of all, removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves, threw away the veins, and rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water; Blotted off any excess moisture from the leaves. Then, added 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), ground the spinach until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. When done with grinding, added an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer, mixed with the spinach slurry, and strained the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker.

Transferred the green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun it at 200 times the force of gravity, 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4oC. Made sure to include a balance tube in the centrifuge. After centrifuged for the first time, poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. Prevented the debris at the bottom of tube “A,” from going into tube “B”. Centrifuged the second time for the 50-Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC. Again, poured the supernatant to another container. Added an extra 15 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. Then, aliquoted into 3, 5 Ml volumes by dividing among 3 conical tubes. Added 5 Ml of reaction buffer to each conical tube and spin again at 2800 ppm for 10 minutes. Re-suspended pellet in approximately 3 Ml grinding buffer to concentrate chloroplasts.

Labeled 15 large test tubes, one Blank tube containing 6Ml of distilled water, 2Ml of pH 6.5 Buffer; three tubes containing 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP with no chloroplast; 12 tubes containing 6Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP and chloroplast. Then mixed each tube immediately after adding the chloroplasts. After mixing, transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Blanked the spectrophotometer at 600nm using Tube 0, and then immediately measured the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm. Put three tubes without chloroplast in sunlight, three tubes with chloroplast in sunlight, three tubes with chloroplast in green light, three tubes with chloroplast in red light and three with chloroplast in dark place. Record the absorbance in 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minutes.

Since there are three sets of data, three paired t_tests are used to find the significance of the result. 


Results:
For samples with no chloroplast and chloroplast in a dark environment, the absorbance didn’t change very much. For the other three, the absorbance changed relatively more. The p_values are 0.009(between the green light group and red light group), 0.945(between sunlight group and red light group) and 0.66(between sunlight group and green light group).

Discussion:
As we can see from the result of our experiment, sunlight caused the biggest change then green light and then red light. This is opposite to our hypothesis. In addition, the P-value is only statistically significent between the green light group and the red light group, which indicates that our result is very likely to be obtained due to chance. There are two reasons I think that may lead to this result. The first one is that the experiment time is not long enough for the plant to show significent difference. The second one is that our experiment is not precise enough. Even though we tried to use light of one color, our experiment is done during day time, so the sunlight is too strong to be get rid of completely.

After looking for similar previous researches, I found that we should not only focus on the direct product of photosynthesis. In fact, for example, root growth in lettuce plants irradiated with green LED light at PPF 100 decreased(Johkan, 2012). Instead, we should measure the effect of light of different wavelength on plant on a longer term such as for several weeks or months. For further experiment, more different wavelength should also be tested to find out a more precise trend of change. In addition, more other factors that may influence the photosynthesis rate else than electron transport rate, like the rate of the Calvin Cycle could be tested to more accurately determine the rate of photosynthesis.
