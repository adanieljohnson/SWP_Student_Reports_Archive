Title: Increased Juvenile Hormone and Its Effects on the Development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
A hormone called juvenile hormone greatly affects the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars through certain life stages and eventually pupation. In this study, we observed the effects of increased juvenile hormone, or an insect growth regulator, and hypothesized that this increase would prolong the juvenile stage and eventually the larvae would not be able to pupate. Our data showed no significant difference in the change in weight and length when comparing the treatment and the control groups. A reason for this result is that juvenile hormone does act as an insect growth regulator before the wandering stage which means that the caterpillars gained weight and delayed their progress towards pupation but after the wandering stage, juvenile hormone has the opposite effect and no longer acts as an insect growth regulator. The hypothesis would have been supported if the experiment had a shorter duration as the Manduca sexta would not have reached the wandering stage.

Introduction:
In this experiment, the group studied the effects of the addition of a growth homone on the growth and development of Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera with a holometabolous life cycle, which means that it goes through four major stages of life and then through metamorphosis into the pupal form. [Johnson: 2018]. Manduca sexta caterpillars develop through a series of life stages, instars 1-5, pupation, and adulthood. The molting between these stages are controlled or regulated by two hormones, ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone. The amounts or concentrations of these hormones greatly affect the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Juvenile hormone is a long chain of organic molecules produced by the corpus allata in the foregut of the caterpillar [Johnson: 2018]. This hormone is responsible for regulating the type of molt that Manduca sexta undergoes during its development stages. This experiment will focus on altering the levels of juvenile hormone in order to see how it affects the development of the caterpillars. One experiment, that was performed in the past, treated Leptinotarsa decemlineata or the Colorado potato beetle with juvenile hormone. The experiment revealed that treating the Leptinotarsa decemlineata with the addition of juvenile hormone would delay the onset of pupation and prevent the emergence of an adult [Koopmanschap: 1989].  The lab group predicts that if the Manduca sexta caterpillar’s levels of juvenile hormone were increased, the juvenile stage would be prolonged such that the larvae would fail to pupate. 

Materials and Methods:
During this experiment, eight caterpillars of the same life stage were divided into two groups of four. The control group was fed food with just water added to it while the treatment group was fed food with five drops (0.25 mL) of Precor 1:1250, or 3% juvenile hormone, added to it.  Each caterpillar was given 10g of food in their container cell per their group.  The food was replenished as needed over the duration of the experiment. This experiment lasted for a duration of twelve days. The caterpillars were kept in a container that was segmented so that each caterpillar had its own space and were easily identifiable as the segments were labeled. The containers were then kept in an incubator at 25.0°C on a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle. The caterpillars were weighed on a standard lab balance individually and measured in centimeters daily. The growth and development of each caterpillar were recorded in order to more closely observe how the addition of juvenile hormone would affect their development and eventual pupation. At the end of the experiment, the data was put into a two-sample t-test to calculate a two-tailed p-value to evaluate if they were significantly different. 

Results:
The mean for weight gained by the control group was 6.46g +/- 1.46g while the mean for the treatment group was 8.575g +/- 1.32g (Figure 1). The mean for length gained by the control group was 3.4cm +/- 1.29cm while the mean for the treatment group was 4.25cm +/- 1.24cm (Figure 2). This experiment revealed that the treatment group that received 3% juvenile hormone correlated with the greater weight gain when compared to the control group (t-value= -2.149, degrees of freedom= 5.940, p-value=0.076). It also revealed that the treatment group generally grew more in length than the control group on average (t-value= -0.952, degrees of freedom= 5.990, p-value= 0.378). 

Discussion:
This experiment concluded that the hypothesis was not supported as our p-values reveal that our data was not significantly different. The data is not significantly different which means that there is no support in our experiment that an increase in juvenile hormone levels will lead to a prolonged juvenile period or cause the larvae to not go through pupation. If the experiment had only lasted for ten days, the hypothesis would have most likely been supported. This is due to how the caterpillars entered into the wandering stage around day 11 where they began to lose weight instead of continuing to gain weight. When the caterpillars reached the wandering stage, they began to lose weight and prepared to pupate. This caused the mean weights recorded for the days where the wandering stage was occurring to be decreased and therefore affect the overall difference in weight. This, therefore, affected the statistical results of the data in that it increased the p-value which caused the experiment to not be statistically significant and affected the outcome of the experiment. One study came to a similar conclusion that juvenile hormone causes an increase in weight and a delay in the development of the caterpillars before the wandering stage whereas after the wandering stage, juvenile hormone has the opposite effect [Safranek: 1980]. After the wandering stage, juvenile hormone actually causes a decrease in weight and an earlier pupation stage [Safranek: 1980]. The wandering stage occurs right before the pre-pupation stage and therefore is preparing the caterpillar for pupation. There is actually a shift in the role that juvenile hormone plays in the control of Manduca sexta development. While it plays one role before the wandering stage, it plays the exact opposite role after the wandering stage. Juvenile hormone acts as an insect growth regulator before the wandering stage and therefore causes the Manduca sexta caterpillar to not reach the commitment pulse that is necessary for pupation. Then, after the wandering stage, juvenile hormone no longer acts as an insect growth regulator as the Manduca sexta starts to lose weight to prepare for pupation [Safranek: 1980]. Therefore, for future experiments, it would be important to closely observe when the wandering stage occurs and possibly conclude the experiment on the day that the treatment group starts to lose weight.
