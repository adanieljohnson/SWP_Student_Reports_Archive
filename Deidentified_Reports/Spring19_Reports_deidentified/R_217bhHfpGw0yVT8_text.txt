Title: Affect of Temperature and Light intensity on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleracea  

Abstract:
This experiment was done in order to explore how temperature and light exposure affects the photosynthetic activity of the Spinacia oleracea. Spinacia oleracea has optimal survival conditions of 30℃ and decent light exposure. In order to test how temperature and light exposure affect the photosynthetic activity of Spinacia oleracea samples were prepared and placed in light and dark conditions and a combination of high temperature, room temperature and low temperature conditions; The absorbances of the solutions were taken every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. It was predicted that the dark lower temperature experimental group will have the lowest average change in photosynthetic activity. The average change in photosynthetic activity of the light high temperature experimental group was the highest and the light and dark low temperature condition groups were similar in that they were very low in change in photosynthetic activity. It is believed that the light high temperature experimental group had the highest average change in photosynthetic activity because the conditions were most similar to the optimal growing conditions for Spinacia oleracea. 


Introduction:
While most plants rely on the presence of light in order to participate in photosynthesis, temperature while not as important is also a factor of effective photosynthesis. Extreme temperatures and/or light intensity can have an effect on photosynthesis especially if the plant is not well equipped to adapt to these extreme conditions. For example, an experiment done on Potamotagen pectinatus L. revealed the light and temperature dependence of its photosynthetic rates [Adams: 1989]. The spinach leaf, Spinacia oleracea, is native to central and western Asia and in 2016 the world production of spinach was 26.7 tonnes. Spinacia oleracea is mainly grown in China where the environmental conditions allow for optimal growth. Spinacia oleracea, like many other plants, utilize Photosystems in its chloroplasts in order to metabolize light into usable energy. For example, Photosystem II is the initial protein complex that relies on the presence of light for activation in order to start the cascade that produces ATP in the stroma of the chloroplasts. In this experiment we explored what factors, such as environmental conditions and chemicals, would affect the efficiency of photosystem II in Spinacia oleracea. While considering that Spinacia oleracea’s optimal temperature has been reported to be around 30℃ [Hikosaka: 1997]and that Photosystem II relies on the presence of light for activation, Spinacia oleracea were placed under conditions that altered light intensity and temperature as a simulated environmental factor. Essentially, under what conditions do Spinacia oleracea leaves start to see a decline or increase in their photosynthetic level? This study of the proper conditions of Spinacia oleracea is important because the optimal growth conditions need to be observed so that the crop can continue to be grown efficiently. Taking into account that Spinacia oleracea grows optimally in light and 30℃ conditions, we predict that the experimental groups placed in the dark and lower temperatures conditions will have the lowest levels of chloroplasts as the plant will not be able to efficiently utilize Photosystem II in the chloroplasts. 


Materials and Methods:
Acquire~5 spinach leaves and remove the large veins then place into a mortar and pestle. Crush the leaves and then add 10mL of a grinding buffer and grind until it makes a thick paste. Add an additional 10mL of a grinding buffer to make a slurry. Strain the slurry with a cheesecloth and transfer the liquid into a beaker. Transfer 1mL of the slurry liquid into a microtube labeled “A” and place on ice. Transfer the rest of the slurry liquid into a centrifuge tube labeled “Chloroplasts”. Place appropriate balance centrifuge tubes and spin the slurry liquid for 5 minutes at 200G.  Pour the supernatant out of the centrifuge tube labeled “Chloroplasts” into another chilled centrifuge tube labeled “Chloroplasts 2”. Leave the pellet of debris in the “Chloroplasts” tube. Label 31 clean test tubes and turn on the spectrophotometer to read at 600nm. Fill one tube with 8mL water and 2mL 100mM phosphate (Reaction Buffer), this is your blank. Fill the remaining tubes with 6mL water, 2mL 130mM DCIP and 2mL 100mM Phosphate (Reaction Buffer); keeping in mind that 5 tubes will be placed in each: light low temperature, light room temperature, light high temperature, dark low temperature, dark room temperature and dark high temperature conditions. When you are ready to begin the assay, add 100μL of the enriched chloroplasts from “Chloroplasts 2” into each of the test tubes. Mix each tube immediately and place each into spectrophotometer cuvettes and IMMEDIATELY blank the spectophotometer at 600nm using your blank. Then IMMEDIATELY measure the absorbances of all the samples at 600nm, this is your Time Zero data. Place 5 tubes into each light and temperature condition and wait 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer then read the absorbance of each sample and return each sample to their respective light and temperature conditions. Wait another 10 minutes (20 minutes total) and repeat. Wait another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) and repeat. Multiple T-tests were run in order to validate the data. The room temperature and ice bucket, water bath and room temperature, and water basket and ice bucket groups were compared from both light and dark conditions. 


Results:
The use of the spectrophotometer was to show Photosystem II activity based on change in absorbance; the greater the change in absorbance the greater the Photosystem II activity. Figure 1 shows us that the general trends that we saw were that the low temperature light and dark groups had the lowest change in absorbance over time as compared to the room temperature and high temperature light and dark groups. Between the Room Temperature and High Temperature, the group exposed to light had the highest average change in absorbance as compared to the group exposed to dark conditions, even though the results were found to be insignificant. The group exposed to light had a significantly larger average change in absorbance under room temperature and high temperature conditions. The low temperature conditions yielded around the same average change in absorbance for both the light and dark conditions. Overall, the light conditions typically had a higher average change in absorbance than the dark conditions group. The conditions with the greatest average change in absorbance was the light high temperature condition. T-tests revealed that from the comparison for light and dark groups under the room temperature and ice bucket conditions (p=0.0169), water bath and room temperature conditions (p=0.116), and water bath and ice bucket conditions (p=0.000156). Outliers had to be removed in order to validate the data. 


Discussion:
  Considering that the groups under light conditions in room and high temperatures had the highest average change in absorbance, this means that Photosystem II was most active under these conditions. Although the light high temperature group was found to be insignificant compared to the light room temperature, the light room temperature was still found to be significant compared to the ice bucket conditions.  Nevertheless, the high average change in absorbance of the light room temperature group could potentially be due the room temperature, 23℃, being closer to the optimal thermal conditions for Spinacia oleracea, 30℃ [Hikosaka: 1997]. As the temperature is closer to its optimal temperature, Photosystem II must have been more active in more chloroplasts for the average change in absorbance to be so large. As a result, Photosystem II must have been least active in the groups that were in low temperatures as they had the lowest average change in absorbance due to the conditions being so far from optimal thermal conditions so it must have been too cold for the chloroplasts to have active Photosystem II complexes. This is similar to the experiment done on Potamogeten pectinatus L  where they concluded that the photosynthetic rate of the plant was dependent on light and temperature conditions [Adams: 1989] It is possible that the outliers and insignificance in our data could have been caused by the dark condition groups not being fully immersed in dark as we had to move them into the light to measure the absorbances. A further study must be done in order to isolate the dark group so that they are only exposed to dark conditions. This study was important because it proved that Spinacia oleracea prospers at temperatures around 23-35℃ and in lighted conditions. This can be applied to the growth of Spinach in an agricultural setting since Spinach is produced in such large quantities; This study now allows for optimal growth of the Spinacia oleracea plant.
