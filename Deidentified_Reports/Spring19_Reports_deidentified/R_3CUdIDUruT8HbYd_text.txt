Title:  Effects of Gentrol and Azaguard on Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
The pest control industry has been using chemicals that mimic JH (an important insect hormone) to reduce insect survival and reproduction. This experiment used [Manduca sexta] to test the effects of JH mimics and inhibitors on development. JH is a critical hormone in most insects and it regulates the type of molting in development. This experiment used two types of chemicals, Azaguard and Gentrol, to manipulate JH. We hypothesized that Gentrol would likely interfere with adult development and the Azaguard group will grow significantly less growth than both groups. 8 [Manduca sexta] were separated into Gentrol, Azaguard or control groups and the effects of these chemicals on their weight and length was recorded over a 2-week period. For the first week 4 were control, 2 were Azaguard and 2 were Gentrol and for the second week the 2 that were being fed Azaguard switched into the Gentrol group so we had 4 controls and 4 Gentrol for week 2. The Azaguard group showed significantly less growth over the first week compared to both the control and Gentrol, proving our hypothesis. For the second week there were no significant differences between weight and length for the Gentrol and control groups but the controls did begin to pupate while the Gentrols did not.  

Introduction:
This experiment used [Manduca sexta] to test the effects of JH mimics and inhibitors on development. [Manducaa sexta] were used because of their quick maturation period. JH and ecdysteroids both play key roles in development and regulate multiple functions in adult insects During development the ratio of ecdysteroids to JH is crucial. JH regulates the type of molting while ecdysteroids regulate the timing of molting. During the commitment pulse, the caterpillar is exposed to rising ecdysteroids and very low JH simultaneously for the first time. These levels signal to the caterpillar it is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate. If the JH and ecdysteroids levels are off balance it can throw off the signal leading to problems with development and functioning or even death. This experiment used two types of chemicals, Azaguard and Gentrol, to manipulate JH. Gentrol is a JH mimic and it inhibits the growth of maturity and stunts the ability to reproduce (Goodman 1). Azaguard prevents molting between larval, pupal, and nymphal stages (Taylor 1). This experiment is important because the pest control industry has been using chemicals like these to reduce insect survival and reproduction. Since JH is key for development in [Manduca sexta] both JH inhibitors and mimics will have an effect on the growth compared to control. Gentrol will likely interfere with adult development and the Azaguard group will grow significantly less than both groups.



Materials and Methods:
2 containers were prepared for the caterpillars and 2 holes were punctured in each cell. The containers were labeled with our group’s names, TA, section. ~10g of food were prepared for each caterpillar. The control group’s food was treated with water and the Gentrol and Azaguard groups were treated with a few drops of each respective solution. One 10g blob of food was placed in each cell. 8 caterpillars were weighed and measured then placed in the containers. 2 control groups were placed in each container along with 1 Gentrol group and 1 Azaguard group the same was done for the second container so there were 4 controls, 2 Gentrols, and 2 Azaguard. The caterpillars were observed daily to ensure they had adequate food. The caterpillars were weighed and measured again after 7 days. At the end of 7 days the two Azaguard group members began to be fed Gentrol and become a part of the Gentrol group so there were 4 control caterpillars and 4 Gentrol caterpillars for week 2. 

Results:
After observing and feeding the [Manduca sexta] for one week we saw a significant difference between Azaguard and the control group and between the Azaguard group and the Gentrol group for weight (p-value = 0.0056) as shown in Figure 1. There was also a significant change in length for week 1 between Azaguard and the control group and between the Azaguard group and the Gentrol group (p-value = 0.024) as shown in Figure 2. Most members of control group looked large and plump at the end of 7 days. The Gentrol group also looked large and plump but had a lighter tint to them. The Azaguard group appeared much smaller and darker than the members of the other groups. 
After the next seven days following when we switched the Azaguard [Manduca sexta] to Gentrol we saw that the Control group actually experienced a significant loss in length compared to the Gentrol group (p-value = 0.048) as shown in Figure 3. There was no significant change in weight for the second week as shown in Figure 4. The members of the control group appeared darker than the rest of the groups and some even began to pupate. Two members of the Gentrol group who were fed Gentrol over the entirety of the two weeks appeared much larger than the other [Manduca sexta] and continue to have a much lighter color than the rest. The other two Gentrol caterpillars who were fed Azaguard first then Gentrol appeared extremely small and dark and one died during the experiment. 




Discussion:
Our hypotheses were that Gentrol would likely interfere with adult development and the Azaguard group would grow significantly less than both groups. The second part of our hypothesis was proven by the results in Figures 1 and 2 that show significantly less growth in the Azaguard groups compared with the control and the Gentrol. From previous research on Gentrol it was suspected that as a JH mimic it would inhibit the growth of maturity of [Manduca sexta]. This hypothesis that Gentrol will likely inihibit growth of maturity was proven by the fact that none of the Gentrol group members showed signs of pupating while the Control group did. However, we didn’t see this change reflected in the length and weight data for week 2 mostly because as the controls began to pupate they began to get smaller and form a hard-brown exterior. So even though the controls were further along in development the weight and length were unable to reflect that. Timing of pupating or signs of pupating probably would have been a better measurement to consider for week 2.
