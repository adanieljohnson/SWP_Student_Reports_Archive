Title: Effect of High Nitrate Composition in Soil on the Resource Allocation in Field Peas

Abstract:
For any species to survive, they must be able to adapt to any changes that occur in the environment. Plants are one of the best models to study for resource allocation due to their lack of locomotion. However, for most plant growers around the world, fertilizer is used which increases nitrate levels in the soil and increase plant growth. This study will observe the impact that high nitrate levels have on the resource allocations of the roots and shoots of field pea (Pisum sativun). A high nitrate level could result in less energy being allocated to the roots, which leads to a lower root to shoot ratio of the plant. The field pea plants were grown for two weeks and watered every two days. 2.5 grams of Soda of Nitrate was added to the experimental group pots, and then the root to shoot ratio was calculated based on mass in grams. After running a two-tailed T-test, it was found that there was no statistical significance between the two data sets. It is possible that the plants used had a high variability between them, or that the experiment needs to run longer to see the effects. It is also possible that the nitrate level of the typical soil was high, and that the experiment should find the ratios between a controll group and a nitrate deficient group.

Introduction:
In any environment, plants and animals’ survival depends on how they can interact with the biotic and abiotic factors in their environment. The plant species observed for this study were the field peas (Pisum sativun), and the advantage of plants is that it is much simpler to observe plants interaction with its environment due to lack of locomotion, and it is easy to observe how they allocate their energy resources. Due to certain abiotic or biotic factors in an environment, plants will change how much energy they allocate to growth in different areas of its plant body [Mašková: 2018]. These areas are the roots, the shoot and the leaves of the plants. Certain environmental factors such as rainfall, soil composition, sunlight, and nearby competition. Roots have two basic functions for the plant’s survival. They are responsible for anchoring the plant to the ground and absorbing nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, water, and sulfur from the soil [Uga: 2015]. Plants can have symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil, which can reduce the amount of energy the plant needs to spend on growing roots [Liu: 2018]. The shoot is the main structure for the plant, and its height can help against nearby competition for sunlight. The leaves of the plant are the main body of the plant that is responsible for photosynthesis, harvesting sunlight into energy that the plant can use [Johnson: 2016]. 

Many modern-day plant growers like to use commercial fertilizer to improve the growth of the plant by increasing the amount of nitrate in the soil. However, changing the environment in that aspect may cause the energy allocation of the roots to decrease and result in shorter roots. This can then cause the plant not to be as firMly anchored into the ground and can cause the plant to easily be removed from the soil due to a large amount of runoff or extreme weather. This study will observe the effects on the resource allocation with a high nitrate composition, to see if a decrease in root size is observed. Our group hypothesizes the plant should spend less energy on roots due to the high availability of the nitrogen. Therefore, the root to shoot ratio should be less, than plants in a normal nitrate environment. 


Materials and Method:
The growth of the plants
Two pots or replicates were made for the experimental and controll groups for this experiment. The pot was first filled halfway with soil and then damped with a little bit of water. Then for the experimental group, 2.5 grams of Soda of Nitrate was added to the damped soil and spread mixed thoroughly. Then for both groups, and hand.f.ul of field pea seeds were added to the soil, and then the pot was filled to the top with more soil. The field peas for both groups were placed in a greenhouse with adequate levels of sunlight for both groups and were watered every two days and allowed to grow for two weeks.

Determining Root to Shoot Ratio
Three plants were chosen from each pot for data collection, which resulted in a total of six different ratios for the experimental and the controll groups. The pot of field peas was placed into a large container that was filled up to an inch in water. The roots of the plants were carefully separated from the soil in the pot. Then the plants were rinsed to remove any other remaining debris from the soil, and dried using paper towels. After the plants are dried, they were cut at the root-shoot junction using a pair of scissors. Then the root and shoot of the plant were weighed separately for each plant (in grams) and recorded to calculate the ratios.

Statistical Test
A two-tailed T-test was used to determine if there was a statistical significance between the root to shoot ratios of the experimental group versus the controll group.


Results:
The average root to shoot ratio of the field pea plants that were grown in a high nitrate environment had an average ratio of 0.585, while the plants grown in a controll environment had a ratio of 0.4948. After running a two-tailed T-test on the data, the p_value was calculated to be 0.265, which is greater than 0.05.

Discussion:
After analyzing the standard deviation error bars from Figure 1, and the results from the two-tailed T-test, the conclusion that the root to shoot ratios between the high nitrate and controll field peas is not statistically significent. This means that our hypothesis that the root growth and the root to shoot ratio of the nitrate field peas would be lower than the controll group cannot be accepted. There were many trials for each group. However, the plants themselves could have just been varied in height. The growing conditions for one of the plants used in the experiment could have differed from others due to soil composition or uneven watering of the plants. 

Another interpretation of the data could indicate that the experiment was not designed correctly. Even though we add 2.5 grams of nitrate, it is possible that in the controll group, the soil that was used for the experiment also had enough nitrate for the field peas to use. To confirm this hypothesis, we could analyze the nitrate levels of the soil used for the controll groups, compared to the nitrate levels with regular soil added with 2.5 grams of Soda of Nitrate. If there is an enough nitrate in the normal soil, then that could have reached a threshold for the plant and resulted in no difference in resource allocation between the experimental and controll groups. Instead we should experiment the effect on the effects of a nitrate deficiency on the resource allocation and could result in data that supports our initial hypothesis.

However, there could be another biological explanation for the results of this experiment. Researchers in China have studied the ligase OsSIZ2 in rice and the response to nitrogen that occur. OsSIZ2 has been found to have an impact on plant growth, and its expression was found to increase during a nitrogen deficiency [Pei: 2019]. It is possible that there is a decrease in OsSIZ2 during a nitrogen sufficiency, as in our study, which would result in a reduction of plant growth. No study has been conducted on the OsSIZ2 on field peas, but a simple real-time qPCR analysis could determine if that ligase exists in the field peas used for this experiment. If it does, then it is possible that the nitrogen sufficiency might have decreased both the size of the shoot and the roots, which leveled out the ratios for this experiment.
