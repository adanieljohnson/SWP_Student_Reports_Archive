Title: Lidocaine’s Effect on the Contractile Force of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Lidocaine is an important chemical that is used around the world for different purposes such as in dentist offices and in some home remedies for its numbing properties. While it does have numbing properties, it has a major effect on the contractile force of a muscle as it blocks calcium. In this study, lidocaine’s effects were studied on the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens. It was expected that the injection of lidocaine, or another calcium blocker, into the gastrocnemius muscle would cause a much weaker muscle contraction. Three frog legs were stimulated by electrical shock before and after an injection of lidocaine to determine the twitch threshold difference between the two groups. The results of the experiment revealed that there was a significant difference among the frog legs strength of contraction before and after the injection of lidocaine. Lidocaine restricts the calcium such that it is not able to activate the mechanism necessary for proper muscle contraction and therefore causes the muscle to relax. Further studies on lidocaine would be beneficial as lidocaine’s ability to relax muscles could be useful for other purposes in the body such as reducing bronchospasms in the airway or reducing muscle spasticity in general. 

Introduction:
Neuromuscular control plays a vital role in sensing and responding to internal and external environments. The neuromuscular system consists of nerves and muscles that can respond within milliseconds via action potentials to changes in their different environments [Johnson: 2018]. This process involves action potentials that cause the neuron to release acetylcholine which binds to a receptor on the muscle to open sodium channels that generate action potentials in the muscle fiber. These action potentials stimulate the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which activates the contraction mechanism in the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. Altering the calcium levels in a muscle will affect the muscle’s ability to contract. The action potential in the muscle fibers, that occurs due to the presence of calcium, is what results in muscle contraction. This experiment studied the effects of blocking calcium on the ability of the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens to contract. This experiment focused on the difference in twitch threshold, or the minimum amount of electrical stimulus needed to cause a response of muscle contraction, of a frog leg before and after blocking calcium. One experiment, that was performed in the past, treated humans with lidocaine to observe its effects on bronchospasms. They concluded that lidocaine reduced the severity of the bronchospasms which means that the muscles were less likely to contract due to reduced calcium [Groeben: 2007]. It is predicted that if the calcium in a frog’s gastrocnemius muscle is blocked, then the frog’s ability to contract the muscle will decrease as there will be less calcium to cause the action potentials in the muscle which would result in a decrease in the intensity of the muscle contraction as a reduction of calcium causes difficulty in muscle contraction.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment utilized the lower section of three frog legs, emphasizing the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle in order to measure nerve and muscle activity before and after calcium was blocked. After isolating the sciatic nerve from the muscle, the probe was directly attached to the sciatic nerve by laying the sciatic nerve over the probe. The probe was connected to software that allowed shocks of varying intensities to be delivered. A string was tied from the leg to the measurement tool that was connected to software. This provided a numerical value that was precise but not accurate for the intensity of the muscle contraction. This describes how the numerical data is not an accurate measurement of the response but rather allows for relative comparison among the frogs legs measured on the same device. The voltage used to stimulate the nerve allows for contractions of different intensities to be observed and recorded at different intervals. Each trial was begun by electrically shocking the leg at certain intervals in order to determine the minimum voltage where the leg would contract, or the twitch threshold. It was important to determine the twitch threshold in order to learn the minimum voltage at which the legs would successfully contract. This, therefore, could be applied when electrically shocking the legs after the injection of lidocaine to ensure that the legs would contract. The specimen must have been observed at all times to verify the data. This procedure was performed before and after the injection of 0.1mL of 25mM lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle. This lidocaine was injected in two different spots in increments of 0.05mL and was allowed to set in for at least five minutes in order for the lidocaine to have an effect. The twitch threshold was observed, recorded and compared between the legs before the injection of lidocaine and after. A one-tailed paired t-test was used to evaluate the data by imputing the response in voltage for each frog leg at its twitch threshold and comparing the control and treatment responses. 

Results:
It was revealed that the contractile force for the treatment group was significantly decreased when compared to the control group. The control group was found to contract normally at each leg’s threshold while after the injection of lidocaine, the legs hardly contracted at their twitch thresholds. Overall, the treatment group contracted with lesser force than the control group. The average twitch threshold for the control group before the injection of lidocaine was 0.06367 +/- 0.00736V (Figure 1). Comparatively, the average twitch threshold for the treatment group after the injection of lidocaine was 0.005 +/- 0.000000000004V (Figure 1). This experiment revealed that the treatment group generally produced a response of lesser voltage than the control group (t-value= 9.587, degrees of freedom= 2, p-value=0.0107). 

Discussion:
This experiment concluded that the hypothesis was supported as the p-value reveals that the data was significantly different. The data is significantly different which means that there is support in our experiment for our hypothesis that a calcium blocker, such as lidocaine, will cause the frog’s ability to contract the gastrocnemius muscle to decrease. For each frog leg, the contractile force at the leg’s twitch threshold decreased significantly after the injection of lidocaine. Lidocaine causes the calcium, that is normally released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum due to action potentials in the muscle fibers, to be blocked and therefore not have the ability to activate the mechanism that causes the muscles to shorten and contract [Johnson:2018]. Evidence from another experiment reveal that this outcome should be supported as lidocaine inhibits the increased uptake of calcium in the acetylcholine-triggered response cascade in charge of the contractile mechanism [Kai: 1993]. Therefore, the injection of lidocaine, or a calcium blocker, into the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens decreased the twitch tension of the muscle and the leg did not contract as forcefully when electrically stimulated. To parallel lidocaine’s effects on the gastrocnemius skeletal muscle, this experiment also described how lidocaine directly relaxes the smooth muscle in the airway as the decrease in mobilization of calcium is a universal muscle response [Kai: 1993]. With the mobilization of calcium being decreased, calcium is not able to activate the contractile force or mechanism needed to contract the muscle with a greater amount of force. Studying the effects of lidocaine on frog legs allows for the ability of lidocaine to relax muscles to become more apparent and therefore, more studies on lidocaine could be performed in order to discover its possible uses in other parts of the body such as relaxing the muscles in the airway like bronchospasms or for just assisting in the relief of those people who have trouble with muscle spasms. Further studies of lidocaine may be beneficial in solving problems with muscle spasticity throughout the entire body.
