Title: The Effect of Herbicides and Pesticides on the Chloroplast Activity of Spinach Plants

Abstract:
	NaCl is an herbicide that is primarily responsible for inhibiting the growth of invasive plants that primarily destroy niches. Paquat is a pesticide that is primarily responsible for attacking ants, roaches, and beetles, but also function in inhibiting the growth of multiple plant species. Previous studies indicated that NaCl and Paquat inhibit the light dependent reactions by causing conformational changes in PSII and PSI. The purpose of the study was to test the effect of 100 mM of NaCl and 100 mM of Paquat on the chloroplast activity in spinach leaves. Five test tubes were composed of the NaCl assay, while 5 other test tubes were composed of Paquat assay. Each of the assays absorbances’ were measured before exposure to light and measured after 20 minutes exposure to light. The changes in absorbances were recorded. The results showed that Paquat had the lowest average change in absorbance, while NaCl had the highest average change in absorbance. The results were considered to be statistically significant (p=0.038), proving the efficiency of Paquat. 

Introduction:
To perform certain functions and survive, organisms need to generate and store energy. Organisms can obtain energy through the consumption of animals or produce their own energy sources. Autotrophs like plants, some protists, and photosynthetic bacteria utilize photosynthesis to absorb the photons from sunlight, and convert the light energy into chemical, or glucose. To proceed forward, photosynthesis depends on light dependent and light independent reactions. Light dependent reactions involve Photosystem II and Photosystem I, which are responsible for energizing electrons and activating certain molecules that create a proton gradient. In Photosystem II, the excited electrons reduce plastoquinone and the hydrolysis of water drives the electrons from the plastoquinone to cytochrome b6f, which in turn transfers the electrons to plantacyanin where a proton gradient is established [Mühlbauer: 1998]. Photosystem I involves the transfer of electrons, reduction of NADP to NADPH, and the creation of a proton gradient. The light independent reaction uptakes carbon from the atmosphere using Rubisco (RuBP) and uses the activated molecules from the light dependent reaction to create glucose. The efficiency of these reactions helps to determine the chloroplast activity of an autotroph organism [Mühlbauer: 1998] .
	The agricultural industry, gardening, and niches rely on chloroplast activity. Niches contain stable food webs, where the tropic levels are maintained by a constant flow of energy. If an invasive plant species were to invade a food web, the energy levels in the tropic levels would decrease and cause a variety of species to perish. Farms and gardens require increased levels of chloroplast activity, in order to produce a high output of crops. These plots of land are at risk of pathogens and pests, which destroy the structures of the crops [Qian: 2009]. In order to protect both agricultural and niche crops, herbicides and pesticides prevent the spread of both pathogens and invasive species. Herbicides inhibit the plant growth by lowering chloroplast activity. An herbicide like NaCl increases Cl- ion concentration in the plant cytoplasm and bind to a polypeptide (23 kDa) in PSII, which inhibits the transfer of electrons . Additionally, NaCl increases the K+/Na+ ion concentration in channels of PSII and PSI, which lowers the energy of the electrons [Sudhir: 2004]. But NaCl has been proven to allow photosynthetic reactions to proceed, by increasing the phosphorylation in the light independent reaction. Meanwhile, certain pesticides inhibit plant growth. Paraquat is a pesticide that is absorbed by plant leaves and inhibits photosynthesis by accepting electrons from PSI. This prevents NADPH from being reducing, stopping the PSI process entirely [Qian: 2009]. 
	To understand the effectiveness of both NaCl and Paquat, an experiment can be modeled using spinach leaves. The purpose of the experiment is to observe the effects of NaCl and Paquat on the overall chloroplast activity. It was hypothesized that if 100 mM of Paquat  or 100 mM NaCl was placed into a chloroplast assay, then the chloroplast activity will be inhibited the most by Paquat. 


Materials and Methods:
First, a mortar and pestle, a medium sized-beaker, and 50 mL centrifuge tubes were packed into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle cooled, the central veins of four-medium sized spinach leaves were removed, and the spinach were placed in the mortar and pestle. The leaves were grinded with a 10 mL of grinding buffer, pH of 8. The solution was grinded until it became a paste. The solution was filtered through a cheesecloth and was poured into a centrifuge for 10 minutes. Then, sixteen test tubes were labeled and set aside. The first test tube was a blank which contained 8 mL of water, no DCIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The next five test tubes were labeled “light” and contained 8 mL of water, 2 mL DCIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The next five were labeled “herbicide” and contained 8 mL of water, 2 mL DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 2 mL of 100 mM of NaCl. The next five were labeled “pesticide” and contained 8 mL of water, 2 mL DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 2 mL of 100 mM of Paquat. After the assays were created, 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts were added to all test tubes, except the blank. The assays absorbances’ were measured by a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 600 nm. Afterwards, the assay solutions were placed under a light source for 10 minutes and the absorbances were measured again. The process was repeated twice.

Results:
The absorbances for the herbicide test tubes drastically decreased, indicating that the chloroplast was functioning. Throughout the experiment, the absorbances for the pesticide test tubes remained consistent and did not fluctuate, as compared to the light and herbicide test tubes. The reported average and standard deviation for the herbicide group was 13.837 +/- 8.102 (Figure 1). The reported average and standard deviation for the pesticide group was 6.647 +/- 1.630  (Figure 1). The reported average and standard deviation for the light group was 12.280 +/- 6.902 (Figure 1). From the ANOVA test with an alpha of 0.05, the Fs values was 3.702, with a p-value of 0.038 and degrees freedom (df) of 2. 

Discussion:
The mean of the control group (light) was statistically different that of the experimental group. Therefore, the hypothesis of the experiment was supported. According to Qian, the Paraquat inhibits the light dependent reactions by targeting certain proteins in PSI [Qian: 2009]. Specifically, the Paraquat binds to the molecule on PSI, responsible for reducing NADP to NADPH. As a result, the molecule conformationally changes and disrupts the flow of electrons in the electron transport chain (ETC). Instead, the electrons bind to molecular oxygen and produces charged O2.  Additionally, Paraquat inhibits the expression of rbcl, a gene responsible for expressing Rubisco and allowing for carbon fixation [Qian: 2009]. In the contrary, NaCl did not have a substantial effect on inhibiting the chloroplast activity, since the concentration was not large enough to disrupt the ion channels in PSI and PSII. NaCl attributes to enhancing the phosphorylation in light independent reactions, which allows for the continuation of photosynthesis [Sudhir: 2004]. Further studies can involve increasing the NaCl concentration and observing its effects, but also altering the type of pesticide to determine the survival of certain crops or plants. Results of these studies would help to find ways of maintaining crop fields and ensuring the safety of global environments.
