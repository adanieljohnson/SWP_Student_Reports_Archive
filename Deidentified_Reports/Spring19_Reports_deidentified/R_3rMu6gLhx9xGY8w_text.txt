Title: The Effect of Red and Green light exposure on Root to Shoot ratio in Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
Many interactions between plants occur as they all try to obtain the same resources. Plants need light as a resource in order to undergo photosynthesis. Different colored lights have different wavelengths of energy, and therefore growing plants in different colored lights has shown to impact the structure of the plants. The hypothesis of this experiment is that if radish plants are grown in red and green light exposures, then the plants exposed to red light will have a higher root to shoot ratio because plants are unable to process green light well. Radish plants were grown in red and green light boxes, and their root:shoot ratios for length and weight were recorded after two weeks. The results showed that the length root:shoot ratio was higher in the plants grown under green light than in plants grown under red light. This could have been because the plants grown in green light used their nutrients to grow longer roots, because they were unable to undergo photosynthesis. 



Introduction:
In natural settings, plants exhibit patterns of phenotypic variation depending on environmental factors. No one design is optimal in many environments, so a variation of designs naturally exist [Schmid: 1992]. A number of factors influence the way plants grow and interact. Biotic factors in an environment originate from other organisms whereas abiotic factors are nonliving stimuli such as wind, temperature, and sunlight. These factors cause many interactions between plants as they all try to obtain the same resources. Along with this, resource limitation affects what species are able to survive in a community. In an attempt to overcome this, species evolve to use certain strategies to survive and give up on others which is called trade off [Johnson: 2018]. This relates to resource allocation in Raphanus sativus, the radish plant. The plants have three main parts roots, stems, and leaves, which allow it to obtain resources and grow. The stems and leaves are necessary for undergoing photosynthesis to provide energy for the plant. The roots are necessary for obtaining water and nutrients from the soil. The ratios of roots to shoots depend on what resources are available to the plant [Johnson: 2018]. If there is a lack of water in the soil, the plant will grow longer roots to obtain the maximum water possible. If there is abundant water, the longer roots are not necessary. Plants cannot grow or survive without light, as it is the resource that allows them to undergo photosynthesis. Different colors of light have different wavelengths of energy [Folta: 2007]. This experiment aims to determine if plants exposed to red and green light will grow with different root to shoot ratios. Research has shown the that the long wavelengths of red light have shown to be inefficient for undergoing photosynthesis [Folta: 2007]. However, plants’ ability to process green light is poor compared to red light [Folta: 2007]. It was predicted that radish plants exposed to red light will have a higher root:shoot ratio than radish plants exposed to green light because plants are unable to process green light. 



Materials and Methods:
Radish seeds were planted in four separate pots of soil. After the seeds were planted, 100 mL of water and 100 mL of Miracle Grow was added to each pot. Two of the pots were placed in a box with a green light inside and two were placed in a similar box with red light. The plants were watered with 100 mL everyday for two weeks. After two weeks, the pots were removed from the light boxes. Each pot was placed in a tray of water and five individual plant stems were removed from each. Placing the entire contents of each pot in the water allowed for each entire stem and roots to be removed in one piece. The 10 selected plants from the green light were separated into two parts, the stem and leaf, and the root. The weights (g) and lengths (cm) of each individual piece were recorded and the root to shoot ratios were calculated for each plant. The same procedure was used to determine the root:shoot ratios for the plants in red light. An unpaired t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the root:shoot ratios of plants grown in red light and plants grown in green light. 


Results:
The results showed that the length Root:Shoot ratio was higher in the plants grown under green light than in plants grown under red light (t-value=2.57, df=18, p-value=0.019) (Figure 1). The average length Root:Shoot ratio for red light was 0.530±0.240 and for green light was 0.916±0.410. The weight Root:Shoot ratio was slightly higher in plants grown under red light than in plants grown in green light (t-value=1.14, df=18, p-value=0.26). The average weight Root: Shoot ratio for red light was 0.048± 0.049. The average weight Root:Shoot ratio for green light was 0.030±0.011. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that radish plants grown under red light will have a higher root:shoot ratio than radish plants exposed to green light was not supported. The results showed that plants grown under green light had a higher height root:shoot ratio and was statistically significant. The root:shoot ratio for weight was not statistically significant and therefore cannot support our hypothesis. It was predicted that plants grown in green light would have larger stems and leaves as they would have a more difficult time undergoing photosynthesis. This is because the green chlorophyll in plants, responsible for photosynthesis, may have difficulty absorbing the same color light [Folta: 2007]. A reason that this hypothesis was not supported could have been that the plants in green light could have used their nutrients to grow longer roots, because they were unable to undergo photosynthesis. Green light has also shown to be effectively absorbed, but not processed well by the leaves of green plants [Sun: 1998]. Plants cannot effectively absorb the long wavelengths of red light, but it is slightly more efficient than green light because of the longer wavelength and differing color from chlorophyll [Folta: 2007]. This allowed the leaves and stems of plants grown under red light to grow larger than the plants in green light, lowering the root:shoot ratio. The green light appeared closer to white, and it is possible that the color was not strong enough to show the true effects in the plants and this also could have impacted the results.
