Title: Resource Allocation of Raphanus Raphanistrum (Radish Plants) in Nitrogen-rich Soil:

Abstract:
In order to survive, plants must learn to obtain and use their limited resources in the most efficient way possible. Resource allocation is vital to survival as plants use a technique known as phenotypic plasticity to direct resources to the specific parts of the plants in need based off of the environmental conditions they find themselves in. This experiment focuses on the allocation plasticity of the Raphanus raphanistrum (radish) plant. Nitrogen is an important resource that all plants need to grow and mature. It was found that high concentrations of nitrogen in the soil may inhibit growth in the root system as a whole in plants.  With this understanding, it is hypothesized that the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil will be lower than the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown under normal conditions.  After running a two-sample t-test, a p-value of 0.077 was calculated, meaning that the data was not statistically significant. These findings may be contributed to the use of Miracle-Gro, resulting in nitrogen burn in the radish plants placed in the nitrogen enriched soil.


Introduction:
Ecological communities are never stagnant, rather, they change over time. To keep up with the environment around them and stay fit, resident plants and animals must interact with and adapt to each other. This environmental stimuli is known as biotic factors. Likewise, abiotic factors are nonliving sources that also encourage adaptation, such as water, air and the focus of this experiment, soil. Both factors play a large role in everything from reproduction to energy capture. As environments constantly change, the availability of resources found in a specific environment, known as limiting resources, change as well. Limiting resources can act as a selection force on certain species as some individuals within a population pass on fit traits that allow them to better obtain the limited resource. How plants and animals use their limiting resources is known as resource allocation. In plants, resource allocation can be measured by examining their root to shoot length ratio. In response to their environmental conditions, plants can change where they focus their energy, known as phenotypic plasticity, where growth patterns are seen to change over time. 
In this experiment the phenotypic plasticity of plants will be tested by comparing the growth of Raphanus raphanistrum (radish) plants in different environmental conditions. Radish plants are an ideal plant to test as they are fast growing and exhibit high plasticity [Agrawal:2002]. Part of the Brassicaceae family, the edible root prefers a soil pH of 6.5-7. The radish plant can quickly adapt to environmental conditions which is why it is a common test subject for many plant studies. A similar study conducted by Yang sheds some light on how nitrogen rich soil affects root growth. Plant growth, when utilizing resource allocation, has to be balanced. That being said, when an individual root finds itself in nitrogen rich soil, it increases its growth, in response, the other roots decrease their growth as less resources are sent there [Yang:2005]. The nitrogen rich soil inhibits growth in the root system as the roots do not need to grow as much to find resources, like nitrogen, as they are surrounded by it. [Zhang:1999]. 
These experiments, as well as the one discussed here, are relevant to many agricultural farmers. In order for them to plan out where and how far apart the seedlings should be placed to allow for enough room to grow, they must understand the growth patterns of their crops. Further, nitrogen is a very common ingredient in all fertilizers as all plants need nitrogen to survive. By observing plants in two different environments, a better understanding of nitrogen’s effects on plant growth can be obtained. With the knowledge that nitrogen rich soil may cause an inhibitory effect of the root system of plants, it is hypothesized that the root to shoot length ratio of radish plants will be smaller in the nitrogen rich environment than those grown under normal conditions.


Materials and Methods:
Before setting up the experiment, around 60 radish seeds were gathered and soaked for 20-30 minutes. While the seeds soaked, six pots were obtained, three labeled “control” and three labeled “nitrogen rich.” Each pot labeled “control” was filled to the brim with vermiculite and watered. The pots labeled “nitrogen rich” were filled halfway with vermiculite and then a scoop of nitrogen was spread across the pot. After the nitrogen was added, the pots were filled to the brim with vermiculite and watered. All 6 pots were given 25mL of Miracle-Gro (less than the suggested 50mL). Nine holes, about 1inch x 1inch, were then made in each of the 6 pots and filled with 5 radish seeds per hole. The holes were then covered with vermiculite and watered again. The pots were all placed in the green house and watered daily for the next 2 weeks.
After two weeks, the radish plants were taken out of the pots and the roots were carefully separated in a tub of water and dried. For each of the 6 pots, 5 plants were selected and measured. The roots were separated from the shoots at the root shoot junction by cutting at the band where a change in color from white to green is observed. For each of the 5 plants selected per pot, the maximum root length and the maximum shoot length was measured to the nearest millimeter and recorded. The mean value of root and shoot length was calculated by comparing the maximum lengths for each of the three “control” pots. The process was repeated for the three “nitrogen rich” pots. After all calculations were made, the root to shoot ratio for the two different environmental conditions were compared using a two-sample t-test.


Results:
Figure 1 illustrates that the average root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in normal conditions is higher than the radish grown in the nitrogen-rich soil.  The mean root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in normal conditions is 1.24 with a standard deviation of 0.42. On the other hand, the average root:shoot length ratio of radish plants grown under nitrogen enriched conditions is 0.82 with a standard deviation of 0.035. After further calculations, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant after conducting a two-sample t-test which had a t-value equal to 1.75, 4 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.077.


Discussion:
Overall, the data did not show a statistical difference between the two groups allowing one to accept the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis that the radish plants in the nitrogen rich environment would have a smaller root to shoot length ratio than those grown under normal conditions. The p-value calculated was 0.07. While this means the data is not statistically significant, one can still interpret the results found. When observing the two groups it was clear that the shoots of the radish plants under normal conditions looked healthier. Further, there were more seeds that sprouted and grew under the normal conditions as not all the seeds in the nitrogen rich conditions sprouted. This difference could possibly be attributed to something known as nitrogen burn. Due to the fact that Miracle Gro was added to all pots, it was difficult to directly compare the two groups since they both had nitrogen in the soil. Further, since both Miracle Gro and a scoop of nitrogen was added to each “nitrogen enriched pot” it is possible that too much nitrogen surrounding the plant had a negative effect on its growth. Nitrogen burn was tested in an experiment conducted by Lui in 2014 that showed excess nitrogen that accumulates in the soil may result in a decrease in yield as the plant gets dehydrated [Liu:2014]. This confounding variable sheds a light on the importance of controlled fertilizer use. Too much nitrogen given to plants can result in negative health effects for both the plants, humans and the surrounding environment.  Consuming high levels of nitrate in plants have harmful effects on human health [Liu:2014]. Further, excess levels of nitrogen leads to more run off, resulting in environmental damage seen through eutrophication. An additional experiment that could be run would be to test different levels of nitrogen in plants to see what concentration is the best for plant growth. This information would give fertilizer companies a better idea of how much nitrogen to put in their product and give farmers a better understanding of how much nitrogen to give their plants.
