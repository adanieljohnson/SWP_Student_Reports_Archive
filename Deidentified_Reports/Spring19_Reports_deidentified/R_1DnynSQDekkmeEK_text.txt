Title: Caffeine injected into gastrocnemius muscle demonstrates muscle signaling

Abstract:
Frog legs demonstrate muscle signaling when stimulated. The researchers studied the effect of caffeine injection on the amplitude of muscle contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle. The gastrocnemius muscle is the rear thigh muscle in a frog. The injection of caffeine induced tetany in the gastrocnemius muscle, which means this muscle was contracting at maximum capacity. Caffeine increased the contractility of the muscle by exposing actin binding sites in the myofibrils. This tetany prevented the electrical stimulus from producing as large of an effect as it did prior to the caffeine injection. The results were not statistically significant, but they were in line with the findings of the field. 


Introduction:
Frog legs can easily be used to study muscle signaling. Because muscles still can contract after an organism is dead, frog legs are a useful model organism for studying muscle contraction. The researchers specifically looked at the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens (a frog species). The gastrocnemius muscle is the rear thigh muscle. The researchers studied the effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemius muscle in the frog leg. Caffeine was studied because it enhances how muscles work, which is called the ergogenic effect [Kumar: 2015]. In the study by Kumar, et al., caffeine was found to increase the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the skeletal muscle of frog legs. Calcium binds to myosin in the myofibrils and exposes the actin binding sites. Increasing calcium levels increasing binding and allows the muscles to contract more. Caffeine has been found to increase a frog leg’s contractility of skeletal muscle [Kumar: 2015]. The researchers looked at amplitude measuring the muscle contractions and how caffeine changed the amplitude of the muscle contractions. The researchers hypothesized that the frog legs would contract normally before being injected with caffeine. After being injected with caffeine, the frog legs will have induced tetany and contract the maximum amount possible. This will make the frog leg respond less to the stimulation because the muscle will not be able to contract anymore.


Materials and Methods:
The researchers studied muscle signaling in three frog legs. Each frog leg was a part of both the control and experimental groups. The frog legs were all tested before being injected with caffeine, which was the control group. After being injected with caffeine, all the frog legs were stimulated by the probe again to see the differing results, making this the experimental group. Each frog leg was in succession strung up, tested, inject with caffeine, and then tested again. The frog leg was strung up to ensure that the leg did not move in a way that would affect the data when stimulated. In this process, the gastrocnemius muscle was also separated from the leg so that only it would be stimulated, causing the movement in the leg. Once the frog leg was strung up, the needle stimulation probes were put into the gastrocnemius muscle. These needle probes were connected to a source of electricity, and it delivered the stimulus to the muscle that was specified by the computer controls. Next, the computer program’s variables were set. The number of pulses was set to three so that we could run the program once to get all of our results on that frog leg for either the control or experimental group. The Hertz was set to 0.5, which meant the stimulus was slower and easier to observe. We stimulated the gastrocnemius muscle with one volt throughout the experiment. The researchers then stimulated the first frog leg. The frog leg was then injected with caffeine while being stimulated. This process was repeated for each of the frog legs. The researchers chose to use a paired t-test.


Results:
The results were not statistically significant because our p-value was over 0.05 (p=0.122). The muscle reacted as expected when stimulated prior to the injection of caffeine [Figure 1]. When the muscle was stimulated after being injected with caffeine, the caffeine induced tetany. Once tetany was induced, the stimulus was only able to produce very small amounts of amplitude [Figure 1]. The muscle was also cold and stiff once it was injected with caffeine because it was contracting constantly. Before tetany was induced, the gastrocnemius muscle was extremely flexible and squishy.


Discussion:
The null hypothesis could not be rejected because the results were not statistically significant. The predictions made in the Introduction were still accurate. The gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg responded as expected to the injection of caffeine, but the researchers cannot guarantee this did not happen just due to chance. The increase in contractility of skeletal muscles of frog legs due to caffeine is documented in Kumar’s study “Effect of Caffeine on Frog Muscle.” Our results indicated this increased contractility. Tetany was induced, as hypothesized in the Introduction. This experiment introduced no new information into the field, but its findings were in line with the already established material. For future investigation, I would want to explore if increasing the amount of caffeine injected would produce different results. The amount of caffeine could also be lowered to find the lowest amount of caffeine that would still induce tetany.
