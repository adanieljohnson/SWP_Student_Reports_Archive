Title: Rhizophagus intraradices decrease the root to shoot ratio of the Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus

Abstract:
This paper sought to look at how rhizophagus intraradices fungi influences the root to shoot ratio of the Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus (radish plant). This was in reference to resource allocation and how plants expend energy to obtain resources they do not have. Half of the plants were grown with Vermiculite while the other half of the plants were grown with Vermiculate, Miracle Grow and the fungi. The plants were watered every day for two weeks. Then the root to shoot ratio was measured. This ratio can change depending on what resources plant have and what ones they have to expend energy to get. Our group hypothesized that the treatment group would have a lower root to shoot ratio than the control group. Our results supported our hypothesis. The treatment group had a smaller root to shoot than the control group did. 

Introduction:
Species are constantly interacting with each other and the environment. Biotic factors are environmental stimuli that originate from other factors also influence this interaction. Biotic factors are living organisms. Abiotic factors are influential as well, but they are non-living. Examples of this are sunlight and wind. Plants are a big part of the environment. Even though plants are stationary, they still interact with other organisms contributing a lot to the environment. Resource limitation also affects plants. This leads to resource allocation which makes plants expend energy to get resources that they are limited in or don’t have. Different studies show different relationships between fungi and the positive affect it has on the growth of plants. One study in particular shows where Mycorrhizal Fungi help plants grow. [Mohammadi 2011] In this experiment, radish plants, a dependent variable, Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus, will be grown with and without rhizophagus intraradices fungi. This fungus was good to use because it is easily accessible and is already abundant in the environment. This radish plant is good to use for this experiment because it grows quickly and pretty well in most environments. Through this, the root to shoot ratio will be tested between the control group, without the fungi, the independent variable, and the test group, with the fungi. The root to shoot ratio is a way the plant copes with not having enough resources in one area of need.[Maskova 2018]. The root to shoot ratio is the ratio between the root system of the plant divided by the shoot system of a plant. This ratio can very based off of nutrient availability in the soil or reserves in the roots from last season. [Maskova 2018]. Our group hypothesized that the root to shoot ration of the test group would be smaller than the control group. This is because the fungi will help the plants with their uptake of water. They also will have to allocate less resources to getting water making their root system smaller than the control who will have to allocate more resources to obtain water. 

Materials and Methods:
To perform this experiment you first obtain a handful of radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) seeds and soak them in water for around twenty minutes. Next, you divide the seeds plant them in 8 different black boxes. The soil used is Vermaculite. Then you water the plants and add Miracle Grow to all 8. In 4 of them you add a level spoonful of the fungi (Rhizophagus intradices) to ensure each experimental plant gets the same amount of fungus. For the next two weeks water the plants every day. After two weeks it is time to collect data. To do this, soak the plants in water to remove all the dirt. Then weigh the plants in groups of three to have three groups of three. Each group will count as one plant. Next, separate the roots from the shoots weighing each group separately. Measure the length of the longest shoot and longest root in each of the three groups. Finally, use a 2 sample T-test to analyze your results. 

Results:
The results showed were experimental group had a smaller root to shoot ratio than the control group. The weight of the control group is statistically significant  compared to that of the treatment group (t-stat = 0.624, df = 4, P = 0.28). The length of the control group is statistically significant compared to that of the treatment group (t-stat = 0.815, df = 4, P = 0.230). This can be shown in table 1 referencing the weight, table 2 referencing the length, and a graph displaying both the mean height and weight root to shoot ratio. 

Discussion:
Our experiment supported our hypothesis. This was shown by the statistically significant differences between the control and experiment group. The root to shoot ratio for both weight and length were smaller in the plants who had the fungi in the soil. This was due to resource allocation. The plants with the fungi put less resources in obtaining water meaning that they could put less resources into obtaining water for their growth. There were not any significant errors that could have altered our final results.  Another study shows were mychorrhizal fungi decreases the biomass of the root to shoot ratio in an assortment of plants. [Veresoglou 2011]. For next time, it would be interesting to test different fungi to see if they each have a different affect on the root to shoot ratio or approximately the same as this one. Learning about resource allocation and how plants use there root to shoot ratio to try and gain resources they do not have is important. This experiment could be helpful to farmers by either allowing them to grow more crops or grow crops that could uptake water better.
