Title: Effects of Nicotine on the Gastrocnemius Muscle in frog Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Muscle contractions can be affected by multiple factors, such as different neurotransmitters binding to the receptors that lead to contraction. One example is nicotine because it can bind to the same site as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In our experiment, we wanted to test if the presence of nicotine in a muscle meant that it would bind to the acetylcholine receptors and affect the twitch threshold. We hypothesized that the twitch threshold would be lower with nicotine present in the muscle. But after testing our theory on three frog leg muscles, we discovered that there is little difference between the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle if nicotine is present. In the end we concluded our hypothesis was null, but that does not eliminate the theory that nicotine can have effects on the muscles and other organ systems in an animal’s body. If more research can be done on the effects of nicotine inside a person’s body, perhaps new solutions can be found to the modern issue of addiction to cigarettes and juuls. 


Introduction:

The muscular system in animals is very simplistic but effective. Electrical signals will travel down neurons and release neurotransmitters that stimulate the release of calcium which lead to a muscle contraction. The neurotransmitters are very important because they connect the nerves to the muscles. One important neurotransmitter for muscle contraction is acetylcholine. But the receptors that catch acetylcholine also catch the chemical nicotine, which is a highly addictive chemical found in cigarettes and juuls. According to research done at University College in London, the chemicals choline, acetylcholine, and nicotine can all cause muscle contractions in the normal striped muscle of the clade Sauropsida, which includes frogs [Elder: 1930]. In this lab we observe the effects of nicotine on the gastrocnemus muscle in frogs and if it alters muscle contractions. According to a research group at the Medical College of Virginia, nicotine can affect different calcium sites that lead to muscle contraction [Weiss: 1966]. But we want to focus on the twitch threshold of the muscle, which is the lowest level of electrical stimulus needed to cause a muscle contraction. If nicotine is injected into the muscle, it will attach to the receptors where the neurotransmitter acetylcholine should go. In this lab we want to discover if the presence of nicotine in a muscle can cause it to contract with less electrical stimulation. If we inject nicotine into the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog Rania pipiens, then the twitch threshold will be lower than that of the controll.


Materials and Method:
In this lab we found out if the twitch threshold of a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle is lowered when nicotine is injected directly into it. To do this we used a frog leg, liquid nicotine, and a probe connected to a simulator output that caused the contractions and measured the threshold level. We began by exposing the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve in the frog leg. Next we pinned the frog leg down to the tray and tied the muscle vertically upward by a string. The muscle had to be at a 90 degree angle with the tray so the simulator output could measure the contractions accurately. We inserted the probe directly into the gastrocnemus muscle and hooked it up to the simulator output, which was connected to a computer. We began the contractions at 0.000 Hz and continued to increase the frequency until the twitch threshold was reached, or when the amplitude went above 0 volts. Once we accurately discovered the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle, we injected .1 Ml of liquid nicotine directly into the same muscle and waited 1 minute. We repeated this process of finding the twitch threshold in the same leg. Once we knew the twitch threshold of the same leg with and without the nicotine, we repeated the entire experiment with two other frog legs. Once all data was collected we used a one-tailed paired t_test to find out if this experiment was valid and if the results were or were not  up to chance. 


Results:
The results did not show a clear difference between the controll and experimental groups. As seen in figure 1, the average experimental twitch threshold was only .02 V lower than the average controll twitch threshold. Through the use of the one-tailed paired t_test, we discovered that the T-value was 0.44 and the P-value was 0.70, as seen in table 1. Since the P-value was larger than 0.05 the data was insignificent. 


Discussion:
We attempted to find out of the injection of nicotine in a frog leg’s gastrocnemus muscle  would lower the threshold at which they twitch. After performing the lab we did indeed obtain data suggesting that the average threshold of the nicotine-injected muscle was lower than that of the controll. But our one-tailed P-value was above 0.05, meaning we accept our null hypothesis and our results were potentially due to chance. In a different experiment conducted at the University of Cambridge it was proven that nicotine can paralyze nerve cells, but those cells still have the potential to retain some functions and get excited by other stimuli [Langley: 1905]. While Nicotine may have other impacts on the muscles in animals, we cannot conclude that nicotine is able to lower the twitch threshold of muscles and cause contractions sooner. In fact, another research project found data proving that nicotine is capable of causing both contraction and relaxation in the muscle [Nyugen: 2015]. Nicotine is a chemical that can have multiple effects on an organism, inside and outside of their muscle. It has a bad reputation for being the addictive chemical in cigarettes and juuls that lead to health complications. If scientists can continue to research the effects of nicotine on the body, perhaps a solution can be found to cancel out its addictive effects so people will quit smoking and juuling quicker.
