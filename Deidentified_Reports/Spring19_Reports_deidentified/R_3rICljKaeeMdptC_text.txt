Title: The Effects of Precor on the Growth and Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators can be used to alter the developmental cycle of insects, which can be beneficial in controllling pests. This study determines the effects of the IGR, precor on Manduca sexta growth and development. The change in weight was used to measure growth and to determine the beginning of the commitment pulse. Our data confirms that increasing levels of JH causes a delay in development but does not cause a stunt in growth. 

Introduction:
Development stages in most insects like, the Manduca sexta are triggered by a decrease or increase of particular hormones. The advantage of using Manduca sexta as a model organism for studying the impact of hormones on growth and development is the cycle from an egg to an adult moth is short and only about 39 to 48 days [Jhonson:2018]. Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molting during the development of Manduca sexta. The commitment pulse causes JH levels to drop before the pupa stage. [Jhonson:2018] How could altering the levels of JH change the developmental process and growth of Manduca sexta? Delaying or stopping the developmental process of the Manduca sexta could be beneficial for pest controll because Manduca sexta is a pest as a moth, but not as a larva. Precor is an IGR that does not allow JH levels to drop, like the levels naturally do before the commitment pulse. Since the Manduca sexta must reach a certain weight threshold before metamorphous begins, [Suzuki: 2013] JH might have an effect on the weight of the llava. We hypothesized if Manduca sexta were given four drops in precor mixed into food then the Manduca sexta growth will be stunted. 

Materials and Method:
The Manduca sexta in the controll group were each fed 10 grams of food containing 10 drops of water and the experimental group were each fed 10 grams of food containing 6 drops of water and 4 drops of Precor. The Manduca sexta in the controll group and experimental group lived in separate marked containers with separate cells for each Manduca sexta for two weeks. Maintenance required placing both containers with lids in an incubator, replacing food and cleaning out feces as needed. The weights of each Manduca sexta were recorded every day except on Saturday and Sunday. Since the Manduca sexta initially had different weights, the change in weight will be used as a means of comparison. A large decrease in weight will be used determine when the Manduca sexta have a commitment pulse. The average weight change of each of the two groups will be used as a mean of comparison and the p_value will be used to determine if the results are significent enough to prove or reject the hypothesis.

Results:
The controll group started the commencement pulse around the fourth day because they decreased in weight and started wandering around their cells. The experimental group did not start the wandering stage and continued to gain weight during the two weeks. According to figure 1, the controll group’s average change in weight was 4.80 grams and the experimental group’s average change in weight was 7.63 grams. The standard deviation was 1.7 and the p value was 0.98.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, if four drops of Precor is added to the diet of the larval Manduca sexta, their growth will be stunted was not supported. The P value states that the null hypothesis is not rejected. The Manduca sexta continued to gain weight in the controll group because JH levels have an effect on the increase of weight gain before the commitment pulse. In an experiment conducted by the University of Washington, experimenters removed the corpus allata from Manduca sexta and the weight was significently lower than the controll group. [Suzuki: 2013] Our experiment may have been more accurate, and the standard deviation may have been lower if we weighed the Manduca sexta everyday instead of everyday execpt Saturday and Sunday. More research could be done to determine if the developmental cycle of Manduca sexta could be prohibited without causing as much harm to the Manduca sexta. The extreme weight gained caused the Manduca sexta of the experimental group to look more swollen and to become less active than the controll group. A future experiment could test if adding less drops of precor would slow Manduca sexta development without causing as much of an extreme weight gain. Future experimentation could be beneficial use of IGR’s as pest controll has fewer effects on non-targeted insects and animals compared to pesticides [Ramaseshadri:2012] and maybe IGR’s could be less harmful to the targeted pest as well.
