Title: The effect of Precor on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
Precor is a kind of insect growth regulator which works similar to Juvenile Hormone(JH) which controlled the type of molting for insect growth. Manduca sexta is a kind of insect which secrets JH. In this experiment, the relationship between the growth of M. sexta and Precor would be explored with the hypothesis that Precor had no effect on the growth. In the experiment, the control group caterpillars were feed with Precor but not for the treatment group, and measuring caterpillars’ length and weight as the indication of growth. Results had large P values, which lead to the conclusion that there were insignificant to show whether the growth of caterpillars were affect of Precor or not. In the future, experiments with more accurate measurement and more caterpillars were needed.
	


Introduction:
“Insect growth regulators”(IGR) are substances which are used to control pests. And one kind of IGR is to over-activate or block specific processes regulated by Juvenile Hormone(JH) (Johnson:2019). JH is a kind of of hormone secreted by insects like which controls the type of molting during development. Also, JH works with Ecdysterones, another type of hormone which controls the timing of molting. The concentration ratio and insects’ developmenta; stage determine what the effects of two hormones will be. According to research, JH delayed the onset of metamorphosis by fourth-instar Manduca sexta larvae. [Safranek: 1980] M. sexta is a kind of insect which secret JH, and it has four life stages: egg, larvae, pupa and adult. In this experiment, I will research about how IGRs affect the growth of insects. Specifically, my research question is how does the IGR Precor, a kind of JH mimic affect the growth of M. sexta during its larvae stage. By researching on this question, people can learn more about how Precor as a kind of IGR specially affect the life cycle of pests and help people use Precor more properly in the future.  As precor is a kind of “growth regulator”, my hypothesis is that Precor will affect the growth of M. sexta with smaller weight and shorter length.


Materials and Methods:
Select 8 M. sexta caterpillars which had the weight range of 0.49g to 0.85g with length range of 2.8cm to 4.0cm. Separated them into two groups, a treatment group and a control group, each group contained 4 caterpillars, and those caterpillars of the same group were placed in 4 separated compartments of one box with holes for air exchange. Placed both groups in 25℃environment with 12h of light and 12h of darkness. For their food, each caterpillar could get 10g of food with 8 drop of water. These are all controlled variables.  For the treatment group, each caterpillar could get extra 8 drops of Precor in the food, and this was the independent variable. Everyday the length (in cm) and weight (in grams) of each caterpillar were measured as the dependent variable. The experiment lasted for 14 days, and if the faeces of the caterpillars were too much, faeces would be replaced with new food which would be the same as I previously stated.  After gathering the data, I calculated the average length and weight of 4 caterpillars of the same group and the same day. Then perform the 2-sample T-test for the average weight and length to test whether they were significant data.

Results:
ccording to figure 1, the weight of two groups were increase for the first 12 days and decrease for the last two days. And the average weight of control group was higher than that of treatment group. And according to the figure 2, the average length of two groups increased for the first 9 days, then decreased from the 9th to the 12th day. And for the remaining two days, the average length of control group suddenly increased form 6.98±0.36cm to 14.05±0.67cm, but the average length of treatment group decreased from 6.96±0.34cm to 6.48±1.26cm. After doing the two-sample T-test, for the weight, the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 6.27, df = 13, P = 0.28). Also, for the length, the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 1.54, df = 13, P = 0.148).

Discussion:
Since both sets of my data were insignificant for too high P value, this indicates that my results could not support that Precor could affect the growth of caterpillars. So Precor as an IGR, this experiment could not support it could control the number and growth of M. sexta during its larvae age.   However, a possible error might happen in the experiment. When measuring the length of M. sexta, Caterpillars were not fully stretched, and this may made my results smaller than the actual values. Based on my results, I think in the future, similar kind of experiment with more accurate measurement and more caterpillars should be performed in order to determine whether Precor could affect caterpillars’ growth. I held the hypothesis that Precor would not have effect on the growth of M. Sexta caterpillars. As JH controlled the timing and type of metamorphosis, but in his results part, even he focused on the development of M. sexta, but there was no reports on any irregular information on the growth part and there was only reports on difference in metamorphosis stage  [Safranek: 1980] which was only change in status but not related to growth.[Safranek: 1980] 

In the future, the research on other kinds of IGRs will be what I explore, specifically, on how these IGRs affect pests’  different life stages. With these studies, people can better understand functions of different IGRs and differences between them. In this way, people can have better usage of IGRs to help control pests.
