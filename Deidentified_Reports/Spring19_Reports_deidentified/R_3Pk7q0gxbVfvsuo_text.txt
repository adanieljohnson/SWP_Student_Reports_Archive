Title: The Effects of a Sodium Channel Blocker on the Strength of Muscle Contractions in the Gastrocnemius of Rania Pipiens 

Abstract:
Rania pipiens have a similar structure to the human nervous system. Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker that will affect the contractions since it will not allow calcium to flood the muscle. If lidocaine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg and dropped onto the sciatic nerve, the muscle will not contract as strongly. Three frog legs were compared by using a set stimulus and comparing the contraction when lidocaine was injected versus when it was not. The results showed a decrease in the strength of the contraction; the controll and treatment for all three legs were as follows: 0.0183 to 0.0013, 0.027 to 0.001, and 0.011 to 0.0017. However the p_value of a paired t_test was 0.06881 which does not disprove the null hypothesis. Due to errors that occurred after injecting the muscle with lidocaine, the results could be significently different. This experiment could affect human treatment in overactive muscle contractions by extrapolating the information found in this experiment to treat such muscles with sodium channel blockers.

Introduction:
The nervous system of the Rania pipiens is composed of a brain, a spinal cord, and nerves that branch out across the whole body of the frog. The gastrocnemus muscle is the major muscle in the calf of frog legs. There are nerves that are within the muscle itself, but the gastrocnemus is also connected to the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve connects the spinal cord and the gastrocnemus directly [Johnson: 2002]. The sciatic nerve, and all nerves within the gastrocnemus, all have action potentials running through them from the brain. Each action potential can potentially signal a contraction or relaxation. A neuron decides to fire when it has been stimulated by enough action potentials to depolarize the neuron. Once that has happened, the action potential travels down the axon to the next neuron and the process is repeated until it reaches the target cells, the muscle cells in the gastrocnemus in this case. When the action potential arrives at the muscle cell, instead of depolarizing the next neuron, it depolarizes the neuromuscular junction. This in turn releases acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter. ACh binds to its receptors which opens sodium ion channels. This then depolarizes the myofibers in the muscle cells which allows calcium ions to be released. Once the calcium is released, it allows for actin and myosin fibers within each myofiber to slide past each other, otherwise known as the sliding filament theory [Sadava: 2011]  An action potential can be simulated by sending voltages through either the sciatic nerve or the gastrocnemus muscle directly. In this experiment, voltages will be sent, and the strength of the muscle contraction will be collected. As seen above, sodium plays a major role in the translation of an action potential from a neuron into the contraction of the muscle. A sodium channel blocker, such as lidocaine, will be used in this experiment to determine its effects on the strength of muscle contractions [Cummins: 2007]. The amplitude of the contraction should be lower since if sodium is blocked, then ultimately calcium cannot be released, and the muscle won’t contract. Therefore, our hypothesis is if we inject the gastrocnemus muscle with lidocaine, and drop lidocaine on to the sciatic nerve, there will be a decrease in the strength of the muscle contractions. Since the nervous system of a frog leg is similar to that of humans, this experiment could provide information into issues with human nervous systems.

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs of a similar size were acquired, this is to try and have as many similarities between the frog legs and to remove any possible discrepancies that could occur. The skin of the leg was removed by peeling it back away from the muscle and bones with tongs. The thigh was then separated from the quadriceps and the hamstring; the division should already be visible and can be pulled apart easily. Once the two muscles are separated, the sciatic nerve, which is a white filament in between the muscles and is connected to the knee, was cleared out and laid down. The frog leg was pinned down by angling the pins into an X with the muscle in between. This is to ensure that the frog leg remains in place and that any instruments used will also be stabilized. Ensure that the gastrocnemus muscle is fully separated from any other tissues or muscles in the calf. Using scissors, detach the gastrocnemus muscle by removing the Achilles tendon from the foot of the frog leg. The Achilles is the white tendon behind the ankle of the foot, with the scissors cut off as much of the tendon without cutting the gastrocnemus muscle itself. A knot of string was tied around the base of the gastrocnemus near what was the whole Achilles. A larger loop was created then attached vertically until taut so that the gastrocnemus muscle is perpendicular to the rest of the leg. Keep the entire frog leg moist with Frog Ringer’s Solution.Using an electrophysiological recorder, place the two pins into the gastrocnemus muscle. Stimuli starting at 0.1 amps were sent until the frog leg twitched, record the values. The first value at which the leg twitched is the threshold for the leg. Add 0.1 amps and record the new values three times to get an average. 1 milliliter of lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemus and a few drops were placed onto the sciatic nerve. Record the amplitude of the muscle contraction and take the average at the value 0.1 amps above threshold. Repeat for the other two frog legs. Calculate the averages for the strength of the muscle contractions in amplitudes for the controll and treatment of each frog leg. The change between the voltages of before and after lidocaine was injected can be compared using a paired t_test. A double bar graph for each of the three legs was created to show a visual of the experiment. The p_value of the paired t_test was also determined to support or refute the hypothesis.



Results:
The experiment conducted analyzed the effects of lidocaine on the strength of muscle contractions. Figure 1 depicts three frog legs and the strength of their muscle contraction for both treatment and controll. The average values for the treatment of lidocaine was smaller in all three legs (0.0013, 0.001, 0.0017) in comparison to the controll values (0.0183, 0.027, 0.011). The standard deviation for all three legs were also calculated. These values were as follows: three had standard deviations of 0 and the other three were 0.000577. The two-sample paired t_test compares the effects of the treatment in comparison to the controll values. If the p_value for this statistical test is greater than 0.05, the experiment fails to reject the null hypothesis. The p_value for this experiment was 0.06881.

Discussion:
This lab examined the effects of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on muscle contractions of frog legs from the Rania pipiens species. This could be examined by taking a set stimulus value and comparing the contraction of the leg when injected with lidocaine versus when not. The hypothesis was that by adding lidocaine, the muscle contraction strength will decrease because the sodium channels will be blocked, and the contraction will not be able to proceed. Figure 1 shows the difference in strength between the controll and the treatment within each leg. There is a decrease in the amount of force in the contraction when lidocaine is added. Our marginally significent result did not disprove the null hypothesis however. There are a few reasons that this could have occurred. When conducting the experiment with the lidocaine already added, there were a few times that the leg did not twitch, and the sensor did not record the value. Therefore, this suggests that the stimulus was too small to actually make the muscle contract. This would affect the data since the average of the stimulus for the treatment would be lower since it would have been a 0 for the contraction. We chose to ignore these ‘ghost contractions’ so that we could determine a concrete value.  By conducting a paired t_test, the difference between the controll and treatment could be analyzed. The statistics showed that the experiment did not support the hypothesis. The p_value was marginally significent and therefore the experiment could be repeated with more trials to determine more accurately the significance of the experiment. However a few other experiments could also be conducted to further continue this study. Due to the errors listed above, a more precise recorder could be used to capture small twitches, or instead a higher value could be examined between the controll and treatment so that the recorder can detect the twitches. Perhaps an experiment examining the effects of different amounts of lidocaine on the strength of the muscle contractions could also be calculated. Humans have a similar nervous system with a brain, spinal cord, and nerves branching out [Sadava: 2011]. This experiment could be interpolated and used to understand the human system as well. For example, if a person is experiencing a lot of muscle contractions, a sodium blocker could be provided to them in order to help decrease the strength of the contractions.
