Title: The Effects of Hormones on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
 In this experiment, the growth development was evaluated between Manduca sexta larvae that received a growth hormone, and Manduca that did not. The development process in Manduca larvae is essential for the transition from larvae, to pupal, to adult. The expectation was that the added hormone would increase Manduca growth faster than the Manduca without the hormone. Our data showed a significent difference between the two groups, and the data supported our hypothesis. This suggests that the IG regulator did increase the M. sexta growth, and aids in the development process of the insects.

Introduction:
Scientists frequently use larvae and other insects to examine the possibilities for manipulation of growth and development of the organisms. This experiment investigates and evaluates the effects of the IG regulator hormone on the development of Manduca sexta. During development, M. sexta enter a period known as molting, which allows them to change in size, and separates the larval, pupal, and adult stages. These stages are controllled by the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. When the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are present in an insect in the larval stage, it will molt and form a cuticle layer that allows for the insect  to carry out synthesis, and thus change its shape [J. H. Willis: 1981]. The hormone given, IG regulator, is known to interfere with development and lead to molting disturbances [S. G. Salokhe, et al: 2010].  In this experiment, the Manduca larvae were given an added IG regulator to their food to observe the effects it would have on their development through the larval stage. The expectation was that the added hormone would increase the growth of the Manduca larvae rapidly, and allow for them to enter the pupal and adult stages much quicker than without the hormone.

Materials and Method:
 In this experiment, eight Manduca larvae were placed into two containers, each with four separate cells for each Manduca. Holes were poked into each cell, to allow for air flow to the Manduca. Ten grams of food was measured for each Manduca, and six drops of the IG regulator was added to the food. Another controll group was created, but only given the ten grams of food, with no added hormone. The weight and length of each larvae was measured and then recorded. The Manduca were placed into their cells, and put into an incubator of 28 degrees celsius. The Manduca weight and length was recorded again after one week in the incubator, and food was replaced. This was repeated once more, a week after the first check-in. The weight and length were recorded for a third time. The weight and length differences between day one and day fourteen for both the controll and experimental groups were recorded.

Results:
 After completing the experiment, the average of the length change of the Manduca that received the IG regulator was 45.875, whereas the average for the controll was 22.375 (Fig. 1). As for the weight, the average for the IG regulator was 11.08875, and the controll had an average of 4.95 (Fig. 2).  The standard deviation for the length of the experimental group was 12.323 and the controll group was 4.498 (Fig. 1).  The standard deviation for the weight of the experimental group was 3.228, and the controll group was 0.522 (Fig. 2).  We used a statistical t_test to determine if the results were significent or not. The t-value for length was 4.73952, and the t-value for the weight was 4.767407. The degree of freedom for the length of the Manduca was 14. It was 14 for the weight of the Mandua as well. The p_value for the height was 0.000317, which is far significent. The p_value for weight was 0.00207, which is also significent. 

Discussion:
 Our hypothesis, that the Manduca would grow faster when given the IG regulator hormone, was supported by our results. Thus, there was a significent difference between the two groups, and their results. This shows that the IGregulator hormone does indeed promote the growth of the Manduca sexta through their larvae stage. It cannot be assumed, however, that this will be the case for all Manduca. It would be necessary to do the experiment again to ensure that the results are reliable, and not just a coincidence. Many other experiments have concluded that IG regulators inhibit the formation of cuticle molting and larvae development. The hormones can be used as pesticides to cause death or cease development at certain times of exposure in its lifetime. It can inhibit the formation of the cuticle by interfering with the development and division of epidermal cells [Wright: 1976]. Because of this, it would be important to perform the experiment multiple times, in order to assure the results we acquired are reliable.  However, since the Manduca grew more rapidly when given the growth hormone, it can be assumed at this time that the IG regulator aids growth.
