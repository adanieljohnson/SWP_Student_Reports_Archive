Title: The effect of azadirachtin on Manduca sexta larval growth

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that has a holometabolous life cycle, meaning it undergoes complete metamorphosis. Growth during the stages leading up to adulthood (particularly in the larval stages) is dictated by three main hormonal systems. Ecdysterone (the hormone being examined in this study) is responsible for preparing the larvae for metamorphosis which allows them to transition between growth stages. In this experiment, four M. sexta caterpillars were given food with an insecticide containing azadirachtin, a substance that indirectly kills insects by stopping their feeding. Over the course of two weeks, the growth in length of the four caterpillars was compared to a control group of equal size given food containing simple diluted water. It was hypothesized that the presence of azadirachtin in M. sexta’s food would inhibit their growth, however the difference between mean growth in the experimental vs. control group was found to not be statistically significant. While no clear reason as to why this is was pinpointed, the fact that azadirachtin still has the potential to be an effective insecticide remains and further studies are needed to clearly show the effects of azadirachtin on insect control.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta (also known as “tobacco hornworms”) are a species of moth that undergo complete metamorphosis through a holometabolous life cycle. Insects with holometabolous lifestyles undergo four major life stages including the egg/embryo stage, the larval stage(s), the pupal stage(s) and the adult stage. During the pupal stage, M. sexta’s body reorganizes, making its adult form look very different from its larval form [Johnson: 2019]. The transition between life stages is dictated by varying levels of hormone in the insect’s body which causes it to molt or shed epidermal tissue. Once the process of moving from one stage to another has begun, the insect cannot regress to a previous stage [Johnson: 2019]. Most of insect development is controlled by three hormones: Prothoraciotropic (PTTH), Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH and 20E, in particular, are important for molting with Juvenile Hormone regulating the type of molt and Ecdysterone regulating the timing of the molt. Both of these hormones are vital to insect survival and their concentrations determine their functionality [Johnson: 2019].  A spike in ecdysterone at the end of the larval stage of development is what makes larvae stop feeding (and, therefore, stop growing) in preparation for metamorphosis. The size of the larvae depends heavily on this system and adult size also depends on this system since adult tobacco hornworms do not grow [Nijhout: 2006]. Azadirachtin is a common insecticide that inhibits ecdysterone, causing stunted growth, molting defects and prevention of insect reproduction. Azadirachtin is an antifeedant that stops the insect from feeding and does not directly kill it [Morgan: 2009]. Based on this information, it is hypothesized that if azadirachtin is used to inhibit ecdysterone in M. sexta caterpillars, then their growth will be stunted.

Materials and Methods:
To begin, eight M. sexta caterpillars of various sizes were obtained. They were randomly split up into two groups of four, with one group being the experimental/treatment group and the other being the control group. Two containers with four separate cells were labelled and punctured with small air holes which allowed the caterpillars to breathe. Each caterpillar was given ten grams of control M. sexta food mixed with either diluted water or the hormone, azadirachtin. The control group was given food with six drops of diluted water mixed with their food while the experimental group was given food with six drops of insecticide (from the brand “AzaGuard”). The caterpillars were observed over a two-week period and their food was replaced with the appropriate treatment as needed. Additionally, their cells were cleaned of waste as needed. Every day the caterpillars were measured by length (in cm) and any unusual observations were recorded. On the fourteenth day, the difference in length between the first and fourteenth days were recorded for each specimen. After the mean length difference in each group of caterpillars was recorded, a two-sample, one-sampled t-test was performed to analyze the significance of the results.

Results:
The mean growth M. sexta caterpillars in the control group was 1.1 cm while the mean growth in the experimental group was 0.775 cm. Their standard deviations were +/- 0.4830 cm and +/- 0.8732 cm respectively (Figure 1). While the mean growth between the two groups was very similar, the control group did grow larger. In terms of observations, almost all of the caterpillars grew in diameter, becoming fatter, expect for numbers one and four in the treatment group. The caterpillars that were a part of the control group showed much more consistent growth than the experimental group with their lengths generally remaining more constant. All of the caterpillars progressively became more brown and some almost black over the course of the two weeks. Most of the caterpillars stopped eating or decreased their food intake by the twelfth or thirteenth day of observation. It is worth highlighting that the standard deviation of the control group’s mean length change is higher than the mean itself (Figure 1). The difference between the mean growths in the control versus experimental group was found not to be statistically significant (t-stat = 0.6514, p-value 0.2695).

Discussion:
The difference in mean growth (in terms of length) between the control and experimental groups were not shown to be statistically significant. There are many possibilities as to why this is, including biological function of M. sexta caterpillars, the brand of insecticide used and experimental error. Firstly, the effects of azadirachtin primarily cause deficiencies in cell division and secondarily cause molting delays [Morgan: 2009]. Perhaps there was not enough azadirachtin present in the insecticide used or the insecticide was not used long enough for secondary effects to be implemented. This is supported by the fact that the brand of insecticide used during the experiment (AzaGuard) contained only a three percent concentration of azadirachtin [BioSafe Systems: 2017]. The idea that the insecticide did not have enough time to properly effect the caterpillars is supported by the fact that ecdysterone (naturally occurring in all insects) also produces an antifeeding effect [Nijhout: 2006]. It is very plausible that the lack of feeding in the last three days of observation were caused by a spike in ecdysterone and not by azadirachtin. Additionally, most of the caterpillars appeared to have fat bodies (large diameters) and one of azadirachtin’ s primary effects is preventing larvae from becoming “fat” [Morgan: 2009]. This could also mean that the insecticide was not given enough time to be integrated into the insects’ systems. Perhaps the insects were too close to the end of larval development and thus, stopped feeding naturally before the insecticide had time to effect molting. In terms of experimental error, caterpillars tended to curl up when they were being measured which could have led to inaccurate measurements. It is important that this experiment be replicated because, while AzaGuard is a very popular and fairly safe insecticide, [BioSafe Systems: 2017] there is a possibility that it could be improved by optimizing the antifeeding effects of azadirachtin. This could help prevent pests from taking over crops in agriculture or help to control pest populations. In future experiments, it is recommended that M. sexta larvae are very young and as far away from metamorphosing as possible to prevent confusion between effects being caused by azadirachtin or ecdysterone. It is also recommended that azadirachtin be used in a higher concentration to make sure that its effects are shown in M. sexta’s life cycle. It is important to remember that azadirachtin’ s insecticidal effects require lower doses than anti-feeding effects do.
