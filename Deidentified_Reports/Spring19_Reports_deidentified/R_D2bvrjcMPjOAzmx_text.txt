Title: The Effects of Curare on the Threshold for Muscle Contraction in the Leg of a Frog

Abstract:
This study sought to understand the affects of curare on the electrical threshold necessary to trigger muscle contraction. It was hypothesized that if a muscle in frog legs were test before and after being injected with curare, then the muscle’s thresholds for contraction would increase with the presence of curare. The hypothesis was tested using a muscle force transmitter to ensure the results were quantitative as well as qualitative. The results proved to be insignificent and therefore inconclusive. The experiment should be repeated on a greater scale with a greater amount of curare injected into the muscle at several different locations to enhance the findings.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles are responsible for the organism’s ability to respond to stimulus much faster than hormones. Nerves and muscles are responsible for fast actions responding to stimuli in a matter of seconds if not less. Visible muscular reactions are controllled by skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle is made up of thousands of myofibers which contract or elongate to controll movement. Each movement requires at least one muscle to contract and at least one other to elongate. Both contraction and elongation are controllled by the interactions of actin and myosin. When contracted, actin and myosin slide overtop of each other and are stacked while elongated actin and myosin do not overlap nearly as much. Muscular contraction can be artificially induced through electric stimulation of either the muscle directly or a nerve connected to the muscle. The reaction of the targeted muscle to a certain electrical current can be measured at the macroscopic level using a muscle force transmitter. These machines can pick up very small amounts of stimulation and can therefore be used to determine an approximate threshold to induce muscular contraction. Curare is the common name of various plant extract alkaloid arrow poisons which function by inhibiting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors found in the neuromuscular junction. This prevents nerve impulses from activating skeletal muscles resulting in relaxed muscles regardless of stimulation [Auerbach: 1971]. Curare is used in modern medicine as a form of general anesthesia because of its ability to relax muscles. [Antkowiak: 2001] It was hypothesized that if curare was injected directly into the leg muscle of a frog leg and that same muscle was then tested after a brief rest period to find its threshold, then it would be greater than the threshold of the same muscle devoid of curare.

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs will be tested. After being rinsed with frog rigger solution, each leg will be tested to find its individual threshold by starting at 0V impulses and working up by 0.1V. Once found, the threshold voltage will be narrowed by backtracking from the found value by 0.01V until the threshold is found to two decimal places. The impulses and threshold data will be collected by a muscle force transducer, if the machine picks up movement but none is seen, repeat the voltage. Inject each frog leg with 0.1Ml of curare and allow to rest for five minutes before repeating the same procedure. Compare the threshold results using a paired t_test.

Results:
The results of the tests were scattered. Only two of the three tested frog legs saw any increase in threshold. The threshold never increased by more than 0.02V when curare was injected. In the third leg, the threshold remained the same. The thresholds of the experimental group were not statistically significent from those of their controll trials (t_stat = 1.512, d.f. = 2, P = 0.270).

Discussion:
While the threshold of two of the three frog legs increased, it was not statistically significent and could have easily been a result of muscle fatigue or just general variability. This is further supported by the third leg’s lack of increase in threshold. The average voltages to trigger a contraction differed very slightly [see Figure 1] and the overlap of the error bars further supports the rejection of the alternative hypothesis and failure to reject the null hypothesis. These finding run counter to the accepted conclusion that curare affects muscle contraction threshold given its use as a general anesthesia [Antkowiak: 2001]. In similar studies it was found that dosages of curare were able to increase the threshold of muscle contraction to the point that electrical bursts that normally would cause movement had no affect [Granit: 1953]. Due to the contradictions of this study with those in the past, it is suggested that the experiment be repeated on a greater scale. The amount of curare injected into the muscle should also be increased and the injection should be spread across the muscle instead of only occurring at a single location to ensure the best spreading of the curare in the muscle. If the experiment fails once again, it should be repeated with the new modifications using frog legs from several different types of frogs. The results may have stemmed from an immunity of the frog to curare.
