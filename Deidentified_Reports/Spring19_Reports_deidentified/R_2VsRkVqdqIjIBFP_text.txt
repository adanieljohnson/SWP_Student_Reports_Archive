Title: Lidocaine Injections in Gastrocnemius Muscle of Raina pipiens Significantly Affects Voltage Response

Abstract:
Lidocaine is a synthetic drug often used in the medical industry to dull pain. It does this by blocking sodium ion channels, disallowing the membrane from depolarizing, which stops a muscle contraction from being created or continued. Using Northern Leopard, Raina pipiens, frog legs as a model to study if Lidocaine effectively blocks muscle response after being shocked by controllled action potentials, our resulting data showed that there was a significent difference in muscle response between the controll and lidocaine injected muscles (T-stat=4.45, d.f.=2, P=.047). The average response, in Amperes, produced by the R. pipiens was .203 amps before the Lidocaine injection, and .074 amps after the Lidocaine injection. The average standard deviation for the controll group was .0441, while the average standard deviation for the treatment group was .0553. Lidocaine demonstrates how some toxins, like Tetrodotoxin, are effective. They disallow the membrane from depolarizing and in turn completely paralyze or even kill their prey as the muscle response is weakened or even entirely stopped.

Introduction:
Northern Leopard frogs, Raina pipiens, are ideal models to measure how muscle responses are affected by different chemicals, as they have large Gastrocnemius muscles and Sciatic nerves, which allow for easy measurements. In this experiment we are measuring our dependent variable, muscle response (amps), by producing artificially controllled action potentials (volts). We are using Lidocaine as a treatment to see how the Gastrocnemius muscle response changes, as Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker. The amount of sodium released from an impulse, with Lidocaine, will be lower than without Lidocaine, as Lidocaine produces a weaker response as the Sodium ions cannot diffuse through the membrane as quickly as normal, but the diffusion of potassium is not affected. The Potassium will rush out of the cell before all the Sodium ions have entered, as they are delayed, lowering the amplitude of the response.  Lidocaine is a good substitute for studying toxins that block Sodium channels, like tetrodotoxin, which comes from the order Tetraodontiformes which includes pufferfish, one of the oldest known poisons [Hwang: 2007]. This class of toxins can similarly block sodium channels while leaving the potassium ion gates intact [Narahashi: 1964]. By using Lidocaine which is much safer than the tetrodotoxin, we can effectively study the mechanism of sodium ion gate blockage without putting ourselves at risk. Our hypothesis is that the Lidocaine will decrease the voltage response in the muscle, because Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker.

Materials and Method:
Three R. pipiens frog legs were taken and degloved to expose the Gastrocnemius muscles. The sciatic nerve was freed from the muscle and then attached to LabScribe software through an electrical conduit to measure voltage response to the nerve impulse. Measurements were recorded for the threshold potential of each Gastrocnemius muscle. Then to make certain that a full response from the muscle was measured, the voltage stimulus was moved up .1 volts for each of the distinct thresholds of each of the Gastrocnemius muscles. Each muscle was then shocked three times, .1 volts above the threshold potential, and the response, measured in amps, was recorded for controll. Lidocaine was then injected into each of the frog legs. We waited approximately three minutes before measurements were recorded for voltage response from the gastrocnemus, again from impulses .1 volts above threshold. We then took the three separate measurements recorded for both controll and treatment from each of the three muscles and averaged them separately, producing an average muscle response for controll and treatment for each individual leg. Standard deviation for controll and treatment were then calculated for each leg. We then used a paired t_test to compare whether the Lidocaine significently affected the voltage response from the gastrocnemus muscle, using the previously calculated, controll and treatment average muscle response.

Results:
The average response, in Amperes, produced by the R. pipiens was .203 amps before the Lidocaine injection, and .074 was the average amperage after the Lidocaine injection. The average standard deviation for the controll group was .0441, while the average standard deviation for the treatment group was .0553. Using a paired T-test, the mean response in amps of the controll group was significent compared to the mean response in amps of the Lidocaine injected group (T-stat=4.45, d.f.=2, P=.047). In Figure 1, there is a strong correlation and pattern between muscle response from controll and lidocaine injected muscles. Lidocaine muscles are much lower than the controll muscles for all three legs. Also, none of the treatments had any overlapping standard deviations which shows a strong separation in results between the two treatments. 

Discussion:
From the results of this experiment, our hypothesis is supported, as the difference between the controll muscle response was significently different to the muscle response after Lidocaine injection, P=.047. This supports the idea that Lidocaine is successful at blocking sodium ion channels and slowing the depolarization of the membrane, which results in a slower muscle response. This possibly means that if enough of the Lidocaine is injected it could completely stop any muscle response from happening. This would explain why it would be advantageous for organisms to evolve to possess sodium blocking toxins or venoms. It could be either used as a defensive mechanism to slow down predators as the prey escapes, or to paralyze the prey, so less energy is required to chase it down before ingestion. Blocking the sodium ion channels is the most efficient way to paralyze prey because the action potential nor calcium released will have a significent effect because the ion channels controll the rate of depolarization. The calcium only lets the contraction last longer. This has been shown in previous studies [Vornovitskii: 1966], that in Rania ridibunda, commonly called the Marsh Frog, calcium levels in the Sartorius muscle rise with increasing levels of Novocain, another sodium channel blocker like Lidocaine. In future experiments, it would be interesting to test the legs at different voltages, not just .1v above the threshold. This would give us data to show that lidocaine significently blocks sodium ion channels regardless of the voltage. If true, Lidocaine or other Sodium ion channel blockers could be administered to people who have certain neuromuscular disorders to help stop spastic muscle movement, which may keep them up at night or disallow them from doing every day tasks. 
One possible source of error was that the controll treatment was tested first each time. From our raw data, it was apparent that with each action potential the response in amps decreased slightly for both the controll and for the treatment. If we had tested six legs, three for treatment and three for controll we may have received more precise, true results. But as different legs would receive different treatments, a paired t_test wouldnâ€™t be an appropriate choice for the statistical measurement. If a larger sample size, which had received both treatments had been used, more precise results from this experiment would have been produced.
