Title: Effect of Nitrogen in Field Pea (Pisum sativun) Growth

Abstract:
Recourse allocation is a process in which plants disperse the appropriate amount of natural resources into their leaves, stems and roots to ensure its survival. Nitrogen is a natural resource which can limit a plants growth. Therefore, if nitrogen was added into field pea (Pisum sativun) soil, then the plant can grow more causing a smaller root to shoot ratio. The results proved significent for weight; with the controll plants growing heavier. The controll plant appeared healthier through a brighter green color and more leaves in comparison to the nitrogen treated which had a darker green color with fewer leaves. Hence, the weight for the controll had a smaller root to shoot ratio. The length ratio, however, were not significent. The results indicate that too much nitrogen can cause a negative impact on plant growth. 

Introduction:
Biotic and abiotic factors are two ways to categorize how plants interact with their surroundings. Biotic factors are how plants interacts with other living organisms while non-living aspects such as sunlight and soil are abiotic [Johnson:2018]. The factors, however, which enable the plant to grow are limited, hence, are considered limited recourses. To respond to the presented resources, it must properly allocate them to ensure the plant’s survival. Resource allocation occurs between the leaves, stems and roots. When recourse allocation alters depending on the given conditions, it is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson: 2018]. Field peas (Pisum sativun) for example, were utilized to test resource allocation. Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are main natural resources plants utilize for growth. Nitrogen is a main limiting factor for plant growth [Fageria: 2005]. Nitrogen is vital for plant growth for multiple reasons: it aids in amino acids production for plant structures, is a nucleic acid in DNA, and enhances chlorophyll photosynthesis [Tajer]. Therefore, nitrogen is utilized in many fertilizes. Miracle-Gro, a commonly used fertilizer, contains 24% nitrogen. Therefore, it makes a good candidate to create a nitrogen right environment. If Miracle-Gro solution is added to the field peas (Pisum sativun), then they will have a lower root to shoot ratio in weight and length than those who are only given water. 

Materials and Method:
Dirt was added into two separate pots. After, fertilizer was poured into both and the dirt mixed. Nine indents were then made in the soil and filled with two seeds per hole. The holes were then covered with dirt and 100Ml of water was poured. The controll pot was given 100Ml of water daily for two weeks while the experimental pot was given 50 Ml of water and 50Ml of 1X Miracle-Gro solution which contains 24% nitrogen for the same amount of time. Both pots were set to grow during the two-week period in a green house. At the end of the two-week growing period, the process of taking the plants out began. This was done by using a bucket partially filled with warm water. The controll pot was emptied into the bucket in which the plants were gently moved around to allow the roots to release the soil. Ten of these plants were separated without the roots breaking and taken out onto a paper towel. After, the roots were individually rinsed and were cut directly above the pea. The roots and stem length were measured in centimeters and weighed in grams. The same procedure was repeated with the experimental group. A two-tailed T-test was then preformed to test if results were significent. The alpha value was utilized to determine significance. 

Results:
As portrayed in figure 1, the weight for the nitrogen treated plants was much higher than that of the controll. The average weight ratio for the controll plants was 1.02±0.15 while the average weight ratio for the nitrogen treated plants was 1.83±0.74. The weight ratio resulted in statistically significent results (d.f.=18, t-value=3.375, p_value=0.003). Length, on the other hand, are more closely related for both groups. The average length ratio of the controll plants resulted in 0.68±0.12 and the nitrogen treated plants had an average length ratio of 0.82±0.41. However, the length ratio was not statistically significent (d.f.=18, t-value=1.09, p_value=0.29). Through observation, however, the controll group appeared overall taller and healthier through the greenery and a multitude of leaves.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was rejected because the nitrogen treated group had a significently larger root to shoot ratio for weight. Although the results proved partially significent, it was in the opposite direction than predicted. The field peas (Pisum sativun) grew similarly in length as expressed through the root to shoot ratio. However, the plants’ weight value still proved significent. Hence, this experiment suggests that although nitrogen is beneficial, too much can negatively impact the plant. This can be explained through field peas’ naturally occurring “non-nodulating bacteria” isolated at the root which produce optimal amount of nitrogen for the plant [Tariq: 2014]. The plant is getting nitrogen from the bacteria and the fertilizer. When excess nitrogen is added, the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities decrease causing the plant to slowly die [Makino: 1991]. In addition, nitrogen has also been shown to cause soil acidification which in turn can negatively impact plant growth [Barak: 1997]. To further improve this experiment, more pots and plants could have been tested.
