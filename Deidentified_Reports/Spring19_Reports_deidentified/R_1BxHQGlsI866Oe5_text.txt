Title: The Effect of Tubocurarine on the Threshold Contraction in Dissected Frog Legs 

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of an acetylcholine receptor antagonist, tubocurarine, on the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens (frogs). We hypothesized  that tubocurarine would increase the threshold voltage necessary for muscular contraction because more stimulus would be needed to counteract the antagonistic effects of the tubocurarine. We tested this hypothesis by suspending three different frog legs to a force transducer and testing threshold voltage pre and post 0.2 mL of 1 mM tubocurarine injection. Using silver thread electrodes, each frog leg was electrically stimulated pre and post injection, with the voltage increasing by 0.1 mV increments until a muscular contraction occurred. Myograms supplemented our analysis of threshold. Our results were ruled statistically insignificant (f=2, t-stat=0.0096, p-value=0.9297). Thus, the null hypothesis could not be rejected. Desensitization of tubocurarine due to repeated stimulus and/or tubocurarine working primarily as an ion channel blocker may account for the insignificance of our results. 


Introduction:
Acetylcholine is an essential neurotransmitter for the movement and contraction of muscles. However, acetylcholine merely plays a role in a larger process known as excitation-contraction coupling [Calderón: 2014]. In the neuromuscular system, this process involves an action potential (the “excitation”) triggering the presynaptic neuron to release acetylcholine. Acetylcholine exerts its effects by binding to a receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber,  which results in the opening of ion channels and sodium rushing in to depolarize the postsynaptic membrane [Sadava: 2014]. This depolarization spreads throughout the muscle fiber and triggers the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium released stimulates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, which in turn activates the myosin, pulling actin towards the center of the sarcomere, and effectively shortens the fiber. The muscle can only relax again once calcium re-enters the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2018].
The resultant muscular contraction and subsequent relaxation from the excitation-contraction coupling process can be illustrated through myograms. Myograms are graphical representations produced by measuring the force of a muscle generated over a certain period of time [Johnson: 2018].  This graph contains three distinct phases: the latent period, the contraction phase, and the relaxation phase. The latent period is the very brief stretch of time between the contraction and relaxation phases (usually lasts less than 10 milliseconds). The contraction phase happens when chemical changes in muscle fibers cause the muscle to shorten, and the relaxation phase is activated by the contraction phase reaching its maximum load, and thus returning to its relaxed state [Johnson: 2018]. Thus, we looked for a sharp spike upwards (signifying increased tension) in the myograms to supplement out analysis of muscular contraction. 
In this experiment, we attempted to analyze acetylcholine action at neuromuscular junctions in the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens (frogs). Tubocurarine is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, meaning that it prevents acetylcholine from binding to receptors [“Tubocurarine”: 2019]. Nicotinic receptors are ionotropic. This means that when acetylcholine bind to these receptors, ions flow through it (mostly sodium in this case), which in turn depolarizes the cell. Because tubocurarine would be blocking these receptors and thus the subsequent ion flow, we sought to determine whether more stimulus would be needed to oppose the antagonistic effects and activate contraction of the tubocurarine-injected gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens’ legs.  Further, we hypothesized that administering tubocurarine would increase threshold voltage because more stimulus would be needed to overcome the effects of tubocurarine.


Materials and Methods:
In order to test this hypothesis, three frog legs were obtained. The skin was peeled off all three legs and the gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the bone. To counter the muscle drying out, it was doused with Ringer’s solution for all three legs. In three separate trials, the gastrocnemius muscle of one of the frog legs was suspended from a force transducer. Once suspended, silver thread electrodes connected to the transducer were inserted into the gastrocnemius muscle, avoiding the sciatic nerve. Using the computer software Labscribe, we began at 0.0 millivolts (mV) of electrical stimulation, increasing stimulation by 0.1 mV increments until we determined the initial threshold voltage of the frog leg without any addition of tubocurarine (control data). Following this, we administered 0.2 mL of 1 mM tubocurarine to the leg with a clean syringe, massaging the leg after the addition of tubocurarine to spread it out within the muscle. After waiting five minutes, we tested contraction threshold with the addition of tubocurarine for the frog leg (experimental data). This was repeated two more times with the remaining frog legs. The statistical t-test used to analyze the data was a paired one-tailed t-test.


Results:
The initial threshold voltage never exceed 0.25 volts in all three frog legs. In addition, two out of the three legs experienced reduced threshold levels after administration of tubocurarine. The contraction strength (in volts) also decreased after tubocurarine injection for all three frog legs (figure 1). 
Our results were not statistically significant (df=2, t-stat=0.0096, p-value=0.9297). There was no obvious trend between pre and post tubocurarine injection. The difference in threshold voltage pre and post injection was +0.10 in leg 1, -0.13 in leg 2, and +0.01 in leg 3.



Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported based on the results of our experiment. Only one of the frog legs experienced an increased threshold voltage after administration of tubocurarine, which refutes our original hypothesis. Our results may be better explained through a study conducted in 1979, which stated that electrical stimulation could potentially desensitize tubocurarine [Colquhoun: 1979].  Thus, if tubocurarine was desensitized, it would not be nearly as effective at exerting its normal ion channel blocking effects [Nohmi: 1984] and/or acetylcholine antagonist effects. If this desensitization occured, threshold voltage would decrease due to reduced antagonistic effects from the tubocurarine. In our experiment, the first frog leg was continuously shocked due to technical difficulties with the needle probe. Due to the accidental constant shocking and stimulation of leg one, we could have potentially enhanced the desensitization of tubocurarine. This prediction is supported by the fact that the threshold voltage greatly decreased post tubocurarine injection in leg one. The other two legs were not electrically stimulated continuously, and thus did not experience a major decrease in threshold voltage post tubocurarine injection. The desensitization of tubocurarine in leg one provides one possible explanation for the inconsistency in results. However, the differences in threshold voltages could also be attributed to experimental error. When the first leg was injected with tubocurarine, some of the tubocurarine solution leaked out of the leg. Thus, perhaps the lowered threshold voltage for the first leg after tubocurarine injection occurred because not enough tubocurarine was injected to exhibit any noticeable effects. 
A study conducted in 1984 suggests that tubocurarine blocks the calcium dependent potassium conductance in bullfrogs [Nohmi: 1984]. The release of potassium is responsible for the repolarization phase of the action potential. Further, if several potassium channels are blocked, the repolarization phase would be inhibited. This would make it more difficult for the action potential to reach the resting membrane potential necessary to generate another action potential (and in this case stimulate another muscle contraction). Thus, more stimulus would be needed to release the desired amount of potassium to carry out the action potential. This research could actually be expanded upon in a future experiment. We could determine the threshold voltage necessary for generating consecutive muscle contractions under continuous electrical stimulation of tubocurarine-injected gastrocnemius muscles. If the threshold voltage had to be greatly increased to produce consecutive muscle contractions in the tubocurarine-injected legs, we could infer that blockage of potassium channels was occurring. The decreased amount of potassium available for release, due to tubocurarine blocking effects on potassium channels, would only be addressed through more stimulation. 
 Studying the effects of tubocurarine proves extremely important still today. Although we only tested tubocurarine in frogs, tubocurarine has its own history in the development of human medicine. In the 1900s, it was used alongside an anesthetic for skeletal muscle relaxation in humans during surgery [“Tubocurarine”: 2019]. If we could determine effective dosage and administration of tubocurarine in frogs, thus obtaining statistically significant results, we could potentially see if it could how it could be used as a muscle relaxant in frogs. They are an ideal vehicle to study the effects of tubocurarine, which could potentially translate to the broader world for future medical  procedures.
