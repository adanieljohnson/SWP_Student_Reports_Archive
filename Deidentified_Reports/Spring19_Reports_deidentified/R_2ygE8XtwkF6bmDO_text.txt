Title: The Effect of Colder Tank Water on the Aggression Levels of Male Bettas

Abstract:
Male Betta splendens’ aggression levels, specifically the amount of time the fish displayed their red “mane” was observed in this experiment. Bettas create this red “mane” by protruding the branchiostegal membrane from underneath the opercula. Bettas gulp oxygen from the water at the surface giving males additional oxygen to display this red mane for substantial periods of time while in interacting with other bettas. In order to survive, the metabolic rate of an organism must not drop too low. Temperature affects metabolism through its effects on rates of biochemical reactions, decreasing the temperature decreases metabolism in most organisms. We predicted that by decreasing the temperature of the water, the male betta fish would be less aggressive than in room temperature water because the lower temperature will decrease their metabolic rate, and the fish will try to conserve energy to survive, so they will not expend that energy by maintaining an agonistic display. We found that there was a significant difference between the time displaying the red “mane” in the room temperature and cold water. Our results compare similarly to other studies which research the effect of temperature on aggressive behavior. 

Introduction:
	Observation of animals requires the collection of data, the recognition of repeated patterns, the development of questions and hypotheses, and the formulation of experiments to test the hypotheses [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we observed male Betta splendens’, Siamese fighting fish, aggression levels. These fish demonstrate several types of agonistic displays including pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2018]. Additionally, one of the more prominent displays of aggression is the flaring of the red “mane”. Bettas create this red “mane” by protruding the branchiostegal membrane from underneath the opercula [Johnson: 2018]. Like most fish, bettas need oxygen in order to survive. However; because they are not completely dependent on their gills, the oxygen in the water at the surface that they gulp gives males additional oxygen during agonistic displays or fighting [Johnson: 2018]. Because they must swim to the surface of the water in order to gulp the oxygen in the water, it could also interrupt agonistic displays or fighting between the fish. Additionally, if one male survives longer at the bottom of the tank than another male, that fish can hold the other down at the bottom of the tank while fighting in order to kill the other by depriving it of oxygen.
Metabolism is the process by which energy and materials are transformed within an organism and exchanged between the organism and its environment [Gillooly: 2001]. In order to survive, the metabolic rate of an organism must not drop too low. The oxygen the fish gulp helps maintain the metabolic rate. Temperature affects metabolism through its effects on rates of biochemical reactions [Gillooly: 2001]. Previous research suggests that metabolism is primarily determined by size and temperature, so lowering the temperature of a small fish would decrease the metabolic rate of that fish [Gillooly: 2001]. Additional research has uncovered that an aggressive response in fish is correlated with an increase in oxygen consumption in order to maintain the metabolic rate [Ros: 2006]. In this experiment, we tested how changing the temperature would affect the agonistic displays of the male bettas. We predicted that by decreasing the temperature of the water, the male betta fish would be less aggressive than in room temperature water because the lower temperature will decrease their metabolic rate, and the fish will try to conserve energy to survive, so they will not expend that energy by maintaining an agonistic display. 


Materials and Methods:
Two tanks were used for this experiment, one for each condition. We put ice in the second tank in order to decrease the temperature of that tank to approximately 14℃. The other tank was at room temperature around 17℃. Two male betta fish were added into separate compartments of the tank with a white plastic divider between the compartments. The fish were given about five minutes to rest and become accustomed to the new environment. The divider was then removed from between the males and we observed how long the red mane was displayed on each fish for no longer than five minutes. The timer was started and stopped with the red mane was displayed in order to get a cumulative amount time of the aggressive display of each fish. We repeated the process for another interaction between two different fish. 
The fish were then put in the cold-water tank and left to rest for 15 minutes in order for their bodies to become accustomed to the temperature of the water. Then we removed the barrier between the males and recorded the time each fish displayed their red mane for both interactions. After the time had been recorded, the fish were placed back into room temperature water. We used a paired t-test to determine the significance of our results.


Results:
In the room temperature water, we recorded an average time that the fish displayed their red manes to be 205 ± 39.6 seconds. The mean time that the fish in cold water displayed their red manes was 56 ± 50.1 seconds. We found that there was a significant difference between the two groups (t-stat= 5.2, df=3, p=0.014). The difference in average aggressive display time of red “mane” can be observed through Figure 1. 

Discussion:
	Our results supported our hypothesis that the male betta fish would be less aggressive in cold water in order to conserve energy necessary for survival. As mentioned earlier, other studies have shown that decreasing the temperature of a small organism will also decrease the metabolic rate of that animal [Gillooly: 2001]. Thus, the animal must conserve energy in order to survive. This conservation comes at the cost of not demonstrating such frequent and aggressive displays of the red “mane” in many fish [Ros: 2006]. Our results were similar to previous studies because we didn’t observe as long of an agonistic display in cold water as we did in room temperature water (Figure 1). Because oxygen is needed to display the red “mane”, there must be an abundant amount of oxygen in order for the bettas to survive and show aggressive behavior. In colder water, more oxygen is devoted to maintaining circulation within the organism, so there is not as much left over for agonistic displays. However; one study found that energetic costs may emerge late during conflict when animals escalate their behavior [Ros: 2006]. This study correlates with one of our interactions in the cold water when the two fish began to demonstrate aggressive behavior after having sat passively in the cold water for the first few minutes.  Research suggests that changes in behavior often is adaptive and therefore increases the probability of survival [Schreck: 2011]. This study also co-aligns with our hypothesis that the fish will decrease their agonistic behavior in order to survive. The next step in this study could be to test how males react differently against a female in different temperature waters in order to understand if they will exert their red mane less or more. The results could provide information as to how male bettas expend and conserve their energy differently when interacting with males and females at different temperatures.  This experiment supports that male bettas are less aggressive in cold water, but a future study could also test whether an increased temperature water would actually increase agonistic displays.
