Title: Effects of Caffeine Injection to Frog’s Muscles

Abstract:
Manipulation of frog’s muscle contraction would allow us greater insight into the ways muscles work and could help with applications such as prosthetic limbs. Caffeine would cause greater muscle contraction as calcium is always in the muscle, never allowing it to unbind from each other. We hypothesized that the amps produced by the muscle would spike after being injected by caffeine. Using credible previous studies, caffeine had an impact on the muscle’s contraction to tetany. We used tree frog legs and stuck metal electrodes into the sciatic nerve and measured the amps produced by the legs 5 times before and 5 times after the injection. Our data was significent as our p_value is lower than 0.05. Our hypothesis was supported by our significent data.

Introduction:
The experiment tests the effects of a caffeine injection into the Frog’s gastrocnemus muscle by measurement of voltage. The caffeine plays an important biological effect within the muscle fibers of the frog as it affects the amount of calcium within the sarcomeres of the frog muscles. [Almers, 1984] The frog muscles contract and release, causing movement in which it utilizes to travel to places. This is essential in the frog’s daily life as it allows it to move and travel to other places. [S.Ebashi, 1968] The frog’s gastrocnemus muscle was chosen because of the relative ease of obtaining it and the easy observation of it tightening. [Paul H, 2005] Normally, acetycholine is released from the nerve terminal and its binds with the muscle fibers, causing the release of calcium which causes an action potential in the muscle fiber, opening the sodium channels. The sodium is then released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and this causes the actin and myosin to form a cross bridge, resulting in a muscle contraction. [Almers, 1984] However, the caffeine has been known to overstimulate the calcium channels and allow it to remain the sarcomere for longer than usual, causing tetany. The constant presence of calcium does not allow the muscle fibers to be released from each other. An essential observation is the extended period in which it contracts for as it showcases the effect of caffeine. [Paul H, 2005] Normally, the electrical impulse would be given by the frog’s nerves however, since it’s a separate entity, electrical voltages would be provided by use of metal electrodes. Our hypothesis is to send voltages 5 times into the frog’s sciatic nerve and then inject the gastrocnemus muscle with caffeine and then send voltages 5 more times, the leg was tested with a consistent 5 volts.



Materials and Method:
We first collected three frog legs and skinned them, we then located the sciatic nerve for the metal electrodes. We set them up with the string attached to the muscle to measure the voltage in the muscle. We then placed metal electrodes in the sciatic nerve and sent 5 voltages through it consistently at 5 volts before injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with caffeine and then sending 5 voltages afterwards to test the contraction of the muscle. We then repeated this two more times with the two other legs. Our Independent variables will be the change in voltage and using the same amount and kind of caffeine. Our dependent variable will be the summation or amount of twitch that the muscle responds with. 

Results:
For leg 1 (figure 1), the voltage increased significently after the injection of caffeine as it spiked from 0.187V before the caffeine injection to 0.882V after the caffeine injection. For leg 2 (figure 1), the voltage produced by the leg also increased significently from 0.2914V before the injection to 0.693V after the injection. Lastly, leg 3 (figure 1) showed the greatest change in voltage produced by the leg as it ranged from 0.0972V before the injection to 1.037V after the injection. Standard deviations were shown on the graph as each dot represents 5 voltages, they are however extremely small and are hard to see on the graph. A two-tailed two sample t_test was ran for the average amps before and after the caffeine injection across the three legs. The T-test results for the amps before and after the injection is (t_stat=5.94, d.f.=4, P=0.02448). Our data was significent because the p_value was below 0.05.



Discussion:
The results do support our hypothesis as our data was significent. Our p_values are well below the threshold of 0.05. The caffeine introduced a large amount of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcomere and causes it to contract until tetany. The caffeine overstimulates the muscle and as such, is contracted until it runs out of ATP. [Almers, 1984] This is evident by the amps produced by the frogs as it spikes after the injection of caffeine. The sciatic nerve is stimulated by the volts produced from the metal electrodes so creates an action potential in the muscle causing the continued contraction of the muscle as calcium is unable to return to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A logical next step for this study is to repeat this experiment but with different injected substances instead of caffeine, a logical choice could be pure calcium. It would be advisable to use the same tools to repeat the experiment in order to maintain consistency. The seizing of the muscle is akin to continued contraction of muscle such as tetrodoxin or rigor mortis. The manipulation of muscle contraction would help the scientific community down the road on applying such knowledge to items such as prosthetic limbs. The more research about muscles, the easier it is in the future to create artificial limbs to aid other people.

Figure 1. Effects of Caffeine Injection into a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle as evident by voltage from the frog’s leg. The voltage from the frog’s leg before the injection of caffeine is rather similar and it spikes after being injected by caffeine. This process is repeated two more times for a total of three. The voltage was measured by a metal electrode. Each dot is a mean value of 5 voltages from either the pre-injection or post-injection group, the error bars are ± 0.03-0.024
