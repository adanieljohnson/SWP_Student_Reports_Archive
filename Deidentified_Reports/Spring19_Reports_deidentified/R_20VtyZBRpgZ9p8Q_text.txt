Title: Effect varying higher temperatures has on photosystem II in spinach chloroplasts over 60 minutes. 

Abstract:
Plants are never in constant environmental conditions because temperature, humidity, wind, ph levels etc.… are always changing. Due to an increase in air pollutant and green house gases, the earth has increased in temperature over the years. With this in mind the primary question we were interested in is, does higher temperatures affect photosynthesis? We predict that spinach chloroplasts in solution at room temperature will have the largest decrease in absorbance compared with 30 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees. We designed an experiment using DCIP as an electron acceptor for the hill reaction as the premise to measure photosystem II output. We obtained a time zero absorbance and then measures their absorbances every 15 minutes over an hour. Our data supported our hypothesis and based on the ANOVA we ran our results were statistically significent. This conclusion came from our calculation of P-value with a 95% confidence interval utilizing the ANOVA. We would like to further our research by designing an experiment using varying ph levels in combination with higher temperatures to see if that has any other effect on the photosynthetic rate in plants

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes that plants undergo. Plants ability to undergo photosynthesis is beneficial not only to the plants but to all other organisms. With earth’s climate constantly changing, and human activity causing many unpredictable consequences, it is vital for us to understand what are the different factors that affect the photosynthetic rate of a plant. In our experiment we will be measuring the Photosystem II output because we are able to use the hill reaction to measure the photosynthesis output.  If we isolate the chloroplasts, photosystem II will pass electrons to alternative electron acceptors that are much easier to measure; this is the hill reaction. We used a hydrophobic electron acceptor 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol, also known as DCIP. When DCIP is oxidized it is a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light. When it is reduced to DCIPH2 reorganizes bonds and if reduced enough will become colorless. As color is lost, we are able to measure the DCIP reduction to DCIPH2 directly as a decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm [Garrido:2001]. This means that photosynthesis has an inverse relationship with absorbances, as the absorbances decrease it means that photosynthesis is taking place. Using what we know we were interested in changing external factors to measure how photosynthesis is affected in spinach leaves. An article explained that at higher temperatures photosynthesis is one of the plant cell functions that is highly sensitive and is usually inhibited before other cell functions are affected. Plants placed in higher than normal temperatures primarily affect Photosystem II (PSII) [Mathur :2014]. A study done on found that exposure to 40 and 45°C for 6 hours resulted in a significent decrease in the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II [Chen: 2012]. Our group was interested in seeing if this conclusion was still true exposing chloroplast to an hour at higher temperatures instead of six hours. We predict that spinach chloroplasts in solution at room temperature will have the largest decrease in absorbance compared with 30 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees Celsius.

Materials and Method:
Our experiment was broken into two parts. In part one we isolated and enriched the chloroplast from 6 medium-sized spinach leaves.  We grinded 6 deveined spinach leaves with a total of 30 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), waited 3 minutes that beginning after the grinding was complete and strained the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. We then transferred the green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes. Lastly, we poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into a second chilled 50 Ml beaker labeled sample A and left the pellet of debris at the bottom of tube “A”. Next in part two of our experiment, we began by labeling 19 test tubes and adding varying volumes of water, 130 mM DCIP and reaction buffer as seen in Figure 1. To begin the assay, we added 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts, that were prepared in part one of our experiment to the blank tube, and tubes #4-19. After adding the chloroplast, we immediately mixed each tube and got a spectrophotometer reading at 600 nm beginning with tube blank and then measuring the rest of the tubes. Then, we placed tubed blank and 2-9 at room temperature, tubes 10-14 in a 30 degrees Celsius warm water bath, and tubes 14-19 in a 45 degrees Celsius warm water bath. We the measured their absorbances every 15 minutes over the next hour. We used an ANOVA as our statistical test to determine whether our results we statistically significent or not. 

Results:
Our results showed a greater decrease in absorbances at room temperature followed by 30 degrees Celsius and an increase in absorbance at 45 degrees Celsius. The percent change of the absorbances were as followed: room temperature 18% decrease, 30 degrees Celsius 10% decrease and at 45 degrees a 14% increase. Figure 1. shows the correct measurement for water, 130mM DCIP and reaction buffer each test tube contained. We ran an ANOVA on Figure 2. which showed that our results for the change in absorbance were significent based on the 95% confidence interval. Our statistical test showed ( d.f. =3, P&lt; 0.05).

Discussion:
Overall our results supported our hypothesis because the chloroplasts in solution at room temperature had the largest decrease in absorbance compared with 30 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees. This means that it had the most photosynthetic activity of the three groups. Similarly, although this was not part of our hypothesis, the trend continued with test tubes in 30 degrees Celsius had a larger decrease in absorbance compared to the test tubes in 45 degrees Celsius. Our results showed that the most photosynthetic activity was observed at room temperature and the least photosynthetic was observed at the highest temperature (45 degrees Celsius). Previous research done allows us to make sense on why there was a significent drop in photosynthetic activity, specifically photosystem II. A research article stated that one of the key factors that makes PSII electron transport most susceptible to heat stress is that there is an increase in fluidity of thylakoid membranes at higher temperatures which causes dislodging of PSII light harvesting complexes from thylakoid membrane [Mathur: 2014]. This is important to know because as global warming takes more and more effect due to climate change, the consequences are affecting vital processes such as photosynthesis. However, temperature is not the only environmental condition that is changing. Acid rain is becoming more prevalent than we have seen previously. Now that we know temperature affects photosynthesis, further research can be done to see if ph has any effect on photosynthesis. The primary question being how does ph in combination with higher temperatures effect the photosynthetic rate in plants.
