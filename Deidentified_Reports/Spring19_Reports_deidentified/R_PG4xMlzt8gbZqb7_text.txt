Title: The effects of sodium inhibition on neuromuscular reactions in Limnodynastes Tasmaniensis

Abstract:
The function of muscles and ability to move both voluntarily and involuntarily in Limnodynastes Tasmaniensis is directly connected the interaction between muscular and nervous systems though electrical and chemical signaling. The inhibition or excitation of these chemical reactions, however, could affect the ability of the muscle to react to various stimuli. Three legs were similarly tested, each once as a controll and once after lidocaine injections as a treatment, to determine the effects of a sodium blocker on muscular reactions to electrical stimuli in, Limnodynastes Tasmaniensis, L. Tasmaniensis. The collected data was quantified by comparing both the change in voltage threshold and change in muscular reaction to the controll threshold before and after lidocaine treatments to determine significent change. The final results showed that there was a statistically significent difference in muscular reactions to the controll threshold but not for change in threshold overall. In each of the legs there was only a minute, if any, reaction to the controll voltage threshold after being treated with the sodium blocker. The analysis and observations support the hypothesis given that the reactions following lidocaine treatment were decreased compared to the controll though some movement

Introduction:
The nervous system is a vital mechanism for the function of muscular systems, processing chemical and electrical stimuli and processing the signals to enable movement. These neuromuscular interactions allow reactions to various stimuli which can be recorded using a myogram. Myograms are specialized devices that analyze the reactions of muscles, converting movement into Volts as a unit of measurement based on the various levels of electrical stimuli given through a current probe [Johnson:2018]. This unique intercommunication between the nervous system signaling and muscular reactions is specific to animals due to the presence of myofibers in the muscular system [Johnson:2018]. This neuromuscular connection is visibly present in the hind legs of L.  Tasmaniensis in the gastrocnemus muscle in the thigh and the sciatic nerve which runs longitudinally down the leg [De Luca: 1997]. This relationship is vital to survival as extreme signals are required to trigger high-energy movement of these muscles which enable the frog to jump long distances. Many chemical reactions are triggered by the electrical stimuli that begin the signaling process in the nervous system [De Luca: 1997]. Sodium is one such reactive component of the neuromuscular interactions which is necessary for signals translating muscle movement [De Luca: 1997]. The use of various other chemical stimuli to alter normal chemical reactions in the muscle would disrupt the standard cascade of events between neuromuscular systems [De Luca: 1997]. It is hypothesized that the use of a sodium blocker on the Gastrocnemius muscle would inhibit nervous system signaling, preventing muscle reactions to electrical stimuli.

Abstract cont. 
remained in the feet due to the injections not being directly in the sciatic nerve. It is concluded that the injection of a sodium blocker into L. Tasmaniensis gastrocnemus muscle minimizes the reactions of the thigh to electrical stimuli due to inhibition of signaling while peripheral areas of the leg were less affected.

Materials and Method:
Three L.  Tasmaniensis legs were tested in two parts, the controll and treatment, to determine the effects of a chemical sodium blocker on muscular reactions to electrical stimuli. Each leg was tested individually to preserve moisture for optimal results of accurate muscle movement. The leg was first prepared by removing the skin from the top of the thigh down to the foot, exposing the gastrocnemus muscle. The muscle was then gently separated to expose the sciatic nerve. Once the nerve was separated from surrounding muscle and connective tissues the electrical current probe was placed for later stimulation. The sciatic nerve was chosen for current probe placement because the nerve itself would not be treated with the sodium blocker, only the gastrocnemus muscle. While handling the sciatic nerve, care was taken to maintain moisture and limit metal exposure in order to preserve the ionized state and ensure accurate muscle reactions. The leg was then connected at two points to the myogram, used to measure the voltage reactions of the muscle to varying electrical stimulus. The controll was then tested by finding the threshold of the leg and recording the reaction in Volts. For the treatment, the gastrocnemus muscle was injected in two spots with 0.05 Ml of 25 mM lidocaine, totaling 0.1 Ml, and was given a 7-minute resting period to allow the sodium blocker to take effect. The leg was then retested at the controll threshold for a reaction before finding the new treatment threshold in Volts. This process was repeated on all three L.  Tasmaniensis legs and the collected data was analyzed using a two-tailed t_test to determine statistical significance.

Results:
The difference in neuromuscular reactivity to electrical stimuli in L.  Tasmaniensis before and after treatment with lidocaine injections was statistically significent regarding the change in average muscular reaction (t-value: 11.055, DF:4, p_value:0.0003) but not with regard to the change in voltage threshold for muscular reaction (t-value: 1.375, DF:4, p_value:0.241). The average voltage reaction for L.  Tasmaniensis following lidocaine injections was less than the controll with 0.002 ± 0.003 V while those prior to lidocaine injection were 0.063 ± 0.009 (Figure 2). The average voltage threshold for L. Tasmaniensis following lidocaine injections was insignificently greater with 0.153 ± 0.047 V threshold compared to the 0.103 ± 0.041 V in the controll group (Figure 1).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the use of a sodium blocker would inhibit muscle reactions to electrical stimuli in L.  Tasmaniensis was supported by the findings, however the inhibition was limited both in the affected area of muscle and in the limit of reactions to greater stimuli. The observations of each frog leg during the controll period showed distinct movement in the thigh through to the foot while they were significently decreased following the lidocaine treatment. However, despite the lesser movement, in two of the legs the feet would move when the rest of the leg would not. This can be attributed to the placement of the electrical current on the sciatic nerve which could signal to the muscles in the foot without being affected by the lidocaine injection in the gastrocnemus muscle in the thigh. This suggests that an alternative placement of the probe, directly on the muscle, could have resulted in no periphery movement during the treatment testing as the signal could not have moved beyond the inhibited area. These findings were supported by previous studies showing similar muscular inhibition due to alternative synthesized sodium blockers [De Luca: 1997]. The study also found that differing sodium blockers and doses can different affect the muscular reactions [De Luca: 1997]. This suggests that an alternative concentration of lidocaine could have caused a further increase in voltage threshold for the treatment and that an increase in injection sites could have limited periphery movement in the leg. The previous studies findings further supported the collected data regarding the effect of electrical stimuli following treatment, requiring greater voltage to produce similar reactions [De Luca: 1997]. It is concluded that the use of a sodium blocker on a specific muscle system will have effects on the injection site and surrounding areas, inhibiting reactions that were more likely to occur without the blocker; however, the reactions in periphery areas and when more extreme stimuli were implemented were not entirely inhibited. This study could be further expanded to test the effects of sodium blockers on different types of muscle tissue or on different organisms where physiology is differed by environmental pressures, allowing further insight into uses for sodium blockers based on specific factors.
