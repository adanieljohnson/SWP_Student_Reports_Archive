Title: The effects of the presence of food on the aggression of Betta splendins males

Abstract:
The topic for this experiment was animal behavior, in this case specifically intraspecies agnostic behavior. This behavior was observed in the fish species Betta splendins. For this experiment, the independent variable of the presence of food was introduced to see how the behavior of the fish was affected. It was hypothesized that the presence of food would lead to increased levels of intraspecies agnostic behavior in the Betta splendins males. A statistically significent difference was found in the means of the sums of aggressive behavior values between the presence of food and the absence of food. The mean for the presence of food was higher than the mean for the absence of food, in which a higher mean value indicates higher levels of aggression. This supports our hypothesis that adding the presence of food to increase competition among the male Betta splendins fish would increase their levels of aggression among each other.

Introduction:
This experiment studies the effects of the presence of food on the aggression levels of the fish species Betta splendins, also commonly known as Siamese fighting fish. Betta splendins are known to show very aggressive intraspecies behavior. Intraspecies behavior is behavior that takes places in interactions between members of the same species. For this experiment, we wanted to see if competition for food affected levels of aggressiveness within these fish. This experiment specifically looks at the effects of introducing dry food into the environment, but other studies have shown that live diets are preferred for feeding this type of fish [Thongprajukaew: 2019]. Our hypothesis is that if food is presented to two starved Betta males, then the males should exhibit more intraspecific agnostic behavior in competition for the food.

Materials and Method:
Six Betta splendins males were used in this experiment. Prior to the experiment, these six males were starved of food for 3 days. To measure the agnostic behaviors of these fish, we used a 1-6 ranking system, and each of the behaviors they exhibited had a value between 1 and 6. Behavior 1 was pelvic fin flickering. Behavior 2 was tail beating. Behavior 3 was tail flashing. Behavior 4 was erect pectoral fins. Behavior 5 was spreading gill covers. Behavior 6 was the “red mane” behavior. Initially, two males were placed together in the same tank for five minutes and their behavior was observed and recorded. Next, the two fish were separated for a five minute rest period. Next, the fish were then placed together again and the fish food TetraPro was introduced into the environment. Under these circumstances, their behavior was observed and recorded for five minutes, then they were separated again. Two fish tanks were used to help isolate the variable of the presence of food. This entire process is then repeated two more times with two entirely different sets of Betta males. A two-tailed t_test was used to analyze the results.

Results:
The mean sum of aggressive behavior in male Betta splendins in the absence of food was 8.667 +/- 5.465 (Fig. 1). The mean sum of aggressive behavior in male Betta splendins in the presence of food was 22.500 +/- 7.120 (Fig. 1). The difference between the means of the sums of aggressive behavior in the presence of food and in the absence of food was found to be statistically significent (t_stat = 9.00, d.f. = 5, p_value = 0.0003). The behavior of these male Betta splendins was clearly more aggressive in the presence of food.

Discussion:
The mean aggressive behavior value was higher in the presence of food than in the absence of food, and our two-tailed t_test showed the results to be statistically significent. So, the results support our initial hypothesis that the presence of food would lead to increased aggressive intraspecies behavior from the fish. Using our ranking system of aggressive behaviors, we were able to determine that the fish were more aggressive in the presence of food. This is due to the competition for a limited amount of food within one environment. Typically, studies have found in the past that maximum growth and reproductive performance can be achieved by feeding Betta splendins twice a day [James: 2004]. However, in this experiment the fish were starved for three days prior, so this is probably an unusually long amount of time for these fish to go unfed. This increased the levels of competition for food among the fish since that had not eaten in a long time, which was our intention in not feeding them for several days. Betta splendins are already known to be a very aggressive species of fish, and adding the competition for food increased their levels of agnostic behavior.
