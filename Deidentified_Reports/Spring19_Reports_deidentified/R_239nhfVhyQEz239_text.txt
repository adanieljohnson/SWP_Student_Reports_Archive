Title: The Effects of Caffeine of Muscle Contraction in Deceased Frogs' Legs

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system helps an organism sense and respond to stimuli in a more controllled and quick way than the hormone system, and it can be easily affected by outside chemicals like caffeine. We will connect a series of three different frog muscles directly to a force transducer, then measure their myograms both before and after caffeine injections. The statistical test showed a significent increase in mV measured after the injection, so therefore the hypothesis was supported. This means that caffeine strengthens muscles, and induces tetany faster. This leads to further discussion on the effect caffeine has on muscle performance in other areas of life, such as sports.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system helps an organism sense and respond to stimuli in a more controllled and quick way than, say, the hormone system. It can respond within milliseconds, whereas hormones take much longer to release and spread to the targeted areas of the body. An animal’s skeletal muscle is comprised of myofibers bound by the connective tissue in the body. The myofibers are activated by acetylcholine release from the nerves, which open calcium channels that cause an action potential in the myofibers. We can study the movements generated by the action potential with myograms, which are visual recordings of the stages within singular muscle twitches. They are collected by attaching the muscle to a force transducer and stimulating the muscle directly, or the sciatic nerve connected to it. It is known that caffeine ingestion can promote performance-enhancing effects on the power of muscle [Duncan: 2015], so our hypothesis is that is that if the muscle is directly injected with 1Ml of 200mM caffeine, the muscle twitches will last longer and be more intense due to the effect caffeine has on muscle stimulation.

Materials and Method:
Three different frog’s legs were connected directly to a force transducer, with the sciatic nerve remaining untouched and unattached to the stimulus and the muscle being directly attached.  The frequency is 1 Hz, the width is 5 seconds, and the voltage used is 5v. The strength, length, and latent period of each stimulation will be measured through a series of myograms as a controll, then each frog’s leg will be injected with 1Ml of 200mM caffeine then the same settings will be used to stimulate each muscle directly again. Any trends and differences will be recorded. The data will be then tested with a paired T-test.

Results:
There were some general trends noted. Each frog legs immediately swelled up after the injection of the caffeine. Each frog leg was firm to the touch and tense immediately after injection as well. The caffeine also chemically reduced tetany, since the tetany was observed quicker and at a higher rate after injection. The p_value was 0.01, much lower than he alpha value of 0.05. The legs with caffeine injections had a higher average mV level.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported. This information was also supported in another study: when 8mM caffeine was injected, enough calcium was released from the muscle to increase contractions [Herz: 1968], meaning that the force of the contraction in the leg was greater with caffeine injection than without it. This is also true for our experiment. For each leg, there were some immediate effects of the injected observed. The controll stimuli always yielded a contraction that steadily declined over time, whereas without the injection the contractions were in the same general mV level for all five pulses. After the caffeine was injected, it produced chemically induced tetany immediately for all three legs tested, raising the baseline threshold much higher than in controll tests. Each contraction was still measured as more intense (a higher mV) than before the injection, even with the new baseline. Each injection also physically changed the muscle and made it look swollen and translucent. Therefore, the caffeine significently affected the muscle contraction in both intensity and duration, due to the increase in chemically induced tetany. This can be applied to other areas of study, such as the effects of caffeine consumption in humans, especially pertaining to athletes. Caffeine can improve muscle contraction, so it could be regulated in the future to stop immoral use of it to increase performance when needed. It can be seen in the same vein as other stimulants, such as steroids in that sense. In future studies, we would have to use many more frog legs at several different controll settings, to ensure our three legs tested weren’t outliers and that muscle improvement was the norm across the board.
