Title: The Effect of Nitrogen Exposure on Energy Allocation in Pisum Sativum 

Abstract:
   Efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer is paramount to agriculture because farmers want to maximize crop production and minimize risk to the environment. This experiment studies the effect of nitrogen on energy allocation in Pisum sativun (pea plants). Plants can utilize epigenetics (turning genes on and off) to focus growth on specific parts, specifically roots and shoots. The expectation was that the the root/shoot ratio for plants watered with both nitrogen and water would be greater than the ratio for the controll plants watered with water alone. The data showed a significent difference between the root/shoot ratios of the treatment and controll groups leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis that nitrogen fertilizer has no effect on the root/shoot ratios of Pisum sativun, and the acceptance of the alternative hypothesis. This difference coupled with the observation that treatment plants were generally smaller suggests that nitrogen overuse caused nitrogen burn in the treatment plants. 

Introduction:
   This experiment tests energy allocation disparity among Pisum sativun (garden pea) plants grown in a nitrogen-rich environment and those in a standard environment. Photosynthesis (is) linearly dependent on leaf N per unit area [Sage: 1987]. The more nitrogen absorbed by a plant, the more efficiently it can perform photosynthesis. The positive effects of nitrogen application to plants, particularly crops, are not infinite. This is apparent in the study of grain plants. More N fertilizer supplied than 150 kg/ha could not increase the amount of N accumulation in plant, contributing to the slight effects on N uptake during the later growth stage of wheat. With the increase of N fertilizer rate, the proportion of N allocation to grain was decreased, and the amount and proportion of N allocation to stem and leaf were increased dramatically [Junye: 2006]. The hypothesis is that pea plants watered with both water and the nitrogen solution will have higher root/shoot ratios than plants watered with water alone because they will be encouraged to allocate more energy to develop strong roots in their resource rich environment.

Materials and Method:
   The treatment and controll garden peas were planted in separate containers filled with soil, each stored in a greenhouse. The planters were watered once daily for two weeks, the treatment planter with 50 Ml of nitrogen solution and 50 Ml of water. The controll planter was watered with 50 Ml of water only. The plants were harvested after the two weeks and separated from the remaining soil by means of running water. The plant roots were cut off from the shoots just above the seed casing. The specimens, separated into treatment and controll groups, were individually weighed and their lengths measured. This data was recorded into a computer with Excel, which was later used to perform a statistical two-tailed T-test with a .95 confidence interval to calculate the root/shoot ratios.

Results:
The root/shoot ratio for weight is lower in the treatment group. The P Value for weight=0.0417 and the P Value for length=0.0479. The treatment plants were observed to be smaller and generally less healthy than the controll group. (t_stat = 0.57, d.f. = 2, P = 0.0448) 

Discussion:
   The hypothesis that pea plants watered with a combination of water and the nitrogen solution will have a greater root/shoot ratio was accepted due to the significent difference in the T-test. The root/shoot ratio for the weight of the treatment group was over .5 less than the controll group (with a sizeable margin of error) (Figure 1). This may be due to nitrogen burn, because the roots of the treatment plants were shorter, or because the shoots were longer (with size/length correlating to weight). Nitrogen overuse is not only detrimental to plants, but the runoff can be devastating to the local ecosystem [Lin: 2014]. The peas were only allowed to grow for two weeks, possibly limiting the time too much for full resource allocation. Additionally, the amount and frequency of nitrogen application may have been too much and may have burned the roots.
