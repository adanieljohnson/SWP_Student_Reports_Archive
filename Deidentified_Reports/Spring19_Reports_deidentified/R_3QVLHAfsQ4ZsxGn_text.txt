Title: Addition of Food to Beta Splendens Decrease Aggressiveness Levels 

Abstract:
Organisms are always interacting with each other and with other organisms. This paper sought to explore interactions the same species had with each other, more specifically how the Betta splendens interacted with each other. Betta fish are known to be aggressive towards each other. They show a series of aggressive displays ranging from slightly aggressive to very aggressive. In order from least aggressive to most aggressive it is pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing and showing a red mane. This experiment tested how the Beta fish aggressiveness changed in response to food. The fish alternated between being given food first and no food first. They were separated with a clear divider and their actions were observed for 5 minutes. Our group hypothesized that the fish would be more aggressive towards each other in the presence of food. Our results did not support our hypothesis. The average aggressive value was actually higher when the fish did not have food as opposed to when they did. This study helped show species interaction with each other. 

Introduction:
Organisms interact with each other and with other species all the time. Some species are more aggressive to each other as opposed to other species. Beta fish, Betta splendens, are one of the species that are very aggressive towards each other. They display aggressiveness through various forms. These include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. They also will show a red mane which is the most aggressive move they can do. While the fish are aggressive towards each other, a study showed where they still preferred socializing with each other as opposed to other species. [Snekser 2006]. Another study observed the aggressiveness of the Betas while focusing on the colors of them. They found that color may have an effect in affecting the level of aggressiveness towards each other, but their results were not significant. [Irawan 2003]. This suggests that color may not be bug reason to why Beta fish are aggressive towards each other. Our study will explore how the Beta fish are aggressive towards each other with the presence of food. We hypothesize that the fish will be more aggressive towards each other when they have food because food is needed for survival. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we started by feeding two separated male Beta fish for 5 minutes to observe their behavior as a baseline. Then we got two different (male) Beta fish with a clear divider between them and feed them both. We observed their behavior for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, we put in an opaque divider and allowed them to rest for 5 minutes. Then we removed the opaque divider again and watched their aggression towards each other for 5 minutes but without food. We then repeated this with 6 other fish for a total of 8 different fish. However, we switched up the order of giving food first and not giving food first. During each of the 5 minute trials we timed how long each fish flickered its pelvic fin and showed its mane. Because mane display is the most aggressive form of behavior the number we got was multiplied by 2.  Then we added the two numbers together to get a total aggressive score. We then used a paired t-test. 

Results:
The results showed the Beta fish being more aggressive without the presence of food. There was no statistically significant difference between the aggressiveness of the fish with food and without food. (t-stat = 1.72, df = 7, P = 0.129). This data is illustrated on figure 1 with the error bars being the standard deviations. From left to right they are 130.7 and 130.9. 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis. This was shown through our data collection when the level of aggressiveness of the Beta fish was higher in the presence of food than without food. A possible explanation for this is that the fish wanted to eat before fighting so they have energy when they fight. One study showed where the “winner” of a fight would have higher oxygen consumption that night compared to the looser. [Collins 2008]. Oxygen is important to survival, so this is a benefit for winning the fight and being more aggressive than the other Betta. Another explanation for why the Betta fish were more aggressive without food is that they were distracted by the food, and put their attention to that instead of the other Beta next to them. There were no errors made that would have messed up our data. In a future study it would be interesting to have no divider between the Beta fish and add food to see if the fish immediately resorted to aggressive behaviors or went for the food instead. This would further show the level of aggressiveness of the Beta fish. Outside of this lab, it is important to see how species interact not only with other species, but also with each other.
