Title: Manduca Sexta Experiment

Abstract:
In this experiment, the goal is to determine the relation by which a certain diet will impact the weight of the Manduca Sexta within a seven day increment. Each day of the seven day increment was followed by the weighing of each caterpillar and drops of Azaguard, Diluted Azaguard or distilled water in their food. 
The measurements were then recorded in an excel spreadsheet to display the entire dataset. This data was used in a statistical test, which was later used to determine whether our hypothesis was supported by our results. Overall, some of the caterpillars showed signs of molting and pupation, which could alter the hypothesis that was tested. 

Introduction:
The hornworm, called the Manduca Sexta is a caterpillar that requires Juvenile Hormone (JH) in order to pupate into an adult. An insect growth regulator (IGR) is a chemical that inhibits the life cycle of an insect. IGR’s mimic hormones in an insect's growth development and disrupts how insects grow and reproduce. The IGR we used in our experiment is called azaguard. Azaguard prevents molting between the larval, pupal, and nymphal stages, which would inhibit the growth of the Manduca Sexta. Our group hypothesized that using an IGR will increase the weight of the Manduca Sexta . In our experiment, we will be testing to determine at what level of IGR will have the most growth on the Manduca Sexta.

Materials and Methods:
(9) Manduca Sexta Caterpillars weighing 0.69g to 2.282g 
We placed each caterpillar in a container with 60g of food and two air holes
We fed each caterpillar 1 of 3 diets for 7 days 
(3) received 4 drops of concentrated (1:1250) Azaguard with 60g of food
(3) received 4 drops of diluted concentrated (2:1) Azaguard with 60g of food. 50% of the Azaguard was used, and the other 50% was diluted with distilled water
(3) received 4 drops of distilled water in 60g of food


Results:
In our findings, Caterpillar #5 displayed the most significant growth (initially weighing at 0.69g to finally weighing 9.82g). Caterpillar #1 displayed signs of pupation towards the end of the experiment, which can be drawn from the weight loss recorded (7.03g to 6.76g). Caterpillar #8 provided the most steady growth compared to the other caterpillars, which could mean that the diluted concentration increased the chances of steady growth. An observation recorded is that the diluted and control group weighed less than the full concentrated group, which can be a result of the dehydration of the full concentration group. The control group received 4 drops of distilled water in their food, which could have inhibited their growth patterns whereas the diluted concentration was slightly impacted.


Discussion:
	In our results, we found that there was no significant statistical findings that could prove that the IGR at varying concentrations could impact the final weight compared to a control group . In our data, the caterpillars (1, 4, and 7) that were given the IGR’s did increase at a faster rate compared to the diluted concentration and the control group (distilled water). However, there were drastic changes between the control group and the other groups. This affects our data in that we cannot draw a comparison given the results founded. The caterpillars given the diluted solution showed signs of rapid growth or no growth at all, and the control group also was not consistent amongst themselves.
One of the factors that can be incorporated if this was replicated again is for the caterpillars to have similar weights, and to measure the food beforehand. There could have been varying levels of food and drops of concentration during each day that could have impacted our results. However, the caterpillars given the full concentration of IGR’s were significant amongst each other and can therefore support our hypothesis that the IGR would increase the caterpillars final weight. Future areas of study could study more levels of concentration and caterpillar observations during each larval stage for a prolonged period.
