Title: Lidocaine’s Effect on the Contractile Force of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Lidocaine is an important chemical that is used around the world for different purposes such as in dentist offices and in some home remedies for its numbing properties. While it does have numbing properties, it has a major effect on the contractile force of a muscle as it blocks calcium. In this study, lidocaine’s effects were studied on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens. It was expected that the injection of lidocaine, or another calcium blocker, into the gastrocnemus muscle would cause a much weaker muscle contraction. The results of the experiment revealed that there was a significent difference among the frog legs strength of contraction before and after the injection of lidocaine. Lidocaine restricts the calcium such that it is not able to activate the mechanism necessary for proper muscle contraction and therefore causes the muscle to relax. Lidocaine’s ability to relax muscles could be encouraging for further study into how to use lidocaine for other purposes in the body such as relaxing the muscles of the airway and therefore reducing bronchospasms or just reducing muscle spasticity in general so therefore further studies on lidocaine would be beneficial. 

Introduction:
Neuromuscular controll plays a vital role in sensing and responding to internal and external environments. The neuromuscular system consists of nerves and muscles that can respond within milliseconds via action potentials to changes in their different environments [Johnson: 2018]. This process involves action potentials that cause the neuron to release acetylcholine which binds to a receptor on the muscle to open sodium channels that generate action potentials in the muscle fiber. These action potentials stimulate the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which activates the contraction mechanism in the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. Altering the calcium levels in a muscle will affect the muscle’s ability to contract. The action potential in the muscle fibers, that occurs due to the presence of calcium, is what results in muscle contraction. This experiment studied the effects of blocking calcium on the ability of the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens to contract. This experiment focused on the difference in twitch threshold of a frog leg before and after blocking calcium. One experiment, that was performed in the past, treated humans with lidocaine to observe its effects on bronchospasms. They concluded that lidocaine reduced the severity of the bronchospasms which means that it was more difficult for the muscles to contract [Groeben: 2007]. It is predicted that if the calcium in a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle is blocked, then the frog’s ability to contract the muscle will decrease as there will be less calcium to cause the action potentials in the muscle which would result in a decrease in the intensity of the muscle contraction as a reduction of calcium causes difficulty in muscle contraction.

Materials and Method:
This experiment utilized the lower section of three frog legs, emphasizing the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle in order to measure nerve and muscle activity before and after calcium was blocked. After isolating the sciatic nerve from the muscle, the probe was directly attached to the sciatic nerve by laying the sciatic nerve over the probe. The probe was connected to software that allowed shocks of varying intensities to be delivered. A string was tied from the leg to the measurement tool that was connected to software. This provided a numerical value for the intensity of the muscle contraction. The voltage used to stimulate the nerve allows for contractions of different intensities to be observed and recorded at different intervals. The twitch threshold was found for each trial by electrically shocking the leg at certain intervals until a reaction or numerical measurement of voltage could be recorded. The specimen must have been observed at all times to verify the data. This procedure was performed before and after the injection of 0.1Ml of 25mM lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle. This lidocaine was injected in two different spots in increments of 0.05Ml. The twitch threshold was observed, recorded and compared between the legs before the injection of lidocaine and after. A one-tailed paired t_test was used to evaluate the data by imputing the response in voltage for each frog leg at its twitch threshold and comparing the controll and treatment responses. 

Results:
It was revealed that the contractile force for the treatment group was significently decreased when compared to the controll group. The controll group was found to contract normally at each leg’s threshold while after the injection of lidocaine, the legs hardly contracted at their twitch thresholds. Overall, the treatment group contracted with lesser force than the controll group. The twitch threshold for frog leg 1 for the controll was 0.055V while the treatment threshold was 0.006V (Figure 1). The twitch threshold for frog leg 2 for the controll was 0.073V while the treatment threshold was 0.003V (Figure 1). The twitch threshold for frog leg 3 for the controll was 0.063V while the treatment threshold was 0.006V (Figure 1). The differences among the controll and treatment were 0.049V for frog leg 1, 0.070V for frog leg 2, and 0.057V for frog leg 3. This experiment revealed that the treatment group generally produced a response of lesser voltage than the controll group (t-value= 9.587, degrees of freedom= 2, p_value=0.0107). 

Discussion:
This experiment concluded that the hypothesis was supported as our p_value reveals that our data was significently different. The data is significently different which means that there is support in our experiment for our hypothesis that a calcium blocker, such as lidocaine, will cause the frog’s ability to contract the gastrocnemus muscle to decrease. For each frog leg, the contractile force at the leg’s twitch threshold decreased significently after the injection of lidocaine. Lidocaine causes the calcium, that is normally released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum due to action potentials in the muscle fibers, to be blocked and therefore not have the ability to activate the mechanism that causes the muscles to shorten and contract [Johnson:2018]. Evidence from another experiment reveal that this outcome should be supported as lidocaine inhibits the acetylcholine-induced increase in calcium sensitivity during the contractile mechanism [Kai: 1993]. Therefore, the injection of lidocaine, or a calcium blocker, into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens decreased the twitch tension of the muscle and the leg did not contract as forcefully when electrically stimulated. That experiment described how lidocaine directly relaxes the smooth muscle in the airway as the mobilization of calcium is greatly decreased [Kai: 1993]. With the mobilization of calcium being decreased, calcium is not able to activate the contractile force or mechanism needed to contract the muscle with a greater amount of force. Studying the effects of lidocaine on frog legs allows for the ability of lidocaine to relax muscles to become more apparent and therefore, more studies on lidocaine could be performed in order to discover its possible uses in other parts of the body such as relaxing the muscles in the airway like bronchospasms or for just assisting in the relief of those people who have trouble with muscle spasms. Further studies of lidocaine may be beneficial in solving problems with muscle spasticity throughout the entire body.
