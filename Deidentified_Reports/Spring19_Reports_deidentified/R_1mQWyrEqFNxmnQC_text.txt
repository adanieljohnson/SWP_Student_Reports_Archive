Title: The effect of fake fish on the agonistic behavior of Betta splendens

Abstract:
In the experiment, we used three male betta fish both worked as the control and the experimental group to study the effect of fake fish on the agonistic behavior of Betta splendens. Betta fish always exhibit agonistic behaviors like tail beating, pectoral fins erect with the presence of another male betta fish. In order to quantitatively assess these behavior, in the experiment we measured the duration of the red mane to make comparison between facing a real fish and a fake fish. As the real fish could get habituation to the fake fish and also maybe because of the lack of reinforce from the fake one, the fish could present weaker or less behavior. We hypothesized that the duration of red mane would decrease in the interaction between one real and one fake compared with the interaction between both real fish. The result showed the duration of red mane when facing a fake fish decreased but the difference was not significant. Further study on behaviors could be made to get more accuate result and understanding of betta fish. 

Introduction:
In ecology, we bring together observational skills from natural history, laboratory methods, and insights and theories from ecology, genetics, and especially evolutionary biology. Ethologists seek to understand physiological purpose of behavior by learning actions of animals of its world [Johnson: 2018]. In the experiment we used the Betta splendens, the fighting fish originated in southeast Asia. During intraspecific interactions, male betta fish displays many obvious agonistic behaviors like fin flickering, red “mane” with the presence of another male betta fish so it is a suitable animal for us to observe and study. We studied the intraspecific behaviors of bettas including both the broadside movements and facing movements. Three main facing movements ranking in order of aggressiveness are pectoral fins erect, spread its gill covers or protrude the branchiostegal membranes, creating a red “mane” [Johnson: 2018]. In the experiment, we compared the agonistic behavior of three betta fish physically separated from the real fish with a fake fish according to the quantitative variable of the average duration of red mane. As we human cannot apply our emotions and understanding to the fish behavior so that using the quantitative is necessary. The average agonistic duration for the fake fish is supposed to be shorter because of habituation and lack of reinforcement. In a real fight such reinforcement could be provided by the flight of the opponent, or by aspects of the mutual interaction between two rivals [Frances: 1968]. We hypothesized that the male betta fish would present red mane at a shorter duration with a fake fish comparing with a real male betta fish. 

Materials and Methods:
We prepared a small aquarium which is divided into three compartments. Three male betta fish have been placed in each compartment, and they have been kept visually isolated from one another for several hours with white plastic dividers. We observed the behavior of isolated males quietly for 5 minutes. Then two clear pieces of glass have been placed between each male betta fish and first we removed the opaque partition for 5 minute observation. We counted the number of times that Fish 1 showed red mane and the duration of the red mane at each time. Then we divided the total duration by the number of red manes to get the average.. We repeated the same experiment with the other two fish and between each trial, the fish rested for 5 minutes. After that, we put the opaque partitions back and replaced one fish with a fake fish. We waited for another 5 minutes to let the fish to rest. We repeated the same experiment between Fish 1, Fish 2 and Fish 3 with the fake fish respectively and recorded the average time. A two sample paired t-test was used to see whether there is any significant difference between two groups. 

Results:
When the fish were visually separated, they were more likely to stay in the corner of each compartment and there was no agonistic behavior. However, after we removed the opaque partition and as soon as both fish were face to face with each other, they displayed most of the agonistic behaviors including pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and especially, red mane. Also, all of the three fish started to move alongside the glass back and forth as soon as they got visual interaction with each other. As shown in Figure 1, each betta fish had its own characteristics as if they had the shortest duration facing a real fish, then it had the shortest duration facing a fake fish. The paired t-test showed there was no significant difference between the fish facing with a real fish and with a fake fish (p = 0.166, t = 2.14, degree of freedom = 2).

Discussion:
We rejected our hypothesis and concluded that the male betta fish would present red mane at a shorter duration with a fake fish than a real male betta fish but the difference was marginally significant. According to the outcome and data been recorded, there was a decrease in the duration for all of the three fish. This result could be due to the habituation, known as a simple and basic form of learned modification of behavior [Harman: 1970]. The most possible reason of having habituation is to beneficially conserve energy. As bettas have been showing the agonistic behaviors a lot and in order to do so they used lots of energy. As they were getting used to the environment and if there was no physical harm to them, they will reduce the behaviors so they can save more energy for its metabolism. In addition, another reason could be there is no reinforce as the fake fish did not move much. Even though the fake fish had similar appearance, it may lack some character or consequence necessary to maintain the display at its initial level [Frances: 1968]. The fake fish was not able to present any agonistic behavior in response to the real fish so that there was no reinforce from the fake fish towards the real one which was more easily to weaken the extent of behavior. As we could only use quantitative variables to study animal behavior objectively, we could also sometimes combine other behaviors into the study. For example, we could measure the frequency of tail beating or tail flashing many components of the aggressive display habituate at different rates [Harman: 1970]. We could combine all the changes in behavior and get a more accurate and specific result.
