Title: Effects of increased nitrogen levels on root and shoot tissue growth in Secale cereale 

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an important topic in conservation biology. With changing climates it is important to understand how plants will alter their allocation patterns in response to environmental variables. We analyzed the effect of nitrogen levels on the growth patterns of the root and shoot tissues of Secale cereale. We hypothesized that the root to shoot length and weight ratios would be smaller in plants grown with the water and Miracle Grow solution versus plants grown only with water because the roots of the treated plants would not have to grow as long to obtain sufficient levels of nitrogen. Our data showed a significant difference in length root to shoot ratio and weight root to shoot ratio. This significance, along with our observation of smaller roots for the treatment plants, suggests that in response to a more nitrogen rich soil, S. cereale grows shorter roots. This allows the shoot to grow without having to allocate as much resources to root growth. In a less nitrogen rich soil, S. cereale grows longer roots in an attempt to harvest more nutrients from the soil. This adaptation proves beneficial for resource allocation, allowing S. cereale to best thrive under various soil environmental conditions. 

Introduction:
In any environment, plants must interact with surrounding organisms and adapt to each other, as well as adapt to changes in their environment. Many plant interactions revolve around obtaining essential resources such as sunlight, water, or nitrogen. These resource levels are limited, and if altered, plants must adapt to these changes via resource allocation and change how they use and distribute their materials. Secale cereale, commonly known as rye, is known to have a great ability to accumulate reserves of nitrogen [Paponov:1999]. Plant roots provide nutrients for the shoot to grow and the shoot provides sugar compounds for the roots to grow. If soil nutrients are less accessible, the plant will need to allocate more resources to root growth in order to thrive. Knowing this, we wanted to test how different levels of nitrogen in soil affected rye root and shoot growth. This is important because in conditions such as terrestrial environments, nitrogen is often the most limiting nutrient and plants differ in how they acquire and allocate it between the roots and shoots [Johnson:2018]. In order to know how nitrogen levels in soil affected rye plant growth and resource allocation, it is necessary to measure the lengths and weights of both the roots and shoots. We hypothesize that the roots in the plants exposed to higher nitrogen levels will be shorter and weigh less than the roots in the plants grown under normal watering conditions. As a result, we expect both the weight root to shoot ratio and the length root to shoot ratio to be smaller for the treatment plants, compared to the control plants. 

Materials and Methods:
For the cultivation of Rye plants, 16 holes were made in each of the four pots of vermiculite and two seedlings were planted in each hole. All pots were placed in a greenhouse in an area under constant exposure to natural light. The plants were watered daily for 2 weeks -- the two control pots received 100 mL of water and the treatment pots received a solution of 50 mL Miracle Grow and 50 mL of water (100 mL total).  For plant harvesting and measurement, the plants were harvested after 2 weeks, separated from the vermiculite, and were washed and dried off. 5 individual rye plants were collected from each pot for a total of 20 measurements (10 control, 10 treatment). Each whole plant was weighed using a standard lab balance. The root was separated from the shoot at the seedling, and the seed was included as a part of the root. The weights and lengths of each root and shoot were recorded. For statistical analyses, a one-tailed, two sample t-test was used to determine differences in the average root:shoot ratios, lengths and weights of the plants grown and watered normal watering conditions compared to the plants grown and watered under a Miracle Grow/enhanced nitrogen treatment. 


Results:
The mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of control plants was 1.10 grams and the mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of experimental plants was 0.81 grams (Fig.1). The mean root:shoot ratio for length in the control plants was 1.08 centimeters and the mean root:shoot ratio for length in the experimental plants was 0.87 centimeters (Fig.1). The standard deviation for mass in the control plants was 0.284 grams and the standard deviation for mass in experimental plants was 0.120 grams (Fig.1). The standard deviation for length in control plants was 0.268 centimeters and the standard deviation for length in experimental plants was 0.095 centimeters (Fig.1). We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results. The mean of the length control group was statistically significantly different than that of the length experimental group (t-value =2.32, df =18, p-value = 0.017). The mean of the weight control group was also statistically significantly different than that of the weight experimental group (t-value = 2.98, df= 18, p-value = 0.004). 

Discussion:
Our results accepted and supported our hypothesis since we observed that our rye plants with the Miracle Grow (nitrogen) treatment had smaller roots than the control plants, resulting in a smaller length and weight root to shoot ratio than the rye plants with the water control treatment. This manipulation produced this result because nitrogen contains chlorophyll, a necessary component of photosynthesis. With our treatment plants having nitrogen readily available, the roots did not have to grow as long to obtain the necessary nutrients. Since both the control and treatment groups of rye plants were exposed to a full sunlight environment, the shoots had the same exposure to sunlight. Since the treatment plants were able to absorb nitrogen easily, the shoots did not have to allocate as many resources to root growth as the control plants did, and the roots of the treatment plants could contribute more resources towards shoot growth and photosynthesis than the control plants could. This was observed in the resulting root to shoot ratios. Our results can be validated through other studies. One found that reduced nitrogen supply induced an increase in the root to shoot ratios [Deckmyn:1997]. There were no known errors to this experiment. However, if a more concentrated nitrogen solution other than Miracle Grow was used, we could have obtained and even more significant difference. The resource allocation in plants under different environment conditions is vital for plant survival and adaptability. Resource allocation under different supplies of nitrogen in rye plants was clearly observed and under increased nitrogen levels, the rye plants were able to allocate more resources to shoot growth. Plants under lower nitrogen conditions were able to adapt and grow and a healthy level, but had to increase root length to get the necessary nutrients.
