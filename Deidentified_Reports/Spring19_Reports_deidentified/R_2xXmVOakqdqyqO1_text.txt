Title: Effect of Salt Water on Root-to-Shoot Ratios in R. raphanistrum  

Abstract:
This experiment set out to determine the effect that salt water would have on the root-to-shoot length ratios of Raphanus raphanistrum samples. The salt water was expected to have a significent effect. This was done by planting two separate groups of R. raphanistrum. The first group was watered with salt water, the second with normal water. The root and shoot lengths were then measured and taken as a ratio. It was found that on average, samples treated with salt water has a higher root-to-shoot ratio than those treated with normal water. 


Introduction:
Plants have the ability to redistribute their resources in the face of certain environmental conditions [Bennett: 2012]. This process is known as resource allocation, and it allows the plant to ensure both its own survival as well as the progenation of its future generations [Bennett: 2012]. Resources chosen for remobilization include both macro and micronutrients that the plant uses for growth and reproduction [Bennett: 2012]. Resource allocation suggests that a plant will allocate resources toward the organ responsible for obtaining the scarcest resource in the plant’s environment [Reynolds: 1982]. This phenomenon occurs in response to certain abiotic stressors in the plant’s environment [Bennett: 2012]. Examples of such factors include wind, water, access to nutrients, and quantity of light [Kelly: 2015]. One way to quantify resource allocation is through a root-to-shoot (R/S) ratio, which measures the ratio of the length of a plant’s root to the length of its shoot. Abiotic factors have the potential to affect R/S ratios in plants. Salt in particular is known to interrupt certain plant functions such as energy production, protein synthesis, and enzyme activity [Panuccio: 2014]. This occurs due to the salt ions (sodium and chlorine) accumulating in the plant’s cells, which can cause a reduction in growth as well as other physiological processes [Panuccio: 2014]. Essentially, plants treated with salt will experience disrupted growth and development as a result [Panuccio: 2014]. We were curious to see the effect that salt had on the resource allocation in samples of Raphanus raphanistrum (radish plants). Radishes are a good candidate in which to observe changes in the R/S ratio due to only two weeks being needed to witness shoot growth adequate for measurement. We predicted that watering R. raphanistrum with salt water would have a significent impact on its R/S ratio when compared to samples treated with normal water. 


Materials and Method:
We filled four plastic pots with vermiculite soil, which we treated with 500 Ml of Miracle-Gro formula each. When then put three spoonfuls of R. raphanistrum seeds into each pot, pushing the seeds into the soil. We then watered two of the pots with 150 Ml of normal water and the other two with 150 Ml of a concentrated NaCl solution. We repeated this process for two weeks following the initial planting. All four pots were kept in a greenhouse under sunlight. After two weeks, the plants were removed from the pots by gently pulling the pots off each mound of vermiculite. The mound of vermiculite was then submerged in a tub of water in order to loosen the plants and their roots from the soil. The plants were then gently pulled away from the wet vermiculite, with their roots kept intact. The R/S ratios were calculated by measuring the length of the root (from the tip of the root to where it meets the green stem) and the length of the shoot (from the termination of the root to the tip of the leaf), both in centimeters. We then divided the root length by the shoot length for ten samples from each group, then compiled all of the data into an Excel spreadsheet. A two-tailed, two-sample T-test was used to test for a significent difference in the R/S ratios for the controll and salt water group. 


Results:
The data indicates that the R. raphanistrum samples treated with salt water had a higher R/S ratio on average. Samples treated with salt water had an R/S ratio of 2.941±0.741956 cm on average, while samples treated with normal water had an R/S ratio of 1.468±0.405923 cm on average [Figure 1]. A higher R/S ratio means that the roots have a greater length than the shoots, which salt water-treated samples clearly do. The mean R/S ratio of the salt water group was significently larger than the controll group (t_stat = 5.507659, d.f. = 18, P = 0.00000314). 


Discussion:
Because there was a significent difference between the saltwater group and the controll group, our hypothesis was supported. Radish samples treated with salt water had a higher root length on average than those treated with normal water. This indicates that in response to the salt water, the radishes allocated resources toward their roots in lieu of their shoots in an effort to maximize absorption. This is in line with previous research on the effect that salt water has on plants. In one study, salt water was shown to have a similar effect on the R/S ratio in canola plants [Abdollahi: 2012]. In the study, salt water was shown to increase the R/S ratio in canola as well as inhibit seed germination [Abdollahi: 2012]. In another study, salt water was shown to have a detrimental effect on seed germination in quinoa plants [Panuccio: 2014]. Actual seawater had the greatest detrimental effect on quinoa germination, followed by a pure NaCl solution similar to the one we used [Panuccio: 2014]. As sea levels continue to rise due to climate change, saltwater will impact plant growth as well as contaminate the freshwater sources plants rely on [Berlin: 2012]. This occurs due to the intrusion of saltwater into the groundwater reservoirs used by plants [Berlin: 2012]. In addition to the danger that rising sea levels pose to groundwater, it is evident the negative impact that salt water has on plant growth and seed germination. As sea levels rise, the threat they pose to global agriculture must be recognized and dealt with.
