Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Tetany in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog

Abstract:
Animals use nerve cells to send action potentials to muscle cells, causing them to contract and relax. If several action potentials are rapidly and continuously fired on the same muscle cell, they will build upon each other in a process called summation. This causes a stronger and more sustained muscle contraction in a process called tetany. In this experiment,  the effects of caffeine on tetany in the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg were tested. This was achieved by isolating the muscle and stimulating it before and after injecting it with caffeine, and then comparing the differences in response strength using a paired t-test. Observations and a computer generated graph were used to see if caffeine triggered tetany in the muscle. It was found that the force exerted by each muscle was increased after the caffeine injection, and that it was observed that each muscle became stiff and hard after the increase in caffeine. This was significant evidence that chemically induced tetany had occurred after the caffeine injection, and the statistical test proved that the injection of caffeine caused a significant increase in the force exerted by the muscle as a response to the stimuli. 

Introduction:
Animals use nerve signals to send messages throughout the body, especially to muscle tissues, at a quick rate. Each nerve cell passes an action potential to another nerve cell until the action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction, which is where a nerve cell meets a muscle cell. When the action potential is transported into the muscle cell, it triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which ultimately causes the muscle to quickly contract (or twitch). Therefore, it is known that one action potential will cause one twitch. However, if a muscle receives several consecutive action potentials, the muscle will constantly remain contracted because the action potentials will begin to build upon one another through a process called summation. This continued state of contraction by a muscle cell is called tetany, and if muscle cells remain in tetany for too long, they will become fatigued and relax. The entire process of contraction, summation, and tetany is regulated by chemicals such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and caffeine. Therefore, a common scientific question that can be asked is what would happen if the concentration of one of these chemicals were to be altered. Scientists have discovered that the effect of caffeine in a frog’s leg muscles was to cause the release of Calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Isaacson et al, 1967). Calcium ions being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum cause the depolarization of a muscle cell, which then triggers an action potential to be sent through the cell, and the muscle will twitch. would increase the level of caffeine in the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog’s leg, and a frog was chosen as the organism of study because they have relatively strong legs with a muscle that can easily be isolated through dissection and allow us to easily obtain data. Therefore, it was decided that the gastrocnemius muscle would be isolated, stimulated with electrical impulses, and then a computer software would be used to determine the force exerted by the muscle with its natural concentration of caffeine and with an injection of caffeine. It is hypothesized that an increased amount of caffeine in the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog will cause the muscle to experience chemically induced tetany and exert a stronger and more continuous force than the muscle without a caffeine injection.

Materials and Methods:
To test the hypothesis, the gastrocnemius will be exposed by dissecting the frog leg and attached to a string. The string will be attached to a machine that will read the force exerted by the muscle when it is stimulated by an electric shock. The machine will also produce a graph on a connected computer of the force exerted on the machine by the muscle over the course of our experiment. This computer will also control the amplitude of the stimulus, the frequency of the stimulus, and the number of pulses being sent through the probe to the sciatic nerve of the frog leg. Each leg will be shocked a total of six times (three times before being injected with caffeine and three times after) at an amplitude of 1.0V. The muscle will be injected 0.1 mL of a 200mM solution of caffeine. The computer generated graphs will be used to determine the force exerted by each response to each stimulus, and it will be observed in its entirety for each leg to determine whether or not chemically induced tetany was observed. Three frog legs will be used for the experiment so that a paired t-test can be performed to test the significance in the difference in force exerted by each individual muscle before and after the caffeine injection.

Results:
Each muscle produced a larger response after the caffeine injection than they produced before the injection. After the caffeine injection, the three muscles produce a response that was an average of 0.077V greater than the response produced by the legs before the increase of caffeine with an error range of 0.018V within that average. It was observed that each muscle was stiff and hard to the touch after the injection while it was smooth and soft before the experiment. In the three initial stimuli, the computed generated graph displayed a single peak for each stimulus from each muscle. After caffeine was injected into the muscle, the graph displayed a large trend upward followed by a plateau with only a small peak for each stimulus. The paired t-test results were as follows: (t-value=6.028, df=2, P-value=0.0264).

Discussion:
The results of the statistical test, as well as observations form the experiment, support the hypothesis. The p-value suggests that there is about a 98% chance that the increased responses to stimuli were caused by the injection of caffeine. This means that caffeine will cause the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog to produce stronger responses to stimuli. The observation of the computer generated graph of force exerted by the muscle over time and of the muscle support that each frog leg experienced chemically induced tetany. The sudden increase and plateau that of the graph (as described in the results section) means that the muscle quickly contracted and remained in its contracted state continuously. This means that tetany was achieved without stimulating the sciatic nerve. Instead, the caffeine must have triggered the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing the muscle to remain contracted and therefore supporting the claim that chemically induced tetany was observed. Limited time and resources reduced the variety of claims that could be tested in this experiment, but future studies of similar nature could be done in order to better understand how different chemicals control the actions of a muscle. For example, a study can be done to compare the effects of all four chemicals in affecting both strength of stimulus response and the process of tetany. Scientists have also discovered that caffeine can more than double the duration of each action potential in an animal muscle cell by keeping the sarcoplasmic reticulum open to continue the depolarization of the muscle cell with an increase in calcium ions (Gubareff et al, 1965). Further research could be done about this to determine how caffeine causes this increase, and if other chemicals affect this as well. This would be important in allowing scientists to see which chemicals control which processes and how prevalent each substance is in a muscle cell.
