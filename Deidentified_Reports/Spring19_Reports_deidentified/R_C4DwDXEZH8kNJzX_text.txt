Title: The Effect of Increased Juvenile Hormone Signaling through the Introduction of IGR on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
In all organisms, including insects, hormone signaling plays a vital role in telling the body when certain things should occur. In the organism Manduca Sexta, two hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) are the two main hormones that regulate the maturation of the M. sexta larva. In this lab we investigated the role of JH on the development of the M. sexta by incorporating a synthetic IGR hormone that would increase JH activity to investigate the hypothesis that this would affect caterpillar growth. After feeding a controll group five drops of water, and an experimental group five drops of IGR, for two weeks, a two-sample T-test was utilized to determine if our data was significent. Upon the completion of our analysis, we were not able to conclude that the experimental group’s growth was affected. 

Introduction:
In most organisms, a transition from their juvenile state to their adult state is triggered by hormone signals. Although this hormone signaling varies species to species, the basic mechanism remains the same. In this lab, we focused on hormone signaling in insects. Our test subject was the Manduca Sexta. The M. sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera which includes all moths, butterflies and skippers. The Manduca Sexta is used in many studies pertaining to hormone regulation because the different instars separated by molts makes it easy to see how the manipulation of hormone levels can change progression from pupa to adult moth [Zhou: 2001]. This phenomena can be seen in previous studies in which JH was applied topically to the M.sexta during its fourth instar, resulting in a significently smaller pupae and developmental anomalies such as shortened wings and an unfused proboscis [Kiguchi: 1878]. 
During its larval stages, the M. sexta presents itself as a bright blueish green caterpillar with diagonal white stripes and singular horn on its last abdominal segment. Upon maturation, the M. sexta emerges from its pupa as a large brown moth with large orange spots on its body. The process by which the M. sexta completely changes form from caterpillar to moth is metamorphosis. This process is highly regulated by the release of hormones that signal when it is time to enter different stages of the M. sexta’s life. The two main hormones that work together in most insects are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). JH is a family of insect hormones that are made up of a long chain of organic molecules. JH regulates the type of molt during development and works in conjunction with 20E to controll many other functions within developing and adult insects. Within the M. sexta, these two hormones specifically controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis. The absolute concentration and concentration ratios of the two hormones, along with the M.sexta’s developmental stage, determine the effects of the hormones. 
The M.sexta’s developmental stage consists of five larval instars separated by molts. Throughout the first four larval instars, JH levels stay consistently high. During the end of the fourth larval instar JH levels begin to decline and eventually drop below the 20E hormone levels for the first time. During the fifth larval instar, JH levels drop very low and there is a slight rise in 20E. This rise in the 20E hormone is known as the commitment pulse. This commitment pulse is easily recognizable as it results in a black pulsing line going down the caterpillar’s back. This signal is produced when the M.sexta larvae is large enough, and has stored enough energy and nutrients in order to successfully pupate and complete metamorphosis. 
During our experiment, we investigated the role of JH on the growth of the M.sexta as it progressed through its larval stage. Previous studies have shown the effect of JH on The larval stage was our focus, and we terminated the experiment before the M.sexta was able to complete its transformation from a caterpillar into a moth. We hypothesized that if we increased JH expression in the M. sexta by means of an IGR hormone, the growth of the M.sexta caterpillars would be affected during their larval stages. 


Materials and Method:
We set up the experiment by creating two identical habitats for our controll and experimental caterpillars. We determined that each of our experimental caterpillars would receive five drops of IGR for every ten grams of food. Our experimental caterpillars received five drops of filtered water to their food in place of the IGR hormone to decrease the chance of any confounding variables within our experimental procedure. Our dependent variable was identified as the caterpillar’s growth. We measured this according to mass in grams.
The initial set-up of our caterpillars’ habitats included two plastic containers that had dividers sectioning it into four separate compartments. One container was for the controll caterpillars while the second container was for the experimental caterpillars. We set these containers up by punching four airholes on the side of each compartment. We clearly labeled each container stating whether it was experimental or controll, as well as the individual compartments 1-3 so we could easily identify each separate caterpillar. When selecting the caterpillars for this experiment, we chose ones that were small, but similar in size. Before putting each caterpillar in its new habitat, we weighed it and recorded its mass in grams as the starting weight. 
The food for this experiment was generic Manduca Sexta food. We prepared this for our experiment by scooping out a large portion of the food and mixing it with a small amount of water to moisten it. Once we had mixed the food to a good consistency, we separated it into six ten-gram portions. After creating the portions, we added five drops of IGR hormone to three of the portions, and five drops of filtered water to the other three. After mixing in the IGR and water as well as we could so that it was evenly distributed in the food, we rolled each portion into a ball. Each ball of food was placed into a different compartment of the habitat with a caterpillar. Upon completion of the initial setup, our caterpillars were placed in an incubator set at 25˚C where they remained for the duration of the experiment unless they were being weighed.
We collected data on our caterpillar’s growth for the next two weeks. Each day we had someone come in to record the mass in grams of each caterpillar. We also took pictures to document their growth. If the caterpillars seemed to be running out of food, we would make more using the same procedure as the first time.  We also tried to keep the habitats clean by removing any feces from the container. 
Upon the completion of our experiment we evaluated our data using a two-sample T-test to come up with a p_value that stated whether we could accept our hypothesis.


Results:
The average change in weight for the experimental group of caterpillars was 5.34 grams with a standard deviation of 2.4 and the average change in weight for the controll group of caterpillars was 5.89 with a standard deviation of 3.0. One caterpillar from our controll group and two caterpillars from our experimental group died before the completion of the experiment.
We preformed a two-sample T-test on our data to see if our data was significent. Our calculated p_value from our T-test is 0.400527.


Discussion:
From our data, there seems to be a general trend that the controll group grew larger than the experimental group. Caterpillars died in both the controll group and the experimental group, and there is no indication to what the cause of dead could have been. However, the third caterpillar in the experimental group seemed a lot sicker than the remaining caterpillars in the controll group. This could give indication that all the caterpillars in the experimental group were less healthy than those in the controll group because of the added IGR hormone. In terms of our original hypothesis, we were not able to determine that the IGR hormone has an affect on the growth of the experimental caterpillars because our p_value was much larger than the 0.05 that would make it significent. 
There are many factors that could have introduced error into our experiment resulting in insignificent results. One factor is the maturity of our caterpillars at the beginning of the experiment. Previous successful studies on insect hormone regulation began hormone manipulation much earlier, even beginning at the process of oogenesis [Swevers: 2009]. Since our lab is later in the week, the caterpillars left over from the previous labs were more matured and much larger. This could have affected our results because the IGR did not affect JH levels in the caterpillar until it had already begun to mature. We do not know for certain, but the caterpillars we chose for our experiment could have already been in their second or third larval instar by the time the IGR was introduced into their system. In order to more accurately determine the affects of the IGR on developing M.sexta, we would want to introduce the IGR into their diet as soon as they hatched from the egg. We could expand this farther if we wanted to and even introduce the IGR hormone to the M.sexta embryo. 
Other sources of error include certain limitations to our experiment that could not be helped due to the limited number of resources, and the short time frame. Our experimental and controll groups were very small, making it very difficult to distinguish a prominent trend in growth. Our experiment was also not repeated; we only ran it one time which means that there are no other statistics to compare our current data to. Finally, our experiment was not able to be carried out to its completion due to some of the caterpillars dying before the conclusion of the experiment. 
We know that JH levels can be manipulated to significently alter the pupal stages of the Manduca Sexta, and even result in a deformed adult moth [Kiguchi: 1878]. Therefore, future studies pertaining to the effect of JH levels on growth and size should follow through the end of the M.sexta’s life span in order to fully observe the affects.
