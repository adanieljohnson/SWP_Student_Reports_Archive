Title: An increase in aggression between betta splendens without exposure to dye and betta splendens with exposure to dye

Abstract:
Animal behavior has been shaped by evolution and selection as animals react to their environment. Betta splendens use colorful displays and agonistic behaviors in the presence of other members of its own species to improve their fitness. It was hypothesized that if a bright dye is introduced into the environment, then Bettas will display an increased amount of aggressive behavior. Four individual Betta fish were observed displaying aggressive behavior with and without dye. The Betta fish without dye presented lower amounts of aggressive behaviors while those exposed to dye had a higher amount of aggressive behaviors yet, the results were not significant (paired t-test: 0.798, p-value: 0.483, critical value: 0.05). It was concluded that the behavior displayed in this study was influenced by how the Betta’s own skin color interacted with the colored dye. In the future, one should control for the pigmentation of the fish and dye. This would be interesting to study as artificial selection for aggressive male Bettas traits are producing an effect on female selection. It would be noteworthy to extend this study onto female fish as well as wild Betta fish.

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior, or ethology, aims to understand the physiological purpose of behaviors and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. They focus on the genetic, physiological, and learned actions of an animal and its perceptions of its environment. In the wild, betta splendens tend to have a uniform dark color with shorter fins [Todd: 2008]. The wild males that are larger in size, have longer fins, have more brilliant colors, and are the most aggressive are commonly selected for in aquariums and pet stores [Todd: 2008]. Wild and captive-bred betta splendens use these colorful displays and expressions of agonistic behaviors in the presence of other members of its own species to defend territory boundaries and exclusive access to resources that are critical for survival and reproduction [Lynn: 2007].  Males display intensity in coloration along with aggressive behaviors during an agonistic interaction [Lynn: 2007]. The two main types of aggressive behaviors comprised of broadside displays or facing displays. Broadside behaviors include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, and erect dorsal/anal fins while facing movements include erect pectoral fins, spreading gill cover (operculum), and protruding branchiostegal membranes (also known as red mane). How would a manipulation of the colors displayed in a Betta’s environment affect its agonistic behavior? It is important to explore Betta’s behaviors as captive-bred Bettas are selected to display more desirable traits for humans, leading to more aggressive traits and altering their behavior. It was hypothesized that if a bright dye is introduced into the Betta’s environment, then it will display an increased amount of aggressive behavior.

Materials and Methods:
Four individual Betta fish were used in separate containers with removable opaque and clear dividers. The clear dividers were never removed. We labeled the fish F1, F2, F3, and F4 to keep track of their agonistic behaviors. The agonistic behaviors that were recorded included: pelvic fin flickering, tail flashing, tail beating, erect dorsal/anal fin, spreading gill cover, and protruding branchiostegal membrane. We began removing the opaque cover between F1 and F2 as well as removing the opaque cover between F3 to F4 for five minutes. Two members recorded all aggressive behaviors seen during those five minutes and answers were compared to have higher reliability. The opaque divider was put back into place after the five minutes and the Betta fish rested for another five minutes. After this five-minute break, six drops of red food dye were introduced into the Betta fish’s environment. The opaque dividers were removed once more between F1 and F2 as well as between F3 and F4. Aggressive behaviors were recorded once more by two individual members and compared. The data was analyzed by calculating and graphing the average amount of behaviors before and after dye exposure. A one-tailed paired t-test was also calculated to analyze the significance of the data which was determined by a critical value of 0.05.

Results:
Shown by Figure 1, there is an observable difference between the average amount of aggressive behaviors displayed before and after dye exposure. When the Betta fish were not exposed to dye, they presented lower amounts of aggressive behaviors with an average of 17.50±6.56 while the Betta fish exposed to dye had a higher amount of aggressive behaviors with an average of 27±29.34. Although there is a clear difference between both averages, the data was not statistically significant (paired t-test: 0.798, p-value: 0.483, critical value: 0.05).

Discussion:
As Figure 1 shows, there was a greater amount of aggressive behavior after red dye exposure. Despite this trend, which supports our hypothesis, the results were not statistically significant enough to provide substantial support. The trend could have been easily affected by the Betta fish’s own color and how it blended in with the red dye. F1 had a red coloration, F2 had a light-yellow coloration and both F3 and F4 had blue and black coloration. The darker blue and black fish (F3 and F4) displayed a much lower average amount of aggressive behaviors in general and after exposure to dye. The red fish and light-yellow fish (F1 and F2) displayed much more aggressive behavior in general as well as after exposure to the red dye. When aggressive, Betta fish also produce a color flash in which their pigmentation appears brighter than its original color to accompany other aggressive behaviors [Todd: 2008]. On the other hand, non-aggressive behaviors involve color loss as the Betta’s pigment is reduced to a grey or stripped coloration, as well as evasion [Todd 2008]. This non-aggressive behavior is often seen in fish that are less aggressive after interacting with another fish who has responded with aggressive behavior [Todd: 2008]. It was concluded that the behavior displayed in this study was influenced by how the Betta’s own skin color interacted with the red dye. Since the black and blue fish appeared much darker, they reacted in a more passive manner while the red and light-yellow fish, which were much brighter, and more susceptible to color flashes, reacted in a more aggressive manner. Additionally, the darker blue and black fish appeared even darker when exposed to red dye while the red and light-yellow fish both appeared much brighter. This would be an interesting topic to continue to study as artificial selection for traits that make Betta fish brighter, larger in size, and have longer fins has led to the creation of more aggressive male fish that are producing an effect on female selection [Todd: 2008]. This statement is supported by another study that concluded that domesticated strains of Betta fish were significantly more aggressive than their wild counterparts [Verbeek: 2006]. In the future, the significance of such a study would be heightened by controlling for the exact colors of the fish and analyzing how their natural pigmentation would be affected by the specific color dye that is used. It would be noteworthy to extend this study onto female fish as well as wild Betta fish.
