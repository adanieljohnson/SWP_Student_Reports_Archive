Title: Presence of female conspecific audience increase male Betta splendens’ display of agnostic behavior

Abstract:
Animals have intraspecific and interspecific behaviors. In sexual selection, the direct male-to-male competition is a kind of intraspecific behavior. Betta splendens (Siamese fighting fish) has interesting pattern of agonistic displays and thus is a good subject for studying animal intraspecific behavior and sexual selection. Effect of the presence or absence of a female audience on B. splenden male-male agonistic display was studied. The expectation was that with the presence of a female B. splenden, males will exhibit an increase in aggressiveness (assessed by score of aggressiveness per minutes) due to greater competition for mating. The resulting data rejected this hypothesis, as it showed non-significant increase of aggressiveness in the experimental group (with female audience) in comparison to the control group (without female audience). This result shows that presence of female conspecific audience does not increase B. splenden male-male aggressive behavior.

Introduction:
Betta splenden is a species of commonly seen aquarium fish and is known also as Siamese fighting fish. Betta splendens originated from Thailand whose wild types usually have bigger body size than domesticated ones [Johnson: 2018]. The wild type B. splendens change their color and behavior (especially motions of its fins) with presence of another male Betta. Male Betta has two main types of intraspecific behaviors, broadside movement and facing movement. In broadside movements, Betta splendens turn their side towards the opponent. Broadside movement include (with ascending aggressiveness) pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. In facing movements, the Betta male faces opponent and may display behaviors including (with ascending aggressiveness) pectoral fin erection, gill cover spreading and red mane, in which the Betta flips its gill and expand the branchiostegal membrane. 

From our previous observations, when two males with significant body size difference are used, the male with larger body size displays more aggressive behavior and higher aggressiveness than the smaller male, while the smaller male shows fewer agonistic behaviors shortly before becoming submissive. This behaving pattern remains unaffected after 5 minutes’ resting period, with or without male-male physical contact/with or without presence of a female. However, from previous studies, researchers found that with the presence of female conspecific audience, the tested males display more aggressive behaviors in comparison to an absence of female audience. The two males perform significantly more tail beatings and spend longer time on gill cover erection [Doutrelant: 2001]. In this experiment, changes of male Betta intraspecific agonistic behavior in response to presence or absence of conspecific female are tested. Since direct male-to-male competition is a very important way of sexual selection, we hypothesize that with the presence of a female conspecific audience, two male Betta with similar body size will display greater level of aggressiveness per minute in their interaction.



Materials and Methods:
Three B. splendens males with similar body size and a female B. splenden were used in this experiment. Since previous researches suggest that larger body size is an important determinant for dominance in males [Schuett: 1997], the dominance hierachy may inhibit the submissive male’s agonistic behavior due to this reason  (this relationship between body size and dominance hierarchy could be an explanation of our previous observation as afore mentioned in introduction). All individuals were placed in an aquarium separated with removable non-transparent partitions. For trail without female Betta audience, each male individual interacted with two other males for once. During the experiment, one partition was removed, which limited all movement in 2/3 of the total length of the aquarium. For trial with female audience presence, two males (still each male interacted with the other two males individually) were placed in the same amount of space with the female B. splenden.  The aggressiveness of male B. splendens were assessed via a scoring system, for which we assigned scores of aggressiveness for each agonistic behavior in the scale of 1 to 5. In this scale, for broadside movements, pelvic fin flickering=1, tail beating=2, tail flashing=3; for facing movements, pectoral fins erection=1, gill covers spreading=2, and red mane=3. For more aggressive behaviors like physical contacts/conflicts, we assigned darting=4 and biting=5. Each trail lasted 2 minutes, and the male individuals might be separated before the time limit if any vigorous physical contact were observed in order to prevent injury. A 5-minute resting time was required between trails to prevent habituation. The overall aggressiveness of B. splendens was measured by score per minute, and an average was calculated for both the control group (without female audience) and the experimental group (with presence of female). Paired t-test was used to assess the difference between the score of aggressiveness per minute of males with and without female B. splenden present.

Results:
The mean score per minute of the control group (no audience) is 6.133 ±4.2 (point per minute).  The mean score per minute of the experimental group (with audience) is 12.795 ±11.8 (point per minute). The paired t-test shows that the score per minute of the experimental group is not significantly higher than the control group (t-stat = 1.426, df = 5, P = 0.213). During the experiment, the agonistic behavior with higher aggressiveness is observed in shorter time with female audience presence in comparison to the control group: the male B. splendens lunch into physical contacts faster with female audience. The female B. splenden did not display any kind of aggressive behavior. The male B. splenden with no losing experience (male 2) showed the highest aggressiveness in comparison to both of its opponents (male 1 and 3) and actively performed behaviors like darting and biting.

Discussion:
This experiment rejects our hypothesis, showing that with the presence of a female audience, aggressiveness per minute of male-to-male agonistic behavior did not increase significantly. We observed a decrease in the time that the males needed to display the most aggressive display (darting or biting) with the presence of female during the experiments. This experiment gives us a result different from previous studies which suggested that the males will show significantly higher aggressiveness with the presence of a female B. splenden [Doutrelant: 2001]. One possible reason why the males were not displaying significantly more aggressive behaviors during our experiment as we hypothesized is that the male-male competition usually tends to be restrained and ritualized, and usually avoids causing lethal injuries to their opponents to avoid unnecessary and excess energy investment just for one female. As male fitness is determined by how many sexual partners they have, it would be more beneficial and preferable for the disadvantageous male individual to quit the competition and find new partners rather than wasting too much energy in the competition.
During the experiment, we observed that the trials with the two males with injured fin (male 1 and male 3) from a previous losing experience has much less interaction with one another. The male with more severe injury did not display (score=0) within a 2-minute limit both with or without the female presence, while the male with less severe injury displayed and showed a slight increase in aggressiveness with presence of a female audience within the 2-minute time limit (score without female=6, score with female=9). The two injured male B. splendens did not show any physical contact that may lead to any injury towards its opponent, thus for both trials (with or without female audience) with male 1 and 3, we do not have to separate them before reaching the time limit. One explanation of our observation from the trials with male 1 and male 3 is that physical injury could have influenced the male betta’s ability to perform aggressive behavior. Another possible explanation of our observation could be the winner effect.  Multiple studies on different species show that aggressive display is affected by previous winning and losing experiences, and the effect of previous winning/losing experience can last for a period of time. For example, in R. marmoratus the winner effect lasts around 24 to 48 hrs, during which individuals with prior winning experience shows greater possibility of winning [Hsu: 1998].  Similar result has also been found in a previous study on B. splendens, which suggests that past winning or losing experience influence B. splenden’s aggressive behaviors; the effect may last around 24hrs, during which B. splendens that has similar mirror display but with different previous winning or losing experience display different level of aggressiveness. The male B. splenden with wining experience became dominant, while the B. splenden with losing experiment would not display [Wallen: 1985].
Thus, to eliminate/minimize the possible influence of the winner effect and physical injury from previous competitions, further studies could be done with a larger sample size of males, so that each male individual will only be involved in one trial within 24 hours, or we may repeat the study with longer resting time (longer than 24hrs) for each male individual. 

By learning the effect of a female audience on B. splendens male-male aggressive behavior, we can understand B. splenden’s intraspecific behavior better, which will in turn provide us more information on B. splenden’s sexual selection and mating procedure, enhancing our knowledge on how to breed B. splendens in a more efficient way.
