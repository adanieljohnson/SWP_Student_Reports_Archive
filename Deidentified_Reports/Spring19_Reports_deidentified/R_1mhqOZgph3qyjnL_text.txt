Title: The Effect of AZA Guard on the Weight and Development of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
Hormone balance and regulation is a very important aspect of insect and organism development. With varying levels of different hormones comes differences in developmental patterns and eventual outcome of the organism. In this experiment, we looked at exactly how the manipulation of the hormone Ecdysterone through the addition of AZA Guard would affect the development of the Manduca sexta. The expectation was that the animals that consumed the AZA guard would develop more slowly and to less of an extent than those who did not. Our data showed significant results that this was the case, as the weights of the experimental were much lower than those of the control. This significance in our observations supports that the hormone Ecdysterone is responsible for the development and maturity of the Manduca sexta, and that decreasing the levels of it would prevent the organism from leaving its larval stage.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the hornworm, is an organism that develops holometabolomsly, meaning that it has 4 stages if development. In the transitions between these stages both Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone levels fluctuate allowing for the developmental changes needed for Manduca survival. The Juvenile Hormone is secreted by the Corpus Allata, a pair of glands located on either side of the foregut. JH regulates many functions in the adult insects, but most notably the type of molting occurring during younger development. Levels are highest while the insect is in the 4th larva stage and steadily decreases until it peaks again at the 5th larva stage to the pupal eclosion. As for Ecdysterone – it regulates the timing of this molting, as it spikes before each molt including from one instar to another peaks up for the commitment pulse, then spikes again at the 5th larval stage and remains high from pupa to a developing adult. In this experiment, we looked to investigate how manipulating one of these hormones – Ecdysterone – would affect the development of the animal through the addition of an AZA guard, an insect growth regulator, which decreased the Ecdysterone levels in the hornworm. Such insect growth regulators have been known to modify the growth of insects through the disruption of the molting process [Judd:2018]. With an understanding of this insect growth regulator's potential affects, we hypothesized that the addition of one would cause the experimental caterpillars to develop more slowly, and not as fully, as the controls. This was our hypothesis because the Ecdysterone would be what signals the insect to mature from the larval phase to the adult phase, as that is its main function, but with this signal blocked through the presence of an AZA guard the organism should remain a larva, due to the absence of a cue prompting it the change.

Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca sexta ranging in weight from .5-3 g were assigned to individual cells – with air holes and 10 g of their respective food. There were 2 diet options – either 10 g of regular hornworm food mixed with 100µl (10 drops) of water, or 10 g of hornworm food mixed with 60µl of 1:1250 M AZA guard. 4 hornworms received one and 4 received the other. These individual cells were stored in an incubator exposing the hornworm to light all 24 hours of the day, and keeping their environment at 28C. The hornworms were weighed, their cells were cleaned of any waste that had been produced, and their respective foods were cleaned out and replenished each day. After 7 days of collection the comparative weights were collected and the average weight of each group on the last day was calculated. A two-tailed t-test was then preformed to determine whether the differences were statistically significant or not.  

Results:
The starting average weight in grams of the control group was 1.3025 g and grew to 10.61 by the last day (Table 1). The average weight of the group who received the AZA guard – the experimental group – was initially 1.185g and ended at 4.85 g (Table 1). The standard deviation of the control and experimental groups were 3.91056 and 2.56813 respectively. The two-tailed t-test P value was .007463. When observing the organisms on the last day there was a visible difference in their size, the amount of food they had left from the night before, and the amount of waste they had produced since the day prior. As a result of this experiment, the control group grew to be much larger and mature than the experimental group.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the addition of the AZA guard would cause the experimental caterpillars to develop more slowly, and not as fully, as the controls, was supported by our results. This is due to the fact that this insect growth regulator interrupts the development of the organism, as discussed earlier. According to our P value of .007463 from our two-tailed t-test our results were statistically significant, suggesting that Ecdysterone is a critical hormone in the development and maturing of a hornworm, and decreasing the amounts of it have very detrimental effects on hornworm growth. Past investigations of this same question have come up with similar results, and the same conclusion that Ecdysone antagonists such as the AZA guard we used disrupt molting of the Manduca sexta as well as other insects by inhibiting metabolism of the molting hormone, ecdysone [Byron:2017]. With this knowledge as well as many data sets conformation of it, AZA guard can be used to suppress the development of an insect, measured in weight, due to its obstructing effect on the maturing and molting process.
