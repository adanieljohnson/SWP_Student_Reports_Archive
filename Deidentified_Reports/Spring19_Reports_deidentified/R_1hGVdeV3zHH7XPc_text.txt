Title: Herbivory Has no Effect on the Root to Shoot Ratio (Mass and Length) of Raphanus Sativus

Abstract:
The experiment is designed to evaluate the effect of herbivory on the Root to Shoot Ratio by mass and length of radish. Root to shoot ratio is a measurement used to determine the change of resource allocation for plants. By mimicking herbivory, the above-ground biomass is reduced, then some changes in resources allocation are suspected to occur to achieve the balance. Then we predict that if there is herbivory, the root to shoot ratio in terms of mass and length will decrease. In the experiment, radishes grow normally as the controll groups, and radishes that are cut one leave from each plant are the experimental groups. After recording and summarizing the data, the one-tailed two-sample t_test is applied for evaluation. The p_value calculated does not show a significent change which fails to support the alternative hypothesis. Theoretically, the reduction of above ground biomass rises the nitrogen concentration in leaves and lower the nitrogen use efficiency. The plant is supposed to increase the yield of shoots which leads to a decrease of the root to shoot ratio. The possible drawbacks of the experiment include the inaccurate measurement of leave mass cut from the plant, and a longer period for observation is suggested.

Introduction:
Root to shoot ratio is a measurement to determine the growth functions of plant tissues above ground and below ground, helping to structure the resource allocation of plants. The radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus) germinate quickly and rapidly which have grown and consumed throughout the world. Resource allocation is strategic planning to achieve goals by using limited resources which plays a pivotal role in various plant activities, including growth, reproduction, and defense. For plants, resources required can be meaningfully divided into those acquired above ground and those through below ground. And these resources include basic materials such as carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients as well as manufactured materials such as sugars, proteins, and defensive chemicals. [Bazzaz: 1997] Leaves and stems consist of the above-ground structure of plants which are responsible for photosynthesis to produce carbon compound for storage. For below ground, roots function to take up water and essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other minerals. Generally, biotic factors and abiotic factors are two major classes that can affect resource allocation. Biotic factors are living components of an ecosystem, while abiotic factors are non-living components of an ecosystem. In this experiment, we introduce herbivory as one biotic factor to research its effect on resource allocation of radish. Herbivory imbalances the resource allocation of plants, so plants may compensate the effects especially under favorable growing conditions, limited competition, and minimal top-down regulation. [Pratt:2005] Theoretical models of plant allocation strategies predict that root to shoot ratio is related to leaf nitrogen concentration; therefore, as herbivory occurs, the nitrogen concentration in leaves increases. [Vincent:2009] To maintain the balance, high shoot yield leads to decreasing root to shoot ratio. Therefore, we predict that if there is herbivory, the root to shoot ratio in terms of mass and length will decrease.



Materials and Method:
he plants analyzed in the experiment was radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus). Radish seeds grew in four trays with water, Miracle-Gro, and soil for controll and experimental groups. Seeds in all trays were well watered three times a week. Cut one leave from each plant in two trays to mimic herbivory after one week, then these two became the experimental groups. In the experiment, the independent variable is the absence or present of herbivory and the dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio by mass and length. At the same time, we weighted the mass of the leaves cut and counted the approximate number of plants to calculate the average mass of leave cut as shown in Figure 1. The other two became the controll groups. After another week, measured the length and weighed the mass of roots and shoots from three samples randoMly chosen from each tray. We first harvested three plants randoMly from each tray by carefully pulling them with adherent out of the tray. Then we gently washed the plants in a container of water and pat them dry with paper towel. Then we weighted the whole plants and recorded the weight. Next, we separated the roots from shoots by cutting each plant apart from the root-shoot junction and weighed them separately. After that, we measured the length of roots and shoots from bottom to tip to the nearest mm. After recording all the raw data, we calculated the root to shoot in terms of length and weight and analyzed the result by using one-tailed two sample t_test statistically.

Results:
To evaluate the effect of herbivory on resources allocation in radish. The root to shoot ratio based on mass and length are analyzed. The average mass of each leave cut in terms of herbivory is added to the average mass of each leave at the end. Figure two compares the root to shoot ratios of controll and experimental groups by mass (t-value=0.64, one-tailed p_value=0.27, degree of freedom=10). Figure three compares the root to shoot ratios of controll and experimental groups by length (t-value=1.24, one-tailed p_value=0.12, degree of freedom=10). The mean root to shoot ratio by mass for the controll group is 0.0066±0.0272 and that for the experimental group is 0.0790±0.0411. The mean root to shoot ratio by length for the controll group is 1.0528±0.3873 and that for the experimental group is 1.2838±0.2428.

Discussion:
Based on the evaluation of all results and data collected, the alternate hypothesis that if there is herbivory then the root to shoot ratio based on weight and length will decrease is rejected. The p_value calculated is not significent for this experiment. When herbivory occurs, the biomass of above ground reduces and the nitrogen concentration in leaves increases. To rebalance the resources, the plant will be supposed to higher the shoot yield for more efficient use of nitrogen. Vincent has done a similar experiment about the trade‐off between root nitrogen acquisition and shoots nitrogen utilization across 13 co‐occurring pasture grass species, he suggests that root mass increased when specific root area declined, then he assumes that the decrease in shoot mass will lead shoot mass increase as well.[Vincent:2009] In this case, the root to shoot ratio still has the possibility to change in a long run. We expect to see a clearer relationship between the root to shoot ratio by weight and length and herbivory after some more time. In fact, we did not record the approximate number of plants and the number of leaves cut off when we were mimicking herbivory. Therefore, the data we use is just an approximate number which can lead to inaccuracy. Herbivory and resource allocation is an interesting topic worth more research. I would like to figure out how the decline of root mass affects the plant allocation in a long run.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Radish in experimental groups with leaves cut off
Figure2. Effect of herbivory on the root to shoot rate of radish by mass. The root to shoot ratios of controll groups in the second, third, and fifth samples are higher than those of experimental groups. The comparison does not effectively show a clear contrast between the controll and experimental groups.
Figure3. Effect of herbivory on the root to shoot rate of radish by length. The root to shoot ratio of the experimental group is only lower than that of the controll group for the second sample. Therefore, the root to shoot ratio of the experimental group is generally higher than that of the controll group.
