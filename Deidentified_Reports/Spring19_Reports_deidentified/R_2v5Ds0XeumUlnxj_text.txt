Title: Effect of pH change on the photosynthetic activity of spinach leaves (spinacia oleracea)

Abstract:
The main goal of the study was to determine the effects of adjusted pH values on the chloroplast absorbance, and photosynthetic activity, of spinach leaves (spinacia oleracea).  Our group used three samples of spinach leaf chloroplasts at three different pH settings (4, 7, and 10, with 7 being ideal for spinach leaf photosynthesis).  I hypothesized that there would little difference in the absorbance change between the pH 4 and pH 10 settings.  However, after finding the percent change in absorbance at three successive 10-minute intervals for each sample, and averaging the three at each pH setting, we found that our data was insignificent (P-value of 0.056), and that we could not draw conclusions.  However, my hypothesis would not have been supported if the data was significent, as the percent changes in absorbance varied a great deal between the pH 4 and pH 10 settings.

Introduction:
This experiment demonstrates the effect of different pH values on the light absorption (and, by extension, the photosynthetic activity) of spinach leaves (spinacia oleracea).  Light absorption is a key aspect of photosynthesis, which is the process by which most autotrophs gain nutrients and energy.  Photosynthesis in autotroph cells (specifically, in the chloroplasts of those cells) is affected by a number of factors, from the amount of available light, to salt accumulation in leaves [Delfine: 1999].  Another possible factor is the system’s pH, and how close it is to the ideal pH for the organism to live in – spinach, for instance, has an ideal pH of around 7 [Babic: 1996].  pH changes have been shown to have little effect in algae with broad pH-tolerance; however, if spinach (or other plants) lack such a tolerance, the effects could be greater [Gerloff-Elias: 2005].  In our experiment, we will compare the change in absorbance of spinach leaf chloroplasts at pH 7 to those at pH 10 and pH 4.  The change will be tracked over 10, 20, and 30 minutes, respectively.  I hypothesize that while the chloroplasts at pH 4 and pH 10 will see a decrease in absorbance when compared to those at pH 7, the decrease in each’s absorbance will be similar, if not nearly identical.

Materials and Method:
We packed a mortar and pestle, a medium-sized beaker, and 3 50-Ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice.  We removed the central veins from 4 spinach leaves, discarded the veins, and rinsed the leaf remains with water.  After blotting the moisture on the leaves, we added them to the chilled and dried mortar and pestle.  Our group added 10 Ml of (cold) grinding buffer, which in this case was 400 mM sucrose in tricine buffer, with a pH of 8.0.  With the mortar and pestle, we ground the spinach into a thick paste, so that no leaf chunks remained.  We mixed an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer with the spinach paste, and strained the mixture through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker.  After transferring 200 microliters of the remaining liquid into a microtube marked “Sample of A”, we stored the microtube on ice.  The remaining liquid in the beaker was transferred to a 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun in the centrifuge at 200G for 3 minutes, at 4 degrees Celsius.  A balance tube was also included in the centrifuge spin.  After the spin, we poured the supernatant out of “A” into another chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “B’, while leaving the pellets in the solution in “A”.  200 microliters from “B” were then removed, placed in a microtubule labeled “Sample of B”, and put on ice.  We centrifuged “B” for 10 minutes at 1000G, at 4 degrees Celsius.  The resulting supernatant was poured into a 50 Ml tube marked “C”, and we, without disturbing the pellets in “B”, placed it on ice.  We then added 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the “B” pellets, transferred 200 microliters of the solution to a microtubule labeled “Sample of B”, and stored it on ice.  200 microliters from “C” were then placed in a “Sample of C” microtubule, and placed on ice.  Next, we labeled 10 test tubes (three with “pH 4”, three with “pH 7”, three with “pH 10”, and one “blank”), and set the spectrophotometer to 600 nm.  We prepared 3 replicated samples for each pH reaction mix, along with 1 for the blank, and added 100 microliters of prepared chloroplasts to all tubes.  We immediately mixed each tube, and transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes.  We then blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nm, and measured the absorbances of all pH samples.  We placed all of the cuvettes under a grow light, and repeated the procedure 10 minutes later, before placing the cuvettes back under the light.  We then repeated the procedure again 10 minutes later (after 20 minutes in total under the light), before placing the cuvettes back under the light, and measuring their absorbances after 10 minutes (30 minutes in total), all while recording the data in an Excel spreadsheet.  Finally, we used an ANOVA test to compare the percent change in absorption between pH 7 and pH 4, and pH 7 and pH 10, as well as find the P-value of the experiment.

Results:
Our mean values of percent change of light absorption over the first 10-minute interval were 16.75 for pH 4-treated leaves, -3.98 for the pH 7 leaves, and 14.84 for the pH 10 leaves.  After 20 minutes, the values were -3.16, -14.62, and 4.26, for pH 4, 7, and 10, respectively.  After 30 minutes under the grow light, the values for pH 4, pH 7, and pH 10 were 4.05, 4.27, and 14.27, respectively.  Both the pH 4 and pH 10 settings saw a large increase in absorbance over the first 10 minutes, while the pH 7 setting saw a large decrease after the second 10-minute interval (Fig. 1).  Only the pH 10-treated chloroplasts saw a large increase in absorbance over the final 10 minutes (Fig. 1). According to our ANOVA test, our means were insignificently heterogenous (one-way ANOVA, F2, 6=4.845, P=0.056).  We did not see physical differences between the samples of different pH values, but it was a positive sign that there were no leaf chunks in the tubes, and that the spinach leaves had been fully ground.

Discussion:
My hypothesis, that there would be little difference in absorbance change between the pH 4 and pH 10 – treated spinach leaf chloroplasts, was neither supported nor negated by our experiment.  Since our data is insignificent, no conclusions can be drawn from it.  Had our data been significent, my hypothesis would have been incorrect, as the patterns of absorbance change at pH 4 and pH 10 bore little resemblance to each other (Fig. 1).  However, previous experiments have demonstrated that acid rain (with a pH below 4.0) destroys chloroplast structure and reduces photosynthesis, so decreasing the pH of a system has been shown to have a negative effect on chloroplast light absorbance [Sun: 2016].  One would assume that a very basic environment would have a similar effect on photosynthetic activity as a whole, and that appears to be the case for microalgae, as a basic pH has been shown to lower the maximum photosynthesis of such organisms (unless they have a broad pH tolerance) [Middelboe: 2007].  In order to test whether spinach leaves respond in a similar fashion, my group and I could improve our experiment by tracking absorbance over a longer period of time than 10-minute intervals – however, given the time restrictions, such an experiment would be difficult to perform in class.  In addition, monitoring the clarity of the spectrophotometry cuvettes could improve our absorbance readings; however, we were very diligent in that regard, so it is unlikely to be a large source of error.  Overall, our experiment should be repeated, and extended over a longer period of time, in order to draw conclusions from significent data.
