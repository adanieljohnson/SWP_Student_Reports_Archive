Title: The optimal temperature range for PS II activity in Spinacia oleracea found to be 12-25°C 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis occurs in two phases: the light dependent and light independent reactions which both rely on proteins to carry out their functions. This study aimed to determine at which temperature range is the rate of photosynthesis the highest since photosynthetic proteins have an optimal temperature range.  The rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea was measured by recording the decrease in the absorption at 600nm at 0, 12, 25, 35, and 60°C which translates to an increase in Photosystem II reduction and photosynthesis rate since DCIP, the electron receptor that PS II uses in the Hill reaction, goes from blue to colorless when reduced.  A one-way ANOVA test produced a p-value of 0.024 with an alpha value of 0.05 which indicates a significant difference in the rates of photosynthesis at the different temperature values.  The Tukey-Kramer test, along with the rates of declining absorbance observed, determined that the optimal temperature range for photosynthesis in spinach was 12-25°C.       

Introduction:
In photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water, and CO2 to generate 6-carbon glucose molecules that are used to create energy for the organism.  The proteins that perform photosynthesis in plants are affected by changes in temperature.  At too high of temperatures, many proteins are denatured and do not work correctly.  At low temperatures, the proteins may become hardened and are unable to work properly.  However, studies have found that photosynthesis in spinach is not reduced in slightly cold temperatures as the proteins do not experience stress [Boese and Huner: 1990].  On the other hand, spinach has been shown to be affected by high temperatures with photosystem II becoming extremely susceptible to the effects of high temperature and undergoing photoinactivation [Yamane, et. al: 1998].  This experiment aims to determine the ideal temperature range for spinach leaves, Spinacia oleracea, to perform photosynthesis.  Spinach was selected because it was readily available and the method for extracting chloroplasts was known.  At extremely low temperatures, plants have been found to undergo photoinhibition, and PSII loses its ability to function [Briantais, et. al: 1992].  At high temperatures, electron transport has been shown to be blocked in PSII, lowering photosynthesis [Enami, et. al: 1994].  Since freezing temperatures harden proteins, and high temperature denature proteins, we predict the greatest photosynthetic rate will occur around room temperature and slightly below.        

Materials and Methods:
A Hill reaction was used with DCIP as the electron acceptor in order to measure the decrease in absorbance at 600nm.  Spinach leaves were ground, and centrifuged twice, once at 200xG for 3 min. and once at 1,000xG for 10 min., in order to extract the chloroplasts.  The chloroplasts were mixed with pH 6.5 buffer, water, and DCIP, and initial absorbances were taken.  The samples were placed in either 0°C, 12°C, 25°C, 35°C, or 60°C.  The absorbances were taken every 10 minutes for 30 minutes.  The percent change in absorbance was calculated and absorbance vs time was plotted on an XY graph.  A one-way ANOVA test was used to determine if there was a significant difference in the photosynthetic rate at different temperature ranges with an alpha value of 0.05. A Tukey-Kramer test was used to determine which temperature range was ideal.  

Results:
Results of the experiment are summarized in Figure 1.  12 and 25°C showed the largest decreases in absorbance relative to their time 0 values, and thus the highest photosynthetic rates.  0°C also had a fairly large decrease in absorbance, while 60°C had a much smaller decrease in absorbance.  35°C actually had an increase in absorbance.  The one-way ANOVA test gave a p-value of 0.024 which is smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. The Tukey-Kramer test results in Table 2 indicate that the difference in absorbance was significant for the 12-35°C and 25-25°C temperature ranges.  

Discussion:
Overall, the hypothesis was supported as ideal temperature range for photosynthesis was found to be 12-25°C.  There was a significant difference in the decrease in absorbance of the spinach chloroplasts at different temperatures.  There were certain temperatures at which the chloroplasts photosynthesized at a higher rate.  The Tukey-Kramer test results indicated that there was a significant difference in the decrease in absorbance, and thus the PS II activity and photosynthetic rate, at the temperature ranges of 12-35°C and 25-35°C.  Since the data in Figure 1 and Table 1 show that the greatest decreases in absorbance occurred in the 12 and 25°C temperature environments and the 35°C  environment actually increased absorbance, we could conclude that the ideal temperature range for the spinach leaves to photosynthesize was between 12-25°C, and there starts to be a decrease in photosynthetic ability as the temperature nears 35°C.  Studies have shown that most plants are able to photosynthesize successfully between 10-35°C and face stress below 0°C [Öquist, 1982].  Our data supports this statement as the spinach leaves were clearly able to photosynthesize effectively at 12-25°C.  Furthermore, there was not as large of a decrease in absorbance for the solutions at 0°C meaning that the photosynthetic rate decreased at 0°C and that the chloroplasts were likely facing low temperature stress like freezing.  Finally, we can conclude that the chloroplasts likely faced some negative consequences of heat as the chloroplasts in 35 and 60°C environments had the smallest decreases in absorbance and thus the lowest rates of photosynthesis.  It is likely that the warm temperature began to denature the proteins responsible for photosynthesis, and PSII likely underwent photoinhibition [Briantais, et. al: 1992].  Future studies would focus on determining a more specific ideal temperature range and narrowing the range down to a singular, ideal value.  Furthermore, ideal temperature ranges for photosynthesis of different plant species could be found.
