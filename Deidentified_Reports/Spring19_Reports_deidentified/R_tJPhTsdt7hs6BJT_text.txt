Title: The Addition of Ecdysterone Blocker In Manduca Sexta Diet and Its Effects on Growth and Development

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta, known as the tobacco hornworm, is a moth that inhabits most of the Americas. Throughout its larval stage and into pupation, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdeysterone (20E) affect growth and development 20E controls the timing of development and it spikes before every developmental stage, such as in between the fourth to fifth larval stages. This experiment will give 20E blocker to Manduca Sexta larvae and follow its effects. With this blocker in the food, it is expected that the experimental group will continue to function without ever reach their commitment pulse and developing into the pupal stage. 8 Manduca Sexta larva weighing 1.25-6 grams each were selected to be a part of the trial, All in the larval stages and pre-commitment pulse. 4 of the larvae were put in the experimental group, where 10 drops of 20E inhibitor was added per 10 g of food and the control group was given regular food mixed with a little water to prevent the food from drying and better resemble the food of the experimental group. Throughout the experiment, the experimental group’s weight varied very little, especially compared to the control group. The 20E blocker worked, as it made a difference in the weight and development of the larvae. The spike seen in the weight of the control group in fi

Introduction:
figure 2 is most likely associated with the commitment pulse, as they immediately lost weight following the spike, which is consistent with the fact that Manduca Sexta lose weight right before pupation.

Manduca Sexta, known as the tobacco hornworm, is a moth that inhabits most of the Americas. It is known as a pest in tobacco country, as it can destroy the crop during its larval stage. Throughout its larval stage and into pupation, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdeysterone (20E) affect growth and development 20E controls the timing of development and it spikes before every developmental stage, such as in between the fourth to fifth larval stages. A study aimed at stopping Manduca Sexta destruction of tobacco plants used hormone inhibitors to prevent larva growth [Johnson 89]. This experiment applies the same idea (hormone inhibition) to halt the development of Manduca Sexta larva by adding 20E inhibitors to their diet. With this blocker in the food, it is expected that the experimental group will continue to function without ever reach their commitment pulse and developing into the pupal stage. The larvae were weighed every day for 12 days and observations were taken daily as well. 

Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca Sexta larva weighing 1.25-6 grams each were selected to be a part of the trial. All larvae were in the larval stages and pre-commitment pulse. 4 of the larvae were put in the experimental group, where 10 drops of 20E inhibitor was added per 10 g of food. The control group was given regular food mixed with a little water to prevent the food from drying and better resemble the food of the experimental group. Both groups were fed on an as-need basis. The larvae were kept in plastic containers with holes for air and put in an incubator that maintained a temperature of 28 degrees Celcius. Cages were also cleaned as needed. The larvae were weighed every day for 12 days and observations were taken daily as well. A T-Test was used to determine statistical significance of data collected on the difference in weight of the two groups. Around day 3, the control group began to change color, turning lighter. Then, around day 6 the control group began to turn brown before beginning to pupate on day 8. More important than the weight statistics is the fact that the experimental group never reached its commitment pulse, proving the hypothesis that the experimental group will not reach its commitment pulse.

Results:
Figure 1 shows the individual weights of the larvae throughout the twelve days. B stands for blocker (experimental group), and c represents control. Larva B1 died between day 10 and 11. Figure 2 shows the same data as figure 1, but with the larvae organized by group rather than individually. Throughout the experiment, the experimental group’s weight varied very little, especially compared to the control group. It was also noted that throughout the whole experiment, the control group was more active than the experimental group. Around day 3, the control group began to change color, turning lighter. Then, around day 6 the control group began to turn brown before beginning to pupate on day 8. While the control group experienced much change in coloration, it was noted that the experimental group maintained it green color Further, the control group experienced much larger changes in weight than the experimental group. 

Discussion:
The 20E blocker worked, as it made a difference in the weight and development of the larvae. The control group made it to the pupation stage, while the experimental group did not, maintaining a similar weight and color throughout the trial. The t-value of the percent weight gained/lost daily was 0.405 and the one-tailed p-value was 0.690. However, more important than the weight statistics is the fact that the experimental group never reached its commitment pulse, proving the hypothesis that the experimental group will not reach its commitment pulse. The spike seen in the weight of the control group in figure 2 is most likely associated with the commitment pulse, as they immediately lost weight following the spike, which is consistent with the fact that Manduca Sexta lose weight right before pupation. This is further backed by our observations that caterpillars pupated shortly after the loss in weight. The success of the hormone inhibitor can lead into further study of inhibition in Manduca Sexta, potentially with Juvenile Hormone, something that has already been started in Drosophila melanogaster [Riddiford: 2003].
