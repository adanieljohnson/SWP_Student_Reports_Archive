Title: Effects of the inhibition of Ecdysterone on the growth and development of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta is a pest and its growth and development are controllled by juvenile hormone and ecdysterone . This experiment investigates the inhibitory effect of azadirachtin on Ecdysterone as well as its effect on the growth of Manduca sexta, measured by the average change in weight of caterpillars after an 8-days period. It is hypothesized that the group given azadirachtin would have higher weight than the group without azadirachtin after the time period because azadirachtin inhibits the absorption of ecdysterone. The hypothesis is not supported by the results as the azadirachtin given group has significently lower weight than that of the controll group (t_stat=4.07, d.f.=6, p=0.006657). This could be due to azadirachtin has antifeedant effect and reduce the food consumption of Manduca sexta. This can be applied into farming industry where azadirachtin can be used as an insecticide against Manduca sexta pesticides.

Introduction:
Hormones play a vital role in the metabolism as well as long term development of organisms. A hormone is defined as a regulatory substance produced in an organism and transported in tissue fluids to stimulate specific actions of other cells [Sadava: 2016]. Ecdysterone (20E), for example, regulates the timing of molting during the development of Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta, commonly known as tobacco hornworm is an insect in the Lepidoptera order, which includes butterflies, moths and skippers [Johnson: 2016]. 20E is a type of steroid hormone secreted by the prothoracic glands located at the back the head in insects. Together with Juvenile Hormone (JH), they regulate the insect’s development stages, which is primarily when and what type of molt is formed during development. When there is a high 20E to JH ratio, the insect would stop growing (increasing in weight) and prepare for pupation, because the high ratio indicates that the caterpillars are large enough and has enough stored nutrient. This ratio occurs naturally during the commitment pulse [Johnson: 2016].

In order to investigate the true effect of 20E ourselves, azadirachtin is used to regulate the level of 20E as Aradirachtin blocks 20E receptors. We formed the research question: How does consumption of azadirachtin affect the growth and thus the weight of Manduca sexta? The independent variable is whether the insect will be fed with azadirachtin in their diet. The dependent variable is the change in weight of the insect after 2 weeks of growth. Given such information, it can be hypothesized that if azadirachtin is fed to the Manduca sexta, because 20E receptors will be blocked, the insect would continue growing and would not pupate; therefore the insects given azadirachtin would have bigger increase in weight than the ones not given the azadirachtin. 


Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta weighing 0.8 to 1.5 grams were selected and divided into 2 groups of 4. One group being the controll and the other being the experimental group. Each caterpillar was placed into its own cell in a plastic transparent containers, which had 4 airflow holes for each cell. Each caterpillar was fed with 1 of the 2 diets. Each one in the controll group received 10 grams of food with 5 drops of water (2.5 Ml) and the ones in the experimental group received 10 grams of food with 5 drops of azadirachtin (2.5 Ml). The food mixture was formed into a ball to minimize dehydration of food. Food were re-prepared if they run out. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator that is set to 25 degrees Celsius with 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle. Measure the weight of individual caterpillar every 24 hours and their look are described for 8 days. Mean, standard deviation, and two-tailed two-sample t_test were used to evaluate the results, which were calculated using MS excel.


Results:
Looking at table 1, a significent difference between the average change of weight of caterpillars can be seen. The mean was used as the measure of central tendency as it indicates the arithmetic average. The controll group has an average of 5.07 +/- 1.41 grams increase in weight, which is higher than that of 1.31 +/- 1.20 grams increase of the experimental group. The standard deviations are large in the context of the means, but looking at figure 1, the standard deviations do not overlap. The experimental group weight is statistically significently lower than that of the controll group. (t_stat=4.07, d.f.=6, p=0.006657).

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that the insects given azadirachtin (experimental group) would have bigger increase in weight than the ones without azadirachtin (controll group), is not supported by the results. Figure 1 and table 1 show that the experimental group with water has a significently lower average change of weight of caterpillars than the controll group, which is the opposite from the hypothesis (t_stat=4.07, d.f.=6, p=0.006657). The p_value is much smaller than 0.05 but it proves the opposite of the alternative hypothesis. 

This result could be due to the fact that azadirachtin can act as a antifeedant. [Sieber: 1982]. Azadirachtin has a strong antifeedant effect on desert locust Schistocercu greguriu, which is a caterpillar with similar anatomy [Butterworth: 1968]. Azadirachtin inhibits the feeding and ultimately the ecdysis of Rhodnius prolixus (a pest called kissing bug) [Garcia: 1984]. Even though azadirachtin is antagonist to 20E [Boulahbel: 2015] and in theory that would allow the caterpillar to never pupate, this is not the case in this experiment. From observation during the experiment, the controll group’s food ran out much faster than that of the experimental group. The antifeedant effect of azadirachtin was conspicuous. Because the ones in experimental group are not eating, they cannot become heavier than the controll group.

Further experiment can be done to explore other types of substance that inhibit the 20E or JH and its effect on the growth and development of the Manduca sexta. Other aspect of growth and development such as pupation or turning into a moth can also be explored. Knowing that azadirachtin would reduce the feeding of Manduca sexta can be applied into the farming industry. Fruit and vegetable farmers can use azadirachtin as an insecticide to reduce the number of pesticide moths.
