Title: Comparing the Effect of Two Artificial Fish and One Artificial Fish on the Agonistic Behavior of  Betta splendens 

Abstract:
Animal behaviors are complex actions that are influenced by environmental changes via evolution and selection. Betta splendens, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish,  are known for aggressive interaction in intraspecific behaviors. In this experiment, to investigate how betta fish react to the presence of two betta fish in their tank instead of one, artificial fish were added to a tank with a betta fish and observed for five minutes. Aggression was measure through red mane display time. A one way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test was used to analyze our data. It was predicted that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two artificial fish compared to one artificial fish. Ultimately, there was not a significant difference between the display time of bettas’ red manes while in the presence of zero, one or two artificial fish. We were unable to prove that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two artificial fish compared to one artificial fish. We believe that domestication may be the reason for the lack of behavioral response found in the betta fish. 



Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior. Ethologists do not isolate behaviors from one another but rather seek to understand the physiological purposes for behaviors and how selection and evolution have shaped those behaviors. In order to understand an animal’s behavior, long periods of patient observation are needed allowing for data collection, the recognition of patterns and the development of ideas [Johnson:2016]. Many factors can influence the behaviors of animals; one of these factors is domestication

 Domestication is a process in which wild plants and animals are adapted for a human chosen purpose. Contrasting with the wild type of organism, the domestic version of the organism is often must be raised and cultivated by a human in order to thrive [Edward: 1984]. Domestication is the result of artificial selection; artificial selection is the intentional process to reproduce populations with certain desirable traits. The gene frequencies of desirable traits are controlled in order to control the genotype and phenotype of the organism. By using artificial favorable processes of selections, organisms allocate their resources differently resulting in being genetically different than their wild counterparts [Mignon-Grasteau:2005]. In animals, often domestication results in increasing size, a reduction in aggression and an increase comfortability with humans.

The animal used in this experiment is Betta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish or betta fish. They are a popular fish found in aquariums that originated in Southeast Asia [Johnson:2016]. They were originally bred for aggression due to being used as entertainment in cockfight-like contests [Verbeek:2007]. Later, in 1850, wild species of the Bettas were starting to be bred in captivity and domesticated for aquariums. Betta fish are practical model organisms for experiments due to their highly visual agonistic behaviors. Male bettas are known for being territorial and aggressive towards other males. In the wild, they are found in muddy, low oxygenated and standing waters such as canals, rice paddies, and floodplains. Unlike their wild counterparts, domesticated betta fish are bigger have been bred to permanently display their bright fighting colors[Johnson:2016].

Betta fish show distinct threatening social behaviors while in the presence of other Bettas, especially between two males. Bettas display two kinds of agonistic behaviors: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are when a fish turns to its side towards his opponent. Specific behaviors that fall under this category are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements are when the fish is facing the opponent head to head. Similar to broadside movements, there are three specific behaviors that fall under this category: erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and a red mane. The red mane is created when the betta fish protrudes its branchiostegal membranes, located under the opercula. This is one of the easiest agonistic behaviors to notice. In response to agonistic behaviors, the opponent betta fish can either ignore it, match it, flee, behave submissively or escalate the situation by showing another agonistic behavior at a higher intensity [Johnson: 2016].

Understanding behavioral changes in animals as a result of potentially threatening intraspecific behaviors could lead to a better understanding of animal socialization and communication. In our experiment, we hope to answer the following question: How do betta fish react when one or two other bettas are present in their tank? It was predicted that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two betta fish (artificial) compared to one betta fish(artificial); red mane display time will be used to measure aggression.

Materials and Methods:
Tank preparations:
First, we obtained an aquarium tank with two opaque dividers that divided the aquarium into three distinct equally sized sections. We also obtained 2 artificial fish that resemble the betta fish in shape and color. Next, ¾ of the tank was filled with fresh water. Then, we carefully added one male betta fish to each of the sections (3 betta fish total).  

Control:
First, without putting anything in the sections of the tank, we observed, timed and recorded the time the betta fish displayed its red mane in 5 minutes.  We repeated the process for all three betta fish.  

One fish-shaped object:
First, we added one fish-shaped object into one of the sections. After the fish-shaped object was added, we observed, timed and recorded the time the betta fish displayed its red mane in 5 minutes; the fish-shaped object resembled the betta fish swimming near the surface of the water. We repeated the process for all three betta fish. 

Two fish-shaped objects:
First, we gave each of the fish 5 minutes to rest. After the 5 minutes were up, we added two fish-shaped objects into one of the sections. After the two fish-shaped objects were added, we observed, timed and recorded the time the betta fish displayed its red mane in 5 minutes; both fish objects resembled the betta fish swimming near the surface of the water. We repeated the process for all three betta fish.

Statistics:
Lastly, after collecting the time the betta fish displayed its red mane, we compared the average red mane time in the control, one fish-shaped object, and two fish-shaped objects by running a one way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test


Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the average time that betta fish displayed their red manes in the control group, the group that had zero artificial fish, was 7.333土12.7 seconds (n=3). The average time that betta fish displayed their red manes in the group with one artificial fish was 7.31土10.17 seconds (n=3).  The average time that betta fish displayed their red manes in the group with two artificial fish was 0土0 seconds (n=3). Compared to the mean of the control group, the mean of the group with one artificial fish was approximately 0.314% lower. Compared to the mean of the group with one artificial fish, the mean of the group with two artificial fish was exactly 100% lower. There was not a statistically significant difference found between the two experimental groups and the control group (df=8, p=0.575). Based off figure 1., betta fish did not significantly display higher levels of agonistic behavior when exposed to two betta fish compared to one or to the control group. The general trend shows that one artificial fish produces a similar level of agonistic behavior compared to the control while displaying no agonistic behavior towards two artificial fish. 

Discussion:
It was predicted that betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two betta fish compared to one betta fish. It was found that betta fish do not significantly display their red manes more while in the presence of two artificial fish compared to one, therefore, rejecting the hypothesis. While there was not enough evidence to make conclusions, there were two trends found in the data. The first trend was that the bettas displayed similar levels of aggression when comparing the control to the presence of one artificial fish. The second trend was that two artificial fish elicited no response. Ultimately, our experiment did not support our hypothesis.

In research published in Aquaculture, scientist found experimental evidence suggesting that agonistic behaviors can decrease during the domestication of fish. In many species of domesticated fish, they found that the main factors that determine whether there is a decrease in aggression is relative size and food abundance. Without considering food, relatively larger fish behave more aggressively and dominate while relatively smaller fish behave more submissively. In an environment where food is plentiful, they found that selection for enhanced growth results in an increase in passivity in fish. Due to all fish being similarly sized and having a sufficient amount of food, the overall level of aggression decreases due to agonistic interactions no longer being rewarded [Ruzzante:1994]. Similar to the fish in the study, the betta fish observed were domesticated, larger than their wild counterparts and raised in a non-competitive food environment. Perhaps due to their shared domestic nature, the betta fish in our experiment similarly displayed low and minimal signs of agonistic behavior towards both one and two artificial. It is possible that diminishing the potential reward for being larger and able to out compete for food has led to the reduction in overall aggression in the intraspecific behaviors between domestic betta fish.

In another study, published by the Journal of Physiology & Behavior,  scientists investigated the level of stress that male betta would show when introduced into a spatially confined and unfamiliar environment; they measure the level of stress by monitoring cortisol levels. They found that exposure to an unfamiliar environment raised cortisol levels in the wild type but not in the domestic type. The domestic bettas were better adapted to unusual objects and confined space while the wild bettas displayed behaviors of stress, fear, and aggression [Verbeek:2008].  Due to domestic bettas being bred in captivity, they are more used to and selected for living in smaller and more variable conditions compared to their wild counterparts. In our experiment, we similarly placed the betta fish in very small sections of a tank. Instead of perceiving the artificial fish as possible real fish, the betta fish may have interpreted them as aquarium decorations and therefore non-threatening. This may explain why despite having little room in the tank, the domestic bettas were comfortable sharing the space with both one and two artificial fish.

Intra- and interspecific behaviors of betta fish were studied by scientists who published in the Journal of Animal Behavior. They allowed betta fish to swim through tanks and react to slow-moving conspecific, non-conspecific and inanimate objects. All of the objects provided an elevated response level compared to having no stimuli. They found that conspecifics objects, objects that look like bettas, elicited the same response as the other objects. Betta fish did not perceive different levels of threat based on different shapes [Johnson:1973].  Unlike our experiments, the betta fish reacted to inanimate objects that looked like fish noticeably more compared to the control but this may be due to their objects having movement. Due to their artificial fish presenting as more lifelike, their betta fish demonstrated more aggressive behavior.

A potential source of error in this experiment may have been that the bettas could see each other from their neighboring tanks since the opaqueness of barriers did not totally reach edges of the glass dividers. If a male betta fish saw another male betta through the edges of the divider, this would cause unwanted aggressive behavior. This would explain why the bettas display their red mane while testing the control. Our control values look nearly equal to the values obtained by the group with one artificial fish, perhaps suggesting the continuation of agression towards the neighboring fish.  Interestingly enough, adding two artificial fish, lead to no response which could possibly be interpreted as a result of habituation, which is a decline in the response to a single, constant stimulus in order to conserve energy.

In conclusion, there was no significant difference between the display time of bettas’ red manes while in the presence of zero, one or two artificial fish, therefore, our data was not successfully able to prove that  betta fish will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors when exposed to two artificial fish compared to one artificial fish. In our experiment, it is important to note that the betta fish reacted to artificial fish thus potentially producing a different response compared to a live fish; using two live fish would likely produce a different result. To improve the experiment, I believe the making the artificial fish more realistic would yield more significant data. Perhaps adding movement to the artificial fish would gain a better response. For potential and future experimentation, it would be interesting to investigate betta fish’s reaction to moving artificial fish that resemble agonistic behaviors. Understanding the role of domestication on intraspecific and agonistic behavior of fish could lead to a better understanding of animal welfare and lead to a more efficient and sustainable future in aquaculture.
