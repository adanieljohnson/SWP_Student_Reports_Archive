Title: Effects of juvenile hormones on the growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This experiment studies the effects of juvenile hormones on Manduca sexta. We believed that the hormones would prevent the Manduca sexta from pupating. To test this, we had a group of 4 Manduca sexta fed with 8 drops of juvenile hormones and a group fed with food with 8 drops of water. The average weight after two weeks of both groups was roughly the same and no significent change was found between the groups. The p_value was 0.30619. The hypothesis was not supported.  

Introduction:
Pests have always been a been a problem to agriculture, they are usually killed using pesticides that could harm the environment. However, an alternative solution to using pesticides would be to use hormones found in the pests themselves to prevent the pests from even being a problem. In this experiment, we will observe the effects of juvenile hormones on Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta is commonly referred to as the tobacco hornworm. During the larvae stage, the Manduca sexta can grow up to 10 grams [Reinecke: 1980]. We chose the Manduca sexta because it has three hormones that controll its growth: ecdysteriods, juvenile hormones, and prothoracicotropic hormone [Bollenbacher: 1981]. These hormones can be easily manipulated through Manduca sextaâ€™s diet. In this experiment, we tested the effects of juvenile hormones on the larvae stage of the Manduca sexta. In this experiment, the experimental group was fed additional juvenile hormones. If Manduca sexta are exposed to juvenile hormones, then they will be unable to pupate. 

Materials and Method:
Two groups of 4 Manduca sexta were separated into environments that were exactly the same. The experimental group were given 10 grams of food with 8 drops of juvenile hormone. The controll group was given 10 grams of food with 8 drops of water. The Manduca sexta were given new food and weighed every day for two weeks. 

Results:
The average weight gain of the controll group was 6.55 grams. The average weight gain of the experimental was 4.09 grams. The two-tailed p_value was 0.30619. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that juvenile hormones would prevent Manduca sexta from pupating was not supported. We received no significent difference between the controll and experimental groups. The two groups of Manduca sexta had almost the same amount of growth over the two-week testing period. Both groups of larvae grew rapidly during the test and prepared to pupate. We believed the juvenile hormones would not gain as much weight and not turn brown and begin to pupate. This shows more research into using juvenile hormone as a deterrent to pests. Exploring other options to find a good pest deterrent is needed. Perhaps using the two other hormones that controll juvenile growth could be a good deterrent against pests.
