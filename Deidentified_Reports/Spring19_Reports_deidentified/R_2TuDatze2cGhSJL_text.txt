Title: Effect of Nitrogen in Field Pea (Pisum sativun) Growth

Abstract:
Recourse allocation is a process in which plants disperse the appropriate amount of natural resources into their leaves, stems and roots to ensure its survival. Nitrogen is a natural resource which can limit a plants growth. Therefore, if nitrogen was added into field pea (Pisum sativun) soil, then the plant can grow more causing a smaller root to shoot ratio. However, the results although proved significent for weight, it was in the opposite direction than expected (p_value=0.003). The plant without the added nitrogen had a smaller root to shoot ratio for weight. The results for length of both the controll and nitrogen treated groups were not significent (p_value= 0.29). The results indicate that too much nitrogen can cause a negative impact on plant growth. Specifically, for field peas, it was later found that the plant has bacteria which provides sufficient nitrogen for optimal plant growth, therefore, the excess nitrogen lead to less weight.

Introduction:
Biotic and abiotic factors are two ways to categorize how plants interact with their surroundings. Biotic factors are how plants interacts with other living organisms while non-living aspects such as sunlight and soil are abiotic. The factors, however, which enable the plant to grow are limited, hence, are considered limited recourses. To respond to the presented resources, it must properly allocate them to ensure the plant’s survival. Resource allocation occurs between the leaves, stems and roots. When recourse allocation alters depending on the given conditions, it is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson: 2018]. Field peas (Pisum sativun) for example, will be utilized to test resource allocation. Natural resources plants utilize are those such as nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. Nitrogen is a main limiting factor for plant growth [Fageria and Baligar: 2005]. Therefore, nitrogen is utilized in many fertilizes. Miracle-Gro, a commonly used fertilizer, contains 24% nitrogen. If Miracle-Gro solution is added to the field peas (Pisum sativun), then they will have a lower root to shoot ratio in weight and length than those who are only given water.

Materials and Method:
Two pots were planted with nine field pea seeds per pot. The controll pot was given 100Ml of water daily for two weeks. The experimental pot was given 50 Ml of water and 50Ml of 1X Miracle-Gro solution which contains 24% nitrogen. A bucket was then partially filled with warm water. The controll plant was emptied into the bucket in which the plants were gently moved around to allow the roots to release the soil. Ten plants were separated without the roots breaking. After, the roots were individually rinsed and were cut directly above the pea. The roots and stem were measured and weighed. The bucket was then drained into the sink with a strainer and the remaining dirt and plants emptied into a compost bin. The same procedure was repeated with the experimental group. 

Results:
As portrayed in figure 1, the weight for the nitrogen treated plants was much higher than that of the controll and the lengths for both groups are more closely related. Through observation, however, the controll group appeared overall taller and healthier through the greenery and a multitude of leaves.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was rejected for the nitrogen treated group had a significently larger root to shoot ratio for weight (p_value=0.003). Although the results proved partially significent, it was in the opposite direction than predicted. The field peas (Pisum sativun) grew similarly in length as expressed through the root to shoot ratio (p_value=0.29). The standard deviation is larger (±0.74) for the weight of the nitrogen treated plants expressing a large range of error. However, the plants’ weight value still proved significent. Therefore, there is a low probability in which the field peas did not grow as well as the controll plants by chance. Hence, this experiment suggests that although nitrogen is beneficial, too much can negatively impact the plant. This phenomenon can be explained for field peas have naturally occurring “non-nodulating bacteria” isolated at the root which produce sufficient nitrogen for the plant [Tariq et. all: 2014].  In addition, nitrogen has also been shown to cause soil acidification which in turn can negatively impact plant growth [Barak, et. all: 1997]. To further improve this experiment, more pots and plants could have been tested.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The average root to shoot ratio for weight and length. The average weight for the controll plants was 1.02±0.15 while the average weight for the nitrogen treated plants was 1.83±0.74. The average length of the controll plants resulted in 0.68±0.12 and the nitrogen treated plants had an average length of 0.82±0.41. The weight resulted in statistically significent results (d.f.=18, t-value=3.375, p_value=0.003). However, the length was not statistically significent (d.f.=18, t-value=1.09, p_value=0.29). *************************************************************************
