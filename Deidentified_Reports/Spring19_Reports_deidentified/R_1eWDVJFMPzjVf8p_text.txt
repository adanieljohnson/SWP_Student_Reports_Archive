Title: Rhizophagus intraradices decrease the root to shoot ratio of the Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus

Abstract:
Abstract
	In life there are a lot of ways that organisms influence each other. They can interact with each other by living in the same space as one another. This paper sought to look at how rhizophagus intraradices fungi influences the root to shoot ratio of the Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus (radish plant). This was in reference to resource allocation and how plants expend energy to obtain resources they do not have. Half of the plants were grown with the soil, Vermiculite, while the other half of the plants were grown with the soil Vermiculate, Miracle Grow fertilizer and the fungi. The plants were watered every day for two weeks. Then the root to shoot ratio was measured. This ratio can change depending on what resources plant have and what ones they have to expend energy to get. Our group hypothesized that the treatment group would have a lower root to shoot ratio than the control group. Our results supported our hypothesis. The treatment group had a smaller root to shoot than the control group did. This shows where farmers may be able to use fungi to help their plants grow better and die less. 


Introduction:
Species are constantly interacting with each other and the environment. Sometimes organisms are affected because they live in the same space as other organisms. Other times, organisms such as plants cannot move so they interact with the soil and microorganisms surrounding the plant. Biotic factors are environmental stimuli that originate from other factors also influence this interaction. Biotic factors are living organisms. Abiotic factors are influential as well, but they are non-living. Examples of this are sunlight and wind. Abiotic factors were not studied in this lab, but they are still very relevant in life. Plants are a big part of the environment. Even though plants are stationary, they still interact with other organisms contributing a lot to the environment. Resource limitation also affects plants. [Wake Biology 2019] This leads to resource allocation which makes plants expend energy to get resources that they are limited in or don’t have. Different studies show different relationships between fungi and the positive affect it has on the growth of plants. One study in particular shows where Mycorrhizal Fungi help plants grow. They found that the overall root to shoot ratio increased in a variety of plants. [Mohammadi 2011]  In this experiment, radish plants, a dependent variable, Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus, will be grown with and without rhizophagus intraradices fungi. This fungus was good to use because it is easily accessible and is already abundant in the environment. This radish plant is good to use for this experiment because it grows quickly and pretty well in most environments. This means that the plant should not die, and results should be obtainable. Through this, the root to shoot ratio will be tested between the control group, without the fungi, the independent variable, and the test group, with the fungi. The root to shoot ratio is a way the plant copes with not having enough resources in one area of need.[Maskova 2018]. The root to shoot ratio is the ratio between the root system of the plant divided by the shoot system of a plant. This ratio can vary based off of nutrient availability in the soil or reserves in the roots from last season. [Maskova 2018]. The fungi will help the plants with their uptake of water. They also will have to allocate less resources to getting water making their root system smaller than the control who will have to allocate more resources to obtain water. Our group hypothesized that the root to shoot ration of the test group would be smaller than the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
To perform this experiment we obtained a handful of radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) seeds and soaked them in water for around twenty minutes. This radish plant was good to use for this experiment because it grows quickly. Next, we divided the seeds and planted them in 8 different black boxes. The soil used was Vermiculite. Then we watered the plants and added Miracle Grow fertilizer to all 8. In 4 of them we added a level spoonful of the fungi (Rhizophagus intradices) to ensure each experimental plant gets the same amount of fungus. For the next two weeks we watered the plants every day. After two weeks it was time to collect data. To do this, we soaked the plants in water to remove all the dirt. Then we weighed the plants in groups of three to have three groups of three. Each group will count as one plant. Next, we separated the roots from the shoots weighing each group separately. Measure the length of the longest shoot and longest root in each of the three groups. Finally, we used a 2 sample T-test to analyze your results. The significance value will be based of off a 95% confidence interval. If the p value is less than 0.05 than the data is significant. 



Results:
The results showed were experimental group had a smaller root to shoot ratio than the control group. The weight of the control group is statistically not significant compared to that of the treatment group (t-stat = 0.624, df = 4, P = 0.28). The length of the control group is statistically not significant compared to that of the treatment group (t-stat = 0.815, df = 4, P = 0.230). The error bars represent the standard deviation of each set. This can be shown in table 1 referencing the weight, table 2 referencing the length, and a graph displaying both the mean height and weight root to shoot ratio. 

Discussion:
Our experiment supported our hypothesis. This was shown by the statistically significant differences between the control and experiment group. The root to shoot ratio for both weight and length were smaller in the plants who had the fungi in the soil. This was due to resource allocation. The plants with the fungi put less resources in obtaining water and other necessary nutrients meaning that they could put less resources into growing their roots. There were not any significant errors that could have altered our final results.  Another study shows were mychorrhizal fungi decreases the biomass of the root to shoot ratio in an assortment of plants. The plants do not have to allocate as much resources, so their roots or shoots do not need to be as big to compensate for the lack of water or other nutrients. [Veresoglou 2011]. In another experiment, it would be interesting to test different fungi to see if they each have a different affect on the root to shoot ratio or approximately the same as this one. Learning about resource allocation and how plants use there root to shoot ratio to try and gain resources they do not have is important. This experiment could be helpful to farmers by either allowing them to grow more crops or grow crops that could uptake water better. This is because the roots would not have to go as deep searching for water because the fungus helps the plants uptake water.
