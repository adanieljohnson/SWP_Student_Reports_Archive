Title: Varying Temperatures Affect Reaction Rates of Spinacia Oleracea Chloroplasts in Direct Light

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a complex reaction that allows plants, protists, and certain bacteria to capture energy from the sun. There are many environmental factors that affect the rate of redox reactions throughout the electron transport chain during photosynthesis. This experiment focuses on the effects of altering temperature of the chloroplasts that carry out this reaction. DCIP is a high energy intermediate, similar to NADP+, but different in the way that it becomes colorless as it reacts with chloroplasts. By extracting Spinacia Oleracea or spinach leaves’ chloroplasts and measuring the rate of color change with a spectrophotometer, we were able to measure the rate of activity by the color change of the chloroplasts in different temperatures with direct light. By using DCIP as a color indicator for reaction rates, we were able to determine that there was a big change in color especially in the more temperate temperatures and less color change in the warmer temperatures. The statistical test did not support our hypothesis as the results were not below the cut off value that deems data significent (f-stat = 1.106, d.f. = 35, p = 0.398). However, the visible change was still seen and is important to mention.


Introduction:
For eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts, which are specialized organelles made up of photosystems that capture energy from the sun’s waves to create excited electrons. Once the energy is captured, a water splitting enzyme allows the electron to pass to carrier Q, releasing oxygen and protons into the thylakoid space in the process. Electrons excited by light pass via a carrier, Q, to carrier cyt b6-f, which is a proton pump that harnesses the energy and pumps protons into the thylakoid space. The high concentration of protons in the thylakoid space is essential in driving ATP synthesis [Mamedov: 2018]. These first few steps are known as Photosystem II. The next phase, Photosystem I, also uses light energy to excite electrons which are used by ferredoxin along with a proton (released by the ATPsynthase pump) from the stroma to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. NADPH is used along with CO2 to create macromolecules and energy the organism can use via the Calvin Cycle, which is the source of most nutrients for the organism [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment will focus on Photosystem I.

2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) will be used as an alternative electron acceptor instead of NADP+. DCIP is the focus of this experiment and measuring its change in color is called the Hill Reaction. Originally it is a dark blue molecule that absorbs light at 600 nm. Once it is reduced by chloroplasts to DCIPH2, its bonds reorganize creating conjugated pi bonds. This means that it will absorb UV light and will become a colorless compound [Johnson: 2018]. This reaction is carried out by isolating Spinacia oleracea or spinach leaves’ chloroplasts. By measuring the isolated chloroplasts’ rate of color change with a spectrophotometer throughout 10-minute intervals, we will be able to compare the change in activity of the chloroplasts in four different water baths of different temperatures. The purpose of this experiment is to see if temperature has any effect on the activity of chloroplasts’ redox reactions. We know that spinach leaves thrive in a sunny environment with relatively warm temperatures which allows us to hypothesize that room temperature will probably allow the chloroplast to have the greatest rate of chloroplast activity.

Materials and Method:
Spinach leaves were collected, washed, dried, and grinded with a mortar and pestle after removing main stems and veins. All centrifuge and test tubes were placed in ice prior and in between steps. After adding 10 Ml of buffer to mortar, the spinach was grinded until thick paste formed. This paste was filtered through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled centrifuge beaker and sent to centrifuge at 200 x G at 2800 RPM for three minutes at four degrees celsius. The supernatant was poured into a new beaker and the debris from the first beaker was discarded. The new beaker was then centrifuged again at 1,000 X G at 2800 RPM for ten minutes at four degree celsius. Then the supernatant was poured in a waste leaving the pellet, the bottom layer, in the beaker. 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and stirred. A portion of 100µl from this solution was then placed in 12 test tubes along with 2 Ml of DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 6 Ml of water. A blank was also made using 2Ml of reaction buffer and 8 Ml of water. After mixing tubes, a portion was transferred to cuvettes and their absorbances were recorded at time zero. Then they were placed in their respective water baths with temperatures of 0, 22, 40, and 55 degrees celsius. Ice, room temperature water, and two heated water baths gave these exact temperatures. Lamps were also placed pointing directly on the cuvettes to mimic full sunlight. Then, the cuvettes’ absorbances were recorded every 10 minutes for 30 minutes with a spectrophotometric assay which was blanked with the prepared blank solution. A percent difference equation was used to compare the 3 time intervals to the time zero absorbances. A one way ANOVA was used to compare the percent difference of the chloroplast activity of different temperatures for each time interval.

Results:
The cuvettes at time zero were all a violet color. By the end of the experiment, the room temperature cuvettes were all clear and the ice cuvettes were a very faint violet color. The two heated water bath groups of cuvettes were still relatively dark. (f-stat = 1.106, d.f. = 35, p = 0.398). The absorbance change data is interpreted in Figure 1,2, and 3 based on their time interval. Figure 1 and 2 show the same trend, that is: the room temperature had the highest change of absorbance followed by ice and 40℃ and 55℃. Figure 3 shows a drastic drop of activity in all temperatures except room temperature.


Discussion:
The purpose of this experiment was to test if altering temperatures would have any significent effect on the activity of chloroplast in direct light reacting with DCIP, which is a high energy intermediate like NADPH and FADH2. The chloroplasts which are green react with DCIP which is a dark violet color. However, when in direct light the chlorophyll in chloroplasts absorb light that allow chloroplasts to reduce DCIP to DCIPH2 via photosystem I [Strand:2016]. This is seen as we had predicted in the room temperature chloroplast solution, since it turned clear at the end of thirty minutes. 
 
The ANOVA statistical test concluded that the data sets were not statistically supported to be significent. In other words, the numerical evidence concluded that the results could have happened by chance. However, there was a clear change in visible color based on temperature. As mentioned above, the room temperature cuvette became colorless at the end of thirty minutes. Also the chloroplasts placed in ice had the second highest change of absorbances for all three times. Spinach plants are known to be grow in relatively warm temperatures but have a high tolerance for cold weather which explains the reason for high activity as opposed to the two heated water baths [Johnson: 2018]. The two heated water baths most likely denatured the membranes of the chloroplast especially at 30 minutes, as almost no change was seen at this interval. The best explanation is that the chloroplasts cooked in such high temperatures, especially without the insulation and protection of the original integral parts of the original leaf.

This lab was difficult to time and maintain chloroplast under direct light especially while transporting between intervals to measure absorbances. It was also difficult to maintain the order of the cuvettes seeing that they were not labeled due to risk of affecting absorbance values. Also, condensation formed on the surface of the iced cuvettes as we measured their absorbances which caused the absorbance to rise steadily on the assay when it was supposed to stay at one value. Another factor that is difficult to regulate is the amount of chloroplasts in each beaker and cuvette. Chloroplasts tend to stick together which causes difficulty in trying to divide them evenly, especially after we forced them to stick together by centrifuge. In another attempt of this experiment, there should be a better way to transport, label, and maintain the cuvettes in a constant temperature. There should be a way to evenly split up the chloroplasts and there should be more cool temperatures tested as they would probably give better results.
