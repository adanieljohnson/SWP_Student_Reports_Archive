Title: Proline affect on spinach leaves photosynthetic activity while under salt stress

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is driven by electron carriers and photosystem 1 and 2. Under salt stress, plants photosynthetic activity goes down, however, in response to environmental stress, proline is produced which is a protein that helps stabilize conditions within the stressed cell. Thus, we wanted to see how additional proline affects photosynthetic rates when spinach leaves is under salt stress. We tested rates with proline concentrations of 20mM, 40mM, and 60mM against a control group without proline all in salt stress. We used a Hills Reaction procedure and a series of assays to test absorbance using the electron acceptor DCIP. We discovered that there was no significant difference between any of the proline groups and the salt stressed group with p-values of 20mM, 40mM, and 60mM groups compared to just the salt stress group being 0.493, 0.444, 0.411 respectively. Thus, proline does not have any effect on photosynthetic rates in spinach leaves when under salt stress.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the chemical process plants undergo in order to obtain energy. In this experiment, we will focus on the first stage of photosynthesis called the light dependent reaction. In this stage light excites and electron in photosystem II which passes it along the thylakoid membrane driving a proton gradient into the thylakoid lumen. The excited electron finally gets passed to photosystem I where it is captured by an electron acceptor NADP. In this experiment, we are measuring the activity of photosystem II by using an alternate electron acceptor known as DCIP. This acceptor will lose its blue color when electrons bind to it, so we will measure activity with a spectrometer and a series of assays. In particular, we will be looking at how salt stress affects the photosynthetic activity of the chlorophyll from spinach leaves with the presence of the protein proline. Salt stress causes an excessive accumulation of Na+ and Cl- ions in the plants and this can cause inactivation of enzymes and decrease the efficiency of photosynthesis(Sudhir,2004). Thus, in response to salt stress, many plants use proline which is an amino acid that plants release in excess while under environmental stress. It specifically acts in osmotic adjustment to help stabilize the cell, but it also acts as a buffer in cellular redox potentials and stabilizing sub-cellular structures (Hayat, 2012). Furthermore, Proline can cause salt stress responsive gene expression. Ashraf noticed in his experiment that proline had different effects depending on the plant species. Ashraf’s experiment found that proline has positive effects on salt stress plants, but if too much proline is added, it can be harmful to the cell (Ashraf,2007). In a different experiment done by Ben Ahmed, he tested Olive Trees photosynthetic rates under salt stress in regard to proline. He found that proline helped stabilize and reduce the salts effect on photosynthetic rates (Ben Ahmed, 2010). Thus, in our experiment we want to see the effects exogenous proline has on plant’s photosynthetic rate under salt stress. We believe that the addition of proline will help increase photosynthetic activity.


Materials and Methods:
In the first part of our experiment, we enriched chloroplasts by differential centrifugation. We took the central veins from 4 spinach leaves, ground them up, and added 10 mL of 400 nm sucrose in tricine buffer. We then strained the paste through a cheesecloth and into a beaker adding 10 mL more of the buffer. We stored 200 microliters on ice. Next, the remaining paste into a chilled centrifuge tube and spin it at 200x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Next, this sample was placed in a chilled centrifuge leaving out the debris. We then removed 200 microliters of this liquid and stored it on ice. Next, centrifuge the 50 mL tube at 1000xG for 10 min at 4 degree Celsius. Pour this solution into a clean 50 microliter tube. Take the remaining liquid and add 200 microliters of grinding buffer and gently stir. This will be the liquid you use for exercise 2.
	The second part of the experiment involved quantifying PSII reduction activity using the Hill Reaction procedure. First, we labeled 16 test tubes: 1 blank(8 mL of water and 2mL reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), 3 with chloroplast(6mL water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, 2mL reaction buffer), 3 with chloroplast under salt stress (5mL water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, 1mL 2M NaCl), 3 with chloroplast salt stress and 20 mM proline (4.96mL water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, 2mL reaction buffer, 1mL 2M NaCl, .04mL proline), 3 with 40mM proline (4.92mL water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, 2mL reaction buffer, 1mL 2M NaCl, .08mL proline), and 3 with 60mM proline(4.88mL water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, 2mL reaction buffer, 1mL 2M NaCl, .12mL proline). All of these tubes had 100 microliters of chloroplasts. Lastly, there were 3 tubes of no chloroplast with 6mL water, 2mL reaction buffer, and 2mL DCIP. These tubes had their absorbance measured at 420nm at time zero, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes after the reaction buffer was added. The percent change from time zero was also recorded.


Results:
After the Hill Reaction procedure had been done and the assays had been run we compared the absorbance levels from time zero in order to check the percent change in absorbance. All of the groups besides the no salt stress had a large percent change in the first ten minutes, but then they all drastically dropped to almost no change for the 20 and 30 minute measurements.
	We ran a one tailed t-test between the salt stress groups and the three proline groups. For the 20mM proline groups, the degrees of freedom, t-value, and p-value were 4, 0.018, and 0.493 respectively. The 40mM groups yielded 4, 0.150, and 0.444. The 60 mM groups yielded 4, 0.240, 0.411. 


Discussion:
After evaluating the activity of DCIP as an electron activity in the spinach chloroplast under salt stress and exogenous proline, we found that there was no significant difference in photosynthetic rates between the groups tested with proline and the ones without it. Although Ben Ahmed found that proline helped photosynthetic activity in salt stress plants (Ben Ahmed,2010), there may have been a different effect on spinach leaves that may not have impacted activity. Ashraf said that proline can have different effects on different species of plants, thus, the spinach leaves may react differently to photosynthesis. According to Hare proline stabilizes NADH/NAD+ levels which helps photosynthetic activity under salt stress (Hare,1997). Thus, since we used DCIP to show photosynthetic activity, it may not have had the same effect on this alternate electron acceptor. This is one explanation, but because proline helps enzymatic activity this is a less likely explanation. Thus, we can say that proline most likely does not have the same desired effect on the species of spinach leaves and their photosynthetic activity. In the future, we may want to test how proline does impact spinach leaves under environmental stress, perhaps it stabilizes structure more than enzymatic activity or perhaps it has no impact at all.
