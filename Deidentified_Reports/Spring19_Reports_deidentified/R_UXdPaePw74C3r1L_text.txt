Title: Lidocaine's effect on Rana pipien muscle contractions

Abstract:
Muscle contractions are produced through action potentials in the nervous system that involve the depolarization and repolarization of a cell. Lidocaine is thought to alter the way that this process takes place. In the conducted experiment, Lidocaine was injected into a Rana pipien’s gastrocnemius in order to see if it had an impact on muscle contraction. The expectation was that the muscle would experience a decrease in action potential intensity, lessening the muscle’s ability to contract. Our data showed no significant difference in the control group (not injected with Lidocaine) and the experimental group. This insignificance suggests that the results could have been subject to chance. However, previous studies state that other factors could be involved that would cause this result to happen, or that the conclusion could be wrong completely. Understanding the effect of Lidocaine on muscle contraction could lead to a breakthrough in how people solve many anesthetic problems in the field of medicine.

Introduction:
Muscular contractions in Rana pipiens have been studied for many years.  However, little is known about the effect of anesthetic agents in these ectotherms [Williams: 2017]. Muscle contractions are controlled by action potential signals in the nervous system. These action potentials occur through the opening of sodium channels, depolarizing the cell (invoking a contraction). Potassium channels repolarize and hyperpolarize the cell, causing the muscle to relax. Calcium is a key component in this process, as it is released in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, attaching to myosin binding sites. This is what causes the sliding filament theory, which describes the contraction of a muscle. All together, these components are essential in muscle contraction, meaning that altering one could have severe consequences. Lidocaine is often used on many types of organisms for surgery, as it blocks nerve signals in the body. The anesthetic blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and even affects potassium channels and re-uptake of calcium in larger doses [Huang: 1981]. The experiment evaluates a Rana pipien’s gastrocnemius muscle’s ability to contract when injected with Lidocaine.  Rana pipiens are used because they are readily available, and their gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve are easy to dissect.  For the experiment, the dosage level of Lidocaine is moderate to high, making it even more probable that the muscle contraction will be affected. We hypothesized that if the Rana pipien’s gastrocnemius was injected with Lidocaine, then there will be a decrease in action potential intensity, lessening its ability to contract.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were used in the experiment, with each dissected and prepared to reveal the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle. Frog ringers solution was used to moisten the legs periodically, in order to give the muscle the ability to contract to its full potential. The frog legs were first tested as a control group, meaning that the Lidocaine was not yet injected. An electrical probe was inserted into the muscle to asses myograms through an electrophysiology monitor (LabScribe). The electrode stimulated the muscles with 1.5 amps of voltage for five seconds. Each frog leg was stimulated for three trials in both groups. The amplitude of the myograms was used to evaluate the intensity of action potentials. The same three frog legs were then tested as the experimental group under the same conditions, except for the fact that they were injected with 0.1 mL of Lidocaine. The Lidocaine was given three minutes to take effect on the muscle before testing took place. After testing, a paired t-test was prepared, giving a p-value to use for analyzation of the data. 

Results:
The average action potential intensity of the control group was 0.341v. The average action potential intensity of the experimental group was 0.012v. The paired t-test gave a p-value of 0.219, meaning that the data was not significant. Observations of the myograms showed a large difference in amplitude (intensity). When observing the muscle under stimulation, there were rapid contractions in the control group, but little to no signs of contracting in the experimental group. Figure 1 shows the difference in the average action potential intensities of the two groups, exhibiting the visual difference in the two groups.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that the frog’s gastrocnemius would experience a decrease in action potential intensity, was not supported. The p-value that the paired t-test gave us rejects the alternative hypothesis, suggesting that the results could have been due to chance. It is possible that the small sample size contributes to this issue, as a larger sample size will solidify a more credible result. Varying the amount of lidocaine that is injected across groups could also improve results, as it would support the theory behind dosage effect on potassium channels and calcium [Huang: 1981]. A past study has shown a noticeable effect of increasing the dosages of lidocaine on a human trachea. The trachea relaxed much more quickly under higher dosages of Lidocaine during contraction [Kao: 2010]. A final change that I would make if conducting the experiment again would be to use frog legs that all have a similar length gastrocnemius. A previous study found that the length of the gastrocnemius played a vital role in the contraction and relaxation phases [Sommacal: 2008]. It is important to apply these findings to other species physiology, as lidocaine is used frequently in surgical procedures to suppress pain and sedate the patient. Increasing understanding of how Lidocaine affects muscle contraction could lead to changes in the way that anesthetic procedures are conducted.

Figure Legends: Figure 1. shows the average action potential intensity of the two groups and the standard deviation. The results of the graph show that the experimental group’s average action potential intensity (0.341v) was not nearly as intense as the control group (0.012v).*************************************************************************
