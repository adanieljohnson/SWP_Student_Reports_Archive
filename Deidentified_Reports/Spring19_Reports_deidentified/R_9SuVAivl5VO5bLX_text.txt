Title: Use of shelter by male Betta splendens in relation to the presence of another male displaying agonistic behavior. 

Abstract:
Male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) often display agonistic behavior when in the presence of another male Betta fish. This forces the other male to respond either by avoiding conflict through fleeing, submissing, or ignoring it, or by reciprocating through matching or escalating it. Since engaging can be detrimental to the individual’s survival, it would be expected that a male would avoid conflict unless it was necessary, thus being more likely to avoid the conflict by possibly making use of shelter. We examined how much a male Betta fish used shelter when in the presence of another male compared to when not in the presence of another male by calculating the presence of time the individual spent in the shelter under both conditions. We found there was not a significant difference in the amount of time spent in the shelter when another male was present or not, indicating male Betta fish generally do not make use of shelter when presented with agonistic behavior from other male Betta fish. We instead found that they often reciprocated the behavior, the reasoning for which could be studied further, possibly under different experimental conditions that cater to a more realistic natural environment. 

Introduction:
Animals often show agonistic behavior when competing for food, territory, or mates. This aggressive behavior can be observed in a number of ways depending on the type of species. Some will show warning signals by changing their appearance, color, posture, or pattern. Some will physically fight while others will make noise, among a number of other possible behaviors. 
Male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), tend to show agonistic behaviors in the presence of other males. They often show this type of behavior by changing their color to a brighter blue or red, as well as by flaring their gills and fins. This forces the other male to respond, either ignoring it, matching it, fleeing, submissing, or escalating [Johnson: 2016]. Often times, two males will engage in physical contact, which can be harmful to the fish by causing injury or preventing them from surfacing to get oxygen. Due to this risk, males will sometimes avoid reciprocating the aggressive behavior by either ignoring, fleeing, or submissing. This avoidance reduces the risk that the individual will be harmed, thus increasing its chances of surviving to reproduce [Ambrosio: 2016].
Since avoiding agonistic behavior presented by another male can be beneficial to a male’s reproductive success, we looked to examine how a male Siamese fighting fish may make use of shelter when presented with agonistic behavior displayed by another male, comparing the individual’s use of shelter with and without the presence of another male. By examining male Betta fish use of shelter, we can better understand the method by which male Betta fish engage in agonistic behavior with other males. 
If a male Betta fish has access to shelter, it will make use of that shelter more in the presence of another male than when not in the presence of another male. 


Materials and Methods:
We first placed the male Betta fish in an area in which it had access to shelter and was not in the presence of another male. We recorded the amount of time it spent using the shelter in a five minute period. We then presented a male Betta fish that the individual could see, but was physically separated from. We recorded the amount of time it spent using the shelter in a five minute period. We used three male Betta fish to run three trials of this test. We used a paired t-test to determine whether there was a significant difference between the time spent in shelter when there was another male present compared to when there was not another male present. 

Results:
The average percentage of time spent using the shelter when another male was not present was 4.5% with a standard deviation of ± 9.0. The average percentage of time spent using the shelter when another male was present was 9.5% with a standard deviation of ± 13.6. There was not a significant difference between the two groups (T-value: 0.633, df: 3, P-value: 0.572).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported. The results of this experiment showed that male Betta fish tended to not make use of the shelter that much more when another male was present compared to when another male was not present (Figure 1). Most often, when the male showed agonistic behavior, they would either match it or escalate it, as opposed to submissing, fleeing, or ignoring, which was expected. There was only one instance of the four in which the test fish attempted to flee, but still did not make use of the shelter. When the behavior was matched or escalated, there was no motivation for the fish to use the shelter. 
	A confounding variable that may have influenced our results was the size of the shelter in comparison to the size of the environment; in other words, the amount of water in the tank. If there were more water, the shelter would not have taken up as large of a proportion of space in the tank. Since the shelter took up so much space, the fish may have avoided it to escape the possibility of being trapped. If the shelter had taken up a smaller proportion of space in the tank, the fish may have been more inclined to voluntarily use it, especially if in the presence of another male displaying agonistic behavior. 
	By examining how Betta fish use shelter when presented with agonistic behavior by another individual, we can understand how Betta fish interact with other individuals in their natural environment, where they have access to shelter. This simulates a more realistic understanding of agonistic behavior in male Betta fish.
	From here, we could test the use of shelter when two males are exposed to each other physically. A study examining agonistic behavior of crayfish in relation to social structure found that more the presence of more aggressive individuals resulted in an increase in burrowing behavior (a type of avoidant behavior) [Herberholz: 2003]. By allowing the two male Betta fish to physically engage, a male may be more likely to flee or submit to the more aggressive male since there would be a greater risk to engage. 
	In summary, the results of this experiment show that males are not likely to use shelter when agonistic behavior is presented by another male.
