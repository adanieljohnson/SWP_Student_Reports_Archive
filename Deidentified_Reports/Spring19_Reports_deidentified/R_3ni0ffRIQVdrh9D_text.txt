Title: The Examination of the Change in Muscular Response in the Gastrocnemius of Raina Pipens due to the injection of Lidocaine 

Abstract:
This experiment was preformed to study the effects of Lidocaine on the response of the gastrocnemus of Raina Pipens. We hypothesized that the leg would exhibit smaller responses to electrical stimulation due to the injection of Lidocaine. To test this, we used 3 frog legs and tests each as their own controll and treatment. We first ran an array of electrical stimulations through the gastrocnemus and collected results. Afterwards, we injected Lidocaine and waited 5 minutes before testing again. We measured the maximum electrical response of each leg, before and after injection, and took an average of each respectively. Afterwards we measured the responses of each test and the results were as follows. The treatment groups exhibited a much lower response (roughly .1 Amp on average) when compared to the controll.  Additionally, the standard deviations for the controlls were all roughly .007, while the treatment had a large disparity of ±.003. Our second leg exhibited a difference of nearly .2 A, twice what leg 1 and 3 showed. Our P-value of .047 is within the .05 confidence interval, supporting our hypothesis. Lidocaine is effective since it decreased the response in our subjects.  This is important because it has proven to be effective in numbing the subject muscle group.

Introduction:
In order to investigate the function of muscular response to Lidocaine, we isolated the gastrocnemus (calf muscle) of the Raina Pipens, Northern Leopard Frog, and stimulated it with a variety of voltages both directly into the muscle, and into the sciatic nerve [Johnson: 2018].  We chose to test the effect of Lidocaine on the muscular response because it is a sodium blocker, sodium being an integral part of an action potential [Chen: 2000].  An action potential is a self-propagating process in which more and more sodium is brought into the cell along the axon via voltage gated channels, further depolarizing the cell [Mortimer: 2014].  This propagation continues until the axon terminal is reached and a signal (chemical or electrical) is released [Mortimer: 2014].  This process is integral in muscle function and, if a sodium blocker such as Lidocaine is used then the propagation of the action potential will be slowed or prevented depending on the dosage [Mortimer: 2014].  Our hypothesis is if Lidocaine is injected into the gastrocnemus of the Raina Pipen leg then the voltage produced by the leg will be decreased (in comparison to the controll).  This is because the Lidocaine will block the Sodium receptors and stop or at least slow the flow of Sodium into the cell and this will consequently slow or stop the action potential from firing [Chen: 2000].  We found this experiment particularly important because it will allow us to study the effects of the popular numbing agent at an electrical level.  If we hypothesized correctly then the frog leg will produce weaker responses to the stimulations in comparison to the same leg pre-injection.  Our independent variable is the amount of Lidocaine injected into the gastrocnemus, and the dependent variable is the muscles response to the stimulation.

Materials and Method:
In order to accurately test the effect of Lidocaine on the gastrocnemus’ response to stimulation we selected three frog legs of similar size and made each one both its controll and treatment.  To do this we first tested a frog leg under normal conditions and recorded its responses.  After we finished recording the controll data for that leg we then injected .1 Ml of Lidocaine into the gastrocnemus, waiting 5 minutes before retesting.  We ran through the same process with all three frog legs.  However, before testing was possible, we needed to “deglove” the frog leg, expose the sciatic nerve, isolate the gastrocnemus, and suspend it so the prongs could be inserted, and so observations could be easily recorded [Johnson: 2018].  After testing all three frog legs we collected the total nerve stimulation of each respective leg, pre and post-injection.  After doing so we calculated the standard deviation of each test as well.  Then we summarized our data in a bar graph which is our frog legs (both controll and treatment paired per leg), by the leg’s response in amps.  Lastly, we used a two-paired T test to find our P-value which we would later compare to a P-value of .05 to see if our data is in fact significent or not.

Results:
After collecting all of our data from each of the three frog legs we measured the total nerve stimulation of each leg.  After plotting this data on Figure 1, along with the standard deviations, we found that the controll in each leg had a much larger response, around .1 Amp on average, although our second leg had a difference of nearly .2 Amps.  The averages of each controll are as follows: 0.153, 0.222, 0.235 and the averages of the treatments are: 0.05, 0.034, and 0.137.  It is clear that the treatment exhibited responses in much lower intensities.  These groups are quite lower in average value, with a value of nearly .1 or higher of a difference between the controll and treatment of the same leg. The standard deviations are as follows, for the controll groups: 0.007, 0.0075, 0.0068, and for the treatment groups: 0.0045, 0.002, and 0.0068.  Our standard deviations measured to be quite small, however, the value for our third controll was a lot larger than the others.  Also, the standard deviations of the treatment groups were all smaller than their paired controll groups. After collecting the aforementioned data our p_value was calculated as .047, found via a two-paired T test, and we received a T value of 4.453 as well.

Discussion:
After finishing our experiment with all three frog legs and doing the requisite calculations, we found that our results were in fact significent – and that our hypothesis was supported.  To restate, our hypothesis was if Lidocaine is injected into the gastrocnemus of the Raina Pipen leg then the voltage produced by the leg will be decreased, in comparison to the controll.  After collecting and processing our data we calculated at P-value of .047 which is under the .05 confidence interval and shows that our data is significent.  Following this finding, we opt to accept the alternate hypothesis, in which the leg will respond less once the Lidocaine was injected due to its sodium channel blocking capabilities.  According to Chen et al. (2000), the addition of Lidocaine which blocks sodium channels does in fact lower the flow of sodium into the cell, which consequently makes it harder to reach an Action Potential since there is generally less depolarization in the axon [Chen: 2000].  Our data compliments and supports both Chen’s and our previous assumptions that the effect of Lidocaine on the depolarization of axons due to constricting the flow of sodium would ultimately have negative effects on the strength of response from the frog legs (Amps).  Although the average difference of response between the controll and treatment legs was roughly .1 A, the second leg tested exhibited a differential of nearly .2 A.  However odd this response seems to exhibit, we were able to mitigate its effect on our data by averaging the responses per leg, and by taking the standard deviation.  Some errors that may have occurred include the following: not injecting the full dose of Lidocaine into the muscle – perhaps over penetrating the muscle, or not going deep enough, not waiting long enough for the Lidocaine to really take effect on the muscles response – and or not waiting a standardized amount of time, lastly we may not have had the leg tied at a perfect 90 degree angle throughout the study and it may have been too tight or loose throughout – it was not a standardized as it could have been.  Each of these potential errors could have led to skewed results in our data.  More specifically, not getting the full dose into the muscle would lead to less sodium channels being blocked and therefore less of an effect of the numbing agent that is Lidocaine.  If this was to occur then the action potential would not be as hindered as expected, leading to an intermediary value between the full treatment and the controll.  Getting such a value would skew our data and could potentially lead to inaccurate results.  Additionally, similar result skewing effects may have occurred due to the non-standardization of both the waiting time and the set-up of the leg.  If we were to run this experiment again, then we should ensure that the leg is left for at least 7 minutes to allow the Lidocaine to take full effect, also during the setup we can make sure each piece of string is the same length, and the angle can be measured to make sure it is as close to 90 degrees as possible.  Our study shows that Lidocaine does indeed work as advertised as a numbing agent.  It is able to achieve this affect due to its sodium blocking capabilities, and the reason why it works as a numbing agent is because it decreases signaling (through action potentials) and therefore lowers muscle response to stimulation in the affected area.  This compound is deemed very useful in many medical procedures because it effectively numbs a specific area.  Although Lidocaine is a very well-known and often used compound, it would be interesting to see similar experimentation to ours done at a higher level, perhaps to see if it has any other effects on biological systems.
