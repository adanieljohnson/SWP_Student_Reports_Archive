Title: Effects of Food on Intraspecific Behaviors for Male Betta splendens

Abstract:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior in which one can learn about intraspecific or interspecific behaviors. Interspecific behavior are the interactions with different species whereas intraspecific are the interactions between two of the same species. Male Betta splendens, also known as the Siamese fighting fish or Betta fish, tend to be aggressive towards other male Betta fish. However, when Betta fish and its mirror image were tested in the presence of food, the male Betta fish retreated to the food instead of continuing to display aggressive behavior [Bols:1979][Hogan:1974]. Therefore, if two male Betta fish are placed in the same tank with food, then they will retreat to the food and not display the most aggressive behavior known as “red mane.” When not given food, the fish expressed on average a longer duration of time for “red mane” than when presented with food. However, the results did not prove statistically significant. These results indicate that animal behavior is not always guaranteed, each animal can respond differently within set situations. 

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior which incorporates natural history, lab methods and theories from a multitude of species such as ecology, genetics and evolutionary biology [Johnson: 2018]. When analyzing behaviors, each action are not thought of in isolation, but how they have been shaped by evolution and selection. Additionally, they cannot be interpreted through human lens. The interpretations are gathered through patient observation in labs and their natural habitat. Betta splendens are the species under patient observation and are known for their colorful bodies and aggressive behavior. Their aggressive behavior is initiated toward other males and displayed through a multitude of bodily signals. When viewing their interaction with another of their species it is known as intraspecific behavior. They have two main types of movements: broadside and facing. During broadside movements, their side is turned to the threat and portray aggressive behaviors through moving certain fins or tails. Pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing are all examples of aggressive behaviors [Johnson, 2018]. For facing behaviors, the most threatening is a combination of protruding their pectoral fins and branchiostegal membrane, along with spreading their opercula. This creates what is known as a “red mane.” Aggressive behaviors are known as agonistic behaviors. Responses to these behaviors can vary. Their competitor can ignore it, flee, submit or escalate. All behaviors play a role in reproductive fitness. Multiple test indicate that Betta fish will retreat their aggressive behavior toward their mirror image when food is presented [Bols:1979][Hogan:1974]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that if food is given in the presence of another male Betta fish, then they both should retreat to the presented food rather than continuing to express “red mane”. 

Materials and Methods:
The fish were set in a tank with dividers to separate each individual fish. First, one of the dividers was taken away so only two male Betta fish would interact for three minutes with no food. The amount of time red mane was held was recorded along with the amount of times it was shown. Once the time was up, the divider was placed in the tank again, separating both fish. In a separate tank, the same steps were repeated with different male Betta fish. Testing the second pair of fish allowed the first pair to have a break prior to testing their interaction with food. Their total break period was five minutes. Each pair had a total of two interactions. Once the second pair of fish were tested and results recorded, along with the first set of fish having five-minute break period, a pinch of food was placed in the original tank once the divider was lifted. The same was done to the second pair of fish. A paired two tailed t-test was used to determine significance. 

Results:
As portrayed in Figure 1, the Betta fish who were not given food expressed cumulatively longer time for red mane. The average seconds for the control group was 88.25±94.60 seconds. The average amount of times red mane was presented was 3±3.2 separate times within the three minutes. While the groups who were presented with food expressed red mane for 26.5±38.69 seconds. The average amount of times the red mane was presented was 2.5±3.3 separate occasions. However, the results for time were not statistically significant (df:3, t-value: 1.778, p-value: 0.1734). Through observation, the first set of fish without food were very aggressive with one another and their tendency decreased when food was present for they were not as aggressive with food. The second set of fish, one of which displayed some aggression while the other did not. With the presence of food, neither showed red mane. However, the second fish in the second group who showed no signs of aggression throughout the total six minutes ate the most when the food was present in the last three minutes.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was rejected because although the time of aggressive behavior lowered, it was not a significant change in behavior for the Betta splendens once food was presented. The first set of fish were more active than the second, therefore, inferring that they may have been more naturally aggressive. The large standard deviation occurred because one fish never showed their red mane and its partner not as long as each fish from the first set. This behavior can be explained for when Betta fish grapple with their jaws interlocked sinking to the bottom of the floor and will remain there for a few seconds. They will release each other for surface air once cues have been presented. They will only begin to grapple again once they are both submerged [Johnson: 2018]. This type of fair and mutual interaction is further exemplified through food in this experiment. In the first set of fish, they both chose to escalate the other’s behavior by ultimately expressing red mane, the most aggressive behavior. With food, they did not always retreat from the aggressive behavior as they were both submerged underwater distracted to dominate the fight. In the second set of fish, one of the fish chose to flee resulting in no red mane while the other did present some red mane. The fair interaction was exemplified during the second interaction while the first fish ate food along the water surface and the second fish who originally expressed some red mane, no longer exhibited aggressive behavior towards the other for he was not fully submerged. For future experiments possibly using more fish with slightly longer interaction times can offer a more accurate prediction of standard behaviors for beta fish.
