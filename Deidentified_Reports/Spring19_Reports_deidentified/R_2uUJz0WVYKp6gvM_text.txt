Title: The Effects of Hormones on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
	In this experiment, the growth development was evaluated between Manduca sexta that received a growth hormone, and Manduca that did not. The development process in Manduca larvae is essential for the transition from larvae, to pupal, to adult. The expectation was that the added hormone would increase Manduca growth faster than the Manduca without the hormone. Our data showed no significent difference between the two groups, but the data supported our hypothesis.  This suggests that the IG regulator did increase the M. sexta growth, and aids in the development process of the insects.

Introduction:
This experiment investigates and evaluates the effects of the IG regulator hormone on the development of Manduca Sexta. During development, M. sexta enter a period known as molting, which allows them to change in size, and separates the larval, pupal, and adult stages. These stages are controllled by the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. When the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are present in an insect in the larval stage, it will molt and form a cuticle layer that allows for the insect  to carry out synthesis, and thus change its shape [J. H. Willis: 1981]. The hormone given, IG regulator, is known to interfere with development and lead to molting disturbances [S. G. Salokhe, et al: 2010].  In this experiment, the Manduca larvae were given an added IG regulator to their food to observe the effects it would have on their development through the larval stage. The expectation was that the added hormone would increase the growth of the Manduca larvae rapidly, and allow for them to enter the pupal and adult stages much quicker than without the hormone.

Materials and Method:
	This experiment investigates and evaluates the effects of the IG regulator hormone on the development of Manduca Sexta. During development, M. sexta enter a period known as molting, which allows them to change in size, and separates the larval, pupal, and adult stages. These stages are controllled by the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. When the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are present in an insect in the larval stage, it will molt and form a cuticle layer that allows for the insect  to carry out synthesis, and thus change its shape [J. H. Willis: 1981]. The hormone given, IG regulator, is known to interfere with development and lead to molting disturbances [S. G. Salokhe, et al: 2010].  In this experiment, the Manduca larvae were given an added IG regulator to their food to observe the effects it would have on their development through the larval stage. The expectation was that the added hormone would increase the growth of the Manduca larvae rapidly, and allow for them to enter the pupal and adult stages much quicker than without the hormone.

Results:
After completing the experiment, the average of the length change of the Manduca that received the IG regulator was 45.875, whereas the average for the controll was 22.375 (Fig. 1). As for the weight, the average for the IG regulator was 11.08875, and the controll had an average of 4.95 (Fig. 2).  The standard deviation for the length of the experimental group was 12.323 and the controll group was 4.498 (Fig. 1).  The standard deviation for the weight of the experimental group was 3.228, and the controll group was 0.522 (Fig. 2).  We used a statistical t_test to determine if the results were significent or not.  The p_value for the height was 0.000317, which is far from significent. The p_value for weight was 0.00207, which is also far from significent. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the Manduca would grow faster when given the IG regulator hormone, was supported by our results. However, there was no significent difference between the two groups.  It is possible that the results were a coincidence, since there is no obvious significance between the controll and the experimental group.  This is most likely a coincidence because in recent studies, it was shown that the IG regulator inhibits molting in insects, and disturbs their molting process [S. G. Sahloke: 2010]. Since the Manduca grew more rapidly when given the growth hormone, it can be assumed that the IG regulator aids growth, however since the results were not significent between each other, it is not possible to say that the growth hormone is the reason that they grew faster.
