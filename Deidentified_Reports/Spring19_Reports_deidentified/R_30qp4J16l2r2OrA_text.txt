Title: The Impact of Tubocurarine on Stimulating the Gastrocnemius of Legs of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Neural impulses sent through the sciatic nerve allows for the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle within the leg of a frog. In order to understand how the nervous system is affected by drugs inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle, an experiment with the addition of tubocurarine was performed. The experimental hypothesis stated that if tubocurarine is added to the frog leg, then the threshold of the voltage that will excite the leg will increase. 0.1 Ml of 1 m of tubocurarine was inserted into the frog legs and the threshold of the legs with the drug were compared against the threshold of the same frog legs before the insertion. There was no statistical significance between the controll and treatment groups meaning that the insertion of 0.1 Ml of 1 m of tubocurarine did not affect the contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle in the Rania pipiens frog leg. This biologically happens due to the blockage of neurotransmitters, which ultimately block the signal being sent to the muscle to contract.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is used by animals in order to respond to stimuli within milliseconds, and is crucial to the survival and homeostasis of the animal. Each body has three major muscle groups cardiac, smooth and skeletal muscle. In order to contract a muscle, the central nervous system sends electrical signals through motor neurons that cause an action potential to flood the muscle with calcium, which causes the contraction (Johnson: 2018). In a frog leg, the sciatic nerve is responsible for the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. When the sciatic nerve is stimulated through electrical pulses, the muscle twitches. The accumulation of twitches, also known as summation, allows for a larger contraction (Johnson: 2018). However, muscles can be affected by excitatory and inhibitory drugs within the muscle itself. Tubocurarine is a drug that when inserted into the muscle, will block ACh from binding to its receptors and therefore block the action potential from being sent. When the action potential is inhibited, the motor neurons are not stimulated and therefore do not travel to the muscle for the contraction. This blocks the muscle from receiving the impulses from the motor neurons and therefore won’t twitch. Many experiments have been done that follow the impact of tubocurarine on skeletal muscle. In a study from the Japanese Journal of Physiology, experimenters isolated rabbit and frog skeletal muscle and observed how both caffeine and tubocurarine affected the muscle. The experimenters noted that the tubocurarine notably inhibited the peak tensions of each twitch and ultimate tetanus of the muscle. (Takauji: 1975). The objective of this lab is to explore the properties of the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog when stimulated with differing voltages in order to find its threshold, then observing how the addition of tubocurarine affects the threshold of the frog leg. The experimental hypothesis states that if tubocurarine is added to the frog leg, then the threshold of the voltage that will excite the leg will increase. 

Materials and Method:
Using a frog leg, the sciatic nerve was isolated and in contact with the tips of an electrode. The gastrocnemus was also isolated through dissection and kept taught and at 90 to the leg in order to clearly see any movement from the electrical impulses. The controll group consisted of 3 frog legs, each stimulated with a range of volts until their threshold for excitement, the lowest possible voltage that showed a visible twitch within the gastrocnemus, was found. Then the same frog legs were used as a treatment group, by adding  0.1 Ml of 1 m of tubocurarine to the gastrocnemus muscle and waiting five minutes. Using the same legs for both treatment and controll was important because each leg has a different threshold for excitation, and so to maintain clear and accurate results, we must use the same legs and compare thresholds on each. After waiting five minutes for the tubocurarine to diffuse throughout the muscle, the threshold for excitement in the treatment leg was found. A paired t_test will be used to compare the threshold of excitement for the controll frog legs to their respective treatment legs and determine the mean difference between the two groups in order to understand if there was a statistically significent difference between them. The error that was found between groups was due to fatigue and apparatus.  

Results:
It was possible to see excitation of the frog legs both before and after through twitches of the legs. The p_value for the three legs within the paired t_test was 0.867, the t-value was 0.189 and the degrees of freedom was 2. 

Discussion:
The experimental hypothesis states that when the tubocurarine is added to the frog leg, then the threshold of the voltage needed to excite the leg will increase. The p_value calculated for the data was 0.867, and so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there was a difference between the controll and treatment groups. The error bars did not overlap; however, we cannot take too much account into the error bars because there were minuscule differences within the individual contractions. Instead, these error bars show that there was little fatigue within the gastrocnemus muscle between shocks. The frog legs in this experiment did not follow a similar pattern to that of the frog legs studied in Effect of Dantrolene Sodium on Excitation/Contraction coupling in Frog Skeletal Muscle. In this experiment, dantrolene sodium’s effect on the skeletal muscle was compared to that of both caffeine and tubocurarine. The frog legs injected with tubocurarine showed to have inhibited ability to function in comparison to the legs before they were impacted by the drug (Takauji: 1975). This inhibited ability was due to the neurotransmitters not being able to send their signal because of blockage of ACh. The blocking of ACh means the motor neurons will never being stimulated and cannot relay the information for the muscle to contract. The research done in 1975 having different results to those found in the experiment performed in this lab is important because it shows our data had much error. It could have been due to a plethora of reasons. First, it is possible that 5 minutes did not allow for enough time for the tubocurarine to fully set in. The apparatus could not have been wet enough, we may not have had enough frog legs to test and more. The results of this experiment provide the experimenter with further research questions such as what would happen if the same amount of tubocurarine was added, but the waiting period to let the drug set in was increased. Would the frog legs show significance between results? This experiment provides an excellent example to show how impactful the nervous system is within the animal kingdom. They allow for the muscle movements and responses needed to maintain life each and every day.
