Title: JH hormone inhibition in Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Despite being obviously very different from humans, insect larvae have many analogous features to Homo Sapiens. Knowledge can be gained from this, such as our study of hormone control and development. Here we study the effects of inhibiting a crucial hormone in development for Manduca Sexta larvae, juvenile Hormone (JH). Since this hormone has been associated with overall growth, it was expected that the experimental group that received the JH blocker would grow significantly less than the control group. The data collected from this lab showed a significant difference between the two groups. This points to affirm our expectation that the loss of JH in larvae would stall their growth and development by means of weight. In conjunction with our observation on none of the experimental group caterpillars pupating while one of the control caterpillars pupated, this observation further supports that the loss of JH hinders development. These findings illustrate the importance of relative levels of JH during larvae development

Introduction:
The focus of our study was the observe the importance of hormones in insect growth by inhibiting JH hormone in Manduca sexta larvae. Hormones such as JH can cause drastic changes in insect larvae. Such changes can be as radical as an insect digesting its insides into a protein rich liquid in order to start development into an adult from scratch. [Locke, 1981] Mammals likewise have significant changes due to hormone production such as the transition of adolescence to adulthood in humans. While humans do not change body shape and function within a month, hormones control our daily lives and regulate crucial bodily functions. One example is the adrenal glands which regulate blood glucose levels and the speed of heartbeats in the presence of a threat or dangerous situation[deBobo, 1962]. Failure or overproduction of certain hormones can lead to deadly cancers or life threatening conditions. [Clarke, 1989]The Manduca Sexta caterpillar is well known in the study of hormones due to the relative simplicity of its development. More specifically, its molting is triggered by only three main hormones, hormones which can be easily manipulated. JH is one of these hormones in all stage of life in Manduca Sexta which relates to overall growth stimulation. Studies have found that the raised relative levels of JH in the presence of lower ecdysterone concentration at the end of the 5th instar larvae is the triggering mechanism for molting. [Ismail, 2000] The larvae in this study are given a JH blocker and evaluated by weight to measure development by as a proxy. As JH is a large driving force in overall growth, and needed to produce the commitment pulse, manipulation of JH levels should interfere significantly with the development of larvae. Decreasing the amount of JH in Manduca Sexta will negatively impact the development of the caterpillars. 



Materials and Methods:
The eight caterpillars studied in this experiment were split into two groups, four being a control group and the others being the experimental group. Each caterpillar was placed in an individual partition of a box divided into four chambers. Each caterpillar received their own food daily for 15 days. The control group received a standard diet with 5 drops of water to moisten the food. The experiment likewise received the same diet but with 5 drops of a JH blocker solution. The food was replaced daily. Along with being fed, each caterpillarâ€™s weight was measured in grams using a standard laboratory scale. At the conclusion of 15 days, the average weight of each group studied was calculated. From this, a two sample t test was used to determine the P value to determine if the two groups studied were significantly different.. The standard deviation of each group was calculated as well. 

Results:
The mean weight of mass for the control group was 3.57 grams. The mean weight of mass for the experimental group was 1.82 grams. The p value of our T test was 0.0398 for a one tailed hypothesis and 0.0797 for a two tailed hypothesis. This shows that the two groups were significantly different. Standard deviation for the control and experimental groups were 1.162 and 1.183 respectively. As each group of caterpillars were eating during the 15 days, both groups grew in size. However, the second control group caterpillar pupated around the 13th day while the third experimental caterpillar had died around the 12th day. 



Discussion:
Due to the P value of our T test being below 0.05, our hypothesis was supported. This P value shows that the two studied groups were significantly different. When attempting to recreate this experiment, it is recommended to study the caterpillars for a longer amount of time. In addition to this, it is also recommended that larger study groups should be used. This would give larger data pools which in turn would allow more conclusive statements to be made When considering the qualitative data, more speculations can be made from this experiment. In addition to the experimental group weighing less than the control group, the experimental group had a caterpillar die while the control group had one caterpillar pupate. As the effects on pupation from JH was not studied in this experiment, no conclusions can be made. However, it does stand to reason that JH inhibition may be fatal or at the very least block pupation. Past studies have come to this conclusion. [Beckage, 2004] Follow up studies are recommended to verify the efficacy of these claims.
