Title: The effects of juvenile hormone, in the form of Gentrol, consumption on the growth of Manduca sexta larva

Abstract:
Many pesticides interfere with the hormonal patterns in pests to prevent them from damaging crops. Gentrol is a pesticide used on the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) and works by inhibiting the caterpillar’s ability to decrease its juvenile hormone (JH) levels, thus preventing it from metamorphizing into its adult moth form which damages crops. In this experiment, we compared the growth of M. sexta caterpillars that consumed Gentrol and those that did not. The controll group of caterpillars were given a mixture of food and water, and the treatment group of caterpillars were given a mixture of food and Gentrol. Their change in their lengths and masses were compared, and the Gentrol group had a greater change in both masses and lengths. This supports our alternative hypothesis that caterpillars fed Gentrol will experience different growth patterns than the caterpillars fed only food and water.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, is a worm that metamorphizes into a moth after completing its larval and pupal stages. A typical M. sexta lifespan ranges between 39 and 48 days. Its adult moth form is considered a pest, and various pesticides have been developed to prevent it from damaging crops. Gentrol is one of these pesticides. The active ingredient in Gentrol Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) Concentrate is (S)-Hydroprene, at a 9.0% concentrate, which disrupts the worm’s lifecycle [Arthur]. Without the addition of IGRs, M. sexta uses hormones to metamorph. Specifically, it increases production of ecdysterone (20E) and decreases production of juvenile hormone (JH). Gentrol disrupts the worm’s growth by increasing its JH levels [Kiguchi]. With the presence of JH, M. sexta does not reach its commitment point at which metamorphosis occurs. Our null hypothesis is that the growth rate of M. sexta in the presence and absence of Gentrol will be the same. Our alternative hypothesis is that the growth rate between M. sexta in the presence and absence of Gentrol will differ. The independent variable is the growth of the caterpillars, and the dependent variable is the presence or absence of Genrol.

Materials and Method:
We kept the Maduca sexta caterpillars in chambered containers, each container had 4 chambers, and 1 caterpillar was kept in each chamber for a total of 8 caterpillars in 2 containers. Each caterpillar was given a mixture of 10g food with 6 drops of Gentrol. We added this mixture to each chamber. At the start of the experiment, we recorded the lengths and masses of each caterpillar. Every day for 7 days, we checked on the caterpillars and added more food/Gentrol mixture into the chambers if there was none left and cleaned the chambers. After the 7-day period, we recorded the lengths and masses of the caterpillars again and removed the leftover food from their chambers. We added 10g of food mixed with 6 drops of Gentrol to each of the chambers. For another 7-day period, we checked on the caterpillars daily, fed them the food/Gentrol mixture, and cleaned the chambers. After this 7-day period, we recorded their masses and lengths again and ended the experiment. We repeated these steps for the controll group but replaced the 6 drops of Gentrol with 6 drops of water.

Results:
The average change of length in the Gentrol group was 45.625mm and the average change of length in the controll group was 23mm [Figure 1]. The average change in mass in the Gentrol group was 9.17g and the average change in mass in the controll group was 4.95g [Figure 2]. 

Discussion:
The average change of length in the Gentrol group was 45.625mm and the average change of length in the controll group was 23mm [Figure 1]. The average change in mass in the Gentrol group was 9.17g and the average change in mass in the controll group was 4.95g [Figure 2]. Our two-tailed p_value for the caterpillar masses was 1.80E-8, and our two-tailed p_value for the caterpillar lengths was 2.19E-5. Our results suggest that we have sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis and accept our alternative hypothesis that the growth rate between M. sexta in the presence and absence of Gentrol differ. In future experiments, we could use similar method to test whether different pesticides that interfere with other hormonal functions in pests result in similar outcomes in M. sexta. We could also use similar method to test the effects of Gentrol on different organisms or see whether or not Gentrol effects adult M. sexta moths.
