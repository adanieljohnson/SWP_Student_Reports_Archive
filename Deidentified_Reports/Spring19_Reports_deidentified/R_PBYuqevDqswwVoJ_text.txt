Title: Salt water solution effect on Nerve and Muscle Functions in the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens leg

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment is to determine the basic properties of neuromuscular controll. This will be explored using the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve in the Rania pipiens leg. Three frog legs were first tested without a saltwater injection, acting as a controll group. The same three frog legs will be injected with a solution of salt water which contains 5 mg of salt in 100 Ml of water. The three injected frog legs acted as the experimental group for this investigation. The injected frog legs were then tested, allowing for differences between the experimental group and the controll group to be determined. After conducting the experiment, the average voltage generated by the controll frog legs is 0.46 V +/- 0.07571 V. The average voltage generated by the experimental frog legs (exposed to salt water) is 0.10 V +/- 0.03 V. The salt water solution injected into the gastrocnemus muscle caused the Direct Muscle Response (V) to be weaker than the Direct Muscle Response (V) of the controll group.
The hypothesis for this investigation is that, when the gastrocnemus muscle in the frog leg is injected with 5 mg of salt in 100 Ml of water, the relative strength of the contraction will be weaker because there will be a higher Na+ concentration in the nerve cells.


Introduction:
In animals and insects, movement is vital for the survival of the specific organism. Movement allows animals and insects to find food, nutrients, exercise, find new territory, and find mates. Movement is controllled through the collaboration of muscles and nerves throughout the organism’s body. The animal used in this investigation is the Rania pipiens. R. pipiens is found in grasslands, brushland, and forest of the United States and Canada. R. pipiens is a small green/brown frog, growing between 5 and 11 cm with dark round spots. Its’ belly is typically white or cream, and there is a white stripe under its jaw [Fryer, 2001]. The specific muscle and nerve investigated in this experiment is the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve in R. pipiens leg. The gastrocnemus muscle is one of the bigger, stronger muscles present in an organism, controllling leg movement. Another term used to refer to the gastrocnemus muscle is the calf, which is in the lower part of the leg. The gastrocnemus muscle is a skeletal muscle which means it is attached to a bone within the frog leg. Skeletal muscle consists of myofibers which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, and faced-aggregate. Axons of motor neurons extend into a muscle, and then branch out to innervate several myofibers. This occurs at points called neuromuscular junctions. A nerve stimulates a muscular contraction through a process called excitation-contraction coupling. In this, nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction and cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binds to its receptor, opening sodium channels. The opening of the sodium channels allows for an action potential to be generated within the specific muscle. The action potential stimulates the release of calcium (Ca2+) ion from storage sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating the contractile mechanism in the muscle fiber [Sengupta, 2010]. 
The hypothesis for this investigation is that, when the gastrocnemus muscle in the frog leg is injected with 5 mg of salt in 100 Ml of water, the relative strength of the contraction will be weaker because there will be a higher Na+ concentration in the nerve cells.


Materials and Method:
The first step of this experiment is to skin three different R. pipiens legs to allow their relative contraction strengths to be determined. Then one must cut one end of the gastrocnemus muscle and tie it to a string which is attached to the elevated clamp. After this, one must pin each leg down using metal spikes. Then one must attach the metal probes to the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg. The settings for the electrical impulse is 1V, 0 pulses, frequency 1, and a pulse width of 5 ms. Once these settings are put into the program, one must run the program, sending an electrical impulse through the frog leg. Once this data is collected, one can create a controll myogram for each of the three frog legs. Once the controll myograms are obtained, inject the frog legs with 2 Ml of a mixture of saline solution containing 5 mg of salt in 100 Ml of water. Then one must, reattach the medal probes to the gastrocnemus muscle. Following this one must send the electrical impulse through the gastrocnemus muscle, using the same settings as listed above. This data allows for the myograms of the experimental group to be determined. The statistical test used in this experiment was a one-sample T-test.

Results:
When an electrical charge was applied to the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg, the whole frog leg would twitch. When the experimental group frog legs were injected with salt water, the experimental frog legs became more turgid than the controll frog legs. Consequently, the size of the twitch following the electrical charge was much smaller than the twitch generated within the controll group frog legs. The average voltage generated by the gastrocnemus muscle in the controll frog leg one is 0.36 V, for controll leg two the average was 0.50 V, and for controll leg three the average was 0.48 V. The average voltage generated by the gastrocnemus muscle in the experimental frog leg (exposed to salt water) one is 0.13 V, for experimental frog leg two the average is 0.10 V, and for experimental frog leg three the average is 0.07 V. The average voltage generated by the controll group of frog legs is 0.45 V +/- 0.07571 V. The average voltage generated by the frog legs in the experimental group is 0.1 V +/- 0.03 V. For this experiment, a one-sample t_test was used to analyze the results obtained. The degrees of freedom obtained was 2. The t-value obtained was 5.935594. Finally, the p_value for this experiment is 0.02723. 

Discussion:
In this experiment, the data obtained from the statistical test showed that the data was statistically significent. The data is statistically significent because the P-value obtained is 0.02723, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis for this experiment is rejected and the alternate hypothesis is supported. This means that the addition of salt water to the gastrocnemus muscle weakens the direct muscle response when stimulated by an electrical charge, compared to the controll group of frog legs, that was not injected with a salt water solution. The reason behind the gastrocnemus muscles injected with salt water having a lower direct muscle response than the gastrocnemus muscles without salt water present in them is because the salt water solution increases the Na+ concentration within the muscle. This effects the concentration gradient of the sodium-potassium pump by increasing the concentration of Na+ within the muscle. The increased Na+ in the sodium-potassium pump comes from the injected sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. This higher sodium concentration in the muscles weakens the action potential generated by the gastrocnemus muscle because there is a lower amount of potassium relative to sodium. The weaker action potential generated causes the direct muscle response to be weaker than the direct muscle response generated by the gastrocnemus muscle without injected salt water [Sengupta, 2010]. An application of this investigation to the real world could potentially be that salt water could be a way to help muscles return to a relaxated state after intense exercise. This could assist people who train intensively regularly, by preventing muscle cramps and muscle soreness. The salt water injections would weaken the muscular contractions after exercise, helping the muscle relax.
