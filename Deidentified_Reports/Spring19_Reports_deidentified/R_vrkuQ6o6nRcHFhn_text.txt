Title: Influence of Juvenile Hormone on the growth and development of Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
The influence of Juvenile Hormone (JH) is tested by artificially increasing levels of the hormone in Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The results of the hormone’s effect are compared to a controll group and it is determined that it is effective at stagnating the Manduca Sexta lifecycle and development. This is concept is important to understanding the effects of hormones in other organisms such as humans.

Introduction:
Just like humans and all other complex life, insects rely on hormones to signal biological change for survival. Hormones can serve various biological functions such as altering heart rate, stimulating sexual development, inducing growth, or signaling for progression of an organism’s lifecycle. The hormones that influence insects such as Manduca Sexta are different than those of other organisms, but they serve many of the same purposes. One hormone that is very important to Manduca Sexta is Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH functions with other hormones to determine when Manduca Sexta should progress through their lifecycle and pupate. Many case studies have been done to observe JH’s effect on Manduca Sexta when they are in a larval state, and it is often determined that the JH in Manduca Sexta typically follows a pattern that, if disrupted, also disrupts the normal lifecycle of the organism [Nijhout: 1982]. The following experiment was devised to compare the weight change of two groups of Manduca Sexta that were treated in nearly indentical conditions over time: one group had artificially increased JH levels from outside influence, and one was a controll group that was no given addition hormones. Each group was kept at ideal temperatures in an incubator, fed the same quantity of food, and only differed by the presence or absence of 6 drops of JH in their food each day. It was determined that if Manduca Sexta are exposed to an excess of Juvenile Hormone, then the progression through their expected lifecycle will stagnate and they will remain in their juvenile state with little change in weight.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca Sexta in larval stages were selected from a large group. Each caterpillar was assigned to an isolated section of a plastic container for ease of identification and to reduce room for error from confounding variables. Each day, all caterpillars had waste removed from their plastic container, had their weights recorded, and then was supplied with 10g of the same food supply. The only variable in this experiment was that an experimental group of four of the eight caterpillars regularly had six drops of JH added to their food supply. After this, the plastic containers were returned to an incubator until the next day. This routine continued for 12 days, and all data on the caterpillar weights was collected in a spreadsheet. The average weights for each controll and experimental group were then applied to a two-tailed two-sample t_test to determine if the difference in weight changes was significent from a P value of 0.05.

Results:
The average weight change over time in each controll group was about 8.895g, but the experimental groups saw little change over time at 3.193g on average. The health of the experimental caterpillars quickly deteriorated and resulted in 3 of the 4 experimental caterpillars dying by the end of the experiment. This issue was not present in the controll caterpillars. Upon doing a two-tailed two-sample t_test for the completed data, the t-value, degrees freedom, and P value were determined as (2.660, 1, 0.037). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that artificially increased JH levels in Manduca Sexta caterpillars affects development based on weight change is supported by this experiment because the average weight change of controll-group caterpillars over the experiment is significently larger than that of the experimental group. This claim can be verified by the P value, which was calculated the be below the required 0.05 value at 0.037. The influence of JH limiting lifecycle progressing in Menduca Sexta seems entirely possible from these results. However, potential issues were present throughout the experiment. For example, three of the four experimental caterpillars died during the experiment which removed their capacity to gain or lose weight. These experimental caterpillars regularly at their entire food supply, so it can be determined that the deaths of the caterpillars came from either a pre-existing condition, or from complications due to excessive JH in the caterpillars. This alternate result from JH may have yielded the same results that we expected, but it involved results that were not expected such as caterpillars dying. It cannot be said for sure if the experimental caterpillars would have continued growing with the controll group had they survived longer. Other studies and experiments have also determined that excessive presence of JH can actually stimulate growth in Manduca Sexta rather than decreasing growth like this experiment found [Rountree: 1986]. To increase the accuracy and precision of results with this experiment in the suture, it would be ideal to repeat the experiment with many more groups of caterpillars that were carefully raised and monitored earlier in their life as to prevent preexisting health issues from killing caterpillars or disrupting the data. It would also be ideal to prolong the experiment for more than 12 days. Proving the influence of insect hormones such as JH has the potential to increase understanding in human hormones and how to utilize them better in fields such as medicine.
