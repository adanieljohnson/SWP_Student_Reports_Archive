Title: The effect of Juvenile hormone mimic in the diet of Manduca Sexta larva

Abstract:
The Juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta is vital for their pupation into adulthood. Manduca are known to produce different amounts of the hormone depending on what larval stage they are in, influencing their growth and the timing of pupation. Sixteen Manduca Caterpillars were split into two groups, one group of eight being fed food mixed with a solution of Juvenile Hormone mimic derived from Ageratum Houstiniaum and one group being fed food mixed with only water. The group who were fed food containing the Juvenile hormone mimic weighed significently more than the controll group, but unlike the controll group, none of the caterpillars from the group fed the hormone mimic had begun to pupate. The takeaway from this is that in late pupal stages, the Juvenile hormone promotes growth but prevents the larva from pupating.

Introduction:
Hormones play a vital role in all organism’s development from a juvenile to an adult. For insects, who often go through extremely transformative larval stages, hormone disruptions in youth can have massive consequences for their maturity into adulthood. Manduca sexta is a species of caterpillar who is no outlier to this statement. The Juvenile hormone found in Manduca is known to be vital in determining the timing of pupation into adulthood [Nijhout, Williams 1974], and the timing of its presence in the larva seem to have an effect on the larva’s growth and ability to progress through its larval stages [Fain, Riddiford 1975]. This experiment will seek to discover how the introduction of blue floss flower (Ageratum Houstiniaum), a known JH hormone mimicker, into the caterpillar’s diet will affects their growth as caterpillars and their pupation into adult form. Our hypothesis is that the caterpillars who eat the food containing floss flower will have significently different weight than the caterpillars who are not fed food containing floss flower.


Materials and Method:
Sixteen Manduca caterpillars of various weights and lengths were selected, all being about one to two weeks old. Four trays with separations into four separate quadrants were used to rear the caterpillars, each caterpillar was given its own quadrant with its own food supply. Eight caterpillars were given food mixed with six drops of 1: 1250 solution of a juvenile hormone mimic derived from Ageratum houstoniaum, these caterpillars made up the experimental group. The other eight were given food mixed with six drops of pure water, these eight made up the controll group. The caterpillars were then held in an incubation chamber for fourteen days, having their quadrants cleaned and food stores replenished every few days. The caterpillar’s weights were measured prior to and after the fourteen-day incubation. Two-tailed T-tests were used to analyze the difference between the controll group and the experimental group in weight.


Results:
There was a significent difference between the controll and the treatment groups in weight (t = 1.8, d.f. = 14, p = 0.093)                                      


Discussion:
	The results of this experiment supported the hypothesis. There was a significent difference in weight between the experimental and the controll groups, with the caterpillars who were fed food containing the juvenile hormone mimic being on average the much heavier of the two groups. There was another difference however, as the caterpillars in the controll group had begun pupating into adults, but the caterpillars who were fed juvenile hormone mimic had not begun to pupate. This evidence suggests that Juvenile hormone has the main effect of stimulating growth in Manduca sexta, while simultaneously hindering the caterpillars from pupating. These findings seem to coincide with the findings of other research, which also suggested that the hormone has a hand in determining when caterpillars decide to pupate [Nijhout, Williams 1974]. It would be interesting to expand the research on this topic to possibly cover how different timings of introduction of Juvenile hormone into the diet of Manduca would affect the caterpillars. For example, a future experiment could compare the effects of introducing the hormone mimic into the diet in the first instar stage against introducing it at later stages. This would allow researchers to determine when introduction of the hormone mimic has the most effect in a negative manor for the caterpillars, allowing tobacco farmers to know when is the best time to treat their crops with pesticide to protect against damage caused by Manduca larva.
