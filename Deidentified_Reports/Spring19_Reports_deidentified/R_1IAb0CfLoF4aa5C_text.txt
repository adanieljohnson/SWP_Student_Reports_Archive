Title: How aggressive behavior changes based on fish tank size in Betta splendins 

Abstract:
Animals interact with their environments and other organisms in order to optimize survival and reproductive success. An example of this is through intraspecific agnostic behaviors; displays in the presence of other members of their species, such as aggressive behaviors. We studied Betta splendins, a common aquarium fish, because of their colorful displays when in the presence of other male betta fish. We tested the impact on different tank size on the amount of aggressive behaviors a fish would display when in the presence of another male. We hypothesized that there would be more aggressive behaviors in the smaller tank than in larger and medium sized tanks. To test this, we placed 2 male betta fish in small, medium, and large tanks and measured every display of aggression. There were more aggressive behaviors in smaller tanks than in medium or large tanks. However, our hypothesis was not statistically supported because compared to an alpha value of 0.05, the p_value was 0.086. It is beneficial to understand how species interact with other members of their species in different territory sizes because we can use this information to understand how humans encroaching on animals’ habitats will impact species. 

Introduction:
Animals interact with their environment in order to utilize time and space in a way that survival and reproduction are optimal  [Koolhaas et al. : 1980). Reproductive success and fitness in fish is highly dependent on successful resource acquisition. In many species this is associated with aggressive behavioral displays for acquiring mates and fending off competitors, which collectively lead to increased fitness (Bautista et al. : 2019). Part of this interaction is visible when animals display behaviors in response to other members of their own species when in close contact.  Intraspecific agnostic behavior is a fundamental aspect of ecological theories on resource acquisition and sexual selection (Bergman and Moore : 2003) Betta splendins, a common aquarium fish, is a great example of agnostic behaviors in action. At rest, males are a dull grayish-brown color but will change color and flare gills when excited by the presence of another male. Bettas can use intraspecific behaviors, which are displays in the presence of other members of their own species. Betta’s colorful displays make it easy to see these aggressive behaviors in operation. Male Bettas in particular are notorious for their aggressiveness [Fan et al. : 2018). Both wild and captive-bred males exhibit aggressive behaviors in defending their territories against intruding males (MacLaren et al. : 2018). We want to study the patterns of Visual Communications which regulates social interactions, particularly those associated with aggression. Bettas can perform broadside movements and facing movement. Broadside movements are displays when a fish turns its side to an opponent. Including pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. Facing movements include erecting pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and protruding branchiostegal membranes. These aggressive behaviors are called agnostic behaviors. Bettas can respond to these behaviors by ignoring it, matching, fleeing, submission, or escalation. In today's lab we will be measuring how aggressive two male Bettas are in response to differing tank size. We hypothesize that they will be more aggressive behaviors measured in the smaller tank than in the medium or large tank. 

Materials and Method:
Six male betta fish were obtained and placed into tanks with partitions so that they were not able to see each other. One fish tank was obtained into opaque dividers were placed into the two slots in the tank making three separate sections. Two fish were placed into the one of the small sections and aggressive behaviors were measured for 1 minute. Any display of broadside or facing movement was recorded as an aggressive behavior. After one minute one fish was removed and placed into one of the other sections of the tank. Fish were allowed to rest for 2 minutes. After the two minutes the partition dividing the two fish was removed and aggressive behaviors were measured for 1 minute and then medium sized tank.  After the one minute one fish was removed and placed into the other section of the tank.  Fish were allowed to rest for another 2 minutes. After the two minutes the final partition was removed and aggressive behaviors were measured for 1 minute in the large tank. After 1 minute both Fisher removed and placed into a separate tank. This procedure was repeated for two other groups of male betta fish. However, the second group started in the medium tank and moved from large, to small, to medium. The third group started in the large tank and then moved to small and then medium. 

Results:
The number of aggressive behaviors were greater in the small tank than in the medium or large tank (figure 1). The groups are not statistically significent from each other with a p_value of 0.086 when compared to an alpha value of 0.05. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not statistically significent due to the P value for the Anova test being 0.086 when compared to an alpha value of 0.05. However, the trends that we saw in the graph support our hypothesis. There were more aggressive behaviors in a small tank than in the medium and large tank (Figure 1). We would expect for there to be more aggressive behaviors in the smaller tanks because there would be more competition for territories. In nature, males establish and vigorously defend territories. In laboratory settings, males will readily attack an opponent if it encroaches on its territory (Fan et al. : 2018). Siamese fighting fish rely heavily on aggressive behaviors for territory defense and reproductive purposes. To acquire territory and mating opportunities, male betta fish compete fiercely with each other by employing well documented behavioral displays that include gill flaring, darting, finning and lateral displays during swimming (Bautista et al.: 2019). When males are in closer proximity, we would expect to see more aggressive behaviors because the males would have to compete more for survival and reproductive success because there would be less resources. In order to yield more significent results, we could run this experiment with a greater number of trials. Our results could not have been significent due to the low number of trials for each tank. It is important to understand how intraspecific behaviors are affected when the territory becomes smaller. We can use this information and apply it to the habitat reduction that humans are doing that force animals to interact with their own species in smaller areas. We can see the costs and benefits of reducing territory size on species and understand how these species will be impacted in the long run.

Figure Legends: 
The number of aggressive behaviors were counted for each group of fish in tank size the number of behaviors were 42 +/- 18.52 for the small tank, 20 +/- 11.53 for the medium, and 12.33 +/- 3.54 for the large tank. The p_value was 0.086.
