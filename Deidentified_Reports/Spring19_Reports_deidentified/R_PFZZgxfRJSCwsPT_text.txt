Title: Average Aggressive Behavior Displays per minute of Male to Male interactions between Betta Splendens shows no significant increase in the presence of a female audience

Abstract:
Betta splendens, commonly known as the betta fish or the Siamese fighting fish, is a species that is notorious for its aggressive behavior exhibited by territorial males during confrontation. These fish become territorial for mating purposes, so it was hypothesized that the presence of a female audience during a male to male confrontation would increase the rate of aggressive displays per minute. Six trial interactions were conducted, with three different male subjects and one female. Each male interacted with each male in three trials, with no female audience present. This served as the control setting. Each male also interacted again with each male in another three trials, but with the presence of a female audience. This was the experimental setting. The average of the aggressive displays per minute for the control setting (without female audience) was 10.935 ± 8.949. The average of the aggressive displays per minute for the experimental setting (with a female audience) was 25.375 ± 23.611. The averages of the control setting and the experimental setting supported the hypothesis, but the Paired T-test values concluded that the data was not of significant difference (t-stat = 1.214, df = 2, P = 0.348).


Introduction:
The study of animal behavior is an objective field that provides important information about behavior and social organization. The science of animal behavior is known as ethology [Johnson: 2018]. Developing a better understanding for the scientific facets of animal behavior and social organization can introduce us to a more accurate interpretation of the world that we live in and the species that we cohabit the earth with. In animal behavioral research, the species Betta splendens, has become a popular subject for study. More commonly known as the Betta fish, or the Siamese fighting fish, this species is notorious for the elaborate aggressive behaviors that are exhibited by the males during confrontation. Male betta fish usually experience confrontation with other males because they are a territorial species, and they compete for spaces through their aggressive confrontations [Bronstein: 1981]. When one male enters another male’s territory, that is when confrontations occur. Male betta fish typically exhibit two categories of aggressive behavior displays: broadside displays and facing movements. The male fish tend to begin their interactions with the lesser of the aggressive displays, the broadside displays. The fish then usually escalate their behaviors with the facing movements, which are the more aggressive displays. Studying the interactions between male betta fish has provided such information, and the further study of this species could introduce new information about the behavior of animals in their habitats. We hypothesize that in an interaction between two males, there will be an increase in the rate of aggressive behavior displays per minute when a female audience is introduced. 


Materials and Methods:
Three male betta fish and one female were selected as the research subjects. The female was selected randomly, but the males were selected to be of approximately the same size. The coloration of the fish was not a factor that was selected upon. Each male interacted with each male in three trials, with no female audience present. This served as the control setting. Each male also interacted again with each male in another three trials, but with the presence of a female audience. This was the experimental setting. Each trial interaction occurred in tanks of approximately the same size. The fish were observed from the start of their introduction, and each aggressive behavior that was displayed by each male fish was recorded. Each trial was timed with a cap of five minutes, yet some had to be cut short and the subjects had to be separated due to the male’s attempted harm of each other. The betta fish were allotted five-minute rest periods between each trial interaction. The primary data that was the focus in this experiment was the time that lapsed in relation to the number of aggressive behaviors that were displayed during the trial interactions. A scoring system was created and the behaviors were scored based upon their level of aggressiveness. The broadside displays included, in order of increasing aggressiveness: pelvic flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. These three displays were given 1, 2, and 3 points (in order) for each behavior observed. The facing displays included, in order of increasing aggressiveness: erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and protruding opercula (red mane). These three displays were also given 1, 2, and 3 points (in order) for each behavior observed. Two other behavioral displays that were added to the scoring system were the displays of darting and biting. Since these two behaviors were the primary escalators to interactions that required intervention, they were assigned to be worth 4 and 5 points. A total score was obtained for each interaction and the score was then averaged per minute. A paired t-test was used in order to compare the data between the control and the experimental settings. 


Results:
The trial interactions with the female audience required intervention faster than the trial interactions without the female audience. There was an increase in the rate of aggressive displays per minute when a female audience was present, as shown in Figure 1. The male fish appeared to lessen aggressive behavior after becoming injured in a previous trial interaction, but not all of the male subjects suffered injury. One male (Male 2) was observed to be continually more aggressive than the other two males. The average of the aggressive displays per minute for the control setting (without female audience) was 10.935 ± 8.949. The average of the aggressive displays per minute for the experimental setting (with a female audience) was 25.375 ± 23.611. The averages of the control setting and the experimental setting supported the hypothesis, but the Paired T-test values concluded that the data was not of significant difference (t-stat = 1.214, df = 2, P = 0.348). 


Discussion:
The results were not of significant difference and thus did not support the hypothesis. A potential reason for the insignificance of our results could be due to the discourse of our hypothesis. Another research group that observed the effect of audience on male to male interactions found that the presence of a female audience did cause an increase in aggressive displays, but specifically in the conspicuous displays (broadside displays). The number of facing displays, the more aggressive displays, had decreased in place of the higher number of broadside displays [Matos: 2002]. Our hypothesis did not specify whether both types of displays would experience an increase or a decrease, but generalized the two into one category. Creating a more specific hypothesis in the next experiment could generate more accurate results. Biological factors could also be the reason for the insignificance of the results. Research has shown that pigmentation in fish is connected to behavioral patterns [Price: 2008]. The male betta fish that we used in our trials were all of different colors. One of the males, the red male, was observed to be the most aggressive of the three fish. Even as the trial interactions progressed, this male did not decrease his aggressive behaviors as did the other two males. Infliction of injury could be another factor that explains such behavior, but the red male did not experience infliction of injury so it is difficult to draw a conclusion about the role of the injuries. To obtain a better understanding of the reason for the insignificance of our results, further research could be conducted with a hypothesis specific to the types of displays. It would also be useful to increase the number of male betta subjects, and to group and observe them based upon coloration. Further research could potentially provide important information about the behaviors of male bettas dependent on different factors, such as audience and coloration. Such information could lead to a more accurate understanding of animal behavior and social organization.

Figure 1. The average rate of aggressive displays per minute for the control (without female audience) and the experimental (with female audience) settings. The data for each setting was averaged from the rate per minute of the three control or experimental trials. The rates for each trial were obtained from the total score for the trial in relation to the time that lapsed before intervention.
