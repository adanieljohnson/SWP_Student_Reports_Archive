Title: The Impact of IGRs in the Development of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
In the development of an insect, there are many factor that play a part to make sure its development is successful. In order to understand the growth and development of such species, knowledge of their physiological aspects is necessary. From this, you can determine how and what you can alter to make their development quicker or slower; factors such as weight and length are evidence of such alteration. 

In this experiment, the objective was to determine the effect of manipulating with the juvenile hormone (JH) with IGRs to see how it would affect the growth and continuous development of the tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta). The prediction was that the Manduca sexta with its food contaminated with IGRs would have a less chance of survival. Using controlled and treated caterpillar food, we were able to test this prediction by tampering their food with IGRs and seeing if caterpillars with the treated food died quicker than the ones with controlled food.
The prediction was that the Manduca sexta with its food contaminated with IGRs would have a less chance of survival. The statistical evidence used was the p-values. The concluding p-value for the average length and the p-value for the average weight proved that there was no significant data. Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected.


Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is a multivoltine leaf feeder that grows rapidly up to 10g in the larval stage… [Reinecke: 1980]. It is a common pest found in plants; their name comes from their worm-like body shape as well as the presence of its horn [Byron: 2017]. From egg to an adult moth, it take about 39-48. The main hormones responsible for the growth and development  of the tobacco hornworm are: prothoracicotropic or brain hormone (PTTH or BH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). 20E and JH are especially essential, as if either is removed entirely, the insect dies; these two together work together to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. However, the completion of the life cycle of the tobacco hornworm depends on outside conditions, the quality of the diet available, and the average daily temperature [Johnson: 2018]. 

The greatest impacts on a insect, is the manipulation of its hormones that allow it grow and develop into an adult. The inputs from the insect’s body, the hormones, are released into the body. This is where IGRs come into play. IGRs act like a juvenile hormone. They regulate the time periods in which the insect stays young; by increasing the IGRs, it will cause a increase in youth time, preventing the insect, in this case the tobacco hornworm, from developing into an adults at its normal rate. An increase in youth usually concludes to an increase in diet, enlarging the body weight as well as the body length. Some insects exposed to such compounds may die due to abnormal regulation of hormone-mediated cell or organ development [Tunaz: 2003]. Other insects may die either from a prolonged exposure at the developmental stage to other mortality factors (susceptibility to natural enemies, environmental conditions etc) or from an abnormal termination of a developmental stage itself [Tunaz: 2003]. Based off the given information, we could hypothesise that if we add and increase the amount of IGR present in the Manduca sexta, it will reduce the chances of it surviving.


Materials and Methods:
We took eight containers with their corresponding lids and punctured holes on top of the lids. We then labeled the first four containers from 1-4 with the name controlled. The same was done with the last four except with the numbers 5-8 and named treatment.This allowed us to know which caterpillar was which. After setting up the containers, we prepared the food. Each caterpillar received 10g of food. Using a small container, we measured 80g of food altogether then remeasured it each food individually into 10g. As we measured each food individually, we rolled them into a ball. This made the distribution of the IGR equal. Once each 10g of rolled caterpillar food was prepared, they were placed in each container. For the containers that said control, 6 drops of distilled water were added onto the food using a pipet. The same was done with the treatment group using the IGR, precor, but with a different pipet. This was to avoid cross-contamination. Finally, using a ruler in millimeters and a scale in grams, we measured the length and weight of the Manduca sexta before placing them into the containers. The work area was then cleaned up. We threw away the pipettes and washed the container used to measure the food. The last thing done before leaving was washing our hands. For the next 14 days, we collected the weight and length of the Manduca sexta. If the food seemed dry, we replaced it again with a fresh 10g along with its correct liquid (distilled water or precor). We made sure to keep their environment clean and write down any observations. We used the two-sample t-test to help determine if there was any significant data from the raw data of length and weight collected.


Results:
As we see in figure one, towards the beginning of the first couple of days, the treatment and control group had a small significant difference in length. The treatment group had the higher average compared to the controlled group. However, between the 4th - 9th day, the difference between the groups increased. The last couple of days, the difference decreased again. On days 1-10, the treatment group had the higher average. By day 11-12, control had the higher average. Figure two had a similar progression. From day 1-9, the difference between the controlled and treatment was more significant. Treatment had the higher average between those days. By day 11-12, the progression had reversed. Instead, the controlled group had a higher average on those days. The minimum standard deviation of the length of the controlled group was 1.258 and the maximum was 26.163; for the treatment group, the maximum standard deviation was 11.117 and the minimum was 1.142. For weight for the controlled group, the minimum standard deviation was 0.034 and the maximum was 7.28;  the minimum standard deviation for the treatment group was 0.120 and the maximum was 2.486. We used a two-sample t-test in order to analyse our data. The mean of the length of the control group did not show a significant difference from the mean of the length of the treatment group (t-stat = 1.35, df = 22, P = 0.192). The mean of the weight of the control group did not show a significant difference from the mean of the weight of the treatment group (t-stat = 1.27, df = 22, P = 0.219). These results overall told us that the IGRs did not make a big difference in the chances of survival for the Manduca sexta. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that adding and increasing IGR in the diet of the Manduca sexta will lower its chances of survival, was not supported. Based off our data, results, and observations, there was no significant data suggesting that the IGR, precor, caused an decrease in survival for our treatment group. All but four of our caterpillars died; two from the control group and two from treatment group. Therefore, these observations do not give evidence nor support. While our hypothesis was not supported, there were possible errors or mistakes conducted that could have lead to the downfall of our hypothesis. There were two days in the week that were missing data. Possibly, those two days could have made an impact. Another possible error was the incubator in which the caterpillars were kept. [I]nsects may [also]die from other mortality factors (susceptibility to natural enemies, environmental conditions etc) [Tunaz: 2003]. Due to multiple people conducting the same experiment, there was limited space. The containers our group used was not supposed to be stacked on top of one another. However, when we came to check on them, there were several time where the containers were stacked on top of each other. The environment in which the Manduca sexta were placed seemed to not be the most ideal place to live in. This could have prevented the air circulation of the Manduca sexta, possible decreasing the chances of them surviving. All these outside conditions affected the output (behavior, growth, development) of the caterpillars. Being able to understand the life cycle of the Manduca sexta and the impacts involved with its growth and development helps us to understand its way of adapting to certain circumstances in order to survive.  These morphogenetic effects include determination of an immature body form and internal organs, hardness and color of the cuticle, and accompanying physiology and behaviors [Adams: 2009]. Not only does this help us in learning about the Manduca sexta, we helps us with any other species.
