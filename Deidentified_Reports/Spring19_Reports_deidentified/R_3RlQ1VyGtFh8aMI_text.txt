Title: Effect of Caffeine on Muscle Contraction Amplitude of Rana Pipiens

Abstract:
Animals use hormones and nerves to produce responses that allow their bodies to react to their environment. When nerves are stimulated, muscle contractions occur and progress through a typical contraction cycle. In order to view contractions, three Rana Pipiens legs were dissected and hooked up to a probe to stimulate contractions. After data was recorded, each leg was injected with 0.1 mL of 200 millimolar Caffeine in order to test the period of amplitude of the contractions. The hypothesis was that the treatment group would produce a greater period of amplitude than the control group due to Calcium channels remaining open for a longer period of time. The statistical data did not support the hypothesis and showed that the treatment group did not have a significantly greater period of amplitude on average. 


Introduction:
All organisms have hormones that control chemical processes in the body. However, only animals have nerves as well as hormones. When combined together, animals are able to sense the environment that they are in and react to their internal and external interactions. The neuromuscular system is able to respond within milliseconds to produce a reaction. Within an animal, millions of myofibers work together to create the skeletal muscular system. The myofibers form together by connective tissues, making up the skeletal muscles proper. When a nerve is stimulated, a muscle contraction occurs due to the excitation-contraction coupling process. By using a myogram from hooking up a muscle to a force transducer, a muscle’s entire cycle of contraction may be seen and analyzed. There are three main sections of a muscle contraction: latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase. The latent period is a very brief stage between when the signal is fired and when the muscle actually contracts, occurring for approximately 10 milliseconds. When the muscle contracts, it shortens based off of chemical changes that quickly occur within the muscle. Once the muscle has reached its maximum contraction point, relaxation occurs and the muscle returns to its normal length. In order to view muscular contractions, researches took a first step in using Rana Pipiens legs that were dissected and hooked up to a stimulator, and recorded through the online program iWorx EP to view and analyze the three phases of contraction [Johnson: 2018]. When exposed to caffeine, there is an increase in Calcium, which produces a stronger and longer contraction, as well as delays the release time as the rate of decay of Calcium in the muscles. The Calcium is released from the endoplasmic reticulum once the shock is induced from the stimulus, allowing the calcium to then bind to troponin, allowing the muscle to contract. Since caffeine increases the amount of Calcium that is released from the endoplasmic reticulum, the muscle contracts for a longer period of time and increases the decrease of Calcium in the muscle cell [Rosser: 2009]. This delay causes tetany to occur in the muscles [Fryer: 1989]. To advance the process and test effects of stimulators, when three Rana Pipiens legs are injected with caffeine, the added caffeine should produce a larger amplitude than the amplitude of the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
Three different Rana Pipiens legs were used in order to evaluate the effects that 0.1 mL of 200 millimolar injected caffeine would have on the amplitude of contractions of each leg to be able to run multiple tests to compare data for the experiment. In order to reach the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana Pipiens, the skin at the top of the leg was pulled down towards the foot, removing the outer layer of skin and exposing the muscle and bone. The gastrocnemius muscle was separated and the bottom portion as well as the achilles tendon were cut, leaving the gastrocnemius in tact with the knee to allow the muscle to move and contract with the stimulation. A string was attached to the achilles tendon and attached to a hook, creating a 90 degree angle with the rest of the leg, which was held down with pins to restrict movement of the leg and only allow for movement of the gastrocnemius in contraction. A probe was placed into the gastrocnemius and hooked up to the iWorx EP program in order to measure the period of amplitude of the contractions. In order to keep a constant in the iWorx EP program, the settings were determined so the amplitude was 1, the pulse was 3, and the Hz was 0.5. These settings were chosen in order to keep a control steady between all of the Rana Pipiens legs and to have enough data to record from each leg. After the period of amplitude was measured for the control leg, 0.2 mL of caffeine was injected directly into the gastrocnemius muscle and the contraction began immediately. The stimulation began right when the leg was injected to be able to view the entire contraction period of how the amplitude measured the tetany induced by the caffeine. The same process was repeated with the other two Rana Pipiens legs, with the control of each being the normal legs, and the treatment being the Rana Pipiens legs after they were injected with caffeine. In order to test the results once the experiment was completed, the paired t-test was used because each leg served as both a control and treatment after the caffeine was injected. This made the paired t-test the most accurate to compare the data of the period of the amplitude of contraction. 

Results:
Observations showed that, in general, the Rana Pipiens legs injected with caffeine had a much larger value for the period of amplitude. The treatment group, at an average of 0.884 +/- 0.0729 volts, showed a larger difference in the amplitude than the control group, at an average of 0.572 +/- 0.212 volts, as shown in Figure 1. Based on the paired t-test, the sample was not significantly different as data showed (t-value = 2.586, df = 2, p-value = 0.123). When looking at all of the Rana Pipiens legs before and after the injection of caffeine, all of the legs produced a greater number of volts when comparing the amplitudes. Although each leg began at a different amplitude, all of the amplitudes increased after the addition of caffeine. When injected with caffeine, there was a visible difference in the texture of the muscle. The muscle became very hard and sustained that position for an extended period of time. 

Discussion:
Based on the t-test results of greater than 0.05, the experiment failed to reject the null hypothesis, so the difference in results was not statistically significant. There was not enough of a significant difference to determine that caffeine injected into the gastrocnemius of the Rana Pipiens had effect on the amplitude of the contractions. The hypothesis that the amplitude would be larger was not supported by the data collected. According to other studies performed by researchers, the increase in Calcium would induce a sustained contraction, producing tetany, with slow decay in the presence of Calcium, meaning a slow decrease in contraction [Fryer:1989]. The results from this experiment seemed to produce a similar result. Each of the Rana Pipiens legs went into a tetany induced state of contraction, as shown by the amplitudes of the treatment group; however, the results must not have shown enough of a difference in the amplitude of contraction compared to the control group to support the null hypothesis. In the future, the same experiment should be done more with more Rana Pipiens legs to be able to see if further directions can support the hypothesis that the period of amplitude would be increased after caffeine is injected.

The error bars represent standard deviation among the numbers that went into the averages, but the statistics show that the results were not statistically significant (p-value = 0.123).*************************************************************************
