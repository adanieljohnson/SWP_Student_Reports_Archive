Title: Effects of Rhizobium meliloti on the resource allocation of alfalfa plants

Abstract:
Resource allocation in plants is the pattern in which species distribute limited resources. Resource allocation can be studied by observing the root: shoot ratio of plants. This experiment studies the effects of Rhizobium meliloti, a nitrogen fixing bacterium, on the resource allocation of alfalfa plants. We hypothesized that plants infected with Rhizobium meliloti would have a higher root: shoot ratio than plants without the Rhizobium. The data showed a significent difference between the controll and experimental groups; however, our hypothesis was not supported as the controll groups had a higher mean root: shoot ratio than the experimental groups. This suggests that plants infected with Rhizobium meliloti fix enough nitrogen from the soil for the plant to allocate resources to the stem and leaves.

Introduction:
Resource allocation is the pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources. While it is genetically fixed in species, allocation can be slightly modified to adapt to certain conditions. The use of limited resources is divided between the roots and leaves of the plant. Nutrients and water found in the soil are absorbed through the roots. These nutrients are then move to the stems and leaves. Conversely, sunlight is absorbed by leaves and used to produce sugars which then travel to the stems and roots to promote growth. This allocation can be studied through the root: shoot ratio which is the biomass of the roots divided by the combined biomass of the stems and leaves [Johnson: 2018]. Rhizobium is a bacterium that causes plants to grow root nodules which the bacteria can inhabit. This process frequently occurs in alfalfa plants where the bacteria create nodules in the root hairs of the plant [Truchet: 1989]. The bacteria then fix nitrogen into ammonia which helps the plant grow. The plant then allocates sugars from photosynthesis to the nodes in order to feed the bacteria [Long: 1989]. From this information, we hypothesized that the alfalfa infected with Rhizobium meliloti would allocate more resources to the roots and have a high root to shoot ratio. 

Materials and Method:
For the controll group, we filled two pots 2/3 of the way with soil, we then soaked the soil in 50Ml of Miracle Grow and added the alfalfa seeds. We then covered the seeds in soil and watered them with 200Ml of water. For the Experimental group we filled two pots 2/3 of the way with soil and soaked the soil in 50Ml of Miracle Grow. We placed the seeds into the pots, covered the seeds with a half a hand.f.ul of Rhizobium meliloti and covered that with soil. We then watered the plants with 200Ml of water. For the next two weeks we watered each pot of plants with 200Ml of water every other day. At the end of the two weeks we pulled the plants out of the pots.  For each pot, we took out 15 individual plants and divided them into three groups of 5 individuals. This gave us a total of 60 individuals and 12 groups. We measured the maximum root and shoot length of each group After we recorded the measurements, we calculated the root: shoot ratio for the lengths of each group. We found the standard deviations and then used a one-tailed, two sample t_test to test for a significent difference between the root: shoot ratio of the plants grown with and without the rhizobium.

Results:
The mean root: shoot length ratio for the controll was 4.662cm with a standard deviation of +/- 1.141cm (fig. 1). For the experimental group there was a mean root: shoot length ratio of 2.075cm and a standard deviation of +/- 0.616cm (fig. 1). Using a two-sample one tailed t_test we found that there was a significent difference between the controll and experimental mean root: shoot lengths (t_stat = 9.99, d.f. = 30, P = 6.61E-11).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the experimental groups soaked in Rhizobium meliloti would have a higher root: shoot ratio than the controll groups was not supported by the statistical data. Instead, the plants grown without Rhizobium had a much higher root to shoot ratio than plants with Rhizobium. This suggests that the Rhizobium nodes in the roots are able to provide enough limited resources, in this case Nitrogen, for the roots so the plant can allocate more resources to the leaves and stems [Long: 1989]. This information can be used by the agricultural industry to improve the growth of crops that are found in the stems and leaves of plants. For example, farmers that grow wheat, spinach, lettuce, or even corn could use rhizobium on their fields to make sure that more resources are allocated towards growing their crops. This would be a safer and more organic alternative to using chemical fertilizers.
