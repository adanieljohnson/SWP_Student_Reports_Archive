Title: The affect of herbicides and pesticides on photosystem II activity in Spinacia oleracea 

Abstract:
Chloroplasts found in all plant cells contain photosystems that are necessary for energy production in plants. Spinacia oleracea was used as the model organism due to its price and abundance. Farmers today use pesticides and herbicides in order to keep these crops healthy, so they have the highest output of food. Could these herbicides used affect the crops they are trying to grow? Pesticides are also common in agriculture today, could these pesticides have an effect on the crops as well? In this experiment salt water was used as the herbicide because it has been seen to decrease Photosystem II activity and certain pesticides have been seen to increase PSII activity. We hypothesize that the percent change over 30 minutes in herbicides will be lower than the controll and pesticide percent change will be higher than that of the controll. This was not the case and may be a result of an unforeseen reaction between the pesticide and the experimental solution causing the absorbance to drastically increase compared to the other test tubes. Another issue with the experimental design that could have caused this outcome is that the concentration of NaCl(aq) was not high enough to affect PSII production. An ANOVA test was performed and had an outcome of 7.47e-9 with 2 degrees of freedom and t

Introduction:
Agriculture today is heavily reliant on pesticides and herbicides in order to have a good crop yield. But could these pesticides and herbicides have a negative effect on plant photosynthesis? That is why this experiment is important, it evaluates the effects of two specific herbicides and pesticides on photosynthesis rates. In this experiment Spinacia oleracea  was used as a model organism. Spinach is a good model organism because it is available year round, cheap, and has a high concentration of chloroplasts [Seigneurin-Berny:2008]. In this experiment the herbicide was NaCl(aq) because salt water was seen to decrease Photosystem II activity in the chloroplasts [Kalaji: 1993]. Paraquat was used as the pesticide and was evaluated because paraquat and other pesticides were seen to actually increase PSII activity instead of decrease it [Chen:2007]. Photosystem II is the first photosynthetic complex found in the chloroplast stroma and is necessary for photosynthesis to occur in plants. Photosystem II works by absorbing a photon and exciting an electron that was donated by an H2O to create O2 and H+. After the e- is excited it is passed to plastiquinone [Johnson:2018]. Instead of measuring plastiquinone or Oxygen levels in this experiment an alternate electron acceptor is used to measure PSII activity [Johnson:2018]. For the purposes of this experiment 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol(DCIP) is used. DCIP is an aromatic ring that is dark blue. After DCIP is reduced as the alternate electron acceptor it changes from dark blue to clear. This major change is key to evaluating PSII activity because as absorbance decreases PSII activity increases [Johnson:2018]. We hypothesize that the addition of the herbicide will decrease PSII activity and the addition of the pesticide will increase PSII activity. 

Materials and Method:
To start the experiment spinach leaves are ground up in a mortar in pestle and 20 Ml of grinding buffer are added. After a paste is created the ground leaves are put in a cheese cloth and squeezed in order to isolate the chloroplasts [Johnson:2018]. The chloroplast solution is put in a centrifuge tube. Water of equal volume is also put into a centrifuge tube to be used as a balance. The chloroplasts are centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpm as that was seen to isolate the most chloroplasts with the least debris [Johnson:2018]. 16 test tubes are then labeled. In test tube 0, 8 Ml of water and  2 Ml of reaction buffer are added and it is used as the blank. In test tubes 1-5, 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer are added. In test tubes 6-10 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of 10 mM paraquat are added. In test tubes 11-15 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of 100 mM NaCl(aq) is added. 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts is then added and the test tubes are evaluated every 10 minutes starting at time 0 at 600 nm in the spectrophotometer. 600 nm is used because it is the optimal absorbance for light [Johnson:2018]. The test tubes are kept under a lamp the entire time to limit the number of variables. An ANOVA test is then performed on the absorbance data across all three groups with a significance cutoff number of .05.

Results:
Absorbance at 600 nm was seen to decrease across all experimental groups as shown in table 1 but the rate at which the absorbance decreases depends on the experimental group [Johnson:2018]. Based on figure 1 the pesticides were observed to have the least change in absorbance and herbicide had the highest percent change in absorbance and the lowest amount of absorbance. After the addition of the pesticide to the test tubes the solution was observed to have a whitish tint unlike the blue tint of the other test tubes. The results of ANOVA test were calculated at 7.47e-9 with 2 degrees of freedom. 


Discussion:
Based on the results of the assay our hypothesis was not supported as herbicide was seen to have the highest percent change and pesticide was seen to have the lowest percent change. This data goes against the data gathered before the experiment was performed. Salt water was seen to decrease PSII production by making the chloroplasts environment hypertonic and drawing H2O out of the chloroplasts and making H2O less available for PSII to strip off the electron [Kalaji: 1993]. Perhaps the reason it was so similar to the controll of just light could be that the salt concentration was not high enough to effect H2O availability for PSII. Concerning the pesticide one reason PSII rates could have decreased is because pesticides are seen to be toxic to certain types of plants in certain cases [Aktar:2009]. This may have occurred in this experiment. Another issue that arose with the pesticide is that there was an unforeseen reaction between the solution and paraquat that made a white milky substance. This drastically affected the absorbance reading of the spectrophotometer and could have affected the percent changes as well. The results of the ANOVA test were surprising because even though the outcome of the experiment was the opposite of what was predicted we still received significent data which rejects the null hypothesis.
