Title: Effects of Increased Soil Nitrogen Quantity on Root:Shoot Ratios in Secale cereale

Abstract:
The growth of plants is largely influenced by resource availability, and the allocation of those resources to different structures within an organism. In this experiment, we analyzed the phenotypic plasticity of Secale cereale (Rye) plants in response to increased soil nitrogen content. Nitrogen supply was chosen as a resource limitation because nitrogen is critical to plant growth as a major constituent of proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll. Our hypothesis was that plants grown in soil with more nitrogen would have a smaller root:shoot ratio than plants grown in soil with no added nitrogen. For two weeks, we watered the control group daily with water, and the experimental group with a water/Miracle-Gro solution. After growth, we measured the roots and shoots of each plant. The data obtained supported our hypothesis; the average root:shoot ratio for both mass and length were smaller in the group grown in soil with increased nitrogen.This is explained by the optimal partitioning theory, which says that in response to differences in resource availability, plants will adjust the allotment of biomass to obtain their most limited resource. Plants with limited nutrients will tend to allocate more biomass to their roots, and less to their stems and leaves. 

Introduction:
     Resource allocation in plants concerns the way plants utilize available resources; specifically, where they disperse energy in the growth of structures like roots, shoots, and leaves. Since a plant will not have the perfect environmental conditions for growth in any ecosystem, it has to make trade-offs in the prioritization of certain areas over others. Although the allocation of resources is genetically determined, external conditions and limiting factors have influence in a plant’s response as well. This change in growth pattern over time based on environmental conditions is called phenotype plasticity [Johnson : 2018]. 
     This experiment evaluates the influence of soil nitrogen quantity on the root:shoot ratio of Secale cereale (Rye). We chose to assess soil nitrogen quantity because of nitrogen’s critical role in plant growth as a fundamental element in proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll [Novoa, 1981]. Assessing the root:shoot ratio will demonstrate the relative allocation of biomass in Rye plants grown in soil without added nitrogen and with added nitrogen (in the form of Miracle-Gro). Typically, the increase of nutrient availability leads plants to allocate less to their roots. This is explained by the resource optimization hypothesis, which says that increased nutrient availability means less energy is needed to acquire that resource [Agren: 2003]. With the concept of resource optimization in mind, my hypothesis is that Rye plants grown in soil with more nitrogen will have a smaller root:shoot ratio than the same plants grown in soil with less nitrogen. 

Materials and Methods:
     Rye seeds were planted in four total pots of vermiculite; two were labelled as the control group, and two as the experimental group. All of the pots were placed in a greenhouse for two weeks, and watered daily. The control group was watered with 100mL of water, and the experimental group with a 50mL water/50mL Miracle-Gro solution; Miracle-Gro contains 24% nitrogen, according to the manufacturer. Although it isn’t completely nitrogen, it was used to provide a higher nitrogen concentration for the Rye plants. 
     At the end of the two weeks, we measured root and shoot weight (g) and length (cm)  in the control group and then in the experimental group (measurements came from 10 plants in each group, five from each pot). We used a standard lab balance to weigh them, and a ruler for length. In order to obtain these measurements, a plastic container was filled with water, and we gently separated each individual plant from the soil. Each plant was washed, and then their roots and shoots were carefully separated at the same point in each individual. We then weighed and measured each root and shoot, and recorded the corresponding mass/length. We used these values to calculate the average weight and length for each group, and the corresponding standard deviations. An unpaired one-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine the differences in average root:shoot ratios (length and weight) of Rye plants grown with the addition of Miracle Grow (nitrogen) compared to plants grown with no added nitrogen. 


Results:
     Our results showed that the average root:shoot ratio of Rye plants grown with added nitrogen was smaller than that of the control group. For the control plants (no added nitrogen), the average root:shoot ratio for mass was 1.10 +/- 0.284. The average root:shoot ratio for length was 1.08 +/- 0.268.
     In the experimental group, the average root:shoot ratio for mass was 0.81+/- 0.1203, and the average for length was 0.87 +/- 0.095 (Fig 1). 
    We used an unpaired one tailed t-test to analyze our results. The mean of the length in the experimental group was significantly different than the length of the control group (t-value = 2.3078, df = 18, P-value = 0.0166). The mean of the weight in the experimental group was also significantly different than that of the control group (t-value = 2.979, df = 18, P-value = 0.008). Observations of the plants before measurement supports our results as well; the ratio of root to shoot was clearly smaller for the group grown with Miracle-Gro, as its roots and shoots were visibly very close in length. The control group’s roots were longer than its shoots.


Discussion:
     Our hypothesis that Secale cereale (Rye) plants grown in soil with higher nitrogen content would have a smaller root:shoot ratio than the same plants growing in soil with less nitrogen was supported by our results. We observed a significant statistical difference in both mean length and weight. This is explained by the critical nature of nitrogen to plant growth; nitrogen is a vital component of proteins, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll, all of which are necessary for successful growth, chlorophyll being essential to photosynthesis [Novoa, 1981].  In a study done regarding the effect of nitrogen supply on Zea mays (corn) and Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf) growth, similar results were obtained [Bonifas, 2005]. For both species, the average root:shoot ratio decreased over time with the addition of nitrogen supply. This is explained by the optimal partitioning theory, which says that plants will optimize their total growth rate through the adjustment of their biomass partitioning patterns for the purpose of acquiring the most limiting resource in the case that there is varied access to resources. [Bonifas, 2005]. The example is given that plants with a limited nutrient availability will allocate more biomass to their roots, and less to higher up structures like stems and leaves. Thus, plants that encounter more than sufficient nutrient supply would be expected to have a smaller root:shoot ratio - as seen in the Rye plants in this experiment with increased soil nitrogen content.
