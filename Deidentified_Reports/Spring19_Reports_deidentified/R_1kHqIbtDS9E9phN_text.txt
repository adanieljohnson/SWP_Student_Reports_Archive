Title: The Neuromuscular Control of Rania Pipien Frogs in Relation to Amplitude Using Lidocaine

Abstract:
The Rania pipien frog’s neuromuscular system functions due to a series of internal action potentials which release muscle contractions. These action potentials occur due to an opening of sodium channels, therefore, when these channels are blocked the action potentials won’t occur. This lab tested the effect of muscle contractions on the Rania pipien frog’s gastrocnemus muscle when using a sodium channel blocker (lidocaine). Muscle contractions were measured (amplitude) before and after the injection of sodium channel blockers at 0.4 volts. It was hypothesized that if the sodium channel blockers are injected into the Rania pipien frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, there will be a decrease to a cessation of the action potential in the static nerve. The alternative hypothesis was accepted by the outcome of the experiment and the statistical analysis determining there were significent differences. It was concluded that lidocaine did cause a decrease in the action potential of a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle.

Introduction:
This experiment will examine the stimulus, response, work summation, and tetanus in a frog’s leg muscle. The objective is to demonstrate the basic properties of neuromuscular controll using the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of a Rania pipien frog. This is a northern leopard frog which is typically a slim green or brownish color. There are thousands of myofibers, cylindrical multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells, in the skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates. These myofibers bound together, forming the skeletal muscle proper, which are innervated by motor neurons. The axons of these motor neurons extend and branch out the muscular junction. “During sustained stimulation of motor neurons, a release of acetylcholine by the neuron sufficient to maintain tetany of skeletal muscle is maintained by stimulation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors by synaptic acetylcholine” [Clarks: 2018]. Therefore, the nerve muscles at the junction release acetylcholine which bind with receptors to open sodium channels, triggering an action potential by an influx of sodium, releasing calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Sodium channels allow for neurotransmitters to pass through and cause action potentials. This release of calcium is what transmits the contractile mechanism of muscle fiber. These muscular contractions can be measured and seen through the use of myograms (graphical recording of muscle activity). An electrophysiology (EP) recording device will be used to monitor the contraction amplitudes of the muscle. The lab hypothesized that if the sodium channel blockers (lidocaine) is injected into Rania pipien Frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, there will be a decrease to a cessation of the action potential in the static nerve.

Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipien frog legs were used for this experiment. The legs were dissected to expose the sciatic nerve. The exposed tissue of the frog legs was kept moist throughout experiment using frog ringers. The gastrocnemus muscle was then connected to the Lab Scribe software. A stimulus of 0.4 volts and 1Hz was applied for 5ms. Then, 0.1Ml concentration of lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle and a drop was applied to the nerve and allowed to disperse for 3 minutes. The average voltage was then recorded and analyzed using a two-tailed paired t_test.

Results:
The average amplitude for the controll group was found to be 1.396 volts; whereas, the average amplitude for the experimental group was found to be 0.2493 volts (Fig 1). A two-tailed paired t_test was taken in order to analyze these results. A significent decrease in amplitude was noted (p=0.02531). The statistical results and observations offered various trends throughout this experiment. After injection of the sodium channel blocker to the frog legs the experimental voltage would constantly decrease, and the leg muscle twitch would last longer. Also, the larger frog legs produced higher amplitude voltages in both the controll and experiment in comparison to the smaller frog legs.

Discussion:
The lab hypothesized that if the sodium channel blockers (lidocaine) is injected into Rania pipien Frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, there will be a decrease to a cessation of the action potential in the static nerve. Based on the statistical results it can be concluded that the alternative hypothesis was accepted, and the null hypothesis was rejected. A significent decrease was observed, which suggests that the increase of sodium channel blockers did significently affect the action potential and amplitude of the Rania pipien frog. As the sodium channels are being blocked, neurotransmitters are no longer able to pass through and signal for action potentials to occur. Muscle contraction amplitudes are used because muscular contractions are taken as an index of the natural processes of the impulses across the muscle [Tasaki: 1952]. There was a decrease in voltage in the experimental group because the sodium channel was blocked due to the injection of lidocaine. Sodium channels transport neurotransmitters across neurons, so when it was blocked the neurons were unable to receive the transmitter to create an action potential. The lab found that the frog legs that were larger resulted in higher voltages in comparison to the smaller ones. This occurred due to the amount of lidocaine in the larger legs being more concentrated than those in the smaller legs.
