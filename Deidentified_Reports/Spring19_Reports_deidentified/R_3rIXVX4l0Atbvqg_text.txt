Title: Adding Novacaine to the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Raina Pipiens Frog Legs to See how it Affects their Nerve Stimulation

Abstract:
Voltage was applied to R. Pipiens’ sciatic nerves to see how their nerve stimulation differed when Novacaine was applied to their gastrocnemus muscles compared to when it was not applied.  We hypothesized that the total nerve stimulation of our R. Pipiens gastrocnemus muscles would decrease with an injection of Novacaine since the drug acts as a sodium inhibitor.  We took three different frog legs, applied 1Hz of voltage to them and determined their nerve stimulation as a controll group, and then injected Novacaine into them and determined their nerve stimulation as a treatment group.  Our p_value for the experiment ended up being p=0.047.  We determined that our experiment supported our hypothesis, since the nerve stimulation of the gastrocnemus muscles without Novacaine resulted in more nerve stimulation than those that received Novacaine (Fig. 1).  Novacaine would be helpful for others to relax their muscles during potentially painful experiences, eliminating all or most of the pain that the person would feel.

Introduction:
Muscles consist of thousands of myofibers [Johnson:2018].  Skeletal muscles contain these myofibers, and are also innervated by motor neurons, which can send electrochemical signals to other neurons [Johnson:2018].  These electrochemical signals build up and must reach an action potential to cause a response.  Frogs have sciatic nerves, and these nerves controll the movement of their gastrocnemus muscles, like many other species [Johnson:2018].  The Northern Leopard Frog, or R. Pipiens, has this type of connection between their sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle [Johnson:2018].  When a person removes a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle from its leg, the person can test the response of the muscle’s threshold potential, which is reached when an action potential is reached, if the muscle is still connected to the sciatic nerve.  The threshold potential is the smallest amount of voltage required for a nerve to generate a response from the muscle that it is connected to [Johnson:2018].  Novacaine is a drug that inhibits the pain response of neurons and limits the response of a muscle to a neural impulse.  Since the neural impulse is limited with Novacaine, then the nerve stimulation will be less.  We will be applying Novacaine to the gastrocnemus muscle of R. Pipiens to see how it affects their nerve stimulation.  Our hypothesis is that if Novacaine is applied to a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, then the total nerve stimulation of the sciatic nerve will be lower than normal.  Novacaine inhibits never transmission by blocking sodium channels, therefore lowering the membrane potential of the neurons [2007].  This, in turn, will raise the threshold for depolarization to occur [2007].  If we see that Novacaine decreases nerve stimulation, then we can use Novacaine on someone who is experiencing pain to limit the amount of it that they feel.

Materials and Method:
We took the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle out of the leg of a R. Pipiens.  We separated the sciatic nerve from the tissue surrounding it, leaving it connected to the gastrocnemus muscle.  Then, we hung the sciatic nerve up and applied 1 Hz of voltage to it to test the nerve stimulation of the muscle.  We kept the muscle wet with Ringer’s solution so that it remained functioning properly.  We tested the nerve stimulation of the muscle before Novacaine was applied to it, and 5 minutes after Novacaine was applied to it.  For the treatment group, we applied 0.1 Ml of Novacaine.  We tested three different legs, each as a controll and as a treatment.  We used a paired t_test to determine significance.  For the t_test, we determined the total nerve impulse for each R. Pipiens at an impulse of around 0.1 mV and averaged these numbers for the three muscles in each group, resulting in a numerical nerve impulse for the treatment and a numerical nerve impulse for the controll.

Results:
The average nerve stimulation for our controll group were 0.153, 0.222, and 0.235 volts, respectively (Fig. 1).  The average standard deviation for these groups was 0.0197 (Fig. 1).  The nerve stimulation for our controll groups were 0.05, 0.034, and 0.137 volts, respectively (Fig. 1).  The average standard deviation for these groups was 0.005 (Fig. 1).  The mean nerve stimulation for our controll group was statistically significent compared to the average nerve stimulation of our treatment group (t_stat = 4.453, dF = 2, p_value = 0.047). 

Discussion:
Our experiment supported our hypothesis that Novacaine would lower the nerve stimulation of the R. Pipiens muscles (Fig. 1).  In every test, when Novacaine was applied into the gastrocnemus muscle, the nerve stimulation was lower than when it was not applied (Fig. 1).  There was a significent difference in the nerve stimulation between our controll and treatment groups (p_value = 0.047).  One error that could have occurred in our experiment is that we could have accidentally cut some of the sciatic nerve or pulled on it too hard, resulting in a messed up sciatic nerve-gastrocnemus muscle connection.  This would result in a smaller nerve stimulation than expected.  A lower nerve stimulation would occur because an animal’s sciatic nerve is connected to its gastrocnemus muscle [Wali: 1990].  Another error that could have occurred is that we may have waited too long to add Ringer’s solution to the muscles.  This may have resulted in a lower total nerve stimulation than normal.  In the future, we could wait longer after injecting Novacaine into the gastrocnemus muscles before we test their nerve stimulation.  This would help us to determine how long it would take for Novacaine’s effects to wear off.  Novacaine would be helpful for others to relax their muscles during potentially painful experiences, eliminating all or most of the pain that the person would feel.
