Title: The effect of environment size on the agnostic behaviors of male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Studying animal behaviors helps researchers observe how organisms respond to various stimuli. Betta splendins is a species of fish that is known to exhibit agnostic behavior in the presence of other male bettas to assert their dominance through a variety of displayed behaviors. It was hypothesized that the betta would show more aggressive behavior in the smaller tanks. This experiment observes the effect of environment size on the aggressive displays of male betta fish. Using different size tanks, each betta fish was observed for five minutes and observations about the timing of their red mane behavior was recorded. Though the statistical tests revealed no statistically significent data that support the hypothesis, the observations suggest that tank size may have contributed to the wide range of behaviors displayed.

Introduction:
Animals display a range of behaviors, whether embedded in their genotype or learned, in response to various environmental stimuli. Ethology is the study of animal behavior where researchers use observational study to further understand how certain behaviors may have evolved. This experiment uses patient observation to observe what variables affect the agnostic behaviors of Betta splendins, or betta fish. Wild betta fish are found to live in densely vegetated areas, like the shallow waters of rice patty fields. The wild-type species are not exposed nor show preference for larger environments with more open space [Jaroensutasinee: 2001]; therefore, this experiment tests at whether the size of the environment has an impact on the agnostic behaviors of male betta fish. These organisms display a variety of agnostic intraspecies behaviors to assert dominance to other bettas, such as the expansion and flashing of their fins, facing and facing behaviors, lowering of the head, darting, and biting [Bronstein: 1984]. Specifically, we looked at the behavior of red mane: an agnostic behavior exhibited by male betta fish by extending the gills from their branchiostegal membrane, located on the side of their heads. We hypothesize that the male fish exhibit more aggressive behavior in smaller tanks rather than larger ones. 

Materials and Method:
Before the experiment, we obtained a large tank, split into two 10 inches by 10.5 inches sections. In addition, we used a smaller tank split into two sections, 4 inches by 6 inches each. Each section within the tanks was separated by a clear piece of glass. First, two male betta fish were placed the separate sections of the small tank. The behavior of one male fish was observed for each trial. Their agnostic behaviors were quantified as the seconds leading to the first red mane agnostic behavior as well as the overall duration in seconds of that behavior over the five minutes that they were exposed to another male. After these five minutes, we placed an opaque divider between the sections to let the fish rest for five more minutes. Next, we replaced one of the fishes with a new male and repeated the steps taken to observe their behavior. This was repeated for observations for three trials total before repeating all steps with a bigger tank. A paired t_test was used to test the results for significance. 

Results:
Graph 1 reveals that the male fish took longer, on average, to show the red mane behavior in a large tank (30.6 seconds +/- 34.5 sec) compared to when they were in the smaller tank (22.6 seconds +/- 31.8 sec). The paired t_test revealed no statistical significance between the data for the large and the smaller tanks (t_stat = 1.84, d.f. = 2, P = 0.21). Graph 2 shows that the males exhibited red mane behavior for longer in the smaller tank (132.6 seconds) than those in the large tank (101.3 seconds). The statistical test showed no statistical significance for the duration of the red mane behavior between groups (t_stat = 0.98, d.f. = 2, P = 0.43). 

Discussion:
The data collected does not support the initial hypothesis that male betta fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior in the smaller tanks. With large standard deviations and a large p_value, our data showed great variation which cannot support a conclusion that betta fish in general show more agnostic behaviors in smaller environments. However, though the data is not statistically significent, some of our findings show preliminary evidence that size of the environment affects the agnostic behaviors of the males. Both the smaller average time before the first red mane behavior and the longer duration support that there was more aggressive behavior in the small tank versus the larger one. Due to small sample size and the wide range of behavior, our data cannot be generalized to all betta fish. Regarding our findings with the fish who showed more aggressive behaviors in the smaller tank, a possible justification would be that in the smaller enclosures, it was easier for the organisms to see encounter each other through the glass. However, one of the trial males exhibited no agnostic behavior throughout the study, though it was observed having seen the other fish. This brought up the question into whether all male betta fish exhibit agnostic behaviors when confronted by the threat of another male, as usually expected. It also begs the question as to what other factors impact the bettas decision to show agnostic behavior and to whether they can distinguish when a threat is significent enough to need that type of behavior. Another experiment conducted found that it took males longer to attack another male fish depending on the level of displayed aggressive behavior of the other fish [Simpson, M. J. A: 1968]. This finding could potentially have impacted our experiment, considering that we did not account for the reciprocated level of aggression by the other fish.
