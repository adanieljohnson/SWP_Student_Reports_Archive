Title: How IGRs impacts Manduca Sexta caterpillars during development 

Abstract:
Hormone function is an essential element regarding development of insects. The regulation of hormone functions assist in the process of completing molting and continuing to the next stage of life. This study examined the effects of the insect growth regulator (IGR), precor, when exposed to Manduca Sexta caterpillars. Eight, four control (fed water) and four treatment (fed precor), were observed for 14 days. The data displayed no significance regarding the IGR, pre-core, affecting the length and weight of the Manduca Sexta. An excessive amount of IGR would negatively affect the caterpillar meaning the weight and length would be below average and ultimately, lead to death. The results failed to support the hypothesis stating that the IGR, precor, would lead to morality and development abnormalities. There is no significant regarding the data. 


Introduction:
This experiment investigates the impacts of hormones on the Manduca Sexta caterpillars during development. Hormones are an essential part of development as it triggers growth. Identifying and understanding hormonal control and their effects on developmental plasticity and physiology is crucial as it gives insight regarding biological evolution. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) affect the physiological regulatory process of insects as it mimics hormones associated with development. IGR’s have been reported for mortality and developmental abnormalities, especially regarding the larva stage [Thompson: 2005]. Manduca Sexta is classified as having a holometabolous life cycle. The caterpillar undergoes passings from one life cycle to another through molting. Molting premites the Manduca Sexta to experience morphology and change in size. This is crucial as when analyzing development of the Manduca Sexta, it is present to see where growth occurs. The Manduca Sexta’s growth can be easily manipulated using IGRs; furthermore, making it the insect of choice when analyzing evolution of growth rate and physiological control [Kingsolver: 2007]. In this experiment, the caterpillars will be treated with an IGR called pre-cor and further evaluated regarding length and weight measurements in order to reflect on their development. With the presence of an IGR, the caterpillars will develop abnormalities leading to death faster than the caterpillars that were not fed caterpillar food containing the IGR, precor. An excessive amount of IGR would negatively affect the caterpillar, meaning the weight and length would be below the average control caterpillars and ultimately, lead to death.


Materials and Methods:
Eight, eleven-twelve day-old, Manduca Sexta caterpillars weighing .59-1.2 g and recording a length between 30 and 40 mm long were selected and divided into two groups of four. One group being the control and the other being the experimental group. Each caterpillar was separated and placed in a plastic container containing small breathing holes in the lids. Each container was labeled the caterpillar’s designated number and which group it was in. The control group was fed 10 grams of caterpillar food with six drops of water while the experimental group was fed 10 grams of caterpillar food with six drops of pre-core, an IGR. All the caterpillars were kept in the same condition in a refrigerator at 25 degrees Celsius under constant exposure to artificial light. The caterpillars were observed, measured (millimeters), and weighed (grams) everyday in the evening for two weeks. Plastic surgical gloves were utilized when handling the caterpillars. The caterpillars were weighed on a standard lab balance. The caterpillars received new food everyday along with six drops of water or pre-core depending on which group they were classified as. This was done in order to avoid the food from drying up. The waste produced by the caterpillars was disposed of everyday. Statistical analyses consisted of two sample two-tailed, one for length and one for weight, in order to determine the p-value to see if there was any significance regarding the data. In addition, the statistical analysis included standard deviation. 

Results:
Initially, the treatment group surpassed the weight and length of the control group exponentially and then leveled, whereas the control group maintained consistent with both length and weight. This resulted in the control group weighing more and having longer recorded lengths in comparison to the experimental group by the end of the experiment (Fig. 1 & 2). The treatment group weighed more and was longer until the last three days where the control group reported to be longer and heavier. The average weight was 3.96 grams for the control group over the past 14 days, whereas the average for the treatment group was 5.42 grams (Fig. 2). The average length for control group over the 14 days was 49.09, while for the treatment group is was 57.29 (Fig.1). The average standard deviations for the control group for weight was 1.376 and 1.546 for the treatment group (Fig. 2). The average standard deviations for the control group for length was 8.24 and 6.842 for the treatment group (Fig. 2).
 We completed a two-sample t-test to analyze our results in order to find significance. There was no statistical significance regarding the weight (P=0.219). In addition, there was no statistical significance regarding the length either (P=0.192). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, tha an excessive amount of IGR would negatively affect the caterpillars, meaning that the weight and length would be below average and ultimately, lead to death, was not supported. There was no significance proving our hypothesis that the IGR, precor, would lead to morality and development abnormalities. Although our results failed to prove this, various scientific journals did find relevance when investigating the effects of IGRs. It is proven that IGR’s like Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone have an impact on the development of insects. It has been reported that IGRs affects the mortality and developmental abnormalities, especially regarding the larva stage [Thompson: 2005]. There are two days missing in our 14 day experiment, leaving there only to be 12 data points. This was an error regarding our experiment as it negatively affected the trends shown. The statistical tests revealed that we reject the alternative hypothesis and support the null hypothesis because the p-value was greater .05.  Hormones are an important part of development as it triggers growth. Identifying and understanding the effects of hormonal control and the impacts it has on developmental physiology is vital as it gives insight regarding biological evolution. Overall, it is crucial to investigate the effects of hormones on insects as it has a monumental impact on understanding biological development.
