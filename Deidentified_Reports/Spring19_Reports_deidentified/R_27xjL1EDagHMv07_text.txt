Title: Resource allocation of Fagopyrum esculentum in a nitrogen rich environment 

Abstract:
This study’s goal was to observe how a plant allocates its resources in response to the environment. Specifically, how a nitrogen rich environment would influence the distribution of resources for the Fagopyrum esculentum, also commonly known as Buckwheat. We hypothesized that if buckwheat is exposed to a Nitrogen rich environment, then there will be an increase in the root to shoot ratio for both the length and the weight. Meaning that the plant will allocate its resource to the roots in order to absorb more nitrogen to support the plant’s development. This experiment was done by comparing the experimental nitrogen group’s weight root to shoot ratio to the controll group. Furthermore, we also calculated and compared the experimental nitrogen group’s length root to shoot ratio to the controll group. After conducting this experiment, we observed a statistically significent difference between the two groups for both the length and weight’s root to shoot ratio. This supports our hypothesis of an increased root to shoot ratio in the experimental nitrogen group.

Introduction:
When observing a species of plant, one would notice that this plant can look slightly different when it is growing in two different environments. It is even seen when looking at a tree located at the edge of a forest and that same species of tree located in the center of the forest. This differentiation is caused by the plants ability to allocate its resources in response to abiotic factors. Based on environmental factors like wind, temperature, humidity, or soil nutrients, the plant can allocate its resources accordingly to maximize its growth in that specific environment [Johnson: 2018]. One of the best ways to measure this resource allocation is looking at the root to shoot ratio for both weight and length. This root to shoot ratio helps researchers see if the plant is diverting more of its resources into the roots or into the stem of the plant. A separate study was able to determine that when a plant was exposed to excess nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, an observable increase in the development of the roots, increasing the root: shoot ratio [Agren: 1987]. All those nutrients are important, but nitrogen is especially important because it provides the foundation for nucleotides. Our DNA, which code for proteins, are composed of singular nucleotides and each nucleotide has a nitrogen group. Since every cell requires nitrogen, nitrogen is a necessity for a growing plant [Näsholm: 2009]. Knowing the importance of nitrogen and the effect nutrients has on the growth of a plant, we wanted to see if nitrogen alone would have the same effect on the development of the roots and the shoots. In our experiment, we hypothesized that if Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) was exposed to a highly rich Nitrogen environment, then there will be a greater root to shoot ratio than the controll for both the length and the weight. The main reason why we chose buckwheat is because it is a native plant to the North Carolina region and that it is highly influenced by its environment. It also grows fairly quickly in almost any environment.


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we first planted buckwheat seeds in four separate pots, two labeled controll and two labeled experimental. Every pot was watered with 50 Ml of water and 50 Ml of Miracle grow. The plants were put in the greenhouse and were watered every day for a two-week period. The controll pots were watered with 100 Ml of water and the experimental group were watered with solution of 50 Ml of water and 50 Ml of the miracle grow, containing the nitrogen. The plants were harvested after two weeks and ten individuals were separated from the controll group and ten individuals from the experimental group. The roots were separated from the shoots by cutting the plant at the root-shoot junction. Then the weights and lengths of the roots and shoot for each individual were measured and recorded. Lastly, we calculated the root: shoot ratio for weight and length for the experimental and controll group. The mean and standard deviation was calculated for each group and an unpaired two tailed T-Test was used to determine if our data was significent. 


Results:
We observed a clear visual difference between the individuals in the controll and the individuals in the nitrogen experimental group. The controll group displayed a healthy growth pattern, but the nitrogen group experienced severely stunted growth and what looked like plant death. As seen in Figure 1, we observed that the weight’s root: shoot ratio for the controll group was 0.040 +/- 0.048 and the nitrogen group was 0.490 +/- 0.306. After conducting a unpaired two tailed T test, we determined that the results were statistically significent (t-value=4.59, d.f.=18, p=0.0002). Then we found the length root: shoot ratio for the controll group was 0.486 +/- 0.160 and the nitrogen group was 1.486 +/- 0.492. Similarly, after conducting another unpaired two tailed T tests, we found that our results for the length’s root: shoot ratio were significent as well (t-value=6.11, d.f.=18, p=0.0000091). 


Discussion:
We determined that both of our data supports our hypothesis because the results from an unpaired two tailed T test showed that our data was statistically significent. This supports our hypothesis that predicted that the experimental Nitrogen group would have a higher length and weight root to shoot ratio than the controll group. This is because with sunlight not being a limiting factor, the plants can allocate their resources to their roots so they can absorb more nutrients to support the ample amount of sunlight. Our data is also supported by previous results [Bonifas: 2005]. They observed a significent increase in the root to shoot ratio for velvet leaf (46-82%) as well as corn (29-45%) when exposed to a nitrogen rich environment [Bonifas: 2005]. For future experiments, I would lower the exposure to nitrogen in our experimental group with the hope that the plants can survive better under these conditions. We observed one flaw within our experiment, and that was that our experimental nitrogen group was almost dead. We believe this occurred by over exposure to the nitrogen, past research has supported this notion, where they exposed plants to a higher concentration of ammonium, NH4+, and found a significent reduction in plant growth, as well as a high percentage of plant death [Roelofs: 1986]. Lastly, this experiment is relevant because it provides farmers and botanists with the knowledge that over exposure to nitrogen can kill your plants, high exposure can increase the allocation of resources to the roots more than normal soil.
