Title: Resource allocation and Observing Phenotypic Plasticity of Raphanus Sativuses Grown in Vermiculite and Mycorrhiza

Abstract:
The underlying concepts of this experiment are observing plants plasticity and their resource allocation. By adding other factors so see how both the plasticity and allocation of recourses, one can see how those factors impact the plants survival compared to not factors. In this experiment the factor was adding a fungus to a set of radishes and see how they affected the radishes’ growth compared to radishes without the fungus. Overall, the experiment shows that the fungus was able to significently change the length and weight of the radishes’ shoots, which was due to the symbiotic relationship formed. With those results the hypothesis was supported significently. The idea that the fungus does help with the length and weight aspects of the radishes’ shoots does make sense due to the change in where its resources are allocated to so the plant can maximize its resources. The experimental results are important because the ability to increase the yield of a plant’s shoots while also maintaining the overall stability of the plants resources. 

Introduction:
Plasticity is the adaptability of an organism to changes in its environment or differences between its various habitats. The trait is an important for plants to have because different conditions can arise, which can cause a plant to need to exhibit phenotypic plasticity in ways of altering the growing pattern of its leaves, roots, or stem/shoot. The plants in the experiment are Radishes (Raphanus Sativus) which will be subjected to Mycorrhiza fungi called Rhizophagus Irregularis. The fungus forms a symbiotic relationship with the plant’s roots so the plant can easily intake inorganic phosphate through the soil. This relationship is very important because when cultivating plants, the goal is to maximize the plant’s shoot growth, so proving that the fungus helps increase the growth of the shoots and prosperity of the plant is essential to a healthy plant. In one study, the fungus was found to significently increase the yields of crops compared to the controllled group [Ceballos: 2013]. The experiment’s results show that the cassava (Manihot Esculenta) yields were significently increased due to the use of Rhizophagus Irregularis. Additionally, the results supported the strong potential for the use of the fungi in major farming and that its use would be economically profitable [Ceballos: 2013]. My hypothesis is that the experimental Raphanus Sativuses that are growing in Rhizophagus Irregularis will have significently lengthier and heavier shoots and thus a low root to shoot ratio. Due to presence of the fungi and the nature of their symbiotic relationship, the experimental group will not have to allocate more resources to produce a complex root system and divert the resources to creating bigger shoots. Therefore, the controll group growing in regular vermiculite will not have any significent differences with their root and shoots and thus having a high root to shoot ratio.

Materials and Method:
We took the seeds that had been soaked in water and planted them in the vermiculite with miracle grow in it, all of which was separated into 4 different containers. After the controll group was planted then the experimental group was prepared but with the added fungi, all of which was separated into 4 different containers. Then the plants were taken into the greenhouse to be watered for 2 weeks. Next, the plants were harvested carefully and not quickly as to not damage the roots. Then the controll plants were broken apart from the vermiculite which allowed the separation of the roots. The plants were gently washed in the container of water and gently dried with a paper towel. After the harvest was done, we measured the plants roots and shoot in terms of weight and length. First, we weighed the whole plants together and then recorded the data. Next, we separated the roots of the plants from the shoots at the root-shoot junction, and all other plants were cut at the same root-shoot junction for consistency. Then we weighed the shoots and recorded that data and calculated/ recorded the root mass (the root mass is the total mass subtracted by the shoot mass). Finally, we measured the maximum shoot length and root length to the nearest millimeter and then recorded the mean value for each of the group's plants. All the steps for the controll plants were repeated for the experimental group. All the data was put into a table where the standard deviation was calculated. To portray the results of the experiment the statistical test chosen to compare the data was a two-tailed t_test which tests the null hypothesis that means values of measurement variable are the same in two groups.

Results:
For there to be a significent difference observed, the group’s P values must be above 0.05 or p≥0.05. In the two figures (figures 1 and 2) below the data collected is displayed in graphs detailing the differences in means with the standard deviation applied. The data for the root to shoot ratio for weight was that mean of the controll data was higher than the experimental. (controll: 0.542, ±0.195, fungi: 0.424, ±0.158) [Figure 1]. The data for the root to shoot ratio for length was that the mean of the controll data was higher than the experimental. (controll: 2.510, ±0.343, fungi: 2.306, ±0.451) [Figure 2]. The results of the t_test show that the mean of the root to shoot ratio for weight was statistically different. (t_stat = 0.82, d.f. = 4, P = 0.46). The results also show that the mean of the root to shoot ratio for length was also statistically different. (t_stat = 0.62, d.f. = 4, P = 0.57). The results show that for both the weight and length ratios there was a significent difference between the two groups allowing for the interpretation to be significent.

Discussion:
The hypothesis proposed for the lab was shown to be significently supported by the statics of the two-tailed t_test of the root to shoot ratio of length; in addition to the root to shoot ratio for the weight. The Raphanus Sativuses’ ability to form a symbiotic relationship with the fungi is present and can be seen in the results by having lower weight and length ratios than the controll. The lower weight and length ratios are due to the Rhizophagus Irregularis’ symbiotic relationship with the plants, which allow the plant to allocate its resources to grow bigger and longer shoots rather than focusing on the roots and shoots. In a different study with the same fungi, the plants were shown to have an also increase in growth for the entire organism, but rather than just focus on the roots or shoots, the experiment tested how the plants grew with varying availability of phosphorus. When there is not enough phosphorus present the plants were not able to form the symbiotic relationship with the fungi, so the relationship was not very beneficial [Fiorilli: 2013]. In this case, the studies are similar in that the Raphanus Sativuses in the fungi did show a significent difference in length and weight, but they are different because the other study focused on the whole plant. Both the Ceballos and Fiorilli studies convey the same results of the Rhizophagus Irregularis increasing the overall growth of the plants in that experiment.  However, the results for the proposed experiment are possibly due to the limitation and other factors throughout the experimental process. One limitation was that when cultivating the controll group, the miracle grow was not placed on the four different controll groups, which could have caused a different outcome in the results. Not having the miracle grow was a factor that would have made the controll group grow more. Overall, the importance of the result is significent because the data represent what Raphanus Sativus growth looks like with the fungi added, and that the results are the expected outcome of the fungi making the Raphanus Sativus grow more in the shoot area. Observing the results, one might see that it is important to carefully view how the fungus’ relationship with different plants vary in the conditions the plants are in. In the future, the study could be improved by adding different types of plants to see the varying results of the plants’ allocation of resources and comparing the results to one another.
