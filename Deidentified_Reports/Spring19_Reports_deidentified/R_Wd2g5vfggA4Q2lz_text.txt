Title: The effect of high temperature on spinach photosynthetic rate

Abstract:
In this experiment, we focused mainly on monitoring the temperature effects (21.7 oC, 30 oC, 45 oC) on photosynthetic rate of spinach leaves through DCIP as alternative electron acceptors. Our hypothesis is that spinach chloroplast will have a largest decrease in absorbance at room temperature (21.7 oC) compared with 30 oC and 45 oC environments. By filtration and centrifugation, we were able to extract spinach chloroplasts from the leaves. We added substrate solution with DCIP indicator into the chloroplasts solution to allow reaction to be monitored through spectrophotometer. Data suggests solution with chloroplasts under 45 oC environment heated for 15 minutes has the largest percentage change of 86.5%. Our hypothesis is rejected given the significance from ANOVA. In this experiment, 45 oC environment provides the highest photosynthetic activity of spinach chloroplasts within 1 hour. Longer experiment may show different trends (as suggested that 6 hours heating over 45 oC environment leads to heat stress and chloroplasts deformation.[Chen, zheng,guo :2012]). The experiment may be improved by conducting experiments with a larger sample population and experiment for longer time period for more informative trend.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis, acts as the lifeline for most plants in the world, plays crucial role in energy production. Therefore, it is important for us to understand the role of photosynthesis and how it functions inside plant cells. As a complex process, photosynthesis happens in multiple steps. Three stages happen in photosynthesis, light-dependent reaction, light-independent reaction, and oxidation. The first two stages, light-dependent reactions use absorbed photons of two different wavelengths to generate reducing power in the form of NADPH. The light-independent reactions, also known as Calvin cycle, use ATP and NADPH to create 6 carbon complexes [Johnson : 2016]. Temperature influences leaf photosynthetic rates in both short and long‐terms. In the long term, a shift in growth temperature causes a shift in the optimum temperature of leaf photosynthesis, which allows the plants to perform more efficient photosynthesis at their new growth temperature [Berry & Björkman 1980].

For this experiment, we will use DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) as our alternative electron acceptors that are easier to measure than the production of oxygen [Johnson : 2016]. By measuring the activity of this Hill reaction, we are able to estimate the rate of photosynthesis in spinach chloroplasts. DCIP also acts as color indicator since oxidized DCIP is a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light at 600 nm, while reduced DCIPH2 reorganizes the bonds to conjugated double carbon bonds, making the molecule colorless (represented as decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm), so that our experiment could be monitored by spectrophotometer at 600 nm.

Our hypothesis is that spinach chloroplast will have a largest decrease in absorbance (highest efficiency) at room temperature (21.7 oC) compared with 30 oC and 45 oC environments.


Materials and Methods:
We used ice-cooled mortar & pestle to grind 6 medium-sized clean & dry spinach leaves (with veins removed) into thick paste using 15 ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Then add additional 15 ml grinding buffer into the paste and wait 15 min for the buffer to wash out chloroplasts. Strain all green slurry through six layers of cheesecloth into a chilled 150 ml beaker. Once the green solution is obtained, transfer it into a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube and labelled “A”, spin it with a balance tube at 200 X G & 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 oC. After centrifugation, pour the supernatant out of “A” into a second tube labelled “Sample A”. We only need to use the supernatant from Sample A for further experiment.

For the second half of the experiment, 19 test tubes were labelled as shown in Table 1, each reaction condition has 5 replicates except for blank and no chloroplast situation.

The assay began with 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts solution from Sample A being added to the blank tube, and to Tubes #5-19. Each tube is mixed and then transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nm using blank. Then the absorbance of all the samples were immediately measured at 600nm. They were recorded as Time Zero data points. Samples blank/ #2-9 were placed at room temperature, #10-14 in an 30 degrees celsius warm water bath, and #15-19 in a 45 degrees celsius warm water bath. After 15 minutes, the spectrophotometer was blanked with blank. Then the absorbance of each sample were recorded at 600 nm. After recording absorbance, the samples returned to their respective temperatures. The same recording process was repeated at 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and 60 minutes interval. All data points were sorted and check for significance using ANOVA.


Results:
Observed from Figure 1,, heat-treated samples all have reduced absorbance comparing with time zero samples. Among all samples, solution with chloroplasts under 45 oC environment heated for 15 minutes has the largest percentage change of 86.5%, chloroplasts treated under room temperature (21.7 oC) has a change of 59.3% ~ 38.0%, chloroplasts under 30 oC environment has a change of 72.1% ~ 56.8%, and chloroplasts treated with 45 oC heat bath has a change of 86.5% ~ 53.3%. Running ANOVA tests on each temperature condition separately, and we got the following p values: p1=0.000021 (15oC), p2=0.001151 (30 oC), p3=0.021 (45oC), p4=0.038 (60 oC).

Discussion:
According to the data and the ANOVA tests, the data is significant enough, suggesting that different temperature environments lead to different chloroplasts activity is supported. However, our hypothesis that room temperature environment produces the largest chloroplasts activity isn’t supported by the data. From Figure 1, we could assume that comparing with room temperature environment (21.7 oC), heating environment (30 oC and 45 oC) would increase the chloroplasts activity, thus increases the photosynthetic rate. As suggested by Figure 1, 45 oC environment would produce the largest percentage change in the first 60 minutes compared with those of 21.7 oC and 30 oC environments. This finding is contradicted with the article which suggests temperature above 36 oC for 2 minutes would irreversibly inactivate Hill reaction in barley chloroplasts [Nolan:1976]. Such situation occurred may be explained by following reasons. Firstly, our experiment use water bath as heating tool, apart from the volume of chloroplast solutions, we also treated these samples with ice before experiment. Therefore, the heating of the solution may spend more time than we expected, and the actual temperature of solution may be lower than the recorded 21.7 oC, 30 oC, and 45 oC during the experiment. Secondly, in this experiment we use spinach leaves instead of barley leaves as source of chloroplasts. Different plant species may have different optimal photosynthesis temperature and that may explain why the optimal temperature we found is higher than recorded in Nolan’s article. Thirdly, if we took closer look at the trends in Figure 1 we could find that room temperature chloroplasts have a concave down parabola trend, 30 oC chloroplasts have a mild decreasing trend in absorbance as time passes, and 45 oC chloroplasts have an increasing absorbance from 15 minutes to 60 minutes suggesting that a decrease in photosynthetic rate is happening. Such situation may be explained by the article saying that high temperature would reduce the Hill reaction activity. As a result, our 45 oC chloroplasts may undergo irreversible cell destructions as experiment continues, which is suggested in chen’s article that 6 hour exposure to 45 oC environment would lead to heat stress and chloroplasts deformation [Chen, zheng,guo :2012]. According to the article [Yamori, Noguchi, & Terashima :2005], long term temperature change could alter the optimal photosynthetic temperature for spinach. Therefore, longer experiment may show different trends (as one article uses 6 hours to heat the chloroplasts). The experiment may be improved by conducting experiments with a larger sample population and experiment for longer time period for more informative trend.
