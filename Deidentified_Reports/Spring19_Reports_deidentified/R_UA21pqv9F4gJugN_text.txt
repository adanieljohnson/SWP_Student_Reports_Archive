Title: An Injected dose of SEVIN, an Acetylcholine Inhibitor, has Little Effect on Muscle Contraction in Frog Leg. 

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to understand how motor neurons are affected by a certain neurotransmitter. We will observe the neuromuscular controll of a frog leg by adding an Acetylcholine inhibitor (SEVIN). As our treatment, we used SEVIN to test how the muscle reacts with and without the presence of ACh. ACh is important in motor synapses and without it, no action potential will occur. Our hypothesis is that the leg will not twitch because no action potential will occur without ACh. Through comparing three legs without SEVIN and with SEVIN we can perform statistical analysis to determine if our hypothesis is supported. We found that with the addition of SEVIN, the leg twitched less than then controll group. The percent change in response was &gt;50% for each leg, but was not great enough to prove our hypothesis significent. We used a one-tailed T-test with an alpha value of 0.5 and our P-value was 0.9 making us fail to reject the null hypothesis. We concluded that the difference in percent change could be due to an uneven distribution of SEVIN in the frog leg. To repeat this lab, this could be a controll to see if the response changes. 

Introduction:
In this lab we will be using frog legs to observe neuromuscular function of the gastrocnemus muscle under controllled and treated conditions. In order to demonstrate this, we will isolate the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from the frog leg in order to be able to administer a voltage to the muscle [Johnson:2018]. The goal is to initiate a muscle twitch and record the response under different conditions. To do this we will use a computerized system called iWorx to administer a voltage to the leg. In response we will observe a physical twitch: a twitch is one single short muscle contraction [Johnson:2018] This system records the response of the leg in voltage that is given by the twitch, which will be our primary source of data. 
The overall purpose of this lab is to understand the how the chemicals in the nervous system interacts with muscles and nerves. The way we will do this is administer a chemical impulse that will create a muscle contraction. A neurotransmitter that affects motor neurons is SEVIN which is an Acetylcholine (ACh) inhibitor. ACh is very important in muscle contraction in chemical synapses of motor neurons because ACh innervates muscle fibers which eventually create nerve impulses in muscles [Britannica:2018]. Without ACh, the postsynaptic membrane won’t be activated, and ions won’t flow, and the signal will not pass [Sadava:2016]. This makes SEVIN a great neurotransmitter to use to inhibit ACh and inhibit motor impulses. We wondered if we treat the frog leg with SEVIN how the twitches differ. We will measure this by the strength of the leg with and without ACh measured in voltage [Johnson:2018]. We hypothesize that the leg will not twitch because no action potential will occur without ACh. 
The purpose of this lab is to determine how ACh plays a role in muscle contraction observed by the injection of SEVIN which inhibits ACh. We want to determine how impactful SEVIN is decreasing muscle contraction by decreasing ACh in the motor synapse [Carpentar: 1961]. This lab will be used to determine how SEVIN affects motor impulses and determine how effective it is.



Materials and Method:
To begin this lab, we needed to prepare the frog leg. To start we removed the skin on the leg to expose the muscle, bones, and nerves. The leg was placed on a board and pinned down to prevent the frog leg from moving when it twitched. This helped to keep the probe in the leg and prevent the leg from moving out of place when the twitch is administered. The first trial we did not manipulate the leg so it could be the controll. We began by administering 1.0V at 1 Hz and recorded the voltage from the twitch. We repeated three times for the first leg before administering the SEVIN. We made sure to continuously spray the frog with frog electrolytes, so the muscle did not dry out. Once the leg had been tested three times, we injected 20mg of SEVIN directly into the muscle and waited five minutes to let the solution sink into the muscle and get into synapses. We massaged the leg in order for the solution to spread throughout the muscle and to ensure the neurotransmitter could spread to the synapses. We administered 1.0V three times and recorded the responses. Once the first leg had been tested for the controll and treatment (three times each) we repeated the same procedure with legs 2 and 3. After the procedure was finished and all legs were tested, we did a statistical analysis. We used a one-tailed T-test with an alpha value of 0.05 to compare each leg without SEVIN and with SEVIN. We took an average of the three trials of controll and treatment for leg 1-3. We tested our hypothesis by observing visually and through that data if indeed the leg twitched less with the addition of SEVIN. 

Results:
The statistical test used was a one-tailed T-test comparing the controll and treatment groups. We used the average of the three trials for legs 1-3 to calculate the p_value. Our P-value is 0.09 which is larger than the alpha value of .05, therefore our P-value is not significent. Table 1 is a representation of the data recorded for the twitch response from each leg. Each leg had three trials each for controll and treatment, the table shows the average value for each leg. The response from the treatment legs varied slightly showing a range from around 0.1V to 0.4V. On the other hand, the controll responses were very consistent only varying from 1.0V to 1.1V except for one outlier which was 0.6V.  The twitch response reduced by at least half for the treatment group for each leg leading us to believe that SEVIN affected the muscle contraction of the leg, except after statistical analysis, the P-value refuted this observation. Figure 1 shows the percent change of the controll and treatment response for leg 1-3. These values are calculated by averaging the three trials for each leg and then calculating the percent change from one to the other. In this case they are all decreased and are negative values. The percent changes were all above 50% meaning the twitch reduced by greater than half for all the legs. In all cases, the percent change did not equal 100%, meaning that none of the treatment legs did not twitch at all. 

Discussion:
We hypothesized that SEVIN would reduce the contraction of the frog leg in comparison to the controll. Our data proved this to be true because the treatment group had significently lower response voltages than the controll tests. Our P-value proved to not be significent therefore our hypothesis is not supported. Although there was a significent decrease in the twitch response, there were still sources of error in this lab. An outlier in the data is the controll group for leg 1. The average is low compared to the controll group for leg 2-3 being far less than the other two legs. The trail for leg 1 is consistent with the rest of the data according to the change in voltage. We noticed that each frog leg has a different output for the same amount of voltage applied, meaning the frogs have a different amount of ATP in their muscles. An alternate explanation for the low response in leg 1 could be that it was particularly deficient in ATP, causing a particularly low voltage twitch [Carpentar: 1961]. Although our results were consistent with our hypothesis, we can conclude that a source of error for any strange data points could be due to a different amount of massaging done per leg. The different massaging time after the insertion of SEVIN, could lead to an uneven distribution of the SEVIN, and therefore a varying twitch output. Also, the SEVIN could have been localized in different positions of the muscle because the insertion was not in the same section of the leg every trial [Johnson:2018]. SEVIN is intended to be used as a commercial pesticide [Carpentar: 1961]. An idea for future study could be to repeat this study on a muscle of another pest and compares the results to see if there is a statistical difference between the two organisms. This would be an interesting study to compare many different types of organisms to see how SEVIN impacts their muscles differently and how we can compare the physiology of their muscle systems and nerve integration [Johnson:2018]. Overall, this study displayed the neuromuscular controll of a frog leg and how it can be manipulated by an ACh inhibitor [Johnson:2018].
