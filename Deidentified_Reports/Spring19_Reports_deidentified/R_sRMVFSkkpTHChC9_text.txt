Title: The effect of nitrogen concentration on resource allocation in Pisum sativun

Abstract:
In order to maximize the success and survival of a plant in a given environment, plants must carefully allocate their resources. They allocate away from their initial seeds to increase their chances of survival depending on the availability of particular resources such as water, CO2 or other key nutrients. For this experiment, Pisum sativun was used as the organism of study to understand how their allocation of certain resources creates changes in their root to shoot(R:S) ratio when exposed to a nitrogen rich environment. It was hypothesized that the plants in the nitrogen rich environment will have a lower R:S ratio than those in the controll (just H2O) environment. To effectively test this theory, two plots of 9 seeds each were watered with 50Ml of Miracle-Gro in addition to 50Ml of H2O (experimental group), while two other plots of 9 seeds each were watered with 100Ml of H2O (controll group). The R:S ratios were then measured for weight and length. The data supported the hypothesis for weight, but not for length, with both statistics being considered significent. It is hypothesized further that the plants growth could have been completely stunted due to an oversaturated environment with regards to nitrogen, halting the plants growth as opposed to allowing it to spend and allocat

Introduction:
Plants in a variety of environments must allocate resources in particular ways to enhance their growth and subsequently survive. Plants around the world utilize different modes of allocation and cellular processes to ensure they are receiving enough sunlight, water, CO2 and other nutrients depending on the various abiotic and biotic factors they are faced with. As the human population continues to grow, so does our need for food and more efficient agricultural practices. A solution that our world quickly jumped to has been the use of fertilizers to assist with plant growth, a major component of which requires nitrogen. Compared to the other elements key to plant growth (H2O, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen), the majority of nitrogen in our environment is locked in the atmosphere, with only a small fraction being readily available for plants to intake [Smil: 1997]. This increase in the usage of nitrogen rich fertilizers has had major environmental implications and affected how plants maintain their growth and survival. Understanding how these environmental changes affect plants can provide beneficial knowledge that will not only ensure plant survival going forward, but will also allow humans to continue to live healthy lives as plants comprise major components of our diets. In order for plants to be successful, they are often forced to modify their typical allocation pattern in order to adapt to abiotic factors present. When facing resource limitation, plants can react in a multitude of ways, often growing deeper downward or higher upward to maximize nutrient absorption. We observed the R:S ratios for both length and weight of plants given a 50Ml Miracle-Gro and 50Ml H2O to simulate a nitrogen rich environment and compared it to plants given normal H2O as they would in a completely natural environment. We chose Pisum sativun, commonly referred to as field peas, as our experimental organism because they are relatively inexpensive and are readily able to be planted and grown in short periods of time. These two factors make it so field peas can be easily altered by a variety of stimuli. These plants are also very common in our society and are a staple in many human’s diets. These plants carry a variety of essential nutrients, emphasizing the importance of understanding how the environment affects them. 	

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, 9 plants of Pisum sativun were used to observe the effect of nitrogen concentration on resource allocation, and more specifically the root to shoot ratios for both length and weight. First, 9 seeds were potted in soil by making 9 divots in each of the four separate plots of soil, and one seed was placed in each of the divots. All of the seeds were then covered up with soil. The plots were then divided into two groups, with two of the plots containing 18 seeds total serving as the controll group, and the other two plots also containing 18 seeds serving as experimental group.  The plots were then placed in the greenhouse where they remained for two weeks. Each day, the two controll groups were watered with 100Ml of normal H2O, while the two experimental groups with the simulated nitrogen rich environment, were watered with 50Ml of Miracle-Gro and 50Ml of normal H2O. After doing this for two weeks, the plants were removed from the greenhouse and all of the plants were picked from the pots and cleaned by moving them through a tub of water. This cleaning process was done carefully to ensure the roots and shoots remained intact. The plants were then cut just above the seed shell where the root system met the shoot system, and each of the 27 plants roots and shoots were weighed and recorded into the data tables. Following the weighing of these plants, the lengths of each of the 27 plants was taken, and again were recorded in the data tables. The length measurements were taken from the incision at the root to shoot intersection to the end of the furthest leaf. After this was completed, the root to shoot ratios for both weight and length were determined by dividing the root weight by the shoot weight, and the root length by the shoot length. Once all of our data was collected, a two-tailed t_test was completed for both length and weight, comparing the R:S ratio for length and weight between both the controll and experimental groups.

Results:
The results from this experiment show that the R:S ratio for length was higher in the experimental group when compared to the controll group, with the opposite being true when looking at the R:S ratio for weight. Figure 1 indicates the R:S ratio for the controll group given only100Ml of H2O compared to the experimental group which was treated with 50Ml of H2O and 50Ml of Miracle-Gro (nitrogen treatment). Looking at weight, the experimental group had a mean and standard deviation of 1.790  0.877 grams and the controll group had a mean and standard deviation of 1.097  0.239 grams. Looking at length, the experimental group had a mean and standard deviation of 0.918  0.304 grams and the controll group had a mean and standard deviation of 0.702  0.092 grams. P-values above 0.05 suggest no significent difference between controll and experimental groups.

Discussion:
For this experiment, our data supported our hypothesis for weight, but not for length. The R:S ratio for weight was lower in the experimental group then in the controll group, while the R:S ratio for length was higher in the experimental group compared to the controll. Nitrogen plays a key role in plant growth and survival and its abundance in soil or lack thereof can have major implications on plant growth. The primary method for nitrogen intake is through the root systems of plants. This fact supports the notion for why the R:S ratio for weight was lower in the experimental group. Due to the abundance of nitrogen in the soil, there is less of a need for the roots to fortify themselves in order to better absorb the nitrogen already abundant in the soil, decreasing their weight and lowering the R:S ratio. This allocation of energy also allows the plant to dedicate more of its resources to the shoot system, further decreasing the R:S ratio. Too much exposure to Nitrogen can be detrimental to the overall growth of the plant, as this element displaces other essential nutrients in the soil, causing mineral deficiencies for the plant, hurting its chance of survival [Moffat: 1998]. However, nitrogen deficiency in soil can be just as harmful as over-exposure, demonstrating the need for a homeostatic balance between the element and its environment. Nitrogen deficiency can significently reduce overall leaf area, the presence of chlorophyll and subsequently the plant’s overall ability to perform photosynthesis [Zhao: 2005]. When analyzing the lengths of plants, the R:S ratio of the experimental group was higher than that of the controll group. This difference could be because in the experimental group, the roots extended as far as possible in search for valuable nutrients like nitrogen. Due to this essential resource being scarcer, the plant allocated more resources to its root system to ensure the presence of this necessary nutrient within the soils composition.
