Title: The impacts of creatine on the muscle threshold level of the Anura 

Abstract:
Understanding how the neuromuscular systems works and can be altered is important to help us understand how animals react and interact with their environment. Recent research has looked at how solutions, such as caffeine, can be injected to the muscle to change the muscle threshold voltage. Our experiment hypothesizes that if we inject the gastronomic muscle of an Anura with the workout solution Creatine, then there will be a change in threshold voltage compared to the control trial. We recorded the control threshold voltage and the threshold voltage after Creatine injection with an electromyogram. We analyzed the data using a paired t-test. After analysis, we determined our hypothesis was not supported and that further experimentation is needed to reject the null hypothesis. Further research on the effects of workout solutions on muscle contractions will help us better our understanding on how our bodies react to the environment and how we can alter these responses with external substances. 

Introduction:
Understanding how the neuromuscular systems works and can be altered is important to help us understand how animals react and interact with their environment. Recent research has looked at how solutions, such as caffeine, can be injected to the muscle to change the muscle threshold voltage. Our experiment hypothesizes that if we inject the gastronomic muscle of an Anura with the workout solution Creatine, then there will be a change in threshold voltage compared to the control trial. We recorded the control threshold voltage and the threshold voltage after Creatine injection with an electromyogram. We analyzed the data using a paired t-test. After analysis, we determined our hypothesis was not supported and that further experimentation is needed to reject the null hypothesis. Further research on the effects of workout solutions on muscle contractions will help us better our understanding on how our bodies react to the environment and how we can alter these responses with external substances. 

Materials and Methods:
We randomly selected three different legs harvested from the Anura. Each leg will experience both the control and experimental conditions. The first data set was taken from the muscle exposed to no manipulation. This group acted as a control comparison group to our experimental manipulation group. The second data set was taken from the same three legs after they are injected with Creatine. To begin the process, we skinned the leg of the Anura, separated the gastrocnemius muscle from the lower half of the leg and exposed the sciatic nerve. Second, we attached the leg to an electromyography machine to and placed two electrodes on the sciatic nerve to stimulate muscle contraction. We used a computer program to discover and record the voltage levels of muscle contraction threshold in the controlled condition. For the third step of discovering the threshold, we started to stimulate the muscles at .00mV and increased the voltage by a hundredth of a millivolt until an action potential was detected. Once the control threshold was detected we injected the gastronomes muscle with three milliliters and waited three minutes for the solution to take effect in the muscle. We then repeated steps for detecting the threshold and recorded the voltage from the manipulation group. After the data was gathered, we calculated the differences between the threshold voltages. Finally, a paired t-test was used to determine if there was a significance difference between the voltage of muscle threshold with no manipulation and after an injection of Creatine.  

Results:
The control group possessed a mean threshold voltage of 0.09 mV while the experimental group possessed a mean threshold voltage of 0.11 mV (Figure 1). The standard deviation of the threshold voltage for the control group was 0.09 and the standard deviation for the experimental group was 0.08 (Figure 2). We used a within subject paired t-test to analyze the results.  There was no significant difference in threshold voltage between Creatine injection (M = 0.11, SD = 0.08) and non-Creatine injection (M = 0.09, SD = 0.06, MDiff = 0.02, SDDiff = .03), t-stat = 0.95, df = 2, P = 0.444. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that after the injection of Creatine in the muscle there would be a difference in muscle threshold, was not supported. Our recorded p-value indicates that our results were not statistically significant and were largely due to probable chance. We should retain our null hypothesis that Creatine has no effect on muscle threshold level. Many factors may contribute to these insignificant findings. One possible explanation is that there was too much solution injected into the muscle, inhibiting its function. Another possible explanation is that we did not have a long enough wait period between injection and retesting; the solution did not have enough time to diffuse across the muscle. These insignificant results are important to note because it is a preliminary study for determining the effects of Creatine on muscle contraction. It provides a starting point for future studies. Further research is important because it helps us to better understand the impact of Creatine and other workout supplements have on our body. It will allow us to see if the supplement actually helps or is just a placebo. Future studies will also help better our understanding of how our bodies react to our environment and how this reaction time can be altered.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The two bars represent the mean muscle threshold level for both the no creatine injected trial (control group, n=3)  and the creatine injected trial (experimental group, n =3). The point of threshold on the y-axis is measured in millivolts. Figure 2: The two bars indicate the same averages of figure one with an overlay of the standard deviation of both groups. The standard deviation indicates the amount variation from the mean of our data points.*************************************************************************
