Title: The Lack of Effect of Different Color Pigments in Leaves on the Rate of Photosynthesis of Lactuca Sativa

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes on the planet.  Photosynthesis occurs in every plant on the planet no matter what shape, size, or color.  In our experiment, the rate of photosynthesis is measured in Lactuca sativa with a green color pigmentation, and a purple color pigmentation.  This purple color in the lettuce comes from anthocyanins, and we wanted to see if anthocyanins influenced the rate of photosynthesis.  In order to measure this rate of photosynthesis, the plants were grinded and centrifuged before finally being measured in a spectrophotometer over time.  The end results did not show a significent difference between the purple and green leaves.  This means that the anthocyanins and the purple color did not have any significent effect on the rate of photosynthesis.

Introduction:
There are many chemical processes in plants that have important effects on all life on Earth.  These basic plant functions and reactions occur in many organisms all over the planet.  One of these such organisms is Lactuca sativa, green and purple lettuce.  This organism undergoes photosynthesis and is relatively easy to grind and centrifuge which then allows for easy measurement of the rate of photosynthesis.   Photosynthesis is one of the most vital chemical processes on the planet.  This process involves plants taking up light, carbon dioxide, and water in order to make usable sugars and energy in the form of ATP.  An important byproduct of this reaction is oxygen.  Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration in animals or any other life forms that require oxygen and the combination of these two reactions make all life on earth possible [Johnson: 2016].  There are two main stages of photosynthesis, the light and the dark reactions.  The first is called the light reactions because light energy is used to excite electrons which then power a proton gradient and generate ATP and NADPH.  This NADPH then goes to the Calvin Cycle, also known as the dark reactions.  This cycle uses ATP and NADPH to create G3P, which can be used as an energy storing molecule for the night when there is no sunlight available [Johnson: 2016].  Both the light and dark reactions occur within different areas of the chloroplasts.  In order to best measure the rate of photosynthesis, a molecule of DCIP will be used.  In this experiment, DCIP acts as an alternative electron acceptor and is therefore reduced.  DCIP is a dark blue molecule but becomes colorless when reduced to DCIPH2 which allows for an absorbance change to be measured with a spectrophotometer [Johnson: 2016].  In this experiment, the rate of photosynthesis will be measured in both green and purple lettuce.  This idea was chosen because purple lettuce contains anthocyanins which turns the leaves a purple color.   In an experiment done by R.E. Smillie, anthocyanins were found to minimize photodamage to photosynthetic tissues [Smillie: 1999].  We believed that this protection against photodamage could also somehow increase the rate of photosynthesis in these plants since there would be less damage to chloroplasts. Our main question and the reason for this experiment was to find out if anthocyanins did in fact have an effect on the rate of photosynthesis in purple colored leaves.  Since purple leaves have anthocyanins, and anthocyanins protect from photodamage, we hypothesized that the purple lettuce would photosynthesize more because of an unknown effect of anthocyanins on photosynthetic abilities in the leaves.  Whether or not different pigmentations of leaves affected the rate of photosynthesis could have had huge impacts on how humans view nature.  While it would probably be unable to stop the rate at which humans are generating CO2, leaves that have increased photosynthetic abilities and take up more CO2 could potentially slow down the rate of emissions that humans produce and the effect we have on planet Earth as a whole.  


Materials and Method:
First, a mortar and pestle was used to grind up green spinach leaves along with grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). The large chunks of the leaves were then strained out.  The solution that passed through the strainer was centrifuged at 200 x G for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was poured out into another tube and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 x G for 10 minutes.  Finally, the supernatant was poured out and then the pellet was resuspended with grinding solution.  This entire process was then repeated with the purple leaves.  For the final step of the experiment, a blank needed to be made.  3 trials of the green leaves, the purple leaves, and no chloroplasts all needed to be made as well.  These tubes all included water, DCIP so that the absorbance could be measured, reaction buffer, and chloroplasts in the tubes that needed chloroplasts.  The spectrophotometer was set to 600 nm and a blank was set.  An initial absorbance needed to be taken, and then another absorbance was taken every 10 minutes for 30 minutes.  A paired T-Test was used to determine significance.  


Results:
The P value found from the paired T-test was found to be p = 0.245.  This means that any difference in the data was not significent.  As for general trends in the data, the solution without chloroplasts did not drop in absorbance nearly as quick as the two solutions with chloroplasts.  The green and purple lettuce also seemed to drop at a similar rate.  Based on Figure 1., after the first 10 minutes, the absorbances of both the green and purple lettuce dropped to about 92% of the initial absorbance.  They both then dropped to about 86% for the green and 87% for the purple at 20 minutes.  Finally they both dropped to 86% for the last measurement at 30 minutes.  The solution with no chloroplasts initially dropped to about 96% after the first 10 minutes but stayed near this absorbance for the remainder of the time.     



Discussion:
Based on the P value determined by the paired T-test, there was no statistical difference between the rates of photosynthesis of the green lettuce and the purple lettuce.  This means that the null hypothesis was accepted, and the alternative hypothesis was rejected.  As photosynthetic rate increased in the plant over time the percent change also went down.  The graph clearly showed that the green and purple lettuce had a photosynthetic rate, but not that there was any difference between the two.  In an experiment focused on temperature and its effect on photosynthetic rates on plants with anthocyanins, the anthocyanins were shown to not inhibit any photosynthetic ability, and that temperature only slightly had an effect [Orin-Shamir: 2015]. This means that the anthocyanins and the purple color did not have an effect on the photosynthetic rate.  Some more supporting data came from an experiment done by Samuel O. Neill.  In his experiment, anthocyanins seemed to have a protective effect on photobleaching in the cells rather than an effect on photosynthesis [Neill: 2003].  This supported our data because the anthocyanins did not really have an effect on photosynthesis but were actually in the leaves to protect from photobleaching from the sun.  In total, the alternative hypothesis was not supported and there was no significent difference between the green and purple lettuce.  One possibility for this lack of a significent difference between the green and purple lettuce may actually be because the anthocyanins never got into the final solution.  Anthocyanins are located in the vacuole and the centrifuge removed almost every part of the cell excluding the chloroplasts [Pecket: 1980].  The anthocyanins could never have had an effect on the photosynthetic ability of the chloroplasts if they were centrifuged out and never made it to the final solution.  Some possible future experiments might include trying to see how the rate of photosynthesis changes when purple and green leaves are left in direct bright light for extended amounts of time.  Since anthocyanins seem to be a way for plants to protect themselves from photobleaching, the green leaves should theoretically have lower rates of photosynthesis after the leaves begin to bleach.  Another possible experiment could be trying to find a way to make sure that the anthocyanins make it into the final solution and then measuring photosynthetic ability.  This would then finally determine whether or not anthocyanins do actually have an effect on photosynthetic ability.  Rates of photosynthesis are very important for us to understand.  Photosynthesis is a driving force for life on Earth and it is very important for humanity to understands as much as is possible about the reaction.  For these reasons, understanding anthocyanins is a very important topic that needs to be more fully explored and worked with.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1:  This is a graph of percent absorbance versus time.  As time moves forward, the percent absorbance goes down as the rate of photosynthesis moves forward.  The initial absorbance was taken and then all other absorbances were based off that first point.  The three lines are for No chloroplasts as a negative controll, purple lettuce as the experimental, and green lettuce as the positive controll.  The error bars show a range 1% above and below the average in which all absorbances are found.
