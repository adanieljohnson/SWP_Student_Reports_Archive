Title: The Effect of Caffeine on the Neuromuscular controll of [Rania pipiens]

Abstract:
This experiment observed the effects of caffeine on muscle response. The test subject of the experiment was the leg, specifically stimulating the Gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve, of [Rania pipiens]. It was hypothesized that when injected with caffeine, the frog leg after caffeine will experience stronger muscle contractions in response to the same stimulus than the leg before caffeine was injected. The legs were tested by recording the response to .5 amps of stimulus before and during caffeine injection. The average stimulus response was higher after the muscle was injected with caffeine than before. This is likely because caffeine increased the skeletal muscle contraction through increasing calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Introduction:
In vertebrates, muscle contractions rely on complex signals communicated from the nervous system to the skeletal muscle. Action potentials move through a muscle fiber, stimulating the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that causes the muscle fiber to contract and shorten. If a muscle is stimulated long enough, it will fatigue when it runs out of ATP [Johnson: 2018]. Muscle contraction properties can be affected by many factors, such as the chemical environment of the muscle. This experiment aims to look at the effects of caffeine on the response amplitude in the legs of [Rania pipiens]. Caffeine is a known central nervous system stimulant that temporarily promotes alertness [Rosser:2009]. The test subject is the Gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve in [Rania pipiens]. It is hypothesized that when injected with caffeine, the frog leg with caffeine will experience stronger muscle contractions in response to the same stimulus.

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were obtained. The Gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of each leg were prepared by skinning each leg. Each leg was doused with frog Ringer’s solution to keep them moist. The stimulus probe was attached to the muscle of the first leg. It was stimulated with .5 amps and the response amplitude was recorded in volts. The muscle was then injected with .1 Ml of 200 mM caffeine while recording a response to .5 amp. The response voltage was recorded by taking the mean of three “fire” mechanism responses. This method was repeated for all three frog legs. A paired t_test was used for statistical analysis.

Results:
The average stimulus response was higher after the muscle was injected with caffeine (1.638 V +/- 0.281 STD) than before (0.735 V +/- 0.202 STD) (Figure 1). The difference between the mean volts was not statistically significent (p= 0.055) with an alpha of 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval.



Discussion:
The hypothesis that the frog leg after injected with caffeine would experience stronger muscle contractions in response to the same stimulus was not supported because the difference between the stimulus response before vs after caffeine was not statistically significent. The mean stimulus response was higher with caffeine than without it. This is likely because caffeine, a common central nervous system stimulant, increases skeletal muscle contraction through increasing calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the muscle fibers [Friel: 1992]. This causes more calcium ions to bind to troponin, uncovering myosin binding sites and that allow for a power stroke to happen in the muscle fiber. The increased calcium ion release resulted in a sustained contraction of the muscle [Kumar, Tomar: 2005]. The experiment should be replicated again in order to run further statistical tests on the significance of the data in order to determine if the higher mean after caffeine was injected was due to chance. It would be very informative to expand the experiment to different types of muscle, such as cardiac and smooth muscle, to see if it responds in the same way to caffeine as skeletal muscle does. This could lead to a greater understanding about what affects heart health or digestive health if either type of muscle responds in certain negative or positive ways to caffeine levels.
