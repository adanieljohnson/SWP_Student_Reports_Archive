Title: Juvenile hormone mimic effects on Manduca sexta caterpillar growth

Abstract:
Insect hormones affect the growth and development of insects. When studying insects, it is important to know how certain hormones affect the growth processes, such as the molting stage, of insects. Here we look at the effect of adding JH mimic, and insect growth regulator (IGR) to Manduca sexta caterpillar diets. The expectation of this experiment was that the experimental group that was fed JH mimic in their food would have a significantly different average rate in weight change over fourteen days. The results showed that the average weight change over fourteen days for the control group was 0.5485g, and the average weight change over fourteen days for the experimental group with JH mimic added to the food was 0.747g. Visual observations were inconclusive; one cannot could not tell a difference between the control and experimental groups. Our data showed no significant difference between the average rate of weight change of the control group of Manduca sexta caterpillars and the experimental group of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The lack of significance could suggest the experiment was not given enough time. Learning and understanding more about insect hormones, specifically JH, could give us a broader understanding of how hormones affect insect development and the molting stage 

Introduction:
This experiment tests the effects of insect hormones on insect weight change. Hormones are extremely important in affecting an insect’s growth and development—they are chemical signals that affect target cells and receptors. Puberty can be used as a metaphor for an insect’s molting stage. Like when humans transition to adulthood through puberty, insects transition to adulthood through molting. Molting can accomplish many different things, like changes in size or changes in form [Nijhout: 1981]. The Manduca sexta, the insect of interest in this experiment, experiences molting [Nijhout: 1981]. Insect molting is controlled by two major hormones: ecdysteriods and juvenile hormone (JH). Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) play an important role in altering the processes regulated by hormones. JH, an IGR, is present during the larvae stage, allowing growth and progression through the larval stage until insects are ready for metamorphosis [Riddiford: 2003]. If JH is absent in the caterpillar at the time of metamorphosis, then molting occurs; however, if JH is added during the final larval stages, the switch from larva to molting does not occur [Riddford: 2003]. In this experiment, the hormone JH mimic was used as to mimic the effects of the juvenile hormone. The experiment consists of adding JH mimic in Manduca sexta caterpillars’ food and the evaluation of the caterpillars’ weight change over fourteen days, using physical appearance as a gauge for observations. We hypothesized that if JH mimic is added to the Manduca sexta’s diet to increase JH levels, then this increase will affect the weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar when compared to the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were split into two groups of four; one group served as the control group and the other group served as the experimental group. Each day, every caterpillar in the control group was fed regular amounts of untreated caterpillar food (10g) with seven drops of water added in, and every caterpillar in the experimental group was fed a regular amount of treated food (10g), with seven drops of JH mimic added in. The caterpillars had food every day, and the food was replaced when necessary or when the caterpillars ate it all. For fourteen days, all eight caterpillars were weighed daily, and the masses were recorded. Visual observations were made every day throughout the fourteen-day period. Pictures were taken of the caterpillars for visual reference after each day. When not observing, feeding, or weighing caterpillars, the caterpillars were kept in an incubator under the same conditions, such as sunlight, temperature, and space. A two tailed t-test was used to determine if the difference in weights of the control group and the experimental group was significant or not.

Results:
After the experiment was completed, the average weight change over fourteen days for the control group was found to be 0.5485g, and for the experimental group with JH mimic added to the food, it was found to be 0.747g. When statistical testing was applied, the two tailed t-test calculated a p-value of 0.282. At the conclusion of the fourteen-day experiment, the caterpillars’ appearances in both the control group and the experimental group varied. In the experimental group, one caterpillar was dead. Another’s coloring suggested that it was getting ready to die. The other two looked relatively healthy. In the control group, only one caterpillar appeared completely healthy. One had completely molted. Another had a ring around its neck, so it could not molt. The final caterpillar appeared slightly off-color, yellowish rather than its normal bright green. Figure 1 shows the average change in weights of the experimental and control group over a two-week period.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that if juvenile hormone mimic is added to the Manduca sexta’s diet in order to increase juvenile hormone levels in the insect, then this increase will affect the weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar, was not supported by this experiment. The two-tailed t test showed results over the 0.05 level (0.282), thus meaning that there was no significant difference between the two groups of caterpillars’ weight changes. The alternate hypothesis was rejected while the null hypothesis was supported; JH mimic does not appear to have an effect on the weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars. According to studies, JH directs the action of ecdysone and 20E; its presence does not allow the hormones to switch from a larva to a pupa, therefore inhibiting the molting process [Riddiford: 2003]. Taking this into account, even though the null hypothesis was accepted, it is possible that the experiment was not given enough time. Perhaps the Manduca sexta caterpillars were not given enough time with the presence of JH in their diets in order to see the results the alternate hypothesis supported. At this point in the experiment, the null hypothesis is accepted. Despite this, hormones are still extremely important in regulating insect development. Further studies on the effects of JH hormone on insects could increase understanding about insects’ molting process and the effects hormones have on caterpillar weight change. Additionally, insect hormones control the molting process, in which the insect is metamorphosed into an adult [Nijhout: 1981]. Understanding more about the effects of insect hormones could further explore how they control the growth process, development, and the molting stage of the insects themselves.

Figure 1. The effect of JH mimic on Manduca sexta caterpillars’ weights. Control group (first bar) had an average weight change of 0.5485g. Experimental group (second bar) had an average weight change of 0.747g. Experimental Manduca sexta caterpillars were exposed to 7 drops of JH mimic in their diets, while the control group had seven drops of water added to their diets. Weights of all eight caterpillars were recorded each day. The average rate of change in weight for each caterpillar was calculated, and a two tailed t-test was performed.  *************************************************************************
