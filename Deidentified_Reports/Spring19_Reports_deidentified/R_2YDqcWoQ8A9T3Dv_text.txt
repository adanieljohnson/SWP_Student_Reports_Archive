Title: The effect of heat on the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts

Abstract:
In typical plants and some bacteria, the photosynthesis reaction is the most important process as it facilitates plants to capture and extract from the sun, water, and the air the energy and resources that are vital for sustaining their lives. Photosynthesis can be divided into light-dependent and independent reactions, and light-dependent reactions contain photosystem II and I. Temperature is one of the factors that affect chloroplast activity. In this experiment, the universality of the theory of decreasing in photosynthetic rate of chloroplasts with the increase in temperature was tested. The chloroplasts from spinach leaves were treated under room temperature, 30 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees Celsius for 60 minutes and the ones in the 45-degree Celsius environment had a significantly smaller percentage change in light absorbance than any other groups in the experiment due to the damage in PS II and electron transport chain. For further study, we hope to investigate the effects of heat in the photosynthesis of chloroplasts with more diverse types of plants.


Introduction:
The word “photosynthesis” literally stands for the synthesis with light. In typical plants and some bacteria, the photosynthesis reaction is the most important process as it facilitates plants to capture and extract from the sun, water and the air the energy and resources that are vital for sustaining their lives. The energy is then stored in the form of carbohydrates, and the energy they have can be released through the process of glycolysis and respiration. This reaction is widely regarded as the world’s most important reaction as it provides food sources for mankind from the ancient time and power source for industries nowadays. [James:1949] To examine the significance of photosynthesis, the best way is to consider the consequences of its absence. During the period when the extinction of the dinosaurs took place, the strike of the asteroid ejected dust into the atmosphere. The sun was blocked and thus the photosynthesis process in the plants was shut down. Although the interruption of the reaction was not at all long, the consequences it brought was tremendous, as over 90% of the biological species were wiped out. [Robert:2014] The process of photosynthesis can be divided into three stages. The first two stages are light-dependent stages, during which the proton gradient needed for ATP synthesis and the NADPH needed for energy storage. The energy is then stored in the form of carbohydrates through the carbon assimilation process, which is the light-independent reactions. Both light-dependent and independent reactions take place in the chloroplasts of the plant cells. The light-dependent reactions take place on the thykaloids, which are membrane-bound compartments inside chloroplasts. The light-dependent reaction consists of 2 systems: photosystem II and I. The energy carried by photons can be absorbed through photosystem II and in it create a proton gradient essential for ATP synthesis. The energy is then transferred to photosystem I, where NADPHs are produced as electron carriers that store energy for further reactions inside chloroplasts. The measurement of the output and reaction rate of a particular part of the whole photosynthesis is vital for figuring out factors that affect the chloroplast activities. This can be achieved through the Hill reaction by replacing the electron acceptor of photosystem II to an alternative one. DCIP is used in this experiment as the alternative electron acceptor. Because the reduction of DCIP to DCIPH2 shifts its color from the original dark blue color to none, by measuring the light-absorbance of the reaction solution can the activity of the reaction be monitored. Temperature is one of the factors that affect chloroplast activity. In a previous study, the effects of change in temperature on the Hill reaction activity of barley chloroplasts was examined. Though the activity of photosystem II was still increasing when the temperature was raised from 20 degrees Celsius, the amount of increase was decreasing, and the activity came to a decline at 29 degrees Celsius, followed by a significant and irreversible decrease in activity above the temperature 40 degrees Celsius. [Nolan:1976] This result coincides with the study carried out by Chen on the effects of high temperature on the photosynthesis in fingered citron. A significant decrease in photosynthetic rate was observed when the fingered citron is exposed to 40 degrees and 45 degrees Celsius. [Chen:2012] The disruption in photosynthetic activity was also observed in the experiment of Mathur’s. [Mathur:2014] In this experiment, the universality of this outcome of decreasing in photosynthetic rate with the increase in temperature was tested. Spinach leaves were selected as a source of chloroplasts. The hypothesis of this experiment is that chloroplasts at room temperature will experience the largest decrease in light absorbance at 600nm compared those in 30 degrees and 45 degrees Celsius after 60 minutes. The smaller decrease in light absorbance indicates the decline in photosynthetic rate as the color shift caused by Hill reaction is reduced.


Materials and Methods:
A mortar and pestle were packed, and a medium-sized beaker (150-250 ml size), and three 50 ml centrifuge tubes were put into crushed ice to cool. The large central veins from 6 medium-sized spinach leaves were removed and the remaining leaf pieces were rinsed with tap water and dried. The dried spinach leaf pieces were then added into the cooled down mortar. Fifteen ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added to the mortar and the spinach leaves were ground until they turned into a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. An additional 15 ml of grinding buffer was mix with the spinach slurry and remained static for 3 minutes for buffer to wash out chloroplasts. The entire volume of the green slurry was filtered through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. The green mixture was transferred into a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was poured out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube. Nineteen test tubes were cleaned and prepared as shown in table 1 and placed in a tube rack. Five replicates were prepared for each of the treatment except for the blank and no chloroplast treatment groups. The spectrophotometer was turned on and set to detect light absorbance at 600nm.   One hundred μl of the enriched chloroplasts prepared in the cooled beaker in the first part of the experiment was added to the blank tube and tubes 4-18. Each tube was mixed immediately after adding chloroplasts. The mixtures were then transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. The blank tube was used to set the spectrophotometer at 600 nm to blank. Then the absorbances of all the samples at 600nm were measured immediately. Tube blank and #1-8 were placed at room temperature, #9-13 were placed in a 30 degrees Celsius warm water bath, and #14-18 in a 45 degrees Celsius warm water bath. For every 15 minutes, the spectrophotometer was set to blank using the mixture in the first test tube, and the absorbance of each sample was measured and recorded. This step was repeated three more times until it had been one hour since the chloroplasts were put under different environments. A one-way ANOVA statistical test was used to test if there was any significant difference between the control group and experimental groups, and three experimental groups treated under different temperatures.


Results:
The mean percentage absorbance change of the no chloroplast group was (2.380+/-1.303), (15.266+/-5.549) for the room temperature group, (9.213+/-4.208) for the 30 degrees Celsius group and (-18.283+/-11.546) for the 45 degrees Celsius group. (figure 1) The result of the ANOVA test indicated that there was a significant difference (p = 0.000022) in the mean percentage absorbance change of chloroplasts of four groups. The further test indicated that the group treated at 45 degrees Celsius had a significantly smaller mean percentage absorbance change than all the other sections. No significant difference was indicated between other groups.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was partly supported by the ANOVA test, indicating that chloroplasts treated in the 45-degree Celsius environment had a significantly smaller percentage change in light absorbance than any other groups in the experiment. Observing figure 2, the percentage change of absorbance of the 45-degree Celsius group is negative, indicating that it had decreased over time. This can be interpreted as the rate of Hill reaction decreased, and photosynthetic rate decreased in this group after 60 minutes of treatment. This can be concluded as that the ability of the chloroplasts from the spinach leaves to conduct photosynthesis was reduced with the exposure to the high temperature. This result echoes with the previous experiment on barley chloroplasts and fingered citron, which both noticed a significant decline in the photosynthetic rate after the chloroplasts were exposed at 45 degree Celsius. [Nolan:1976] [Chen:2012] Also, in our experiment, though not significant, a decrease in the photosynthetic rate was observed when comparing the group exposed to 30-degree Celsius temperature with the one treated at room temperature. As Nolan stated in his study with the barley chloroplasts, at 29 degrees Celsius (which is close to our 30-degree Celsius condition), though some thermal inactivation began to be present, the temperature-induced changes in chloroplast membranes are reversible. When the temperature is raised to just below 40 degrees, the activity declined with time was not regained by decreasing temperature, indicating that some irreversible damages of the chloroplasts were made. [Nolan:1976] The theory of the temperature-induced damage to the chloroplasts is further explained by Chen, who discovers the reduction of carbon assimilation, inactivation of photosystem II and photosynthetic electron transport to have caused the decline. [Chen:2012] In Marthur’s study, he breaks down into details and explains the mechanisms of photosystem II’s responses to heat stress. For photosystem II, he indicates the two key factors that make it most susceptible to heat stress is the first is the increase in fluidity of thylakoid membranes at high temperature, causing the dislodging of PSII light harvesting complexes from thylakoid membrane. The second is the dependence of PSII integrity on electron dynamics. He also interprets the effect of high temperature on plastoquinone, the electron carrier, and other processes in photosystem II that might have cause the decline in photosynthetic rate due to the heat. [Mathur:2014] To concluded from this experiment and refer to past literature, we discovered that one hour of exposure of spinach chloroplasts to temperature as high as 45 degrees Celsius can already cause irreversible damage to the photosystem II and electron transport chain. The reason why the 36-degree Celsius group was not significant was probably due to that the inactivation of the photosystem II was reversible and slight, and during the process of transporting the samples from heat bath to place for measurement, the system might have already recovered a bit from the heat stress. Studying the effect of temperature on the photosynthesis of plants has a practical impact the related fields such as agriculture, as farmers can manipulate the growth temperature of specific plants for better photosynthesis, resulting in better harvest. One of the shortcomings of this experiment is that the exposure of the chloroplasts to the heat was too short in time, and for further study, we hope to investigate the effects of heat in the photosynthesis of chloroplasts from more diverse types of plants.
