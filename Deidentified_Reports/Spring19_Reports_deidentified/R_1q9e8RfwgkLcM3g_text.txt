Title: Additional juvenile hormone (JH) on development of Manduca sexta.

Abstract:
The objective of the study was to determine the effect juvenile hormone on the development and growth of Manduca sexta. This organism follows a holometabolous lifecycle, which is most prominently defined by the period in time when it is ready to pupate—commitment pulse. It was hypothesized that an increase in juvenile hormone would in fact delay the commitment pulse of the Manduca sexta and maintain a significently lower overall mass than the controll. Manduca sexta were isolated into containers receiving both the controll and treatment food samples. The highest weight was recorded for each caterpillar, as it would indicate when the caterpillar has reached its commitment pulse and/or developmental stage. Trend seemed to show very little difference between the groups. The p_value was p = 0.427377 at an alpha- 0.05. The averages of the highest weights were essentially the same, which supports that there was no significent difference between the groups. 

Introduction:
Model organisms are an optimal standard for testing biological processes when exposed to distinctive variables. The Manduca sexta, order Lepidoptera, is one model organism that helps biologists study behaviors regarding holometabolous lifecycles.   The Manduca sexta’s holometabolous life cycle is characterized by several sequenced stages. The most regarded stage is the larvae stage, where the Manduca sexta resemble a vermiform structure. They remain in this stage for roughly 18-23 days under constant conditions. This time period is further divided into instars: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th. Each instar can be classified by molting in which the epidermal cells secrete a fresh cuticle. Layers of cells dividing the instars, driven by the cuticle formation, allows the Manduca sexta to further change in size and shape.   This life cycle can be manipulated by changes in endocrine function. The developmental stages are controllled by both neural and hormonal based signaling. The insect receives a signal from the body to the brain, which releases biochemicals causing hormonal changes based upon what was exposed to the organism. Neural pathways or hormonal pathways will help the organism adapt to the environment (activation) and can also change the body structure of the organism as part of growth and development (organizational).  Treatment groups of Manduca sexta can be easily changed by hormonal biochemicals. One type of hormone that will be tested on the Manduca sexta is juvenile hormone (JH)— large, chained organic molecules produced by the glands situated on the corpus allata. Juvenile hormone serves to regulate the developmental molting process. Similar to the processes of juvenile hormone, ecdysterone (20E)— secreted biochemical produced by cells in the prothoracic glands—regulates the timing of molting in organismal development. Both hormones serve a large purpose in that they are not able to keep the organism alive unless they are present in the Manduca sexta’s system. Depending on the instar larval stage, these hormonal releases fluctuate, signaling the organism’s eclosion period.  Several studies have showed a major significance in juvenile hormone in relation to ecdysterone in other model organisms [Johnson 2016]. Nijhout et. al (1974) determined that the occurrence of juvenile hormone impacts the prothoracicotropic hormone. It was found that at approximately 5 grams, the larvae have reached the stage where they distinctly stop secreting juvenile hormone due to the PTTH.    
Unique to the Manduca sexta, recognize the commitment pulse (B), in which the organism is large enough to store nutrients and pupate. The significance is that it is the point at which the caterpillar experiences an increase in E20 and a low-level JH, which signals this point of transition [Johnson 2016]. A study conducted by Nijhout (1975) found early that the maximum potential size a larva can be directly correlated to the dimensions of the sclerotized part of the body in terms of Dyar’s rule. An organism has a mechanism to record its absolute size through hormonal and neural biochemical pathways (Nijhout: 1975).  Several noticeable changes will also occur. The organism will encounter a wandering behavior, transcription for protein synthesis will increase, the cuticle will thin out, dorsal bars will become visible on the head, and the cuticle will resemble a brown/black color.  The experiment that we conducted intends to utilize increase juvenile hormone to change the hormonal and neural pathways of the Manduca sexta. Researchers expected this manipulation to delay the recognition of the commitment pulse in the organism to inhibit or interrupt pupation. It was hypothesized that an increase in juvenile hormone would in fact delay the commitment pulse of the Manduca sexta and maintain a significently lower overall mass than the controll. 



Materials and Method:
The experiment conducted involved isolating eight Manduca sexta, whom were each divided into a controll and treatment group. Each group was separated by taking four caterpillars for the controll and four caterpillars for the treatment. Both groups received a container with four subdivided sections, where each caterpillar would have their own environment to continue their lifecycle. The controll group served as the basis for experimental comparison. They were given a standard of ten grams of food and seven drops of distilled water. The treatment group were given the same (ten) grams of food with roughly seven drops of juvenile hormone. Over and interval of two weeks, the caterpillars were kept in an incubator to ensure a constant environment for them to grow. Each day, the caterpillars were weighted using an electronic balance. Weight served as a crucial element to the experiment, as weight informs researchers of the developmental stage each of the caterpillars encounter before pupation. The setup is represented by Figure 3. The highly observed measures were the peak weights of the caterpillars to identify how juvenile hormone impacted growth of the caterpillars compared to the controll. A two-sample t_test was conducted to statistically link the association of mean highest weights of the caterpillars of each group.

Results:
The results yielded the following statistics. The t-value was recorded as t = -0.1911 at degrees of freedom of 3. The p_value was p = 0.427377. Standard mean error for the controll group was found to be roughly 0.58664 and treatments was found to be 0.96003. Standard deviation for the controll and treatment groups were 1.1732966 and 1.920076, respectively. Mass was recorded in grams throughout the experiment. Average highest recorded mass for the controll was recorded as 10.08750.59. Average highest recorded mass for the treatment was 10.30250.96.  

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that an increase in juvenile hormone would in fact delay the commitment pulse of the Manduca sexta and maintain a significently lower overall mass than the controll. These statements were not supported descriptively nor inferentially. The commitment pulse is the point at which a signal is retrieved by the caterpillar notifying it that it has stored enough energy and nutrients to pupate. In most cases, the caterpillars used were those in the 2nd and 3rd instar [Johnson 2016]. This serves as an advantage in that researchers were able to identify levels in which juvenile hormone was relatively high. However, some of the caterpillars chosen were relatively large, estimating the instar stage to be around 4th to 5th. It was predicted that researchers may have given the juvenile hormone too late, resulting in pupation very early. The commitment pulse also plays a role in this case because they may have reached the CP early in the experiment, burdening the juvenile hormone from making a significent impact. Due to this case of using larger caterpillars, it could have significently impacted the comparison between both the treatment and controll groups. This was statistically verified by conducting a two-sample t_test. With a p_value of 0.437 and an alpha value of 0.05, the test proved to be insignificent, showing no significent differences between the groups.  
In a 1974 study, Nijhout et. al determined, as stated before, that the occurrence of juvenile hormone impacts the prothoracicotropic hormone. At approximately 5 grams, the larvae have reached the stage where they distinctly stop secreting juvenile hormone due to the PTTH. In the experiment researchers conducted, the juvenile hormone was present significently higher than this study. They were reaching weights significently higher than the values presented in the study. Possible uncertainty could have been due to the caterpillars that were originally larger in size. If they already reached their commitment pulse, it would have been the case that juvenile hormone was not present. However, because we fed them juvenile hormone, there could have still been a presence due to an extended period of no pupation. The same scientist, Nijhout (1975), found early that the maximum potential size a larva can be directly correlated to the dimensions of the sclerotized part of the body in terms of Dyar’s rule. The mechanism to record its absolute size through hormonal and neural biochemical pathways creates several noticeable changes will also occur. Wandering behavior, transcription for protein synthesis will increase, the cuticle will thin out, dorsal bars will become visible on the head, and the cuticle will resemble a brown/black color. Our study did in fact support this study as those caterpillars that did pupate demonstrated a thin cuticle, dorsal bars, and a black brown color. This was mostly seen in the older, more mature caterpillars. 
The next possible step for experimental procedure is to use caterpillars that are very young. This would give us a better understanding of the role of juvenile hormone throughout the life cycle of Manduca sexta. I would continue to use weight, as it is a great indicator of the instar developmental stage.
