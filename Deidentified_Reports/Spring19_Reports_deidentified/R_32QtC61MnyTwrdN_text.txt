Title: Effects of Colored Environment on Aggressive Behavior in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Betta splendens, or commonly known as betta fish, are a species of Siamese fighting fish that show various aggressive behaviors in the presence of other betta fish, including the red mane. This agonistic behavior is one of the most aggressive behaviors and it can be measured quantitatively by recording the total duration, in seconds, that it is out within a five-minute interval. This experiment did that for four different betta fish in three different water environments: clear, green, and red. It was hypothesized that the red water would cause the fish to have the least aggressive behavior due to previous experiments regarding agonistic responses to betta fish of different colors. It was observed that clear water showed the longest duration of the red mane showing, fish in red water showed slightly less duration, and fish in green water showed the red mane for the shortest duration.

Introduction:
This lab measures the duration of the aggressive behaviors shown by 4 different betta fish in clear, red, and green water. Betta fish exhibit agonistic behaviors with other betta fish, which is an example of intraspecific behavior. One of these aggressive behaviors is the red mane. Showing of the red mane includes extending the branchiostegal membranes from under the operculum. These membranes flare out to create a “mane” around the fish’s head, which is a common facing movement of betta fish in the presence of other males. This is one of the most aggressive behaviors that the fish exhibit [Johnson: 2019]. Betta fish tend to respond differently to fish of the same color than fish of a different color. Betta fish show less aggressive behaviors when presented with betta fish of the same color compared to fish of different colors [Thompson: 1965]. This led to the question of how they would respond to a different colored environment. It was hypothesized that the betta fish would show the most aggressive behavior in the green water, and less aggressive behavior in the red water if the fish themselves were mostly red in color. Betta splendens is a model organism for this experiment due to their clear intraspecies agonistic behaviors and availability to use in the laboratory.

Materials and Methods:
Fish were preliminarily tested to ensure that they exhibit the red mane as an aggressive behavior. From the fish that showed the red mane, four fish of red hues were chosen and placed in a tank with clear water and solid dividers to rest for five minutes before official testing began. During this time, two other tanks were prepared, one with green water and one with red water. The colored water was prepared by adding six drops of food coloring to the water then mixing it in, so the water was the same color throughout. The solid divider between two of the fish was replaced with a clear divider so the fish could see each other. They interacted for five minutes. Each time a fish showed the red mane the timer was started, and when it pulled the red mane back in the timer was paused until it came back out again. This allowed for measurement of the total time, in seconds, that the red mane was out within the five-minute interval. Once the five minutes was completed, the solid divider was reinserted, and the same test was done with the second set of fish. This procedure was followed for the clear, green, and red water conditions, and each fish was allowed to rest for five minutes in the clear water, so they could “reset” back to normal. Once testing was finished, the fish were returned back to their original tanks with solid dividers, so they could rest. The average duration and standard deviation of the red mane being out was calculated for each of the three color conditions and an ANOVA statistical test was done to compare the data. 

Results:
Each of the four betta fish showed the red mane in some capacity. Fish 4 showed less overall activity than the other four fish throughout each of the conditions, including showing his red mane less. Fish 3 was more active than the other three fish, showing his red mane for nearly the whole duration as well as exhibiting various other agonistic behaviors, such as tail flashing, jetting towards the glass where the other fish was, changing colors, and fanning himself out, as well. The betta fish showed their red mane for an average duration of 171.25s +/- 95.5s for the clear tank, 150.76s +/- 85.27s for the red tank, and 116.75s +/- 68.05s for the green tank, which is shown in Figure 1. The difference between each of the conditions was not statistically significant (Fs= 0.433, df= 2, p= 0.662). 

Discussion:
The data that was obtained was not statistically significant, meaning that the averages for each of the three conditions were not different enough to provide confidence that they were different from each other due to the experimental manipulation. Along with this, our hypothesis was not supported. We predicted that fish in red water would show their red mane for the shortest duration of time, but on average they showed their red mane the longest in the clear water condition. Based on the way the fish reacted behaviorally in the green water, along with the short duration of showing their red mane, it is possible that the fish could not see clearly in the darker water which caused them to not be fully aware of the other fish. Due to this they showed less agonistic behaviors. There is a lack of research in regard to aggression of betta fish depending on color of water and clarity of sight, so there is currently no way to determine if this is truly why the green water had the lowest duration of agonistic behavior. Moving forward this is a topic that could be researched more intensely to determine whether color actually does have an effect on agonistic behaviors. A similar study was done to determine if color or brightness had an effect on betta fish behaviors, and the data was inconclusive as well [Grabowski: 1968]. In a related study done on betta fish regarding agonistic response to texture, it was determined that texture does in fact play a role in the aggressive behavior or betta fish, especially when they can see textures similar to that of a scale pattern from another betta fish [Bando: 1991]. Texture and color are both crucial aspects of eyesight, so it would make sense that color may affect the behavioral responses as well, especially if the colors are those similar to the colors typically found in betta fish. In another study, it compares the betta fish’ reactions to fish of their own species, fish of another species, and inanimate objects. Based on the way the fish respond agonistically, it was determined that there may be more to how the fish respond than just the visual stimulus in intraspecific behaviors. It may be important to also consider the social behaviors of the opposing fish, and how the opposing fish responds to the agonistic behaviors of the fish in question [Johnson: 1973]. This implies that there are a lot of factors when considering agonistic behaviors of betta fish and visual perception. The experiment done was limited in how many factors could accurately be measured, so further studies to separate some of these factors are needed. It is also important to consider the behaviors of the individual fish in this experiment. Of the four fish, one was less active overall, which could have skewed the data. It passed the initial test to see if it exposed the red mane, but when it was in the presence of another betta fish it barely showed any agonistic behaviors, and sometimes did not even look in the direction of the other fish. Contrary to this reaction, there was another fish that was extremely active in comparison to the other fish. This fish was always showing more than one agonistic behavior, would run into the glass trying to get to the other fish, and barely ever pulled his red mane in.
