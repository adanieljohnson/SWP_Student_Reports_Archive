Title: Growth and development patterns in [Manduca sexta] with the use of Gentrol IGR

Abstract:
Hormone regulation is an important topic in insect development. With an increase in the use of synthetic pest controll, it is important to understand how they affect the physiological processes in insects. Here we look at the effect of Gentrol IGR on the growth and development of [Manduca sexta]. The expectation was that Gentrol would inhibit molting and lead to unhealthy development. Our data showed significent difference between the caterpillars treated with Gentrol and those not. Half of the treatment group died from the Gentrol and the other half appeared sickly when compared to those not treated, which indicates the harm of Gentrol. The understanding of the effects of IGR inhibitor could further our understanding of the uses of IGR on biochemistry and physiology of insect development.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effect of hormones on insect growth and metamorphosis. Hormones affect metabolic processes of cells throughout the body. Hormones employ chemical controll of physiologic function, such as regulating growth and development, sexual functioning, and metabolism [Richards: 2018]. Molting is a crucial step in insect development. Molting enables the insect to change in size and/or morphology. During molting, an insect sheds its old cuticle by secreting a new outer layer, or cuticle. Once it has undergone that developmental change, it cannot reverse-develop into an earlier stage. [Manduca sexta], the insect of interest, undergoes molting. In this experiment, the use of hormone regulation is tested on [Manduca sexta] to study the effects on development [Johnson: 2018]. Hormones can be utilized as “insect growth regulators,” which affect the normal physiological regulatory processes crucial for healthy development. The use of hormones for pest controll was first discovered in lab-reared linden bugs, when they had inexcusably low egg hatch rates and failed to mature into adults. The researchers traced the cause back to paper towels used in jars that contained juvabione. Juvabione is an IGR compound made by balsam fir trees, which was used in the paper industry at the time. This finding led to advanced interest in the use of IGRs as alternatives of toxic insecticides [Tunax: 2004]. In [Manduca sexta], molting is controllled by two hormones, ecdysterone and juvenile hormone. The four stages of [Manduca sexta’s] life cycle are egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. Ecdysterone and juvenile hormone regulate much of those stages [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment treats the caterpillars with Gentrol IGR and evaluates their length and mass as a reflection of their health and development. Gentrol IGR is an inhibitor, so should affect their development. In this lab, we are looking into the effect of IGR, specifically Gentrol, on insect development. It is hypothesized that the use of Gentrol on [Manduca sexta] will lead to a lack of development, preventing them from becoming pupae.

Materials and Method:
[Manduca sexta] were placed into each compartment of 2 4-parted containers with approximately 10 grams of food, which was provided in lab. The containers A and B were labeled 1-4. Each [Manduca sexta’s] length and mass were recorded under their assigned number and letter. [Manduca sexta ]1 and 4 got 5-10 drops of DI water into their food (Control group). [Manduca sexta] 2 and 3 got 5-10 drops of Gentrol IGR into their food (Treatment group). The two containers were then closed with a lid (2 holes in each container kept air flow) and put into an incubator for 7 days. Each day, the [Manduca sexta] were checked on, observes, and given more food with the appropriate additives if necessary. After the 7 days, their final mass, length, and observations were recorded. The difference in length and weight was calculated. The one-tailed T-test was then utilized on the computer to detect dignificance with the averages, standard deviation, and standard error to determine the differences between the Gentrol group and Control group.

Results:
The average difference in length for controll group was -14 mm and the average difference in length for gentrol group was 4.25 mm (Figure 1). The average difference in mass for controll group was -1.605 grams and average difference in mass for gentrol group was 1.08 grams (Figure 2). The general trend is a decrease in mass and length for the controll group, hence the negative values. It was the opposite for the gentrol group. The standard deviation for the controll group for length was 12.37 mm (Figure 1) and for mass was 2.14 grams (Figure 2). The standard deviation for the gentrol group for length was 10.23 mm (Figure 1) and for mass was 2.23 grams (Figure 2). We used a one-tailed t_test to study our results. The one-tailed p_value for length was 0.048233, so not greatly significent. The one-tailed p_value for mass was 0.091477, which also isn’t significent. When observing the [Manduca sexta] on the final day, there were some obvious difference between the Gentrol group and controll group. Most importantly, 2 out of the 4 from the Gentrol group died. The 2 others that were still alive were a light aqua-gray color and plump. The controll group looked different. One had pupated into a small, brown casing. The others were dark green in color and not moving much. They were noticeably smaller than the Gentrol group.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that [Manduca sexta] given Gentrol IGR would develop incorrectly and die was supported. We found significent differences in data that presented negative growth of the controll group and positive growth, or death, in the treatment group. The results suggest that the treatment group grew in size due to the hormone, but weren’t healthy. Since they did not show signs in pupating, they were stuck in terms of development and couldn’t maintain their state. This makes sense because Gentrol is an inhibitor, so the [Manduca sexta] kept growing in the same developmental state [Tunax: 2004]. That led to their death or overall sickly nature. The controll group showed signs of healthiness from their color and development, so that could suggest further development. Previous studies demonstrate the same effectiveness of hormones for pest management [Ellis: 2009]. This study found that hormone use for pesticide is an effective tool in managing insect populations. Understanding the effects of IGR inhibitor in the context of [Manduca sexta] pest management could further our understanding of the uses of IGR on biochemistry and physiology of insect development.
