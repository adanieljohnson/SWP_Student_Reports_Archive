Title: Addition of IGR insect hormone Increases JH Which Affects the Commitment Pulse of Manduca sexta.

Abstract:
This experiment will use the Manduca sexta (M. sexta) insect more commonly known as the
Tobacco Hornworm as a subject to test a hypothesis about hormones. The M. sexta produces
two types of hormones involved in maturation which we will be investigating – Juvenile hormone
(JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). We will be manipulating these hormones by adding Insect Growth
Regulator (IGR) to increase the levels of JH. Three subjects will be treated with water and three
treated with water and IGR. If the M. sexta is treated with IGR we hypothesize that they will not
experience the commitment pulse and mature to the pupal stage because they will not
experience a drop in JH levels. Additionally, the treatment group will not grow as much as the
controll group because the hormone imbalance. As a result, the two-tailed T-test showed that the
M. sexta treatment group did not show any significent difference from the controll group with the
controll growing at 53% average daily growth and treatment at 42% with a standard deviation at
33% for controll and 27% for the treatment group. We conclude that IGR does not affect growth in
M. sexta. We can confirm that IGR plays a role in insect development by increasing levels of JH
and removing the commitment pulse in M. sexta, but ultimately does not affect growt

Introduction:
This experiment we will be investigating Manduca sexta (M. sexta) development with the influence of insect growth hormones. The Manduca sexta insect is more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm This insect is part of the Order Lepidoptera, this Order includes butterflies, moths, and skippers [Nijhout: 1975]. The M. sexta is a holometabolous organism which means it has four major life stages [Johnson: 2018]. We will be observing the larvae and pupa stages. The life cycle of M. sexta maturation progresses as follows, 1st instar larvae, 2nd instar larvae, 3rd instar larvae, 4th instar larvae, 5th instar larvae, pupa, adult moth [Johnson: 2018]. This cycle takes roughly two weeks, which is the duration of this experiment. We will be manipulating these hormones to understand how a certain hormone impacts M. sexta development. There are two hormones involved in M. sexta development into the pupa stage. The interaction between these two hormones decide if the insect experiences something called a commitment pulse and goes onto the pupa stage. These are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) [Jesudason: 1990]. Juvenile hormone is involved in regulating the type of molt during development and regulated multiple functions in adults [Johnson: 2018]. Ecdysterone is involved in regulating the timing of molting during insect maturation and regulated adult functioning additionally. JH and 20E work together to impact M. sexta development by existing in specific ratios [Jesudason: 1990]. At the 5th larvae stage JH and 20E levels both lower significently, and JH drops below 20E. This relationship causes a commitment pulse to occur. A commitment pulse indicates that the M. sexta has grown enough that it is able to store enough nutrients to transition into the pupa stage and eventually an adult moth [Johnson: 2018]. We are using M. sexta for this experiment because we know about the hormones that play a role in their maturation and the timeline of their life cycle [Nijhout: 1975]. In this experiment we will be manipulating JH levels to learn more about what affects the commitment pulse [Jesudason: 1990]. When Juvenile Hormone increases, we will observe whether the M. sexta larvae matures into the pupa stage of maturation since the levels of JH will not drop below Ecdysterone; which is what triggers the commitment pulse. In order to test this, we will be using a hormone called Insect Growth Regulator (IGR). With the addition of IGR, JH levels will naturally rise – rise above 20E during the 5th larvae stage [Staal: 1975]. We hypothesize that when M. sexta is treated with IGR, they will not experience the commitment pulse and mature to the pupa stage because the drop in JH levels will not occurs and they will not grow to the maximum size before dying. In this case the treatment group will have IGR and the controll group will not. We will monitor the growth of the treatment and controll M. sexta into the pupa stage by measuring their weight.

Materials and Method:
We began by selecting which hormone we will use to influence the treatment group. We decided to add five drops of IGR to the treatment group’s food to stunt the growth into the pupa stage. We used three M. sexta in the controll group and three in the treatment group, which we set up in two separate containers. Each container had three cells for each M. sexta with air holes for breathing. We gave all six M. sexta 10g of room temperature food with 5 drops of water, in addition, we gave the treatment group 5 drops of IGR. To prepare the food sample we mixed the cold food into a paste until it was room temperature, added it to the cells, and added the water and IGR respectively. We added the six M. sexta into their respective cells and left them in an incubator at 25C. We weighed the M. sexta each day we fed them, staring on the first day of the procedure. Every two days the M. sexta were weighed, fed and habitats cleaned. One variable we kept constant among all groups was amount of light. The M. sexta had 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark in the incubator. The temperature was kept constant at 25C. Lastly, the amount of food given was 10g each day for each M. sexta. By the end of the two weeks we collected the weigh from each day and calculated the average percent growth from each day using the difference in weight after each day. In order to determine if our results were significent, we used a two-tailed T-test to compare the treatment group and the controll group average percent growth, using the alpha value 0.05.  

Results:
Table 1 shows the daily growth in grams and percent change of the M. sexta. The change in growth percent is calculated using the daily change in growth in grams. Both controll and treatment group grow at a high percent change in the first three days with the controll gaining 2.52g and treatment growing 2.73g after the first day. Percent change in growth in the last four days taper off, the controll group at only 2g and treatment at 1.9g on the last day. The average percent change for both groups vary greatly from the daily percent change: controll avg. 54%, treatment avg. 42%, when those numbers do not represent the daily percent change values. The standard deviation is calculated using the daily change in percent values. Figure 1 is a representation of the average change in percent in the controll group and treatment group. The error bars are a representation of the percent variation above and below the average value 33% for controll and 27% for the treatment group. According to the two-tailed T-test comparing the average daily percent change in mean weight at an alpha value of 0.05 resulted in a p_value of 0.46. Although the average percent change in growth are slightly different, they are not statistically different. We observed that the first couple of days the M. sexta ate all the food and had large amount of feces. The last few days the M. sexta did not all finish their food; which explains the percent change in weight variance. By day seven, one of the controll subjects was transitioning to a black color indicating the transition into the pupa stage. None of the treatment M. sexta experienced this transition.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported because the treatment group never entered the pupa stage and the treatment and controll group had no significent difference in weight. Although there was a difference in the average percent change for the two groups, the results showed to be not significently different through statistical analysis [Johnson: 2018]. While all M. sexta grew and stated alive for the entirety of the study, one of the controll caterpillars entered the pupal stage. We can assume that the IGR prevented the treatment group from entering the pupal stage although more observation time could have reinforced the results further. The addition of IGR affected the commitment pulse but did not affect the growth of the M. sexta prior to maturation. The groups grew at a similar rate making us fail to reject the null hypothesis [Nijhout: 1975]. Our findings are consistent with our hypothesis by saying the M. sexta treatment group never experienced the commitment pulse, but it is inconsistent with the hypothesis in regard to the difference in growth for the two groups. [Johnson: 2018]. Our work is consistent with other studies showing that JH levels indicate a commitment pulse which is the transition from larvae to adult moth in M. sexta [Jesudason: 1990]. A potential source of error in this study is that the M. sexta were left without food on between days we checked on them. This could have potentially stunted their growth temporarily during the larvae stages [Johnson: 2018]. Our standard deviation value is higher than normal because we used percent change, which varied greatly. At the beginning of the study the M. sexta had a high percent change in growth while on the final says of the study the percent change in growth was very low, leading to an inaccurate average percent change, and standard deviation value [Johnson: 2018]. An idea for a future study is to take the experiment longer to see if the M. sexts develop into pupa stage. If we conducted the study until the M. sexta matured into an adult moth we would be able to more confidently state that the group treated with IGR indefinitely did not experience a commitment pulse. [Johnson: 2018] In this experiment we successfully observed M. sexta development from the larvae stages into the pupa stage. We also successfully altered a group of treatment M. sexta in order to understand the hormones involved in development [Staal: 1975]. After this experiment we can conclude that IGR hormone does not affect growth of M. sexta in the larvae stages. We can confirm from this study and other studies of insect hormones that IGR plays a role in insect development by increasing levels of JH and removing the commitment pulse in Manduca sexta.
