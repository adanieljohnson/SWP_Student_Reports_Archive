Title: Excess of Nitrogen Increases Resource Allocation to Shoots in Pisum sativun

Abstract:
 This study was designed to determine the effects of excess nitrogen on phenotypic plasticity in Pisum sativun, by comparing resource allocation to the roots and shoots of the plant. This was determined by the length of the distinct portions of the plant (roots and shoots). The hypothesis was that the root:shoot ratio would be smaller in those plants exposed to more nitrogen. This hypothesis was supported. 

Introduction:
Plants, like all other organisms are dependent upon the limited resources found in their environment. Yet, the very extraction of needed resources requires the investment of energy and materials applicable to many purposes [Johnson:2018]. Thus, natural selection has driven plants to allocate their resources efficiently, maximizing survival and reproductive success. However, environments are not static, and so one strategy of resource allocation may not be effective in the face of change. As a result, plants have developed phenotypic plasticity, or the ability to alter morphology or physiology via resource allocation in response to the environment. [Reynolds and D’Antonio: 1996, Johnson:2018]. Usually, this equates to optimizing the plant’s uptake of the most limited resource. [Poorter, Niklas, Reich, Oleksyn, Poot, and Mommer: 2011]. This experiment examined phenotypic plasticity regarding nitrogen levels in the plant Pisum sativun, commonly known as the field pea. To do this, the root:shoot ratio (root mass divided by shoot mass) was employed. It was hypothesized that individuals exposed to higher nitrogen concentrations will exhibit a lower root:shoot ratio than those exposed to lower nitrogen concentrations. 


Materials and Method:
Four containers were prepared for the plants (two dedicated to the controll group, and two to the experimental group), filled with dampened soil. 2.5 grams of nitrate of soda was added to each experimental group container, and mixed in with the soil thoroughly. The pea plants seeds were then planted and allowed to grow for two weeks (with regular watering). When it came to to collect data, the plants were removed from the soil, and cleaned. 10 plants from the controll group and 10 from the experimental group were selected for examination. The roots were separated from the shoots, and their lengths were measured separately in centimeters. A one tailed T-test was used to analyze the data. 

Results:
The root:shoot ratios for the experimental group was significently smaller than those of the controll group, displaying a p value of 0.003667, and a t value of 3.021542. The average root:shoot ratio for the controll group was 0.81446475223 and the average for the experimental group was 0.59051884323. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that field pea plants exposed to higher nitrogen levels would exhibit smaller root:shoots ratios is supported. This also signifies an increase of resource allocation to shoots and leaves, as opposed to roots. This is in accordance with the biological principle of optimal partitioning such that materials and energy will be committed to the acquisition of the most limited resource. [Poorter, Niklas, Reich, Oleksyn, Poot, and Mommer: 2011]. In areas poor in nutrients and water (present in the soil) resources (and thus biomass) are often allocated to the roots. However, with an excess of nitrogen present, the most limiting factors are above ground (sunlight, CO2) making it more prudent to allocate resources to shoots and leaves. [Poorter, Niklas, Reich, Oleksyn, Poot, and Mommer: 2011] These concepts are extremely relevant to agriculture, which would aim to produce crops where more biomass is dedicated to the desired portion of the plant. Depending on the crop, phenotypic plasticity could be taken advantage of by adjusting nitrogen levels to maximize yield.
