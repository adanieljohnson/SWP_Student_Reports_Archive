Title: Effect of Additional Acetylcholine on the Amplitude of Muscle Contraction in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog

Abstract:
The contraction of a muscle in multicellular organisms incorporates both the nervous system and the muscular system. Specifically, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, or ACh, is the main molecule in the conduction of a muscle contraction. Three frog legs were dissected, revealing the sciatic nerve and separating the gastrocnemius muscle from the Achilles tendon. Each leg was then stimulated three separate times; measuring the amplitude of the muscle contraction in volts. This process was then repeated for each leg: once with no additional ACh injected, or the control, and once with additional ACh injected. The contraction force of the ACh injected legs was 0.306 volts less than the contraction force of the control group. By using a standard paired t-test, the average contraction force of the gastrocnemius muscle between the two groups was statistically insignificant (t-stat: 1.857, df= 1, p-value= 0.314). he scientists’ hypothesis that adding acetylcholine to the gastrocnemius muscle would decrease the amplitude of muscle contraction, was not supported by the data. The results indicate that although the ACh injected muscles contracted at a smaller amplitude than the control legs, but it is not statistically significant because the p-value was more than 0.05.

Introduction:
The contraction of a muscle in multicellular organisms incorporates both the nervous system and the muscular system. Specifically, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, or ACh, is the main molecule in the conduction of a muscle contraction. Acetylcholine is made by the enzyme choline acetylase and stored in a vesicle at the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron [Birks:  1957]. After acetylcholine is released by a vesicle in the axon terminal, it binds to its nicotinic receptors on the motor end plate which propagates a rush of sodium into the muscle cell, and subsequently, an action potential down the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. This chain of events results in calcium being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the contraction of a sarcomere. Since ACh is a neurotransmitter, it must be removed from the synapse, via acetylcholinesterase, diffusion, or reuptake into the axon terminal, for the muscle to repolarize and be able to contract again [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, if acetylcholine were to stay bound to its receptors, the action potential would keep firing, resulting in tetanus of the muscle and decrease in strength of muscle contraction. In the experiment conducted by the researchers, additional ACh was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog to see its effects on contraction amplitude. By stimulating the muscle with electricity, the contraction of the frog leg muscle can be measured accurately in the units of volts. The scientists hypothesized that the addition of acetylcholine would decrease the strength of muscle contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were dissected, revealing the sciatic nerve and separating the gastrocnemius muscle from the Achilles tendon. Then the leg was connected, tying string to where the Achilles tendon was cut, to a hanger where it could stay suspended in the air. Finally, two electrodes were placed under the sciatic nerve so that it could be stimulated electrically. During the experiment, the threshold of excitation for each leg was found and then used as a constant voltage to stimulate the leg at. Each leg was then stimulated three separate times; measuring the amplitude of the muscle contraction in volts. This process was then repeated for each leg: once with no additional ACh injected, or the control, and once with additional ACh injected. 0.1mL of acetylcholine was injected into each frog leg with a concentration of 200mM. A paired T-test was then used to evaluate the amplitude of contraction between the frog legs with no additional ACh added and the frog legs with additional ACh added. 

Results:
The average amplitude of muscle contraction for the control group was 1.338 volts and the average amplitude of muscle contraction for the ACh injected group was 1.032 volts with a standard deviation of 0.187 and 0.045 respectively (Figure 1). The contraction force of the ACh injected legs was 0.306 volts less than the contraction force of the control group. By using a standard paired t-test, the average contraction force of the gastrocnemius muscle between the two groups was statistically insignificant (t-stat: 1.857, df= 1, p-value= 0.314). The frog legs did not change, appearance wise, after the injection of ACh into the muscle.

Discussion:
The scientists’ hypothesis that adding acetylcholine to the gastrocnemius muscle would decrease the amplitude of muscle contraction, was not supported by the data. The results indicate that although the ACh injected muscles contracted at a smaller amplitude than the control legs, but it is not statistically significant because the p-value was more than 0.05. It is evident that acetylcholine does have an effect on muscle contraction, but not to the extent that the scientists hypothesized. Researchers have found that one unit of acetylcholine is met with one unit of post-synaptic action, or removal of ACh from the synapse [Birks: 1957]. The findings of other research means that additional ACh should have an effect on muscle contraction, however, in the scientists experiment, it did not have a statistically significant effect on the amplitude of muscle contraction. Further studies should be conducted on the effect of acetylcholine not only on muscle contraction, but also on time of contraction or other effects. The usefulness of research on the effect of acetylcholine in muscles is directly translatable to the real world. Certain muscular toxins could be counteracted with more knowledge on ACh and it could be useful for medicinal purposes, such as stopping muscle twitching or contractions.
