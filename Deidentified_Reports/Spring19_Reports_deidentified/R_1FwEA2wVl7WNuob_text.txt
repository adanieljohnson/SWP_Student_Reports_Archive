Title: Effect of Mycorrhizae Fungi on Root:Shoot Ratio of the Raphanus raphanistrum 

Abstract:
This experiment was aimed at discovering the effects of Mycorrhizae fungi on the resource allocation of Raphanus raphanistrum. Two test groups were created, one group of plants were provided with additional Mycorrhizae fungi, another was not. These plants were allowed to grow for 2 weeks and at the end of these 2 weeks data was recorded on the average R:S ratios of the weight and length for both the experimental and the controll group. It was discovered that the R:S ratios for the weight and the length were greater for the plants exposed to Mycorrhizae fungi. The R:S ratios for weight was proven to be insignificent and the R:S ratios for the length were found to be significent. Since both the root length and mass, as well as the shoot length and mass increased, it is hard to conclude where the energy allocated to. More studies on this subject are required to determine the effect of Mycorrhizae fungi on resource allocation in plants. 

Introduction:
The ability of plants to grow in climates that are fluid and that often change in the availability of resources is due to their ability to allocate available resources to areas that are lacking in abundance. For example, plants are known to allocate energy towards growing either longer roots or longer shoots depending on the needs of the plant. If the plant is suffering from a lack of sunlight, it might allocate its resources to the growth of its shoots. Oppositely, if the plant was living in soil that was too soft to stay anchored in it might allocate its resources to grow longer roots. “Shifts in allocation patterns under changing environmental conditions have been experimentally proven to maximize plant growth.” [Bazzaz & Grace: 1997] The organisms that live in the soil that plants grow in can play a huge role in the growth of roots and shoots. The organism that is the focus of this experiment is the Mycorrhizal fungi. “Symbiotic associations between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots are widespread in the natural environment and can provide a range of benefits to the host plant.” [Gosling: 2006] In this experiment, we will be testing the effect of adding additional Mycorrhizae fungi to the soil in which Raphanus raphanistrum (wild radish) are planted in on the allocation of materials to either the roots or the shoots of the plant. 
	Hypothesis:
	If the roots of Raphanus raphanistrum plants are exposed to an abundance of Mycorrhizae fungi, then the root to shoot length and weight ratio will be different from those not treated with additional Mycorrhizae fungi. 


Materials and Method:
The first part of the experiment involved the group acquiring a hand.f.ul of Raphanus raphanistrum seeds and allowing them to soak in water for 10 minutes. While the seeds were soaking, 6 pots of soil were prepared – 3 pots for soil containing additional Mycorrhizae fungi and 3 pots for soil not containing any additional Mycorrhizae fungi. This effectively formed the experimental and controll groups for this experiment. Mycorrhizae fungi were added to the 3 experimental pots in small pinches in the hole where the seeds were planted. The seeds were then covered back up with soil, provided with fertilizer, and left to grow for two weeks. It was made sure that each plant was watered every day (minus weekends) during this period. After two weeks, the plants were carefully removed from the soil, making sure to not rip any of the roots. 3 random individual plants were chosen to be measured. The 3 plants for each pot were measured for total mass and individual mass of the roots and the shoots. The longest root and the longest shoot from each pot sample were used to find the root and shoot length. To weigh and measure the roots and shoots, the two were separated by cutting where the shoot changed colors from green to white. The shoots were measured for length from the tip of the stretched-out leaves to where the color changed from green to white. The roots were measured for length from where the shoot changed from green to white to the end of the root. The data was recorded and used to calculate the R:S ratios for weight and length of the experimental group compared to the controll group. The length and weight R:S ratios for each pot in the experimental and controll group were then averaged and used for comparison of the two. 

Results:
From Fig. 1 it can be concluded that the average R:S ratio for weight was different between the FUNGI (.424 ± .158) and NO FUNGI (.26 ± .2) groups. This result was proven to be insignificent however due to the p_value (p = .16, DoF = 4, t = 1.12) being greater than .05. From Fig. 2 it can be concluded that the average R:S ratio for length was different between the FUNGI (2.3 ± .451) and NO FUNGI (1.04 ± .253) groups. This result was proven to be significent due to the p_value (p = .13, DoF = 4, t = 4.23) being less than .05. 

Discussion:
The group’s hypothesis was found to be supported for the most part. On average, the R:S ratios for both weight and length were greater for the plants that were exposed to additional Mycorrhizae fungi than plants that were not exposed to additional Mycorrhizae fungi. The data for R:S ratio for length was found to be significent (p = .013) while the data for R:S ratio for the weight was found to be insignificent (p = .163) The R:S ratios were different but only the R:S ratio for the length was found to be significent. This could be caused by the roots being much smaller than the shoot in terms of mass, so it is simply not possible to prove that there was a difference caused by the Mycorrhizae fungi in such a small sample size. The roots being longer could be due to the effect that Mycorrhizae fungi have on roots. Mycorrhizae fungi have been proven in the past to provide “improved nutrition, enhanced resistance to soil-borne pests and disease, improved resistance to drought, tolerance of heavy metals and better soil structure.” [Gosling: 2006] The main reason for this experiment was to discover what can determine where a plant allocates its energy. Since both the root length and mass, as well as the shoot length and mass increased, it is hard to conclude where the energy allocated to. “Generous capital investments into leaves and stems for increased photosynthesis may exceed the ability of the root apparatus to both support shoot mass and acquire necessary mineral building blocks. Too great an investment in root material may create an unacceptable overhead of maintenance respiration.” [Madsen: 1990] It is possible that the Mycorrhizae fungi had such an effect on the growth of the root that it counteracted the effect of resource allocation within the plant. Another study focusing on this point is needed to discover the effects of Mycorrhizae fungi on resource allocation in plants. 
Possible sources of error for this experiment could include accidentally tearing the roots when pulling them out of the dirt. This experiment is important for understanding the importance of certain fungi found in the soil in the growth and development of roots and the plant as a whole. In the future, similar experiments could be done to find the best fungi to aid in plant growth and the allocation of energy to certain parts of the plant. Mycorrhizae fungi, or any other fungi that are beneficial to plants, could then be used by farmers to aid in the growth and production of better crops.
