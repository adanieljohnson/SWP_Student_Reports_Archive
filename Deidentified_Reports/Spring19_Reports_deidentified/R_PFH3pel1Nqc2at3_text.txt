Title: The Effects of Caffeine Injection on Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction in Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system allows organisms to respond to different stimuli throughout their environment. A direct stimulation can mimic a nerve impulse and cause a response from the muscle. Therefore, contraction amplitude can be measured through direct stimulation. Researchers expect that the injection of caffeine will increase the amplitude of contraction in the frogs’ gastrocnemus muscle. Three frog legs' contraction amplitude will be measured through direct stimulation and will then be given an injection of 0.2 Ml of 200 mM caffeine and the same stimulation will occur and results recorded. Contraction amplitude is being used because it is a measure of how intense a contraction is and it best fits what the experimenters expect the effect of caffeine to be. Caffeine caused the gastrocnemus muscle to tense and then cause a more severe contraction due to its adenosine receptor antagonist affect. There was an average difference before and after caffeine of 0.578+/-0.235 volts, with the post-injection group experiencing the larger contraction. This data also had a p_value of 0.0114 and a t-value of 9.30. It was also observed that the contractions with caffeine in all three legs were more intense. The graph, statistical tests, and observations all support the hypothesis that

Introduction:
caffeine injection will increase contraction amplitude in the gastrocnemus muscle of frogs. Further, the null hypothesis is rejected because of the p_value of 0.0114.

The neuromuscular system allows organisms to respond to different stimuli throughout their environment. The neuromuscular system is especially effective when a response is necessary in a short amount of time. The endocrine system can create change, but may take anywhere from a couple seconds to days. The neuromuscular system reacts in milliseconds. [Johnson 2019]. Neuromuscular junctions are where nerve impulses are turned into a response from the muscle in the form of a contraction. A direct stimulation can mimic a nerve impulse and cause a response from the muscle. The direct stimulus mimics the action potential coming from the nervous system and triggers the opening of sodium channels. Adenosine slows down this process, but caffeine is an antagonist to adenosine receptors, which is why researchers expect a more intense contraction. From this action potential and the release of sodium, the muscle will follow the same process as normal contraction. An original study testing the effects of paralytic shellfish poison on frog legs states that direct stimulation creates the exact same chain of events in muscle contraction that occurs naturally post-neuromuscular junction [Evans 1963]. This applies to this experiment, as it suggests that muscle contraction can successfully be measured through direct stimulation and that injections do work in altering muscle contraction, It just happens to be caffeine in this experiment, not poison. Another study suggests that caffeine does increase electrically stimulated muscles, which is where the hypothesis for this experiment was partly based off [Lopes 1983]. The difference in gastrocnemus muscle contraction from direct stimulation of frog legs before and after receiving caffeine injection will be measured. The frogs being used, Rania Pipiens, are native to Canada and the United States. They are a larger species of frogs, which makes access to certain muscles and nerves easy. Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist and therefore prevents the effects of adenosine when it binds to adenosine receptors, sleepiness, drowsiness, and tiredness. Caffeine will prevent the relaxation of muscles, which will increase contraction amplitude. Therefore, researchers are questioning whether caffeine will have an effect on muscle contraction amplitude in Rania Pipiens. Researchers expect that the injection of caffeine will increase the amplitude of contraction in the frogs’ gastrocnemus muscle.  

Materials and Method:
3 frog legs will be dissected to expose the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle. IWORX Electrophysigraphical Software will be used to administer and measure direct volts of direct stimulation to the gastrocnemus muscle. The three legs will be given a stimulation of 3 volts 3 times and the contraction amplitude in direct volts will be measured. The three legs will then be given an injection of 0.2 Ml of 200 mM caffeine and the same stimulation will occur and results recorded. A paired t_test will be used to determine the efficacy of the caffeine and if it causes a change in contraction amplitude. Contraction amplitude is being used because it is a measure of how intense a contraction is and it best fits what the experimenters expect the effect of caffeine to be. Frog legs from Rania Pipiens will be used because they are a larger species of frog with easy access to the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve. Further, because of their natural habitat, they are easy to obtain. 

Results:
The contraction amplitudes were taken and an average with and without caffeine was determined for each frog leg. There was an average difference before and after caffeine of 0.578 +/- .235 volts. This data also had a p_value of 0.0114 and a t-value of 9.30. It was also observed that the contractions with caffeine in all three legs were more intense. Further, when the caffeine was injected, the muscle immediately tensed. This was also seen on the IWORX Electrophysiographical Software as after the injection of caffeine, the muscle was observed contracting and then again after the direct and an additional peak occurred on top of the caffeine induced contraction. 

Discussion:
The graph, statistical tests, and observations all support the hypothesis that caffeine injection will increase contraction amplitude in the gastrocnemus muscle of frogs. This is due to the antagonist effect of caffeine on adenosine receptors, which is consistent with results seen in a similar trial, but on live human participants [Lopes 1983]. Further, the null hypothesis is rejected because of the p_value of 0.0114, showing that there is a very small chance the differences in data came from something other than the caffeine injection. Figure 1. shows that there was a difference in the average contraction amplitude with and without caffeine. An average difference in contraction amplitude of 0.578+/- .235 volts is generally very small, but when put in comparison to the actual amplitudes, the difference is fairly large. Lastly, observations of a more intense contraction support the idea that caffeine caused a difference in contraction amplitude. The success of this experiment can be taken and used in other ways. Meaningful research has taken place in tested neuromuscular response to certain drugs, such as a study that used direct stimulation of frog legs to test the effects of hypnotic drugs [Quillium 1955]. For future studies, potentially helpful or harmful drugs and their effects can be tested through direct stimulation.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Average Contraction Amplitude of the Three Frog Legs Before and After Caffeine Injection. The three frog legs received the 3 volts direct stimulation with and without the caffeine. Three trials were done on each leg with and without caffeine. Those were averaged and then the averages from each leg were averaged to find one value of contraction amplitude with and without caffeine. The standard deviation for the controll group is 0.140 and 0.235 in the experimental group, which suggests that the data is slightly spread out for data points this small but does not contradict the hypothesis. *************************************************************************
