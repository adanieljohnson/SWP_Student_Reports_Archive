Title: Effect of High Nitrate Composition in Soil on the Resource Allocation in Field Peas

Abstract:
For any species to survive, they must be able to adapt to any changes that occur in the environment. Plants are one of the best models to study for resource allocation due to their lack of locomotion. However, for most plant growers around the world, fertilizer is used which increases nitrate levels in the soil and increase plant growth. This study will observe the impact that high nitrate levels have on the resource allocations of the roots and shoots of field pea (Pisum sativum). A high nitrate level could result in less energy being allocated to the roots, which leads to a lower root to shoot ratio of the plant. The field pea plants were grown for two weeks and watered every two days. 2.5 grams of Soda of Nitrate was added to the experimental group pots, and then the root to shoot ratio was calculated based on mass in grams. After running a two-sample T-test, it was found that there was no statistical significance between the two data sets. However, we can still conclude that using fertilizer does not affect the root to shoot ratio of the plants. Plant growers can use fertilizer knowing it does not affect or change the resource allocation of a plant and does not lead to weaker roots.

Introduction:
In any environment, plants and animals’ survival depends on how they can interact with the biotic and abiotic factors in their environment. The plant species observed for this study were the field peas (Pisum sativum), and the advantage of plants is that it is much simpler to observe plants interaction with its environment due to lack of locomotion, and it is easy to observe how they allocate their energy resources. Due to certain abiotic or biotic factors in an environment, plants will change how much energy they allocate to growth in different areas of its plant body [Mašková: 2018]. These areas are the roots, the shoot and the leaves of the plants. Certain environmental factors such as rainfall, soil composition, sunlight, and nearby competition can result in the amount of energy or resources a plant allocates to these areas of the plant body. Roots have two basic functions for the plant’s survival. They are responsible for anchoring the plant to the ground and absorbing nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, water, and sulfur from the soil [Uga: 2015]. Plants can have symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil, which can reduce the amount of energy the plant needs to spend on growing roots [Liu: 2018]. The shoot is the main structure for the plant, and its height can help against nearby competition for sunlight. The leaves of the plant are the main body of the plant that is responsible for photosynthesis, harvesting sunlight into energy that the plant can use [Johnson: 2016]. 


Many modern-day plant growers like to use commercial fertilizer to improve the growth of the plant by increasing the amount of nitrate in the soil. However, changing the environment in that aspect may cause the energy allocation of the roots to decrease and result in shorter roots. This can then cause the plant not to be as firmly anchored into the ground and can cause the plant to easily be removed from the soil due to a large amount of runoff or extreme weather. This study will observe the effects on the resource allocation with a high nitrate composition, to see if a decrease in the root to shoot ratio is observed. Our group hypothesizes the plant should spend less energy on roots due to the high availability of the nitrogen. Therefore, the root to shoot ratio should be less, than plants in a normal nitrate environment. 


Materials and Methods:
The growth of the plants


Two pots or replicates were made for the experimental and control groups for this experiment. The pot was first filled halfway with Miracle Grow and then dampened with a little bit of water. Then for the experimental group, 2.5 grams of Soda of Nitrate was added to the dampened Miracle Grow and spread mixed thoroughly. Then for both groups, and handful of field pea seeds were added to the Miracle grow, and then the pot was filled to the top with more soil. The field peas for both groups were placed in a greenhouse with adequate levels of sunlight for both groups and were watered every two days and allowed to grow for two weeks.


Determining Root to Shoot Ratio


Three plants were chosen from each pot for data collection, which resulted in a total of six different replicates for the experimental and the control groups. The pot of field peas was placed into a large container that was filled up to an inch in water. The roots of the plants were carefully separated from the soil in the pot. Then the plants were rinsed to remove any other remaining debris from the soil and dried using paper towels. After the plants are dried, they were cut at the root-shoot junction utilizing a pair of scissors. Then the root and shoot of the plant were weighed separately for each plant (in grams) and recorded to calculate the ratios.


Statistical Test


A two-sample T-test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the root to shoot ratios of the experimental group versus the control group.


Results:
The average root to shoot ratio of the field pea plants that were grown in a high nitrate environment had an average ratio of 0.5855 ± 0.1636, while the plants that were grown in a normal environment (just Miracle Grow) had a ratio of 0.4948 ± 0.0924 (Figure 1). The mean of the root to shoot ratios of the high nitrate environment were found not to have a statistically significant difference than the mean of the control root to shoot ratio (T-stat: 1.18, df: 10, P: 0.26).

Discussion:
Since there is no statistically significant difference between our two experimental groups; our hypothesis that the root growth and the root to shoot ratio of the nitrate field peas would be lower than the control group cannot be accepted. This result means that the additional impact of nitrate in the plant’s environment does not affect the root to shoot ratio, and the null hypothesis is still accepted.


However, there could be a biological explanation for the results of this experiment. Researchers in China have studied the ligase OsSIZ2 in rice and the response to nitrogen that occur. OsSIZ2 has been found to have an impact on plant growth, and its expression was found to increase during a nitrogen deficiency [Pei: 2019]. It is possible that there is a decrease in OsSIZ2 during a nitrogen sufficiency, as in our study, which would result in a reduction of plant growth. No study has been conducted on the OsSIZ2 on field peas, but a simple real-time qPCR analysis could determine if that ligase exists in the field peas used for this experiment. If it does, then it is possible that the nitrogen sufficiency might have decreased both the size of the shoot and the roots, which leveled out the ratios for this experiment. 


Future research could be done to figure out the specific cell biology and biochemistry that is occurring, while the plant is in a high nitrate environment. However, we can still conclude that using fertilizer does not affect the root to shoot ratio of the plants, and as a result of that does not damage the roots of the plants. So, farmers and gardeners around the world do not need to worry about fertilizer causing a lower amount of resources being allocated to the roots and resulting in plants poor anchoring to the ground.
