Title: Effect of pH change on the photosynthetic activity of spinach leaves (spinacia oleracea)

Abstract:
The main goal of the study was to determine the effects of adjusted pH values on the chloroplast absorbance, and photosynthetic activity, of spinach leaves (spinacia oleracea).  Our group used three samples of spinach leaf chloroplasts at three different pH settings (4, 7, and 10, with 7 being ideal for spinach leaf photosynthesis).  I hypothesized that there would little difference in the absorbance change between the pH 4 and pH 10 settings.  However, after finding the percent change in absorbance at three successive 10-minute intervals for each sample, and averaging the three at each pH setting, we found that our data was insignificant (P-value of 0.056), and that we could not draw conclusions.  However, my hypothesis would not have been supported if the data was significant, as the percent changes in absorbance varied a great deal between the pH 4 and pH 10 settings.

Introduction:
Light absorption is a key aspect of photosynthesis, which is the process by which most autotrophs gain nutrients and energy.  Photosynthesis in autotroph cells (specifically, in the chloroplasts of those cells) is affected by a number of factors, from the amount of available light, to salt accumulation in leaves [Delfine: 1999].  Another possible factor is the system’s pH, and how close it is to the ideal pH for the organism to live in – spinach, for instance, has an ideal pH of around 7 [Babic: 1996].  pH changes have been shown to have little effect in algae with broad pH-tolerance; however, if spinach (or other plants) lack such a tolerance, the effects could be greater [Gerloff-Elias: 2005].  This experiment demonstrates the effect of different pH values on the light absorption (and, by extension, the photosynthetic activity) of spinach leaves (spinacia oleracea).    We as a group will compare the absorbance of spinach leaf chloroplasts at pH 7 to that of pH 10 and pH 4, and measure the difference between such values.  I hypothesize that while the chloroplasts at pH 4 and pH 10 will see a decrease in absorbance when compared to those at pH 7, the decrease in each’s absorbance will be similar, if not nearly identical.

Materials and Methods:
A mortar and pestle, a beaker, and 50-mL centrifuge tubes were packed into crushed ice.  The central veins from 4 spinach leaves were removed.  After the leaves were rinsed and blotted, they were added to the mortar and pestle.  10 mL of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in tricine buffer, with a pH of 8.0) were added, and the spinach was ground into a paste.  Another 10 mL of grinding buffer was mixed with the spinach paste, and the mixture was strained through cheesecloth into the beaker.  After 200 microliters of the remaining liquid were transferred into a microtube marked “Sample of A”, the microtube was stored on ice.  The remaining liquid in the beaker was transferred to a centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun in the centrifuge at 200G for 3 minutes, at 4 degrees Celsius.  After the spin, the supernatant out of “A” was poured into another centrifuge tube labeled “B’, while leaving the pellets in “A”.  200 microliters from “B” were then removed, placed in a microtubule labeled “Sample of B”, and put on ice.  We centrifuged “B” for 10 minutes at 1000G, at 4 degrees Celsius.  The resulting supernatant was poured into a tube marked “C”, without disturbing the pellets in “B”.  20 mL of grinding buffer was then added to the “B” pellets, and 200 microliters were transferred to a microtubule labeled “Sample of B”.  200 microliters from “C” were then placed in a “Sample of C” microtubule (with all microtubules on ice).  Next, 10 test tubes were labeled (three each with “pH 4”, “pH 7”, “pH 10”, and one “blank”).  3 replicated samples were prepared for each pH reaction mix, along with 1 for the blank, and 100 microliters of chloroplasts were added to all tubes.  The spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nm, and the absorbances of all samples (in cuvettes) were measured.  The cuvettes were placed under a grow light, and the procedure was repeated 10 minutes later, before the cuvettes were placed back under the light.  The procedure was repeated 10 and 20 minutes later, respectively (30 minutes in total).  Finally, an ANOVA test was used to compare the percent change in absorption between pH 7 and pH 4, and pH 7 and pH 10, as well as find the P-value of the experiment.

Results:
Our mean values of percent change of light absorption over the first 10-minute interval were 16.75 for pH 4-treated leaves, -3.98 for the pH 7 leaves, and 14.84 for the pH 10 leaves (Table 1).  After 20 minutes, the values were -3.16, -14.62, and 4.26, for pH 4, 7, and 10, respectively (Table 1).  After 30 minutes under the grow light, the values for pH 4, pH 7, and pH 10 were 4.05, 4.27, and 14.27, respectively (Table 1).  Both the pH 4 and pH 10 settings saw a large increase in absorbance over the first 10 minutes, while the pH 7 setting saw a large decrease after the second 10-minute interval (Fig. 1).  Only the pH 10-treated chloroplasts saw a large increase in absorbance over the final 10 minutes (Fig. 1). According to our ANOVA test, our means were insignificantly heterogenous (one-way ANOVA, F2, 6=4.845, P=0.056).  

Discussion:
My hypothesis, that there would be little difference in absorbance change between the pH 4 and pH 10 – treated spinach leaf chloroplasts, was neither supported nor negated by our experiment.  Since our data is insignificant, no conclusions can be drawn from it.  Had our data been significant, my hypothesis would have been incorrect, as the patterns of absorbance change at pH 4 and pH 10 bore little resemblance to each other (Fig. 1).  However, previous experiments have demonstrated that acid rain (with a pH below 4.0) destroys chloroplast structure and reduces photosynthesis, so decreasing the pH of a system has been shown to have a negative effect on chloroplast light absorbance [Sun: 2016].  One would assume that a very basic environment would have a similar effect on photosynthetic activity as a whole, and that appears to be the case for microalgae, as a basic pH has been shown to lower the maximum photosynthesis of such organisms (unless they have a broad pH tolerance) [Middelboe: 2007].  In order to test whether spinach (or any plant) leaves respond in a similar fashion, my group and I could improve our experiment by tracking absorbance over a longer period of time than 10-minute intervals – however, given the time restrictions, such an experiment would be difficult to perform in class.  Another adjustment would be to increase the number of pH values measured, rather than measuring the absorbance of chloroplasts at one basic and one acidic value only.  Overall, our experiment should be adjusted, and repeated over a longer period of time, in order to draw conclusions from significant data.  With a more extensive study, the effect of changing pH conditions on eukaryotic (not just spinach) chloroplasts’ photosynthetic activity could be demonstrated more definitively than in our experiment.
