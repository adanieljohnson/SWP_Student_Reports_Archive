Title: Title. The effect of a 2% Sevin injection on Minimum Threshold in Rana Pipiens’ Gastrocnemius 

Abstract:
In our experiment, we tested the effect of adding 0.2 mL of Sevin solution to a Rana pipiens’ gastrocnemius to observe the changes in minimum threshold required to elicit a muscle contraction. We hypothesized that the group given the Sevin injection would have a larger minimum voltage to trigger a muscle response due to less acetylcholine being broken down. This would require a larger voltage to bring about the same response had Sevin been present. Sevin, formerly known as Carbaryl, inhibits the breakdown of acetylcholine and causes muscle convulsions and potentially death if enough acetylcholine is present in the muscles for a long enough time. After preparing each of three Rana pipiens’ gastrocnemius, we tested all of their minimum voltages, then injected all three with Sevin to observe changes. In our control group (testing done prior to injection of Sevin), we measured the average minimum voltage to be 0.157 +/- 0.0321 V (p= 0.0376) (Fig.1) and in our experimental group we measured their minimum voltage to be 0.293+/- 0.0702 V (p=0.0376) (Fig. 1). Our results supported our hypothesis, yet further testing needs to be done to examine the effects of Sevin on other functions specifically in Rana pipiens. Yet, presently, Sevin is used as an effective pesticide in the Sierra Nevada

Introduction:
Acetylcholine (ACh) plays a significant role in the transmission of a neural impulse into a muscle contraction. At the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic terminal, then it prompts the opening of sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle. [Johnson: 2016] An action potential is characterized as a change in the electrical potential associated with the passing of a neural or muscular impulse. [Johnson:2016] The action potential then prompts the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that in turn triggers the contraction of the muscle. [Johnson: 2016] In our experiment, we will be manipulating acetylcholine in the Rana pipiens’ gastrocnemius with the help of a 2% Sevin solution. Sevin is a competitive ACh inhibitor that resembles the molecule acetylcholine and breaks down ACh in a manner significantly slower than that of the naturally occurring enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). [Xu:2000] This results in excess ACh in the nervous system and can be visible in the form of muscle twitches, convulsions, and spasms although they do not always occur. [Xu: 2000] We will be measuring the resulting minimum voltage needed to elicit a muscle response prior to and after a 2% 0.2 mL Sevin injection. Our independent variable in the experiment is the amount of Sevin added to the muscle and our dependent variable is the minimum threshold that elicits a muscle contraction. We hypothesize that the injection of the 2% Sevin solution into the gastrocnemius will increase the minimum threshold due to the muscle’s inhibited ability to generate an action potential and the slower break down of ACh at its receptors. 


Materials and Methods:
Initially, we followed the provided video steps for degloving and preparing the gastrocnemius to begin the experiment. We delivered a shock of 0.1V and recorded whether or not the muscle elicits a response in the form of a twitch. We continued to increase the amplitude of the shock in increments of 0.1V until the muscle twitched and recorded the value. The minimum threshold was recorded prior to each Sevin injection for each of the three gastrocnemii. We drew out 0.2 mL of the 2% Sevin solution without pulling air bubbles into the syringe. The needle was placed into the muscle, then we injected all of the Sevin solution, and followed with a massage of the muscle to make sure the Sevin dispersed throughout. A shock of 0.1V was delivered and we incrementally increased the voltage by 0.1V until a twitch was observed. We followed by comparing the voltage minimums for each gastrocnemius to draw results from their differences. In this experiment, we used a paired t-test to analyze the significance between the 0 mL data and the 2 mL Sevin solution data.

Results:
In our experiment, data collected on minimal threshold was quantified by a twitch visually observed. Also, multiple sites on the gastrocnemius were found to be lacking Sevin (indicated by a lighter color), so we needed to massage the muscle until all the Sevin was dispersed in the muscle equally. For each Rana pipiens’ gastrocnemius that was treated with 2% Sevin, we observed a higher voltage needed to cause a contraction within the muscle. We calculated the average voltage for the 0mL added gastrocnemius to be 0.157+/- 0.0321 V (Fig.1). For the gastrocnemius that was given the 0.2mL 2% Sevin injection, we found the average voltage to be 0.293+/- 0.0702 V (Fig.1). Our calculated P-value was 0.0376 and our paired t-test t-value was 5.01. We also calculated the degrees of freedom, which measure how many aspects within your experiment are subject to change and concluded that we had 2. 



Discussion:
Our hypothesis that there would be an increase in the minimum voltage needed to prompt an action potential, if an injection of Sevin was given, was supported by the results. The injection of 0.2mL 2% Sevin solution correlated to a larger minimum threshold observed in the gastrocnemius due to the slower break down of ACh compared to that of AChE. This would subsequently result in more voltage needed to achieve an action potential to allow the muscle to contract. The difference between the average minimum voltages was 0.136 V (Fig. 2), so there was a significant enough change in the two voltages to draw results from. Our calculated p value of 0.0376 correlates to a significant difference found between the 0 mL and 2 mL group. In our experiment, the third gastrocnemius had a harder time eliciting a response from lower voltages, and the error was probably the result of inconsistent Sevin throughout the muscle. For this specific experiment, further research would need to be done to determine the effectiveness of the Sevin on functions like hopping, muscle exertion, fatigue, etc. However, the use of Sevin can cause uncontrollable movements, paralysis, convulsion, and even death due to higher concentrations of ACh in the nervous system. [Xu:2000] Therefore, experimentation on live Rana pipiens could be counterintuitive to the experiment due to potential health risks associated with the compound. This could also be helpful for organizations trying to manipulate the population of Rana pipiens in a particular region of the U.S. Similarly, Sevin is a fairly environmentally friendly insecticide/pesticide due to its ability to be broken down in soil, and inability to spread great lengths into the atmosphere. [Xu:2000] With this in mind, it would be very effective for organizations to control ecosystems overrun by Rana pipiens.
