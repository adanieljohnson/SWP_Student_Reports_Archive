Title: The effects of Precor on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars.

Abstract:
We explore how the forward movement in the metamorphic cycle emerges from hormone activity through feeding of Manduca Sexta caterpillars with Precor fused food. We measured the initial weights of the caterpillars before the experiment. We then gave four out of eight of the caterpillars’ food with Precor in it in an effort to alter the growth by altering Juvenile hormone produced. The mean weight of the controll was 6.55 while the mean weight for the experimental was found to be 4.09. The p_value from the two-tailed statistical test was 0.30619. We found the standard deviation to be 3.3419 for the controll and 2.4612 for the experimental. These results suggest that the Precor had no effect on the Manduca Sexta caterpillars and that they grew bigger and would have eventually pupated. There is no correlation between Precor and inability to pupate. 

Introduction:
The hormones of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar, also known as the tobacco hornworm has proven to be resourceful in educating us on how hormones work. This experiment served to observe and evaluate the effects of an insect growth regulator (IGR) in Manduca Sexta caterpillars. IGRs differ from traditional synthetic insecticides like carbamates that are toxic to insects directly. An insect growth regulator instead leads to abnormalities that reduce insect survival by affecting physiological regulatory processes essential to normal development of the insects or offspring [Siddal: 1976]. One way IGRs work is by altering hormone activity. Hormones are chemical signals in animals that help the body to communicate certain activities such as growth and metabolic processes. Much like humans have hormones that enable the transition from childhood to adulthood, insects also have hormones that regulate their growth. An example of such a hormone is Juvenile Hormone (JH). Juvenile hormone is responsible for molting during the development of the Manduca Sexta. When it is time for the Manduca Sexta caterpillar to move into the pupa stage, the Juvenile Hormone reduces its amount at a time known as the commitment pulse [Kenji: 2003]. The Manduca Sexta is being used because they have been studied intensively with regards to their hormone activity. In this experiment, I will use Precor which is an IGR that alters the Juvenile Hormone in the Manduca Sexta caterpillar. We hypothesize that if we should give the Manduca caterpillar Precor, they will cease to grow into a pupa and consequently wouldn’t become adult insects.

Materials and Method:
The eight Manduca Sext caterpillars were divided into two groups randoMly. One group was the controll and the other was the experimental. Each caterpillar was put in a cell in the specified container, that is, either the controll container or the experimental container. Holes were punctured in the containers for air circulation, each cell getting two holes. The containers were labelled with groups names, TA name, section, treatment or controll. Each cell was also labelled in an effort to keep track of each caterpillar. 10 grams of food was measured for each Manduca Sexta caterpillar. For the controll group, eight drops of water were added to the food and for the experimental, eight drops of Precor was added to the food and stirred well for a consistent food sample for each Manduca Sexta caterpillar. The food was made into a blob and placed into the cell of the respective Manduca Sexta caterpillar. The initial weights of each caterpillar were recorded. Both the controll and experimental were put into an incubator which provided them with 12hr light and 12hr darkness. The weights of each caterpillar were measured daily for a 14-day period. Observations were also made during this period. After the 14-day period, a two-tailed-T-test was performed with the means of the controll and experimental weights to determine the p_value and the standard deviation.

Results:
From Table 1, it can be seen that the mean weight of the controll was 6.55 grams while the mean weight of the experimental was 4.09 grams. From Table 2, the p_value from the two-tailed statistical test was 0.30619. The standard deviation for the controll was 3.3419 and 2.4612 for the experiment. Also, the first Manduca Sexta caterpillar turned brown at the end of the experiment. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the Manduca Sexta will cease to grow when introduced to Precor was not supported as p_value was greater than 0.05 and that suggests that the presence of the Precor had no effect on the growth of the Manduca caterpillars. This result might have been because Precor failed to alter the Juvenile hormone quantity in the caterpillars and as such did not cease the growth of the caterpillars. As a result, the caterpillars didn’t remain in their larval stage but rather grew bigger and tried to become pupae [Kenji: 2003]. It can also be as a result of errors such as not mixing the Precor with the food sample well or the fact that my group punctured holes at the top of the container and not the sides. If that is the case, it means that the caterpillars didn’t ingest Precor and therefore it had no effect on them.  To achieve what we had hoped for, we could change the experiment by adding more drops of Precor into the food sample or even make Precor the source of water for the caterpillars. This means that we should study more about the hormones in Manduca caterpillars and broaden the search for an insect growth regulator that will have the effect we had hoped for. Understanding how the hormone receptors work and why Precor couldn’t alter JH amounts could serve as a breakthrough for choosing better IGRs for the Manduca Sexta caterpillar.
