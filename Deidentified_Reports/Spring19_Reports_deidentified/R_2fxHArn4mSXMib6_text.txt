Title: Utilizing juvenile hormone (JH) on development of Manduca sexta.

Abstract:
The objective of the study was to determine the effect juvenile hormone on the development and growth of Manduca sexta. This organism follows a holometabolous lifecycle, which is most prominently defined by the period in time when it is ready to pupate—commitment pulse. It was hypothesized that exposing increased levels of juvenile hormone would delay the commitment pulse of the Manduca sexta and maintain a stable growth rate, yet lower weight and vibrant green-color over a 15-day period. Juvenile hormone is a secreted biochemical that serves a large purpose in the development of the molting process. This hormone also is directly connected to ecdysterone which regulates the molting and growth of when the Manduca sexta transitions into pupation (Figure 1: B). Both hormones serve a large purpose in that they are not able to keep the organism alive unless they are present in the Manduca sexta’s system. Manduca sexta were placed in two containers: one containing the controll group and one containing the juvenile hormone-treated group. They were monitored over a fifteen day time period and the results were observationally and statistically reviewed. The results yielded a p_value based on the growth rates of each day of development in Manduca sexta as 0.297103 based t-value -0.52939. Th

Introduction:
Model organisms are an optimal standard for testing biological processes when exposed to distinctive variables. The Manduca sexta, order Lepidoptera, is one model organism that helps biologists study behaviors regarding holometabolous lifecycles. 
	The Manduca sexta’s holometabolous life cycle is characterized by several sequenced stages. The most regarded stage is the larvae stage, where the Manduca sexta resemble a vermiform structure. They remain in this stage for roughly 18-23 days under constant conditions. This time period is further divided into instars: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th. Each instar can be classified by molting in which the epidermal cells secrete a fresh cuticle. Layers of cells dividing the instars, driven by the cuticle formation, allows the Manduca sexta to further change in size and shape. 
	This life cycle can be manipulated by changes in endocrine function. The developmental stages are controllled by both neural and hormonal based signaling. The insect receives a signal from the body to the brain, which releases biochemicals causing hormonal changes based upon what was exposed to the organism. Neural pathways or hormonal pathways will help the organism adapt to the environment (activation) and can also change the body structure of the organism as part of growth and development (organizational).   
Treatment groups of Manduca sexta can be easily changed by hormonal biochemicals. One type of hormone that will be tested on the Manduca sexta is juvenile hormone (JH)— large, chained organic molecules produced by the glands situated on the corpus allata. Juvenile hormone serves to regulate the developmental molting process.
Similar to the processes of juvenile hormone, ecdysterone (20E)— secreted biochemical produced by cells in the prothoracic glands—regulates the timing of molting in organismal development. Both hormones serve a large purpose in that they are not able to keep the organism alive unless they are present in the Manduca sexta’s system. Depending on the instar larval stage, these hormonal releases fluctuate (Figure 1), signaling the organism’s eclosion period. 
Several studies have showed a major significance in juvenile hormone in relation to ecdysterone in other model organisms. Liu et al studied juvenile hormone response within the ring gland and developmental transitions in Drosophila. By conducting a biosynthetic analysis, scientists in the study focused on a regulation gene in 20E JH that induced the expression of a transcription factor KR-hl. With a higher transcription rate in the autoregulation of hormones in the Drosophila, the ecdysteroid biosynthesis was inhibited, preserving the juvenile status of the fly. This comes to shows that both biochemical regulators determine the mechanisms of developmental transition in organisms (Liu et al: 2017).

 
Figure 1. Release of E20 and JH in Manduca sexta development.
Unique to the Manduca sexta, Figure 1 recognizes the commitment pulse (B), in which the organism is large enough to store nutrients and pupate. The significance is that it is the point at which the caterpillar experiences an increase in E20 and a low-level JH, which signals this point of transition. A study conducted by Nijhout (1975) found early that the maximum potential size a larva can be directly correlated to the dimensions of the sclerotized part of the body in terms of Dyar’s rule. An organism has a mechanism to record its absolute size through hormonal and neural biochemical pathways (Nijhout: 1975). 
Several noticeable changes will also occur. The organism will encounter a wandering behavior, transcription for protein synthesis will increase, the cuticle will thin out, dorsal bars will become visible on the head, and the cuticle will resemble a brown/black color. 
The experiment that we conducted intends to utilize increase juvenile hormone to change the hormonal and neural pathways of the Manduca sexta. Our group expected this manipulation to delay the recognition of the commitment pulse in the organism to inhibit or interrupt pupation. It was hypothesized that an increase in juvenile hormone would in fact delay the commitment pulse of the Manduca sexta and maintain a larger growth rate and vibrant green-color over a 15-day period because it remains in its youthful growing period.


Materials and Method:
Obtain two containers subdivided into four sections. Begin to poke one hole into each of the sections of the container to ensure that the Manduca sexta have access to air. Label one of the containers treatment group and one the controll group. Also, number each section in the tray to assign a number to a caterpillar. It is important to have each labeled correctly to avoid confusion. With a clean spoon, place 10 grams of food into each of the containers by using an electronic balance and a weigh boat. Zero the boat before placing the food inside. It is advised that you loosen the food and place them uptight in the corner of each section of each tray. Obtain distilled water and juvenile hormone solutions. Using a clean pipette, first add seven drops to each of the four sections in the controll group, yielding concentration 7 drops of distilled water per 10 grams of food. Continue the mixing process as stated above. Next, using a clean pipet to avoid contamination, place 7 drops of juvenile hormone in the treatment group, yielding 7 drops of juvenile hormone per 10 grams of food. Continue the mixing process as stated above, again. Obtain eight Manduca sexta and place each into the 8 sections. Note original appearance and weight of each of the caterpillars in grams. Over the next 15 days repeat the underlined section. During each day, remove the feces of the Manduca sexta to ensure an optimal environment. Record the weight and appearance over each day and record the raw data. Dispose of the material into the waste bin, excluding the Manduca sexta and spoons. Wash the spoons and place the Manduca sexta in a bag to be thrown away by the instructor. Using the data, conduct a two-sample t_test to test for a significent different between means of the two groups.   

Results:
Days one through five shows significent growth. The days after five displayed very minimal growth with start of pupation. Note that the average Manduca sexta weight decreased most of the days.
Most of the growth occurred though days one through ten. Observations show lively, youthful Manduca sexta and starts to pupate after 10 days. In raw data, 25% began to pupate and turn brownish color. 
The p_value based on the growth rates of each day of development in Manduca sexta is 0.297103 based t-value -0.52939. Tested to show there is no significance between means. 



Discussion:
The average difference in the growth in the Control Group seemed to yield very unusual results. The growth was steady through day five, but then began to lose a significent amount of weight after day 5. We began to see the commitment pulse very early around day 10, meaning there was some source of uncertainty. The treatment group showed juvenile growth from days one to ten but began to show the commitment pulse around day 12. There was a very minute difference in pupation periods, which shows large uncertainty. It seemed that the ecdysterone proliferated through the organism significently early, which indicates that there was an irregular holometabolous cycle. 
The hypothesis stated that an increase in juvenile hormone would in fact delay the commitment pulse of the Manduca sexta and maintain a larger growth rate and vibrant green-color over a 15-day period because it remains in its youthful growing period. This hypothesis was not supported observationally and statistically. 
A previous study done by Liu et al studied juvenile hormone response within the ring gland and developmental transitions in Drosophila. Results indicated in the study that a higher transcription rate in the autoregulation of hormones in the Drosophila, the ecdysteroid biosynthesis was inhibited, preserving the juvenile status of the fly (Liu et al: 2017). This was partially supported in the beginning of the experiment, but not supported by the preservation of juvenile status.
The next step logical step would be to test the juvenile hormone in 1st instar caterpillars. We used caterpillars in various stages, which could have impacted the results in the end. This would give us a more accurate representation of the treatment group compared to the controll group. I would intend to hypothesize the same way, but improve the procedure and possibly repeat the procedure with 20E.
