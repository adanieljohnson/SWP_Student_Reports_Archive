Title: Effect of Nicotine on Twitch Threshold in Frog Legs from Sciatic Nerve Stimulus

Abstract:
Due to its heavy use worldwide, nicotine is a drug that needs to be thoroughly studied to understand its effects on humans and other organisms. One bodily system nicotine has a large effect on is the neuromuscular system, so we monitored its effect on the muscle twitch threshold of frog legs. The expectation was that this would reduce the twitch threshold, but our data did not show a statistically significant difference between the results of our experimental and control trial groups. This suggests that nicotine does not reduce twitch threshold in muscle cells. This data is useful in understanding the effects and wider application of nicotine through all areas of life in which it could potentially be present.

Introduction:
All muscular movements in all organisms with neuromuscular systems are controlled by stimuli carried through nerve cells and are caused by a collection of muscle fiber twitching; stronger muscle contractions are caused by more muscle fibers twitching at the same time. The speed at which muscles are able to contract is based on the time it takes a muscle cell to reach its twitch threshold: the minimum amount of neural stimulus needed to cause a muscle twitch. The lower the twitch threshold in an organism’s muscle fibers, the quicker its muscles can contract. Because this is true for all organisms with skeletal muscle, the effects of certain substances on the twitch threshold of one organism will likely be similar throughout all organisms including humans. One such substance believed to cause muscle twitchiness is commonly found in smoking products: nicotine, an alkaloid derived from the plant Nicotiana Tobaccum [Nguyen: 2015]. Nicotine is an agonist of nicotinic receptors with are found throughout many regions of the central nervous system and are directly responsible for muscle contractions [Gotti: 2004]. This means that nicotine activates these receptors and makes them more easily stimulated by neurological stimuli. This experiment assesses the effect of nicotine on the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg. These frog legs have an easily accessible sciatic nerve that can be electrically stimulated to cause muscle contractions in the leg muscles [Kao: 1968]. Because nicotine stimulates nicotinic receptors in the central nervous system, we hypothesized that the addition of nicotine would result in a lower twitch threshold than that of the control.

Materials and Methods:
Three different frog legs were prepared in moist frog Ringer’s tissue for sciatic nerve stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle controlled by an electrical probe and LabScribe software. The muscle was pinned to the dissecting pan and tied to force transducer. Each frog leg took part in two trials: a control trial with no additives and an experimental trial in which the gastrocnemius muscle was injected with 0.1 cc of nicotine. In each trial the sciatic nerve was stimulated to various amplitudes in order to determine the lowest amplitude that would cause a detectable twitch, the twitch threshold, to the nearest one hundredth of a volt. Each leg underwent the control trial first immediately followed by the experimental trial. All data was monitored through the LabScribe software. Data from the various trials was compared using a one-tailed paired t-test. 

Results:
As displayed by the bar graph in figure 1, the mean twitch threshold for the control trials of the three legs was 0.18 V and for the experimental trials the mean twitch threshold was 0.16 V. The standard deviation or the control trials was 0.09 V and the standard deviation for the experimental trials was 0.04 V. We used a one-tailed paired t-test to analyze our results. The mean twitch threshold of the experimental trials did not show a statistically significant difference from than that of the control trials (t-value = 0.44, df = 2, P = 0.70). There did not appear to be any differences in the amount of movement at the twitch threshold between each trial, and all frog legs remained intact throughout the experiment. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the addition of nicotine to a frog gastrocnemius muscle would result in a lower twitch threshold from sciatic nerve stimulation was supported by our results, but without a statistically significant difference. This means we cannot confidently say that our results were not due chance. Because of this we must reject our alternative hypothesis and accept the null hypothesis that the presence of nicotine in frog gastrocnemius muscle cells does not reduce twitch threshold of sciatic nerve stimulation. This suggests that nicotine does not reduce twitch threshold in organisms with a neuromuscular system. Because nicotine is an agonist of the nicotinic receptors in nerve cells, this data does not entirely make sense [Gotti: 2004]. This could be due to some experimental error on our part. During the experiment the frog muscle came untied from the force transducer multiple times. We tried our best to reattach the muscle in the same way it was attached before falling off but could have caused some irregularities in the process. To improve this experiment for future use, each frog gastrocnemius muscle should be more securely attached to the force transducer and not altered over the course of its trials. This would help to prevent any irregularities in twitch threshold records between trials. Understanding the effects of nicotine, a very commonly consumed substance worldwide, on a bodily group as large as the neuromuscular system is incredibly important. While it is known that many forms of nicotine consumption such as smoking cause various types of disease and cancer, if nicotine by itself when safely consumed can provide any advantages or disadvantages to muscular performance it would be very useful to know in a variety of life situations. The results could range from affecting regular day activities to those of professional athletes. Research on nicotine’s effect on the neuromuscular system and body as a whole contributes to our understanding of many substances effects on many organisms.
