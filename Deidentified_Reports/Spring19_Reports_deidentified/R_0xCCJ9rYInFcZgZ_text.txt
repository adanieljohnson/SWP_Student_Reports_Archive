Title: Effects of Edysterone Inhibition in Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Hormones play an important role in all plants and animals, because they send signals throughout the organism that help cause specific reactions. One important hormone for the specie we studied, the Manduca Sexta, is the hormone ecdysterone. It regulates the timing of molting in the larval stage of the Manduca Sexta so it can morph into a moth. When a caterpillar does not have a sufficient amount of ecdysterone in its body, it is incapable of growing to its final larval stage and cannot pupate, making it smaller. If the amount of the hormone ecdysterone in a Manduca Sexta is inhibited, it’s mass will be smaller than a Manduca Sexta with normal ecdysterone levels. After observing a controll and experimental group for 13 days, we discovered that our hypothesis was correct and our data was significent, because our experimental group had a much smaller average mass than our controll group. This meant that ecdysterone was crucial for the development of the Manduca Sexta, and without it the caterpillar is incapable of reaching its full size and reaching its pupation stage. 


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is an insect that begins as a caterpillar, known as the Tobacco Hornworm, and pupates into a moth after approximately three weeks. But the larva is not able to pupate and turn into a moth without the help of hormones. One of the hormones involved in larval development is ecdysterone, and according to researchers, ecdysterone is very important because the periodic increase of it in the body leads to insect development  [Gilbert: 2002]. It helps the Manduca Sexta  by regulating the timing of molting. When the larva is physically ready to pupate, there is a spike in Ecdysterone that signals for the body to form a pupa. In this experiment, we want to see what happens if the amount of ecdysterone in a Manduca Sexta larva’s body is reduced or inhibited. According to another research project, when ecdysterone has delayed release in the body of the Manduca Sexta, the caterpillar is much larger and its development time into a moth takes longer [Davidowitz: 2005]. Since ecdysterone controlls the time of pupation, we think inhibiting ecdysterone will prevent the larvae from pupating and keep their masses smaller. If the amount of the hormone ecdysterone in a Manduca Sexta is inhibited, it’s mass will be smaller than a Manduca Sexta with normal ecdysterone levels.


Materials and Method:
In this lab we used 8 Manduca Sexta larva: 4 in the controll group, and 4 in the experiment group. Since our focus was to see the differences in weight between the two groups, we weighed and monitored them in individual containers every day for 13 days. We had several controll factors that included a 24 hour light cycle, placing them in incubators at 20 degrees Celcius, and 10 grams of food each. The experimental group had 5 drops of ecdysteroid inhibitor, or aza guard, in their food, while the controll group had 5 drops of water in their food. Once we collect all the masses of the caterpillars, we will take the average mass of each caterpillar and find the mean of the mass in each group. Then we will compare the controll and experimental group and use a one-tailed t_test. 


Results:
The results showed a clear difference in mass between the two groups, with the experimental group having a much smaller average mass than the controll group. In figure 1 it can be seen that the controll group had much larger caterpillars. In fact, the controll group was able to develop much more effectively that our 2nd controll caterpillar pupated on the 6th day. The one-tailed p_value was less than 0.05, meaning it was insignificent. 



Discussion:
This experiment showed how important hormones are in the development of Manduca Sexta larva and their transition from caterpillar to moth. When ecdysterone was inhibited from the larvae via their diet, their masses were much smaller on average and they did not reach the stage in development where they could pupate. Our one-tailed t_test was less than 0.05, meaning our data was significent and our alternate hypothesis can be accepted. This means that the absence of ecdysterone in the Manduca Sexta larva slows down and inhibits the development of the larva. This can be helpful in real life because the Manduca Sexta larva is a pest that eats crops, so it is not a good idea to put ecdysterone inhibitor in the fertilizer of crops, because the caterpillars will remain larvae for longer and continue to eat the crops.  Ecdysterone is very important in the development of insect growth, as seen in the lab researching the effects of ecdysterone amounts on regenerating legs on coackroaches. It says that the presence of ecdysterone, even in small doses, is essential for morphing and development in insects [Marks: 1970]. Without ecdysterone, insects struggle to grow in weight, as seen in the Manduca Sexta, or regenerate body parts, as seen with the cockroaches. Another research project observed the importance of the Larva stages, specifically the 5th and 6th larva stages, when the caterpillar should begin pupating. Their lab showed that development in the Manduca Sexta is slower and less effective when the ecdysterone kicks in during the 6th instar instead of the 5th instar [Kingsolver: 2007]. So the larvae that reached the 6th instar are like our caterpillars who had their edysterone inhibited, because they had slower growth rates and could not reach pupation. When any hormone in an organism is altered there will be obvious effects, because they play important roles in the body communicating when to make changes.
