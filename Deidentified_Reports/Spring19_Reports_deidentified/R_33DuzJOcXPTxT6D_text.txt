Title: Differences in Root to Shoot Length Ratios Observed Between Radishes Given Tap Water and Radishes Given Salt Water

Abstract:
Plants can reallocate energy expenditure to the systems that need it the most based on their environmental conditions. To observe phenotypic plasticity in plants we examined Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus, and the differences in root:shoot length that occured between radishes given concentrated saline water and radishes given tap water over the course of two weeks. Radishes were an optimal plant choice for this study because they are quick and simple to grow, and have well defined roots and shoots that are easy to measure. We hypothesized that radishes treated with salt water would have a different root:shoot length than those treated with tap water. Radishes in different groups were grown in separate pots under similar conditions in a greenhouse for two weeks, receiving only their respective form of water. Plants given salt water had a higher mean root:shoot length than radishes given tap water. A two-tailed, two-sample t_test was conducted, and a significent result (p_value=3.14x10-5) was obtained, showing that radishes watered with salt water display a significently different root:shoot length than radishes given tap water. This is likely due to radishes under salt water conditions reallocating resources from shoot growth to root growth in order to absorb more water.


Introduction:
Natural resources have limited availability, so optimizing resource conservation and consumption is always a primary concern for all living organisms. Plants have been known to redistribute their energy expenditure. Understanding which environmental conditions lead to which specific changes in resource allocation is important to understanding their nature. The phenotypic plasticity, or ability to adapt to surroundings, in plants has been compared to an economic model where plants make energy “investments” in growth from which they will receive the most benefit [Bazzaz: 1997]. Plants must account for a multitude of changing abiotic factors like the amount of light, nitrogen, and water they receive. It has been shown that plants partition the biomass in shoots and roots in response to variation in light and nutrient availability; so plants that are not receiving a lot of light will grow more, larger shoots in an attempt to capture more sunlight [McConnaughay: 1999]. In contrast, plants that grow in the desert usually have much larger roots than shoots because they have no trouble getting sunlight, but need all the water they can find. Salt’s presence in soil has an effect similar to a drought because salt pulls water toward it, preventing the plant from absorbing water through osmosis and getting the minerals it needs from the water. 
In recent years more an\ more salt has been dumped on roads; nearly 18 million metric tons of salt is used each year to melt the ice and snow off of roads. We are investigating if radishes use a method of resource allocation similar to plants in the desert when faced with a great amount of salt in their water.  This could inform us if differences in water salinity has the same capability to induce changes in root to shoot length ratios that light and nutrients does, and if all the salt being put on roads could runoff and limit crop growth. We predict that if one group of radishes is given concentrated saline water while another group is given tap water, then there should be a significent difference in root to shoot length ratios between the two groups.


Materials and Method:
First we obtained four small pots filled with vermiculite and treated them with miracle grow. We then put about 30 radish seeds in each pot and gave each pot about 150 Ml of tap water. Next we labeled two of the pots two be given saline water and two to be given tap water and put all four pots side by side in a greenhouse with plenty of light. The pots were watered at least every other day with 150 Ml of either the salt water or tap water, respectively, for two weeks. After this period, the radish plants were carefully removed from the soil in a water bath by gently washing off the vermiculite and untangling the roots, making sure to not break any of the roots or shoots. Six replicates from each treatment group, 12 total plants, were measured for their root and shoot length. Root lengths were measured from the tip of the root to the junction with the shoot and the shoot lengths were measured from the junction with the root to the tip of the longest leaf. This data was used to determine the mean and standard deviation of the root to shoot length ratio of the two groups. A two-tailed two-sample t_test was used to determine the difference in average root to shoot length ratio between radishes given salt water and radishes given tap water.

Results:
Over the course of the two weeks, radishes given tap water grew much faster than radishes given salt water. When we harvested them, there were about a third as many sprouting radishes in the salt water pots as there were in the tap water pots, and the plants given tap water grew a lot taller than those given salt water. Overall the radishes given salt water showed heavily reduced growth compared to those given tap water. The mean root:shoot length for radishes given salt water was 2.941 ± .742, and the mean root:shoot length for radishes given tap water was 1.468 ± .406 (Fig.1). We determined that the average root:shoot length for radishes given salt water was statistically significently different from the average root:shoot length for radishes given tap water (t-value=5.508, d.f.=18, p_value=3.14x10-5).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that giving radishes salt water would give them a different root:shoot length than radishes given tap water was supported by the data. We observed a significent difference at the .05 level suggesting that water salinity does have an effect on radish resource allocation, as radishes given salt water grew larger roots compared to shoots than radishes given tap water. Radishes treated with salt water were not able to intake water as efficiently as radishes given tap water. This likely resulted in a redirection of energy from shoot to root growth in an attempt to find and absorb more water, leading to longer roots than shoots. 
Other studies have reported this same observation, one particular study using four different species of turfgrass found that the root:shoot length increased as water salinity increased in all species (Alshammary: 2004). The fact that these results are identical in a different genus of plant suggests the difference in root to shoot ratio is due to the plants ability to perform osmosis, which is decreased with the lower water potential around the roots due to the salinity.
 As radishes are a food crop and show limited growth under saline conditions it is possible that many crops could experience decreased growth if runoff from melting snow containing salt were to accumulate in agricultural fields. One Canadian study found that the chloride from road salts was toxic to aquatic life in wetlands near cities where the salt is often used (Evans: 2001). It would be interesting to do a study where we compared crop yields of farms near cities that use a lot of salt in the winter, to crop yields of farms that are exposed to little or no salt due to their location. As salt is so commonly distributed on roads in massive quantities across the U.S., there is a possibility it could severely impair agricultural output if left unregulated.
