Title: The effects of phosphate on the root to shoot ratio in Pisum sativun 

Abstract:
This experiment focused on the effects of phosphate on the root to shoot ratio for length in field peas, Pisum sativun. Phosphate lowered the length of the roots, thus lowering the root to shoot ratio.  Phosphate is essential in the synthesis and use of the main energy source in organisms, ATP.  We hypothesized that if phosphate was readily available to field pea plants that their root to shoot ratio for length would be lower than that of a plant that did not receive the phosphate.  In our experiment, we compared the root and shoot length of house pea plants grown over the course of two weeks that were watered daily.  The root to shoot ratio for length was lower in the plants that received the phosphate and the results were statistically significent.  Our hypothesis was supported and it was confirmed phosphate being present allowed for the plants with phosphate to use fewer resources peas on a root system due to not requiring as much surface area for absorption of nutrients. 


Introduction:
Resource allocation is the pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources. Plants must expend resources in order to acquire others which requires plants to make tradeoffs.  When a plant makes a tradeoff it must put in varying amounts of energy into different plant organs to optimize the capture of nutrients, light, water, and carbon dioxide in a manner that maximizes plant growth rate [McConnaughay: 1999]. Plants have varying patterns of phenotypic variation based on environmental factors as well.  Farms can use resource allocation to maximize the resources available to them.  In developing countries that have limited resources, knowledge of resource allocation would help them to use what little resources they have efficiently [Tittonel: 2005].  Root and shoot length are variable based on the type of environment they are exposed to.  The ratio of root to shoot length can be very telling of what type of environment the plants were in.  Therefore, we will be using the root to shoot length ratio as our unit of measure in this experiment.  The study species used in this experiment was the field pea, Pisum sativun.  This species was chosen because it grows quickly and thrives in a range of environments.  We hypothesized that if phosphate was readily available to plants that the root to shoot ratio will be lower than that of a plant that does not have phosphate available.  


Materials and Method:
We placed field peas in water for twenty minutes and prepared pots for them while they soaked.  Three of the pots only had wet vermiculite which was our controll group.  The other three pots had wet vermiculite with bone meal mixed into it which was our experimental group.  The bone meal contained phosphate which was mineral nutrient we chose to test.  Once the seeds had been adequately soaked we planted 3 seeds in each of the 16 holes we made in each pot.  The seeds were then covered in vermiculite and watered equally daily for two weeks.  After the two weeks three plants from each pot were taken out.  The plant with the longest root and shoot were then cut at the root-shoot junction.  Each root and shoot was measured separately and the lengths were recorded.  We found the averages and standard deviations for the one-tailed t test we performed after data collection. 

Results:
The root to shoot length ratio for the controll group with only vermiculite was 0.87± 0.26 and the root to shoot length ratio for the experimental group with phosphate was 0.51 ±0.08, as seen in Figure 2.  There was a significent difference in the root to shoot ratios of the controll and phosphate group (t_stat:3.24, d.f.: 2, p_value:0.04).  The controll group root to shoot ratio was 41.38% higher than the ratio for the phosphate group. 

Discussion:
Our results supported our original hypothesis (α=0.05). The root to shoot ratio was smaller for the plants that had an abundance of phosphate available when compared to plants that only had water.  Phosphate regulates protein synthesis, cell division, development of new tissues, and aids in complex energy transformations [Grant: 2001].  Therefore, phosphate is very important for vital plant function.  When phosphate is readily available there isn’t a need for a vast root system because the important nutrients are taken up easily.  On the other hand, plants like our controll do not have access to phosphorus so they must have a vast root system in order to maximize nutrient uptake.  A limitation that our experiment may have had was the fact we only let our plants grow for two weeks and we only measured length.  Making this a long term study and measuring mass as well as length could have strengthened our results.  In a future experiment we could add bacteria that enhance phosphate absorption and see how those plants compare to the plants that received phosphate without bacteria [Rodriguez: 1999].  This would be an interesting experiment because bacteria could be added to soil instead of potentially harmful fertilizers if our results show the bacteria make a significent difference.
