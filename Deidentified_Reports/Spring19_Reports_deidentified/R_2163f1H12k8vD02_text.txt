Title: The effect of Precor on the growth of Manduca Sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an important topic in conservation biology. With changing climates it is important to understand how plants will alter their allocation patterns in response to environmental variables. Here we look at the effect of sand on the growth patterns of the root and shoot tissues of Fagopyrum esculentum. The expectation was that the root to shoot length and weight ratios would be much greater in plants grown in the porous sand compared to plants grown in vermiculite in order to compensate for the quick rate of percolation. Our data showed no significent difference in length root to shoot ratio but did show a significent difference in weight root to shoot ratio. This significance, in conjunction with our observation of more roots per plant grown in sand or a sand/vermiculite mix, suggests that in response to a porous soil F. esculentum grows more roots in an attempt to harvest more nutrients from the porous soil. This adaptation shows a beneficial change in resource allocation that allows F. esculentum to best thrive in a changing environment.  

Introduction:
“Insect growth regulators”(IGR) are substances which are used to controll pests. And one kind of IGR is to over-activate or block specific processes regulated by Juvenile Hormone(JH) (Biology Lab manual). JH is a kind of of hormone secreted by insects like which controlls the type of molting during development. According to research, JH delayed the onset of metamorphosis by fourth-instar Manduca Sexta larvae. [Safranek: 1980] M. Sexta is a kind of insect which secret JH, and it has four life stages: egg, larvae, pupa and adult. In this experiment, I will research about how IGRs affect the growth of insects. Specifically, my research question is how does the IGR Precor, a kind of JH mimic affect the growth of M. Sexta during its larvae stage. My hypothesis is that Precor will not affect the growth of M. Sexta.

Materials and Method:
Select 8 M. Sexta caterpillars which had the weight range of 0.49g to 0.85g with length range of 2.8cm to 4.0cm. Separate them into two groups, a treatment group and a controll group, each group contained 4 caterpillars, and those caterpillars of the same group were placed in 4 separated compartments of one box with holes for air exchange. Place both groups in 25℃environment with 12h of light and 12h of darkness. For their food, each caterpillar could get 10g of food with 10 drop of water. These are all controllled variables.

For the treatment group, each caterpillar could get extra 8 drops of Precor in the food, and this was the independent variable. Everyday the length and weight of each caterpillar were measured as the dependent variable. The experiment lasted for 14 days, and if the faeces of the caterpillars were too much, faeces would be replaced with new food which would be the same as I previously stated.

After gathering the data, I calculated the average length and weight of 4 caterpillars of the same group and the same day. Then perform the 2-sample T-test for the average weight and length to test whether they were significent data. If they were, I would give the conclusion of whether Precor can affect the growth of M. Sexta.

Results:
According to figure 1, the weight of two groups were increase for the first 12 days and decrease for the last two days. And the average weight of controll group was higher than that of treatment group. And according to the figure 2, the average length of two groups increased for the first 9 days, then decreased from the 9th to the 12th day. And for the remaining two days, the average length of controll group suddenly increased form 6.98cm to 14.05cm, but the average length of treatment group decreased from 6.96cm to 6.48cm.
After doing the two-sample T-test, for the weight, the mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 6.27, d.f. = 13, P = 0.28). Also, for the length, the mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 1.54, d.f. = 13, P = 0.148).

Discussion:
Since both sets of my data were insignificent for too high P value, this indicates that my results could not prove that whether Precor could affect the growth of caterpillars or not. So Precor as an IGR, this experiment could not prove whether it could controll the number and growth of M. Sexta during its larvae age. 

However, a possible error might happen in the experiment. When measuring the length of M. Sexta, Caterpillars were not fully stretched, and this may made my results smaller than the actual values. 

Based on my results, I think in the future, similar kind of experiment with more accurate measurement and more caterpillars should be performed in order to determine whether Precor could affect caterpillars’ growth. I still held the hypothesis that Precor would not have effect on the growth of M. Sexta caterpillars as it controllled the timing and type of metamorphosis [Safranek: 1980] which was only change in status but not related to growth.
