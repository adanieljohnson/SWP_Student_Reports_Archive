Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone Analog on Mass and Length of Manduca sexta Larva

Abstract:
In this experiment, we explored the effect of a juvenile hormone analog on the mass and length of Manduca sexta larva. We mixed five drops of Martins juvenile hormone analog into the food of four larva and daily measured their mass and length and compared these measurements to the daily mass and weight of four controll caterpillars fed the same diet, but without the juvenile hormone activator. Because juvenile hormone regulates insect development, we hypothesized that the caterpillars treated with juvenile hormone analog in their food would grow to a great mass and length than untreated caterpillars. Initially, the treated caterpillars were longer and of greater mass, but by the end of fifteen days, the controll caterpillars were longer and of greater mass. Because our data was insignificent, we conclude that juvenile hormone analogs do not promote larva to increase in length or mass, but govern other aspects of insect development.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as tobacco hornworms, are pests of the Order Lepidoptera whose lifecycles last between thirty-nine and forty-seven days and include five larval instars and a pupa stage before eclosing into an adult moth [Johnson: 2016]. The development of M. sexta from caterpillar to adult moth is mediated by three hormones, prothoracicotropic hormone, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone [Johnson: 2016]. Juvenile hormone is secreted from the corpus allata gland in the insect’s foregut [Johnson: 2016], and has been known to science since the 1930’s [Staal: 1975]. A high level of juvenile hormone, hereafter known as JH, maintains internal conditions which mediate a larva-to-larva molt; low or nonexistent levels of JH allow the insect to undergo a larva-to-pupa molt [El-Sheikh: 2016][Johnson: 2016]. 
Juvenile Hormone Analogs, JHAs for short, are “structural mimics” to JH [El-Sheikh: 2016]; the introduction of JHAs to an insect has a similar effect to prolonging the period of time when JH is produced by that insect. The introduction of such compounds as JHAs or other insect growth regulators (IGRs) results in extra larval or nymph forms, superlarva, of giant, though perfect proportion, or imperfectly proportioned, half larva-half pupa or -half adult forms [Skaal: 1975]. In Spodoptera littoralis and in Spodoptera frugiperda, other species of Lepidopteran pests, the JHA insecticides methoprene, fenoxycarb, and pyriproxypen were demonstrated to extend the duration of the last larval stage, and a statistically significent number failed to develop normally into adults [El-Sheikh: 2016]. 
The effectiveness of JHAs as pesticides depends on their ability to prevent treated insects from developing into viable adults that can reproduce, rather than outright killing them. Since giant Lepidopteran superlarva do not usually eclose into viable, reproductive adults, and imperfect forms are typically nonviable [Skaal: 1975], JHAs are decent pesticides against Lepidoptera. But are treated caterpillars more pestilential while still caterpillars than untreated larva? If a JHA treatment causes caterpillars to grow longer and heavier, then they would consume more food, and thus be more pestilential. In this experiment, we measured the length and weight of M. sexta caterpillars fed a diet augmented by five drops of the juvenile hormone analog Martins. Considering that Lepidoptera treated with JHAs may grow into superlarva, recently hatched M. sexta larva fed a normal caterpillar diet augemented by five drops of synthetic juvenile hormone analog will be longer and heavier after two weeks than M. sexta fed a normal diet over the same period of time.


Materials and Method:
We selected eight young M. sexta caterpillars weighing .34 g to 1.04 g and measuring 27 mm to 42 mm and placed them in separate ventilated cells. With an electronic balance, we measured 10.00 g of food (made according to package instructions) per caterpillar used into a plastic container. For this experiment, we initially measured out 80.00 g of caterpillar food. We kneaded the food into one large, homogenous clump, then divided the food into 10.00g balls using a spoon, gloved fingers, and the balance. For the controll group, we mixed five drops of distilled water into each caterpillar food ball and placed one food ball in each controll caterpillar’s cell. For the treatment group, we made four food balls using the same process as for the controll group, but we mixed in five drops of Martins JHA instead of water. We then placed the caterpillar containers into an incubator kept at 28oC with a twenty-four-hour light cycle. Every day for fifteen days we measured and recorded each caterpillar’s mass in grams and length in millimeters and record any other qualitative observations. We replenished food, following the same process as before, as needed. We compared the average masses of the treatment group to that of the controll group using a two-sample t_test, and we compared the average lengths with the same test. We evaluated our data using a one-tailed p value.

Results:
The average mass of the treatment group was greater than the average mass of the controll group until the eleventh day, February 2. The average mass of the treatment group increased until February 3 and decreased from the third until the sixth. The rate of increase of the average mass was greater from January 23 until January 31 than from January 31 until February 6. The average mass of the controll group increased from the beginning of the experiment until February 5, and declined between the fifth and the sixth of February. (Fig 1). The standard deviation for the controll group was above three grams because one of the four caterpillars was less than half the size of the other caterpillars until February 2, when it experienced a rapid growth spurt. (Table 1).
	The average length of the treatment group was longer than the average length of the controll group until the twelfth day, February 3. The average length of the treatment group increased until February1, and between February 2 and 3. The average length of the treatment group decreased between February 1 and 2, and from February 3 to 6. The average length of the controll group increased from January 23 to 24, and from January 25 to February 5, and declined from January 24 to 25, and again from February 5 to 6. (Fig 2).
	It should first be noted that one of the four treatment group caterpillars never ate any food and died after one week. This caterpillar’s data has not been included. Before this caterpillar died, it stopped execrating and turned a crusty brown and mushy to the touch. After February 1, two of the treatment caterpillars and one of the controll caterpillars began to show brown and black spots, to become crusty and mushy, and to execrate less than the other caterpillars, yet still moved. The remaining caterpillars were green, firm to the touch, and not crusted in brown. The result of our two sample t_test for mass was as follows: t_stat = 0.03, d.f. = 28, P = 0.488. The result of our two sample t_test for length was as follows: t_stat = 0.87, d.f. = 28, P = 0.195.


Discussion:
The results of the two-sample t_test for both mass and for length indicate that our data is not significent, and the null hypothesis is accepted. Although the treated caterpillars were longer and of greater mass than the controll caterpillars for most of the days in the experiment (Table 1), they difference between the two groups was not so great that it could be attributed to the JHA. So according to this data, M. sexta larva fed a normal caterpillar diet augemented by five drops of synthetic juvenile hormone analog will not be longer and heavier after two weeks than M. sexta fed a normal diet over the same period of time. Our null hypothesis may have been accepted because our data was imprecise, as demonstrated by wide standard deviations in Table 1. Even within the controll group, the length and mass varied considerably, again as shown by the large standard deviation. This problem could be remedied in future experiments by increasing the number of test subjects, and by selecting subjects nearer to each other in initial mass and length. If the data were to be more precise, then perhaps the data would not be insignificent.
	On the other hand, our data reaffirms the known action of JHAs. The introduction of JHAs prolongs the last instar of Lepidopteran larva before pupation, and the introduction of JHAs to Lepidopteran larva in their final instar before pupation results in malformed adults [El-Sheikh: 2016].The larva in this other experiment were topically treated with JHAs and our larva were fed JHAs, the larva were of a different species (S. frugiperda and S. littoralis), but were of the same order, Lepidoptera [El Sheikh: 2016]. Tellingly, this experiment did not measure the weight or length of larva treated with JHAs before they pupated and eclosed into adults; instead, this experiment measured the percentage of treated larva which pupated and eclosed into normally formed adults in comparison to controlls [El Sheikh: 2016]. This experiment demonstrates that JHAs decrease the likelihood of Lepidopteran larva treated with JHA to pupate and eclose, and by extension, reaffirms that JH governs the type of molt a larva will undergo [El Sheikh: 2016]. JH, and JHAs, do not function as a growth hormone; they do not promote larva to grow to larger masses or longer, as demonstrated in our experiment. Instead, JH functions as a regulator of stages in Lepidopteran development, regulating the type of molt an insect will undergo [Johnson: 2016][El Sheikh: 2016]. So although JH and JHAs may induce Lepidopteran larva to molt into superlarva, extra larval instars of large proportions [Skaal: 1975], they do not promote larva to grow heavier and longer within a single instar, as shown in our insignificent data.
