Title: Local Anesthetic Effects on the Neuromuscular Stimulation of the Gastrocnemius Muscle 

Abstract:
The movement of skeletal muscles in vertebrates is caused by nerve impulses triggering action potentials in muscle fibers.  Action potentials are responsible for muscle contraction, however, repeated contraction of the same muscle causes soreness.  Local anesthetics, such as lidocaine, can be used to alleviate muscle pain, but recent studies show breathing problems can be a side effect.  In our experiment, we examined the connection of lidocaine to muscle movement by examining action potentials in lidocaine-treated gastrocnemus muscles of Rania pipien.  The frog is an excellent model for the function of skeletal muscles because it closely matches human anatomy.  Our data showed no significent difference between the mean number of action potentials observed in the controll group which was not administered lidocaine, and the mean number of action potentials in the experimental group, which was injected with lidocaine solution.  Although the results of our experiment were not statistically significent, the results showed a reduction in action potentials.  If lidocaine also causes a reduction in the effectiveness of the muscles that we use to breathe, this could be significently harmful.  Because lidocaine is so commonly used, it is important to determine its potential side effects.

Introduction:
Action potentials spread from neuromuscular junction sites to the muscle’s motor end plate.  Sodium ions aid in this process by depolarizing the end plate.  The depolarization spreads and causes more voltage-gated sodium channels to open in the surrounding cell membrane until it reaches threshold and the action potential is fired across the cell membrane to the receptors on the muscle fiber [Sadava, 2017].  Current scientific research indicates that lidocaine interferes with and decreases depolarizations in muscles [Mitchell, 1987].  The mechanisms for accomplishing this decrease are still being investigated, but it is believed that lidocaine prevents sodium from flowing through voltage-gated sodium channels [Cummins, 2007].  To study the effect of lidocaine on action potentials we prepared an experiment observing gastrocnemus muscle contractions in three Rania pipien legs used both as a controll and as an experimental group. The Rania pipien legs were not treated with lidocaine for the first part of the experiment and were injected with lidocaine solution for the second part of the experiment.  The lidocaine solution was the independent variable and the action potential in the form of muscle twitches measured in volts was the dependent variable.  We predicted that treatment with lidocaine solution would suppress the sodium channels leading to a decrease in action potentials.  

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, lidocaine solution was used to suppress the sodium channels in the gastrocnemus muscle of an experimental group of Rania pipien legs.  Three legs were initially used as a controll group and then the same legs were used for the experimental group.  Each leg was dissected to expose the gastrocnemus muscle and probes from a stimulator were attached.  The controll group was not treated with the lidocaine solution and was exposed to single pulses of 5 second constant duration from a stimulator at 1.5 volts through the probes.  The experimental group was given a 0.1 Ml injection of lidocaine solution into the gastrocnemus muscle and then exposed to a 1.5-volt pulse of 5 second constant duration through the probes.  The voltage of the muscle response in the form of twitches was recorded for both the experimental and controll groups.  The means of the data from the experimental and controll groups were used to perform a paired t_test with a 95% confidence interval. 

Results:
The paired t_test at a 95% confidence interval, with dF=2, resulted in a p_value of p = 0.219 (Table 1).  Results of the data indicate that there was a difference in muscle twitches between the non-treated controll group and the experimental group treated with lidocaine injection.  This is shown in Figure 1. In this figure, the controll group is represented by the before, or untreated, group, and the experimental group is represented by the after, or lidocaine-treated group.  The error bars represent ±0.03 standard deviations from the mean. The general trends in the data in Figure 1. show there was a reduction in the muscle response after the injection of the lidocaine.  

Discussion:
The data did not show a statistically significent difference between the mean of the controll group without the lidocaine treatment, and the mean of the experimental group with the lidocaine treatment.  The null hypothesis which states that there would be no change in mean muscle response between the controll and experimental groups, was not rejected.  With a p_value of 0.219, there is a 22% chance that the null hypothesis is true.  Although there was no statistical evidence to support the hypothesis that lidocaine can suppress sodium channels that lead to action potentials in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog, we did observe a large difference between the results of the controll and experimental groups.  The data show that there is some effect from the lidocaine, although it cannot be said that the lidocaine blocked the sodium channels to prevent an action potential from occurring.  Additional research can be done on the effect of lidocaine on muscle function.  Experiments on swine show that lidocaine has a relaxant effect on smooth muscle [Satoh, 2015].  A relaxant effect on the muscles that are used for breathing could be the cause of breathing difficulties described in recent case studies.  In one research study, lidocaine administered to rats at higher doses effectively stopped respiration through blockage of Na+ flow in cells [Shakuo, 2016].  Further study of the effect of lidocaine on muscles is necessary because of the potential side effects and the fact that lidocaine is so commonly used in medicine.  This can only be accomplished through further analysis of action potentials.  The chemical signals that cause action potentials are difficult to isolate but are crucial to our understanding of how skeletal muscles function and how to keep them pain-free.
