Title: A decrease of ecdysterone hormones inhibits the growth and development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Hormones are vital to the regulation of development in Manduca sexta. In particular, ecdysterone hormones (20E) are necessary for the onset of the pupation stage of maturation. In this experiment, a 20E blocker was added to an experimental group’s food, and the growth and development of these Manduca sexta were compared to that of a control growth. It was expected that the experimental group would not grow as much as the control and not pupate in order to become adults. The data showed a significant difference between the growth of the experimental and control groups. Blocking 20E in the experimental group meant that the Manduca sexta did not have enough 20E to fully mature and suggested that the species cannot pupate without sufficient 20E.

Introduction:
Hormones regulate many functions in living things. Among these functions are maturation and development. Ecdysterone hormones manipulate when maturation occurs in Manduca sexta (commonly known as tobacco hornworms). Ecdysterones, or 20E, also aid in the development of adult functions of Manduca sexta. If the Manduca sexta exceed a normal 20E level or are deprived of 20E in their diets, their development can be impeded. From the time the Manduca sexta are eggs, it takes, on average, 18-23 days for the insects to develop into pupa. Observing Manduca sexta (that are already larvae) for 14 days provides a time frame long enough for pupation to occur. In the pupal stage, the Manduca sexta undergoes molting, in which the body browns and develops a hard covering called a cocoon. In an experiment that monitored the development of Manduca sexta into the final stages of maturation, ecdysterones were found to be necessary for pupation to occur [Truman: 1981]. The research aimed to answer whether food that contains a 20E blocker will prevent the tobacco hornworms from pupating. The Manduca sexta still consumed 20E, but a portion of the available 20E was blocked using AzaGuard. The control group was fed unaltered tobacco hornworm food. The second group was fed the same food with an added 20E blocker. The tobacco hornworms were evaluated based on their weight, length, and whether or not they pupated. If there is a decrease in 20E in their food, then the Manduca sexta will be inhibited from increasing in weight and length and from developing into adulthood.

Materials and Methods:
There was one control group that was given food with no 20E blocker. Another group was given food with a 20E blocker. Both groups had 4 Manduca sexta placed in individual containers with holes to allow the Manduca sexta to breathe. 10 grams of food were administered per caterpillar. The experimental group was given food with 5 drops of 20E blocker per experimental tobacco hornworm. The concentration of the 20E blocker was 5 drops per 10 grams of food. This number was chosen so that the organisms would have some 20E in their diet, but they would intake less than a normal amount. The weight and length of each caterpillar was measured and recorded daily for 14 consecutive days in order to monitor the development of the Manduca sexta. Weight and length were measured because studies show that these values are highest prior to pupation [Reinecke: 1980]. Observations were recorded each day to note whether any Manduca sexta showed signs of pupation. The Manduca sexta were stored in an incubator in order to maintain a constant environment among all the tobacco hornworms. The incubator was 25 degrees Celsius and was on a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark cycle. Each container was cleaned, and food was replenished daily to keep the Manduca sexta in as clean and healthy environment as possible. A one-tailed two-sample t-test was used to compare the growth in weight and length of the experimental group to the growth in the control group. One t-test was done to compare the weights and another t-test was done to compare the lengths. The p value was measured to a 95% confidence interval. 

Results:
Using a two-sample t-test, the weight changes of the caterpillars were statistically significant (t-value = 2.744, degrees of freedom = 6, p-value = 0.017). The length changes of the caterpillars were also statistically significant (t-value = 3.123, degrees of freedom = 6, p-value = 0.010). The experimental group did not grow as much as the control group. The control group had an average daily weight change of 0.824 g. The error was one standard deviation for this average, or +/- 0.425 g. The experimental group had an average daily weight change of 0.1798 g and a standard deviation of +/- 0.199 g. The control group had an average daily length change 0.233 cm. The error was one standard deviation for this average, or +/- 0.126 cm. The experimental group had an average daily length change of 0.021 cm and a standard deviation of +/- 0.051 cm. On the 13th day of the experiment, one control group Manduca sexta had expelled a black liquid and was dead, so no data was collected from that caterpillar on the final day. Two Manduca sexta, one from the control group and one from the experimental, showed possible signs of pupation. The control Manduca sexta started to brown on day 13 and the experimental Manduca sexta started to slightly brown on day 14. The control group consistently ate the majority of their food and maintained a healthy green hue. The experimental group ate little food throughout the experiment and all four experimental Manduca sexta faded to a light green hue.  

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the experimental group would grow less than the control group and fail to pupate was supported. The hypothesis was supported because there was statistical significance between the weights and lengths of the control and experimental groups. While no caterpillars fully pupated, the experimental group failed to gain weight or grow as much as the control group (see Figures 1 and 2). The 20E blocker impeded the ability of the Manduca sexta to mature into normally functioning adults because there was not enough of the hormone 20E to develop into adulthood. The control group consumed ample 20E and was able to gain weight and length normally. The food of the experimental group contained enough 20E blocker that the experimental Manduca sexta gained less weight and did not grow as long. 20E, therefore, was necessary to aid in the normal growth of the tobacco hornworms. According to previous experiments, 20E levels peak before pupation [Bollenbacher: 1975]. Overall, the experimental group was unable to experience a peak in 20E that would bring the tobacco hornworms into pupation (although one experimental member slightly browned, it is unclear is pupation was actually beginning). One control group tobacco hornworm began to pupate because it received a sufficient amount of 20E. This tobacco hornworm’s 20E levels were able to spike, leading to pupation. Our experiment can be furthered by repeating the experiment with different concentrations of 20E blocker to see how much 20E is needed for Manduca sexta to pupate. This information could be used to study Manduca sexta in their natural environments and ensure that their habitats had enough 20E for the tobacco hornworms to pupate, reproduce, and support a population.
