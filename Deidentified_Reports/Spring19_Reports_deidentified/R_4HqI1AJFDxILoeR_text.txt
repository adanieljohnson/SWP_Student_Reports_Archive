Title: IGRs  and Its Impact on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Over the course of this experiment, the main purpose is to analyze the effect of  IGR hormones on the growth development of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars .The experiment conducted involves observing the effects of IGR; which is a mimicking hormone, on Manduca sexta Caterpillars over the course of two weeks. Based on the hypothesis stated, one can infer that if an excess amount of Precor IGR is given to the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar, there will be a reduced chance of survival for the insect due to changes in growth development which can be observed based on weight in grams, and length in millimeters. Based on the method, Eight  Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were divided into two experimental groups, four placed in the treatment group, and four being placed a placebo group. The treatment group was a treatment of 6 drops of Precor IGR per Caterpillar for each Manduca Sexta. As for the Control group, 6 drops were given per Caterpillar meal for each Manduca Sexta. Over the two weeks, Observation data revealed that IGR may have had a great impact on Manduca Sexta growth, but did not solemnly affect the survival rate of Caterpillars the way it was anticipated. In addition,  the non-significent results calculated conveyed a conclusion that was not surely predicted overall.


Introduction:
The main purpose of this experiment reflects upon the impact hormones have on insect growth.  Hormones generally regulate growth development by either being secreted or released into the organism. The two main focus hormones in this experiment are Juvenile Hormones and Ecdysterone (20E). IGRs are mimics of Juvenile hormone, which regulates the molts that are the intermissions before each of the five stages in the Manduca Sexta Developmental process. As for Ecdysterone hormone, they are regulators for the timing of motling for the Manduca Sexta [Wake Forest: 2018]. Observed effects  of IGR hormones will be analyzed to determine to what extend do insect growth regulators have on the development growth of the caterpillar.  Growth regulator are essential in the developmental process for any organism. An organism can develop expeditiously without if lacking necessary hormone regulators that essentially allows  the organism to develop  naturally to the adult stage. The purpose of IGR hormones is to slow the developmental process of the Manduca Sexta, enable it from surpassing the larva stage into the adult stage. The main hypothesis for this experiment conveys that  if an excess amount of Precor IGR is given to the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar, there will be a reduced chance of survival for the insect due to changes in growth development which can be observed based on weight in grams, and length in millimeters. Overall, there is a prediction that the Manduca Sexta are more likely to excessively grow in size, yet remain in their larva stage rather develop into adults, which will lead to risk chance of survival. 


Materials and Method:
Initially,We began  by collecting and labeling 8 insect holder and divide them into two groups for the treatment and placebo groups.Then, eight 12-day old  Caterpillars were measured based on classified = group (ex: Placebo Group 1), for weight in grams, and length in millimeters. We then began weighing out 10 grams of regular caterpillar food which will be placed into each insect container for Manduca Sexta nutrition. Once the meal was placed into the container, the drops were added using a pipet. Six drop of Precor IGR were added to the food for each treatment group Caterpillar, and Six drops of water  were added to the food for each placebo group Caterpillar. Once the the drops were added, and the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were placed in their specified container. All eight insect containers were placed into a  25Â° C room temperature Refrigerator. Over the course of two weeks, we made sure that an individual from our  group was recording the weight, and length of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars, and any observed physical changes in the Caterpillar such as motion, color, and texture. It was also important to refill Caterpillar food when it  was all eaten to ensure that the Caterpillars were ingesting either Precor IGR or ingesting basic nutrition for the placebo. When recorded  results was calculated,we made sure all the weights and lengths for each experimental group for all fourteen days were averaged.  From there a two-sample t_test for both weight and length would be conducted in order to analyze the two-tailed p_value for both weight and length and determine if the results are significent or not significent. 


Results:
Based on the results calculated and graphed, The average observed Length for the two week averages of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars was 49.092 mm which is roughly 8 values lower than the average length for the treatment group which was 57.292 mm. As  for the  average observed weight for the two week averages of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars was 3.965 g which was  roughly 2 values lower than the average weight for the treatment group which was 5.425 g. All 12 day average for both the lengths and weights are indicated in the figures below, where figure 1 indicates average weights of manduca Sexta over 12 day course. Figure 2 represents the average weights of manduca Sexta over 12 day course. The observed two-tailed p_value for the Average lengths of both experimental groups for the Manduca Sexta was 0.1920, while the observed two-tailed p_value for the Average weights of both experimental groups for the Manduca Sexta was 0.2189. The average recorded standard deviation entailed more variability in the controll groups for the Manduca Sexta Average length (millimeters) which  was 8.24, while the treatment groups had a standard deviation of 6.84. As for the the weight, the standard deviation for the average treatment group Manduca Sexta was 1.54 which is  slightly greater than  the standard deviation for the average controll group which was 1.376.


Discussion:
	Inferring back to the results, the statistical two sample t_test resulted in a two-tailed p_value for the for the Average lengths of both experimental groups for the Manduca Sexta which was 0.1920  p&gt;0.05, which is not statistically significent, so we fail to reject the null. Instead we reject the alternative hypothesis that if  an excess amount of Precor IGR is given to the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar, there will be a reduced chance of survival for the insect due to changes in growth development which can be observed based on weight in grams, and length in millimeters. As for he statistical test two-tailed p_value for the for the Average weights of both experimental groups for the Manduca Sexta, the p_value was 0.2189 which is p&gt;0.05, which is not statistically significent, so we fail to reject the null. We reject the alternative hypothesis again stating that if  an excess amount of Precor IGR is given to the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar, there will be a reduced chance of survival for the insect due to changes in growth development which can be observed based on weight in grams, and length in millimeters. Based on the observed results, our results support our observation which was not as anticipated. Although the assumption was made that the Caterpillars would only risk survival chance if had excess IGR, the controll group Caterpillars also were deceased. The final four Caterpillars remaining were two from the controll group, and two from the treatment group. Although our data did not support our hypothesis, other studies have revealed a correlation between excess IGR regulation and Insect well-being.  An article on critical weight in correlation with development of insect body size revealed how hormones have effects that minimizes the growth of the insect during larva development [Davidowitz: 2003]. Although there are no accurate explanation to why our controll group Caterpillars died, there may be a potential study to carry out on how the environment these Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were put in could have an affect on their development overall. The experiment overall revealed relevant impacts mimicking hormones can have on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars.

Figure Legends: 
 Figure 1: This bar graph represents the over average of weights (in grams) for the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars over the course of 12 days. The black lines indicate the standard deviation for both experimental groups and how the standard deviation was recorded over time for average weights. The Control Caterpillars increase their average weight (in grams) over the 12 days, while the Treatment Caterpillars carry an increasing decreasing pattern over the 12 days. Each day was recorded excluding day 4 and 5 which is why only 12 days are recorded on the graph.

 Figure 2: This bar graph represents the over average of lengths  (in millimeter) for the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars over the course of 12 days. The black lines indicate the standard deviation for both experimental groups and how the standard deviation was recorded over time for average weights. The Control Caterpillars increase their average lengths  (in millimeter)  consistently over the 12 days. the Treatment Caterpillar also have a consistent pattern  for lengths over the 12 days. Each day was recorded excluding day 4 and 5 which is why only 12 days are recorded on the graph.*************************************************************************
