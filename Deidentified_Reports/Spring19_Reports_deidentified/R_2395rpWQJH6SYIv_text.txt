Title: Replica Male Betta Fish Shown to not Stimulate Agonistic Behavior in Live Male Betta Splendens

Abstract:
When faced against other males, Betta splendens use aggressive displays like a red mane to scare off their opponent. To better understand the stimuli leading to agonistic behavior in male bettas we observed 3 males in an isolated environment, with one replica male betta in the tank, and with two replicas in the tank, and recorded how long they had their red manes out over the course of five minutes in each treatment. We hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in red mane exposure time between at least two of the treatments. The bettas did not recognize the replicas as real opponents and displayed their red mane to the replicas for little to no time. A one-way ANOVA test was conducted and an insignificant result (p=.575) was obtained showing that the replica betta fish did not stimulate red manes or aggressive behavior in the betta fish. This is likely because the replicas did not have realistic enough color patterns and could not move and therefore did not simulate any of the more intricate agonistic displays, so the live males did not view them as a threat.

Introduction:
Most animal behaviors have evolved over many generations and are triggered by certain stimuli to serve a specific physiological purpose; ethology helps us discover what causes a certain behavior and what the purpose of that behavior is. Some behaviors, like mating and fighting, require more energy than others and therefore have peticularly specific stimuli to ensure that the organism is not using energy for no purpose. In this experiment we use male Betta splendens because they are easy to keep alive in a laboratory setting and have a set of easily recognizable aggressive behaviors with a simple stimulus: other male bettas. One such agonistic behavior is a facing display where the branchiostegal membranes located underneath the opercula are protruded creating a red “mane” in attempt to intimidate other males [Johnson: 2018]. Betta fish are particularly good at recognizing other male bettas based on specific visual cues; it has been found that accurate color distribution and scale patterns in images were key factors in male bettas displaying aggressive behaviors, more so than general shape of image or replication of agonistic displays [Bando: 1991]. These results, however, were found using two-dimensional images, we are interested in whether a three-dimensional, plastic replica male betta fish would look realistic enough to activate agonistic behavior, marked by red mane display, in male bettas. Our replicas have the general shape and color of a male betta in an agonistic display, but were not specifically designed for this experiment. The bettas’ reactions could give us further insight into the keenness of their vision and whether or not shape and physical presence are important factors in triggering aggressive displays. It could say a lot about their particularity in performing high energy displays and the levels of selection that went into analyzing potential threats. We predict that if a male Betta splenden is exposed to no replica male betta, then one replica male betta, and then two replicas; there will be a significant difference in red mane exposure time between at least two of the treatments.

Materials and Methods:
First we obtained three male Betta splendens being kept in the lab and put them in separate glass tanks each devoid of stimuli inside the tank. We also obtained two plastic replica male betta fish in agonistic displays. Then we observed one betta alone in its tank alone and undisturbed for five minutes, trying not to agitate it with any quick movements or by getting too close to the glass, and recorded the amount of time the fish spent with its red mane out. We then repeated this process for the other two bettas. Next we placed one of the replica bettas in the tank with one of the live fish for five minutes with no other disturbances and recorded the amount of time the red mane was out; we then repeated this process for the two other bettas. Finally we placed both of the replica bettas in the tank with the fish that first received the first replica, to ensure a proper rest period, for five minutes with no other disturbances and recorded the amount of time he displayed his red mane. We then repeated this for the two remaining fish in order of which had been the longest without seeing the replica. We used a one-way ANOVA test to test for significant differences between the average times with a red mane spent out for the the two treatment groups and the control.

Results:
We observed that when the replica was added to the tanks it took a while for the bettas to notice them, possibly because they floated near the surface. Once they noticed it they approached the replica cautiously and inspected it thoroughly, one betta even bit at the replica. However, two of the fish never made a red mane and the one that did did so for less time when the replica was in the tank than when it was not. It would also display its mane while facing away from the replica; we are unsure as to why that betta had its mane out for an extended period with no stimulus. The mean red mane exposure time for no replicas was 7.33 ±10.37 seconds (Fig 1). The mean red mane exposure time for one replica in the tank was 7.33 ±8.34 seconds (Fig 1). The mean red mane exposure time for two replicas in the tank was 0 ± 0 seconds (Fig 1). We determined that there was no statistically significant difference between any of the mean red mane exposure times [F(2,6)= 0.607, p=0.575].

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that there would be a significant difference in red mane exposure time between at least two of three treatment groups was not supported by the data. We observed no significant variance at the .05 level suggesting that our replica male betta fish have no effect on betta fish agonistic behavior. The replicas were not realistic enough to convince the live bettas that they were a threat. Due to either lack of movement or lack of other visual cues the live bettas could tell the replicas were not other real males. The replicas used did not move so they could not change their display; as betta fish often swim back and forth flicking their fins and changing their displays during agonistic behavior, the lack of motion must have looked off to the live fish. The fact that bettas move so much during an encounter means that shape might play less of role in generating agonistic responses than physiologically accurate colorations [Bando: 1991]. Our replica was made out of a soft plastic and therefore relied more on shape than scale patterns to deceive the bettas. Also, organisms habituate to stimuli that turn out to be different from what they initially appeared to be in order to conserve energy. Betta fish will habituate to stimuli that trigger aggressive responses if exposed to them many times in a row with little break or if shown for a prolonged period of time [Peeke: 1970]. Habituation to the replicas may have occurred by the final treatment group because the bettas showed their red mane for even less time while two replicas were in the tank compared to when one replica was in. Another study using replicas was able to obtain significant results, however their replicas were robots that could move and had lights under the gills that acted as additional triggers for aggressive behavior [Romano: 2017]. Because a robot was able to generate an aggressive response from male bettas I believe that smell does not play a big part in stimulating the displays, instead I think it is based on the specific visual cues related to movement and color mentioned earlier that our replicas could not produce. This suggests that Betta splendens evolved keen eyesight in order to be exceptional at determining whether or not what they are seeing is actually another male betta. This helps minimize time spent using energy doing aggressive displays toward fish and other objects that pose no threat to them. Bettas that were better at recognizing real males from other stimuli in their surroundings likely were less easily surprised by other males and wasted less energy on non-threats; they were therefore more likely to mate and pass on their genes. In a future experiment it would be intriguing to have a gradient of different replica bettas, each more realistic than the last, to determine at what level of detail a betta will be fooled and what the distinguishing features on the replica are that triggered the response.
