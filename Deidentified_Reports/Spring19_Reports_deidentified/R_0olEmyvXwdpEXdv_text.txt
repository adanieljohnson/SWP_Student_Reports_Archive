Title: Effects of Precor on Menduca sexta

Abstract:
This experiment involves determining how Manduca sexta will react to different changes in Juvenile hormone (JH) levels compared to a controll group. The experimental group was given Precor, which is a chemical substance containing methoprene, a JH mimic, causing the caterpillars to not undergo the commitment pulse. The four caterpillars in the controll group were given 40 grams of food mixed with 20 drops deionized water, while the four caterpillars in the experimental group were given 40 grams of caterpillar food mixed with 20 drops of Precor. After conducting this experiment, the data obtained stated that the mean caterpillar weight for the controll group was 12.7525 +/- 1.11736 grams and the mean weight for the experimental caterpillar group was 9.7275 +/- 1.34033 grams. The two-tailed p_value obtained for this experiment was 0.013351, which was calculated from a two-variable T-test. These results indicate that the presence of Precor, containing methoprene, within Manduca sexta prevent the caterpillars from reaching the commitment pulse, where they molt from the larvae stage to the pupa and adult stages. The hypothesis for this experiment states that as the relative levels of Juvenile hormone in the Manduca sexta increase, the relative weight of the Manduca sexta will increase.

Introduction:
In organisms, including insects, growth and development throughout life is controllled by different hormones. Hormones are chemical substances which stimulate different cells and tissues to change, causing various effects, such as development within that organism. This experiment specifically looks at the Manduca sexta, which is a breed of caterpillar, and how different hormones within the caterpillar controll the four different stages of life. These four different stages are: the egg stage, the larvae stage, the pupa stage, and the adult stage. The two main hormones which controll the change from stage to stage are Ecdysterone (20 E) and Juvenile hormone (JH). Ecdysterone is secreted by the prothoracic glands at the back of the insect’s head and Juvenile hormone is secreted by the corpus allata located on both sides of the for gut. Ecdysterone controlls the time of molting within the caterpillars by activating genes needed in the molting process. Juvenile hormone controlls the type of molting within the caterpillars by either being active (present) or inactive (absent). JH is secreted by the corpora allata during larval molts but is not secreted during metamorphic molts [Bollenbacher: 1986]. Molting is when the epidermal cells in an insect’s skin form a new outer layer of cuticle cells. This causes the old layer of cells to peel off, transforming the insect’s body [Tate: 1996]. Within Manduca sexta, when the levels of Juvenile hormone drop and the levels of Ecdysterone rise, the commitment pulse occurs. The commitment pulse is a process within molting that causes the Manduca sexta to molt from the larva stage, to the pupa and adult stages. In this experiment, a group of caterpillars was given an increased amount of Juvenile hormone through the mixing of the chemical Precor into their food. This chemical is a Juvenile hormone analog, mimicking its effects within the caterpillar, therefore resulting in the caterpillars having much higher levels of juvenile hormone than normal. This can lead to the following biological statement; will these increased levels of juvenile hormone present within the caterpillars have any effect on how they develop and go through the four life stages of the Manduca sexta? From this, the following hypothesis was generated, as the relative levels of Juvenile hormone increase, through the addition of methoprene, in the Manduca sexta, the relative weight of the Manduca sexta will increase due to the Manduca sexta not becoming pupae because they do not undergo the commitment pulse.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, eight different Manduca sexta were split into two different groups (four caterpillars in each group). These two groups were placed in two separate containers One group was given Precor methoprene, which is a chemical substance that mimics the effects of Juvenile hormone within the caterpillar and the other group acted as a controll group. Both groups were given 40 grams of caterpillar food (10 grams for each caterpillar). The 40 grams of caterpillar food was mixed with 20 drops of deionized water for the controll group, and 20 drops of Precor for the experimental group. At the start of the experiment each caterpillar was weighed, and the relative caterpillar weights were recorded in our lab books. The caterpillars were then weighed daily for the following two weeks and fed when the food was running low or appeared to be visibly dry. Following the two weeks, the date at which the caterpillar weight stopped increasing was determined to be the final day where the results would be used for statistical testing. The statistical test used in this experiment is a two-sample t_test.

Results:
The mean caterpillar weight for the controll group was 12.7525 +/- 1.11736 grams and the mean weight for the experimental caterpillar group was 9.7275 +/- 1.34033 grams. The standard deviation for the controll group was 1.11736 and the standard deviation for the experimental group was 1.34033. For this experiment, a two-sample t_test was used to analyze the results obtained. The degrees of freedom obtained was 6. The t-value obtained was 3.46707. Finally, the two-tailed p_value for this experiment is 0.013351. During the two-week feeding process, the caterpillars in both groups were observed growing up until day 9. Even though the majority of caterpillars stopped growing by day 9, there were a few caterpillars which continued to grow after day 9 (their relative weights still increased). These caterpillars were the fourth controll caterpillar, the third experimental caterpillar, and the fourth experimental caterpillar. The caterpillars in the controll group appeared to be growing at a faster rate than the caterpillars in the experimental group. The caterpillars in the controll group began to go through their commitment pulse and began pupation during the second half of the two-week weighing period, while the caterpillars in the experimental group did not appear this way. On day 11 of the experiment, it appeared that controll caterpillar three had died because it was motionless, even when stimulated.

Discussion:
The hypothesis for this investigation was rejected by the results obtained from this experiment. The results obtained showed that the controll group of Manduca sexta weighed more than the experimental group of Manduca sexta, even though the experimental group was given a Juvenile hormone analog, Precor, in their food. The two-tailed p_value obtained for this experiment was 0.013351. Since the two-tailed p_value obtained for this experiment is less than 0.05, the data obtained is statistically significent. Therefore, the null hypothesis for this experiment is rejected, meaning that the data obtained during this experiment is statistically significent (the addition of Precor does affect the growth and development of Manduca sexta). This is in accordance with previous investigations into hormone controll in the Manduca sexta [Bollenbacher: 1986]. This discovery is relevant because the increased levels of Juvenile hormone (from the Precor solution) in the experimental group of Manduca sexta prevented the caterpillars from pupating and reaching their pupa and adult stages of life. This knowledge could be useful with other insects who become pests as adults (like mosquitos) because one could prevent these insects from becoming pests, destroying crops or harming people. This could save large amounts of money in crop yield or millions of lives (in regard to mosquitos and malaria), making this discovery very useful within different aspects of society.
