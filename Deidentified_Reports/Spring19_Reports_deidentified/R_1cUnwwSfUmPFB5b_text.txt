Title: Effect of JH analogue (methoprene) on Manduca sexta growth

Abstract:
This experiment investigates the effects of higher doses of juvenile hormone analogue, or methoprene, on the growth and development of Manduca sexta. Our hypothesis was that if the amount of methoprene given to Manduca sexta was increased, the caterpillars would never pupate and would only continue to increase in weight. After feeding a control group of caterpillars water, and experimental group methoprene for 2 weeks, data analyzation of collected weights with a two-sample t test was utilized. This analysis revealed that the control group had a greater average change in weight than the experimental group, leading to the conclusion that the increased levels of methoprene were likely detrimental to caterpillar growth and development. Our hypothesis was supported by the fact that the experimental caterpillars never pupated, but it was also not supported due to the fact that the experimental caterpillars failed to gain weight exponentially.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a tobacco hornworm native to most of the United States and some parts of Central America [Byron:2017]. In its adult form following pupation, the species is commonly referred to as Carolina sphinx moth or hawk moth. After hatching from its egg, the larvae will go through roughly five instar stages, or molts, which after each they will be slightly larger in length and weight. After the fifth instar, the caterpillars will pupate, creating a dark brown cuticle coating around themselves, and during which they will rearrange their organs and physical properties to become a moth. This process is carefully controlled by a wide range of hormones, including juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E). JH controls the type of molts (which instar stage) each caterpillar will undergo, while 20E controls the timing of each molt and the shift from one instar to another. Both have additional functions in the adult moths. During the fifth instar stage, the brain will send a commitment pulse, a slightly increased amount of 20E which appears as a pulsing black line along the back. The commitment pulse indicates that the larva is ready to pupate, and once the pulse is sent, the larva will enter pupation within a few days. Once the pulse has been sent, JH will increase slightly, while 20E levels will decrease initially, but then increase more than JH levels. Once the caterpillar begins pupating, both levels will decrease once more [NA:2018]. 

For this experiment we wanted to investigate the effects on weight of increased JH analogue (methoprene) levels in Manduca sexta. We predicted that if the amount of methoprene given to a Manduca sexta is increased, then the larvae (caterpillars) will never pupate and will only continue to increase in weight.


Materials and Methods:
We utilized an experimental and a control group to test this hypothesis, each group consisting of 4 separated caterpillars. We determined to give each caterpillar 5 drops of liquid per 10 grams of food, which was replaced every few days. The experimental group’s liquid was Precor, our methoprene source, and the amount we fed each caterpillar (5 drops per 10 grams food) was our independent variable. The control group’s liquid was filtered water. Both groups were fed a standard caterpillar food. We began the experiment by weighing all 8 caterpillars and recording their weight in grams, and giving each caterpillar 10 grams of caterpillar food with 5 drops of their respective liquids. We proceeded to weigh each caterpillar once per day at roughly the same time each day for exactly 2 weeks, regularly taking down observations and snapping photographs. Our dependent variable was the change in weight observed of each of the caterpillars, and we utilized a two-sample t test to analyze our data.


Results:
The average change in weight of the control group of caterpillars from Day 0 to Day 9 was 12.75 grams, with a standard deviation of 1.12 grams, as displayed in Figure 1. The average weight change of the experimental group of caterpillars from Day 0 to Day 9 was 9.73 grams, with a standard deviation of 1.34 grams, also displayed in Figure 1. We observed a general trend of the control group gaining weight steadily at a faster rate than the experimental group. We also observed that a couple of the experimental caterpillars turned a pale shade of green, and it was almost impossible to determine by looking at their backs if the black commitment pulse had been sent. By the end of the 2 weeks, one of the experimental caterpillars had started to have its skin become looser and wrinkled, and parts of its head began secreting a black substance. All 4 control caterpillars had a commitment pulse by the end of the 2 weeks and had visibly started to enter pupation, with a darkened cuticle in the process of forming, while it was unclear if any of the experimental caterpillars had a commitment pulse or had reached pupation.
As shown in Figure 1., the control group had a larger average change in weight the experimental group, and therefore gained more weight during the 2 weeks of the experiment.


Discussion:
Based on the given data above, it appears that an increased amount of JH analogue, or methoprene in this case, could have overwhelmed the endocrine system of the caterpillars with too much hormone, potentially causing multiple system and organ failures. It is possible that so much hormone (methoprene) forced the hormone receptors on each cell to refuse to accept anymore methoprene, or even other, hormones because they could not process them. This scenario is similar to that of when a human develops Type II diabetes often from flooding their system with too much glucose (sugar); their system is overwhelmed and their cells can no longer handle large amounts of sugar, so they refuse to accept any glucose released into the bloodstream. This requires them to take insulin, which allows sugar to enter their cells and keep them functioning. However, without insulin supplements, people with Type II diabetes would not be able to survive since they would experience multiple-system failure. In the same way, it is possible that the endocrine system in the experimental caterpillars was overwhelmed and the cells of the caterpillars refused to accept anymore methoprene, leading to less growth than the control caterpillars, who produced their own JH at biologically standard levels. If this were the case, it would seem that increased levels of JH analogue did prevent the experimental caterpillars from pupating, which supports our hypothesis, but they did not continue to exponentially gain weight like we predicted. Instead, they appeared more sickly than the control group likely due to multiple-system failure of their organs. It would be practical to repeat the experiment several more times with varying numbers of drops of Precor per 10 grams of food for each experimental group to determine if these results are confirmed regardless of how much Precor is added to their diets. Our findings reveal that by feeding Manduca sexta increased levels of JH analogue, their growth and pupation can be prevented, and potentially even lead to death. This knowledge is relevant particularly for the farming community who deals with the caterpillars on a regular basis destroying their crops, due to the fact that it will assist them in making decisions on the amounts of methoprene that would be wisest to feed the caterpillars in order to prevent them from eating their crops as much as possible.
