Title: The Effect of Tubocurarine on Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction Strength in the Raina pipens

Abstract:
In this experiment, we investigated how an acetylcholine receptor antagonist affects the magnitude of skeletal muscular response in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Raina pipens. We hypothesized that the known antagonist Tubocurarine would decrease the strength of muscular contraction when injected directly into the muscle using a syringe. We completed three trials of our experiment with three R. pipens’ legs and recorded the strength of muscle contraction upon direct stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle using an iWorx computer program. There was a noticeable decrease in muscle contraction strength for each experimental trial. The averaged muscle contraction strength of the three legs before treatment was 0.189 volts and the averaged muscle contraction strength of the three legs after being injected with tubocurarine was 0.085 volts. Upon the completion of our data analysis using a paired T-test, our p-value was determined as 0.012011 allowing us to reject the null hypothesis and accept ours as true. In the future, this experiment could be repeated on smooth and cardiac muscle to determine the effect of Tubocurarine on those muscle types in comparison to skeletal muscle. 

Introduction:
Muscular contraction is a complex mechanism that can respond to a stimulus within milliseconds due to the electrical signaling of an action potential [Johnson: 2018]. Motor neurons innervate skeletal muscles and are the medium through which an action potential travels [Johnson:2018]. The points at which the branches of a motor neuron branches and comes in contact with the skeletal muscle are called the neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. In order to initiate a muscle contraction, an action potential must fire and travel along the axon of a motor neuron arriving at the neuromuscular junction causing the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Ach) [Johnson:2018]. The ACh then binds to its specific receptor located on the membrane of the muscle fiber to trigger the opening of sodium channels [Johnson:2018]. The influx of sodium into the muscle fiber triggers another action potential that spreads through the length of the fiber and stimulates the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson:2018]. The Ca2+ triggers the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber by binding to troponin C and initiating a conformational change that allows a crossbridge to form between actin and myosin [Greig: 2013]. Once a crossbridge is formed, the myosin heads pull themselves along the actin in a power stroke shortening the muscle fibers [Greig: 2013]. The shortening of the muscle fibers through this mechanism is a muscle contraction. The strength of this muscle contraction is what we are investigating in our experiment. 
Without the signal from the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the muscle fiber would not be able to stimulate the release of calcium and contract. Certain drugs have already been proven to inhibit or amplify the ability of acetylcholine and affect muscle contraction by binding to acetylcholine receptors [Zhang: 1998]. In this lab, we are testing the affect of the known antagonist Tubocurarine on the effect of muscle contraction strength in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Raina pipens. The Raina pipens was used as our experimental organism due to its large leg muscles that are easily exposed through the degloving of its outer epidermis. The gastrocnemius muscle in the R. pipens is also very similar the gastrocnemius muscle in humans allowing us to extrapolate our findings and potentially apply it to human skeletal muscle and anatomy. 
We hypothesize that the addition of the ACh receptor antagonist will decrease the magnitude of the muscle contraction during direct muscle stimulation because the acetylcholine neurotransmitter will not be able to bind to its receptor sites and trigger the mechanism of muscular contraction. This study is important because it could potentially lead to the development of muscle relaxers that help treat diseases characterized by cramping and uncontrollable muscle contractions or spasms.


Materials and Methods:
We measured muscle contraction strength using a computer program called iWorx. To collect data using this program, we had to attach the gastrocnemius muscle to probes. To expose the muscle of our frog leg, we first had to deglove the leg by grasping the skin with forceps and pulling it down towards the foot. Once the skin had been removed, we carefully detached the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg by snipping the tendon that attached it to the lower bones of the frog leg making sure to keep part of the tendon long so we could tie a string around it. After we tied the string to the tendon, we used it to hold the muscle up vertically making sure the string had a slight amount of tension to it, but not too much as to pull on or stretch the muscle. We then inserted the electrodes directly into the gastrocnemius muscle making sure the metal of the two probes did not touch and stayed within the meaty portion of the muscle. After we set up the muscle, we determined threshold by increasing the stimulus by 0.01 volts until there was a response. Once we determined threshold, we used this value to stimulate the leg three times for our control data. Once our control data was collected, we injected the muscle with approximately 5mL of the antagonist Tubocurarine using a syringe. After waiting 5 minutes, we used our determined threshold value and stimulated the leg three more times.
Throughout the duration of the lab, we made sure to continuously moisten the frog legs with Ringer’s solution in order to prevent drying out, and to replenish it with electrolytes. We used three frog legs during our experiment, and repeated the same set-up and procedure for each one. Since frogs vary in their musculature and size, we used each leg as both a control and an experimental specimen. We recorded the strength of muscle response for each frog leg six times in total; three control trials and three experimental trials. Once we collected our data using the iWorx Physiological Recorder computer program, we averaged the response for each control and experimental set of data for each leg. We then evaluated these averages using a paired t-test and determined our p-value significance using 0.05 as our degree of freedom.


Results:
There is a noticeable difference in the strength of the muscle contraction for the control trials in comparison to the treatment trials; once the frog leg was injected with tubocurarine, muscle contraction strength significantly decreased in each frog leg. The average muscle contraction response for our first leg was 0.246 volts before it was treated with the tubocurarine, and 0.158 volts after being injected with tubocurarine (Figure 1). The average muscle contraction response for our second leg was 0.216 volts before treatment, and 0.090 volts after treatment (Figure 1). The third leg had an average muscle contraction response of 0.105 volts before treatment and 0.008 volts after treatment (Figure 1). The average standard deviation for all three trials before the legs were treated was 0.008, and the average standard deviation once the legs were treated with the tubocurarine was 0.0128 (Figure 1). Each frog leg showed a decrease in muscle contraction strength after its injection with tubocurarine. However, the responses differed in between the individual legs. Our third leg had a noticeably lesser response to muscle stimulation in both the control and treatment trials in comparison to the first two legs (Figure 1). 
Our calculated p-value from our paired T-test was 0.012011 making our data significant. 


Discussion:
There was a noticeable decrease in the muscle response of each frog leg’s gastrocnemius muscle after the injection of Tubocurarine. Upon the completion of our analysis, we were able to determine the significance of our data due to our very small p-value, and support our hypothesis. However, the experiment could be repeated in order to solidify our results, and make sure our results were not due to error. We only used three test legs, and more data collected could give us better insight into how significantly Tubocurarine impacts muscle contraction. Since the muscular response decreased, we can determine that the Tubocurarine works similarly to other neuromuscular blockers by binding to acetylcholine receptors to decrease the propagation of the motor action potential [Feldman:2012].
In order to broaden the scope of our study, we could formulate a similar procedure using different muscles.  There are previous experiments citing the effects of agonists on smooth muscle contraction in the trachea [Zhang:1998]. Therefore, it would be reasonable to repeat this experiment to determine the affect of our particular antagonist, Tubocurarine, on the affects of smooth muscle, and potentially cardiac muscle as well. This study could even be expanded to include other antagonists and eventually result in different drugs that are able to help with uncontrollable muscle spasms and cramps in all areas of the body.
