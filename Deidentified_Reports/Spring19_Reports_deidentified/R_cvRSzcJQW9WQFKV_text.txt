Title: Examination of Photosystem II Activity Using DCIP Analysis in Spinacia oleracea in response to Varying Salinity Concentrations 

Abstract:
In California there are “approximately 4.5 million acres of irrigated cropland — primarily on the West Side of the San Joaquin Valley — are affected in California by saline soils or saline irrigation water” [Letey: 200]. Rising salinity levels are of great concern because many plants are sensitive to salinity and their production can be limited by non-conducive salinity levels [Shrivastava: 2014]. This experiment studies the PSII activity in Spinacia oleracea in response to varying salinity concentrations.  It is hypothesized that  an increase salinity will decrease PSII activity which will decrease overall photosynthesis.  A DCIP assay was run for spinach leaves in deionized water, 3.5% salinity, and  7.0% salinity. The average absorbances from each of these assays were analyzed through an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test. The ANOVA test gave a p-value of 0.002301, but this value was not significant as the Tukey-Kramer test revealed that  improper comparisons were used which caused a significant p-value when in reality none of the results were statistically significant. Analysis of the Tukey-Kramer test showed that this experiment did not support the hypothesis that as the salinity of a solution increases, photosynthesis decreases. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods (ie: glucose) from carbon dioxide to water. There are three distinct stages to photosynthesis. The first two stages are called the light dependent reactions. These stages use excited photons from light wavelengths to generate NADPH. The electrons from NADPH are used to create the photon gradient used to drive ATP synthesis. The light dependent reactions have two subsystems: PSII and PSI. In PSII energy from absorbed photons of light causes electrons from water to pump free protons across the thylakoid membrane to generate a proton gradient. In PSI electrons travel through a multisubunit complex from NADP+ to NADPH. This reaction removes some protons form the chloroplast stroma to add further to the proton gradient. Together these photosystems create and electrochemical gradient that push protons back towards the stroma of the chloroplast through ATP synthase complex which generates ATP. The third stage is the light independent reaction. This stage uses the enzyme complex rubisco, ATP and the electrons in NADPH to create glucose molecules from carbon dioxide. All of the ATP generated from these reactions is consumed by carbon fixation. Plants and animals can also carry out glycolysis in the cytoplasm and citric acid cycle in mitochondria to get ATP for cellular processes. In these processes glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and the high energy electrons released by this break down are eventually used to power ATP synthesis. The activity of photosystem (II), hence known as PSII, can be determined by DCIP decolorization assay. DCIP replaces NADP+ as the electron acceptor at PSI. DCIP is naturally a dark blue compound. However, whenever it is reduced to DCIPH2 its bonds are reorganized to conjugated C=C bond which make the molecule colorless. This color loss lets us measure DCIP reduction to DCIPH2 directly, as a decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm [Johnson:2018]. “In an experiment studying the effects of salinity on photosynthesis in maize, it was found that salt stress decreased the number of active PSII reaction centers, impaired the connectivity between independent PSII units, destroyed the oxygen-evolving complex, and limited electron transport beyond the primary quinone acceptor Q A” [Kan: 2017]. In California there are “approximately 4.5 million acres of irrigated cropland — primarily on the West Side of the San Joaquin Valley — are affected in California by saline soils or saline irrigation water” [Letey: 200]. Rising salinity levels are of great concern because many plants are sensitive to salinity and their production can be limited by non-conducive salinity levels [Shrivastava: 2014]. In order to study a microcosm of this phenomenon occurring in California, the PSII’s activity of spinach leaves in different salinity solutions was evaluated. It is hypothesized that a salinity solution will create a hypertonic environment in the chloroplast stroma which will cause water to move from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma. As a result, there will be little to no water for the water splitting enzyme to split therefore no electron in PSII for light to excite and not electron to reduce DCIP to DCIPH2. Therefore, an increase salinity will decrease photosynthesis which will decrease DCIP reduction which in turn will keep DCIP as a dark molecule and there will be a smaller change in absorbance. 

Materials and Methods:
Exercise 1: Enriching Chloroplasts: 
Prior to the experiment beginning a mortar, pestle, a medium sized beaker and three 50 mL centrifuged were packed into ice. While the mortar and pestle were cooling, the large central veins form four medium sized spinach leaves were removed. The remaining leaf pieces were then rinsed with tap water and the excess was blotted off. Once the mortar and pestle were cold they were wiped dry and then the spinach leaves were added with 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer pH 80). The spinach was then ground until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. An additional 10 mL of grinding buffer were added and the paste was ground further until it was a spinach slurry with no large chunks of leaves. This slurry was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. After this, 200uL of this filtered liquid were transferred into a microtube labeled “Sample A” and stored on ice. The remaining green liquid was transferred to a chilled 50mL centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant in this centrifuged tube was poured out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50mL centrifuge tube marked “B.” The pellet of debris was left at the bottom of tube “A.” Two hundred microliters of the liquid in tube “B” were removed and placed in a microtome labeled “Sample of B” and stored on ice. Tube “B” was then centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant from this tube was poured into a clean 50mL tube marked “C” without disturbing the pellet and tube “B” was returned to the ice. Another 20 mL of grinding buffer were then added to the pellet in tube “B”which was suspended by stirring gently. Two hundred microliters of this resuspended pellet were transferred into a  microtube labeled “Sample of B” and stored on ice. From tube “C” 200uL were removed and placed into a microtube labeled “Sample of C” and stored on ice. The “Sample of B” pellet were used for exercise two of this experiment. 

Exercise 2: Running DCIP Assay
Ten large test tubes were labeled 1-10 and placed in a tube rack. The spectrophotometer was turned on to 600 nm. Tube one was the blank and contained 2 mL of 100 mM phosphatase reaction buffer and 8 mL of deionized water. Tubes 2-4 were the deionized solution and contained 100uL of spinach chloroplasts from “Sample of B” tube, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, 2mL 100 mM phosphatase reaction buffer, and 6 mL of deionized water. Tubes 5-7 were the 3.5% salinity solutions. These tubes contained 100 uL of spinach chloroplasts from “Sample of B” tube, 2 mL 130mM DCIP, 2 mL 100 mM phosphatase reaction buffer, 5.7 mL of deionized water, and 0.3 mL of 2M NaCl solution. Tubes 8-10 were the 7.0% salinity solutions. These tubes contained 100 uL of spinach chloroplasts from “Sample of B” tube, 2 mL 130mM DCIP, 2 mL of 100 mM phosphatase reaction buffer, 5.4 mL of deionized water, and 0.6 mL of 2M NaCl solution. Each tube was mixed immediately after adding all the ingredients. These mixtures were then transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was immediately blanked at 600 nm using Tube 1. The absorbances of all samples were immediately read at 600 nm. After the readings all tubes were placed on a rack under a grow light. After 10 minutes the spectrophotometer was blanked again with sample 1. The absorbance of each sample was then read again at 600 nm and all samples were put back under the grow light. Step 5 was repeated two more times so readings were gathered at Time Zero, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. Results were recorded in an electronic lab notebook. Percent change was calculated between each reading and the initial Time Zero reading. An excel plot was used to graph change in average percent absorbance  versus time. The results were then compared using ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test. 


Results:
By the end of the experiment the 3.5% salinity solution had the greatest average percent change in absorption with an 82.6% change, the deionized water had the second greatest average percent change in absorption with an 82.3% change, and the 7.5% salinity solution had the lower average percent change in absorption with an 76.7% change. The averages for the 3.5% salinity solution and the 7.5% salinity solution were determined by calculating the percent change from Time Zero to Time 30 minutes for three trials, and then averaging these trials. The average percent change for the deionized water solution was similarly determined by calculating the percent change from TIme Zero to Time 30 minutes, but this done only averaging two of the three trials.  The second trial for the deionized water solution, test tube number 2, was eliminated as an outlier. Test Tube 2 had an average percent of 45.1% which was drastically lower than the 81.8% for Test Tube 1 and the 82.7% for Test Tube 3. However, the Q Outlier Test was applied to statistically confirm these results. The Qcalc for Test Tube 2 was 0.976 which was greater then the Qcrit of 0.970; therefore it was confirmed that Test Tube 2 was an outlier and its data was rejected. An aNOVA test was run to further compare these results. The p-value of the aNOVA test was 0.002301. A Tukey-Kramer test was also conducted and all comparisons were calculated to be insignificant except the comparisons of deionized Water at 10 minutes compared to 3.5% salinity at 30 minutes; deionized water at 10 minutes compared to 3.5% salinity at 20 minutes; deionized water at 20 minutes compared to 7.5% salinity at 10 minutes; 3.5% salinity at 20 minutes compared to 7.5% salinity at 10 minutes; and 3.5% salinity at 30 minutes compared to 7.5% salinity at 10 minutes. 

Discussion:
The trends of Figure 1 show the average percent change in absorption did not support the hypothesis that as salinity of a solution increases, photosynthesis decreases since the 3.5% salinity solution had a higher change in absorbance than the deionized water solution. Even though the aNOVA test gave a p-value of 0.002301, which is less than the critical p-value of 0.05, this only means that the change in absorbances at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes for all three trials were different from each other and not due to random chance. However, when this analysis was broken down using the Tukey-Kramer test to look at the individual groups that were being compared, not all of these groups were comparable. The only groups that showed statistical significance between their numbers were non-comparable groups such as comparing the change in absorbance of deionized water at 10 minutes versus the change in absorbance of the 3.5% salinity solution at 30 minutes. Only the groups that were not comparable showed statistical significance. As a result, it was these improper comparisons that caused the aNOVA test to report a significant p-value when in reality none of the results were statistically significant. From analyzing the Tukey-Kramer test it was concluded that this experiment did not support the hypothesis that as the salinity of a solution increases, photosynthesis decreases. These results were unexpected as prior research showed that salinity in maize decreased the activity of photosystem (II) [Kan: 2017]. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the initial salinity within the thylakoid space was not taken into consideration. This salinity could have been more concentrated than 3.5% leading to an influx of water. Different results more consistent with prior experiments might have been achieved had similar salt concentrations used in past experiments been used in this experiment. Instead of looking into these concentrations, the varying salinities used in these solutions was based off of the average ocean salinity, which might have not been the best standard to base this experiment. However, these unexpected results may be due to the fact that spinach has a wider tolerance range for salinity conditions than expected. In an experiment involving tomatoes, their photosynthesis benefited from vertically heterogeneous soil salinity [Chen: 2019]. In future experiments, the tested salinity concentrations will need to be better adapted to the baseline salinity concentrations within the spinach leaves, and a wider range of salinity  concentrations should be evaluated.
