Title: Presence of a female audience does not increase aggression in Betta Splenden males

Abstract:
Intraspecific agnostic behaviors are a common behavior type across the animal kingdom; it is observable in a variety of species, from reptiles like Komodo Dragons to fish like Betta splendins. These behaviors are usually used for similar reasons across all species, to protect resources like territory and to display dominance to win mates. In Betta splendins, agnostic behaviors occur between males, and can range from visual cues such as tail flashing, to grappling and fighting that can last for hours. Oftentimes, conflicts are resolved simply from visuals; one fish shows that it is prepared to fight and the other decides it isn’t worth it, or is intimidated into fleeing. These aggressive visual cues serve as an important distinction in betta fish that is not seen in some other species, such as elephant seals, and allows them to resolve some conflicts without actually injuring each other. In our experiment, we looked at how the presence of a female audience affects the aggression in male betta fish. We hypothesized that the appearance of a valuable resource would spur the fish into more aggression, but our hypothesis was not supported. We saw that not only were the fish visually less aggressive when females were present, but the results were not statistically significent at all.


Introduction:
Ethology, or the study of animal behavior, is a form of biology focused on attempting to understand not only what different animals do, but why they do it. They aim to understand the physiological and evolutionary purposes for the vast variety of behaviors displayed by animals and how these shape their lives and perception of the world. Meerkats, for example, have developed intricate warning calls and vocal communication as a result of intense predation [Townsend 2012], allowing the large groups to evade predators as well as hunt themselves. Vervet monkeys engage in similar alarm calling within groups [Seyfarth 1980], despite existing in a considerably different environment than meerkats. This suggests a similarity between the two species; the group alarm calling existing in both species advocates for the idea that there may have been similar environmental pressures on both of them. Being able to recognize these patterns across the expansive animal kingdom allows us to compare and contrast different species’ behaviors, as well as how and why they developed them. In the case of the fish Betta splendins, also known as the Siamese fighting fish, males exhibit extremely aggressive, or agnostic, behaviors in the presence of other males. These behaviors range from fin flicking, to the flaring of gill covers, all the way to physically attacking each other, sometimes engaging in “grappling” fights that last several hours [Johnson:2018]. Much like other aggressive species, betta’s are insistently territorial [Bronstein 1981], and engagement with other males is often a consequence of intrusion upon another Betta’s territory, and aggression is noticeably higher in the presence of a nest. The effect of an audience is also observable in Betta’s; males are generally more aggressive with an audience present [Matos 2002]. Oftentimes visual displays of aggression can prevent conflict before it happens, as one or both fish decide that fighting is not worth it. As such, this agnostic behavior carries both advantages and disadvantages; the main advantage is that engaging in it can ward off intrusive males, allowing protection of any present females and territory. A disadvantage is the possibility of irreversible damage or death, which is an unfortunate consequence of physical combat. We hypothesize that in our experiment, the presence of a female audience will increase the aggression of betta males because the females act as a valuable resource that the fish will want to protect. 



Materials and Method:
We used 3 different male fish, a red fish, blue fish, and a large red fish, and they were placed in separate tanks and unable to see each other in order to prevent habituation. A coin was flipped to determine whether the first trial for each would be conducted with or without a female in order to keep it random. Trials were done by removing the obscuring wall between two fish at a time, allowing them to see and react to each other for 5 minutes at a time. After 5 minutes was up, the wall was replaced and the fish were given 5 minutes of rest, also to prevent habituation. Each aggressive behavior was quantified; least aggressive behaviors (pelvic flickering, erect pectoral fins) were assigned 1, more aggressive behaviors (tail beating, spread opercula) were given 2, and most aggressive behaviors (tail flashing, red mane) were given 3. The amount of times each behavior was done in the span of 5 minutes was recorded for each trial. Each fish was tested with and without a female 2 times. We did a paired T test to test each fish’s aggression against itself. 



Results:
Our observations showed us that the fish displayed much less aggression with present females, and the red fish displayed no aggression at all. It spent most of its time facing the back wall, and would even retreat back there upon being removed from there. It paid no attention to other males or females at any point. The big red fish was similar, though he did display some aggression towards other males at times. The blue fish was the most active, as shown in both figure 1 and 2, but was more aggressive during the trials without a female. He paid more attention to the present female than to the other male when the female was in the tank. Our statistical tests reported no significent difference between the trials with and without females.


Discussion:
Based on our data it’s very obvious our hypothesis was not supported. Not only was there shown to be no significent difference between the groups, but the observable data showed that the fish actually became less aggressive when females were placed into the tanks. It appeared that instead of becoming more aggressive to protect “their” female, they paid less attention to the other male and focused more on pursuing the female. It is possible that since the fish were not allowed to cross the physical barrier of the glass, the other male was not perceived as a true intruder. Had they been able to cross and physically interact, it is possible that more aggression would have occured when the female was there. It is also possible that since both fish had a female in their tank, that there was no limited resource to fight over since they each had a female. If only one fish had a female but the other didn’t, the results may have been different on account of the now limited resource becoming more valuable. A major limitations were the ethical ones; it's inhumane to allow the fish to genuinely harm each other, and as such we kept the glass barrier between them. Had they been able to cross and been able to interact not only more with each other, but with each others’ females, it's possible that more aggression would have been displayed. The other fish crossing and physically attacking the red betta may also have forced him to leave the back wall and thus given us data on his aggression as well, but since this was not possible he never even really had another male in his line of sight. He may have not even known that there was another male at all, which would explain the null reaction from him. This is biologically important because it begs the further 	question: if presence of resources seen as valuable, such as females and shelter[Bronstein 1981] are generally causes of increased aggression, is it possible that these only promote more aggression when they are limited? It is shown that in many other species, such as rattlesnakes and mantis shrimp, that intraspecific combat for resources usually does not involve deadly weapons such as venom [Green 2015], suggesting that animals are aware of consequences as well as risk/reward. As such, not engaging in risky aggressive behaviors in the presence of resources that don’t necessarily need to be competed for due to existing in excess could potentially be something that betta fish understand. When resources aren’t being threatened, there is very little cause for fighting, and this could explain the lessening aggression when both males received a female. A future experiment attempting to understand whether or not betta can recognize important resources as limited or not could be vital in understanding betta aggression from an ethological standpoint.
