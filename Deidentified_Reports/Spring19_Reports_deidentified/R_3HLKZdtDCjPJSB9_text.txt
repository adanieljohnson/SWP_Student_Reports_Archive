Title: The Decrease in Root: Shoot Ratio in Pisum sativun due to an increase of phosphorus in vermiculite 

Abstract:
In ecological communities, resident plants interact with and adapt to their environment. Plants adapt in response to limited resources, such as too much shade. Species have evolved to allocate their resources in a particular pattern. This can be increasing root length to obtain more nutrients in the soil. Phosphorus (P), a common soil nutrient, is essential for plant growth. This experiment tested the effects of P on root:shoot ratio based on length in field peas, Pisum sativun. We hypothesized that if P was readily available in vermiculite, root length would be shorter and therefore have a smaller ratio compared to plants without. To test this, we compared shoot and root length of field pea plants grown over a course of two weeks, watered daily. The root:shoot ratio was smaller in the P plants and the results were statistically significent with a p_value of 0.04.  Our hypothesis was supported due to the ratio being lower because the P plants did not have to explore as far for nutrients. Phosphorus is a component of key molecules such as nucleic acids, phospholipids, and ATP, and, consequently, plants cannot grow without a reliable supply of this nutrient. It’s important to know just how a plant is affected without phosphorus when you want to produce more crop yielding plants. 

Introduction:
In ecological communities, resident plants are forced to interact and adapt to their environment. Many plant interactions revolve around obtaining resources like sunlight, nitrogen, and water [Bloom and Chapin : 1985]. However, there is a limit to the available resources in an environment. This affects what species are present in a community.  In response to limited resources, such as too much shade, or not enough water in the soil, species have evolved to allocate their resources in a particular pattern. These environmental pressures have made species use recourse allocation, in which species distribute and use its limited resources. They can modify this pattern to allow them to adapt to environmental factors. Plants constantly sense the changes in their environment; when mineral elements are scarce, they often allocate a greater proportion of their biomass to the root system [Hermans et al. : 2006]. An example of resource allocation can be seen in a study of differences between the wild type of apple plants and the domesticated apple. Because the domesticated apple had been altered to increase a harvestable yield, the plant had to trade-off investment in defense and became highly susceptible to pests [Whitehead and Poveda :2019]. In our experiment, the root:shoot ratio differences based on length of Pisum sativun (field pea) species growing in phosphorus rich and normal vermiculite will be measured. Phosphorus is a component of key molecules such as nucleic acids, phospholipids, and ATP, and, consequently, plants cannot grow without a reliable supply of this nutrient [Schachtman, Reid, and Ayling: 1998]. The effect of phosphorus is of interest because Phosphorus is essential for plant growth and fecundity. It is an integral component of genetic, metabolic, structural and regulatory molecules, in many of which it cannot be substituted by any other elements [White and Hammond: 2008]. Because Phosphorus is so essential to the plant processes, if phosphorus is not abundant in the soil, the plant will increase the root length in order to search for this nutrient. We hypothesize that the root:shoot ratio will be smaller in the phosphorus rich vermiculite plants because the plants won’t have to increase their root length in order search as far for nutrients due to it being in abundance in the soil. 

Materials and Method:
Six planters were obtained and filled with vermiculite and then soaked through in water. Phosphorus bone meal was sprinkled and mixed in to three of the planters. Twelve holes were punched into each of the six containers and pea seeds were placed in each. The containers were labeled as either controll or experimental, 3 containers for each, and then placed in the green house. The plants were watered every day for two weeks. Once the two-week period was up, plants were taken in for calculation. Starting with the phosphorus containers, the plants were dumped out and soaked in water. Three plants, including roots, were obtained from each container. These plants were placed on a labeled paper towel in order to keep the groups together. There were three plants from each phosphorus container for a total of 9 plants. The longest rooted plant was taken from each group, for a total of 3 plants, and the roots were cut off at the point that the green shoot turned white. The root and shoot length were measured using a centimeter ruler. Measurements were recorded and then the averages of each group were taken. This method was repeated for the controll group containers. Root to shoot ratio was calculated by dividing average root length by average shoot length. A two sample one-tailed t_test was run to find significance when compared to an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
The root: shoot ratios were smaller in the phosphorus plants than in the controll group plants (figure 1). The roots of the controll group plants were longer than the roots of the phosphorus plants. These two groups are statistically significent from one another with a p_value of 0.04 when compared to an alpha value of 0.05. 

Discussion:
Our data supported the hypothesis because root:shoot ratio was smaller in the phosphorus group. The root:shoot ratio was significent because at an alpha value of 0.05, the p_value was 0.04. We would expect these results because the roots would be shorter in the phosphorus group because those plants would not have to search as far and hard for nutrients because it is readily available. Phosphorus is different from other soil nutrients in that it is immobile. Phosphorus is only partly soluble in soil and therefore doesn’t move much. Proliferation of lateral roots does not necessarily achieve significently greater exploitation of mobile soil resources like nitrate, but it does for less mobile ones such as phosphate [Robinson: 1996]. This means that because phosphorus is immobile in soil, the roots must change their location in the soil in order to absorb this nutrient. This would allow us to believe that because the phosphorus is readily available in the phosphorus rich vermiculite, the roots would not have to explore as far for nutrients. The controll group ratio would be larger because it would have to go deeper to find nutrients in the vermiculite. This shows that the plants in the phosphorus rich soil are allocating their resources in a different area than their roots. There are enough nutrients in the shallow areas of the soil and therefore, the plants won’t waste their energy making longer roots to look for nutrients. The plants in the controll group allocated their resources to their roots to make them longer because they needed to search for nutrients in the soil. We could further test this hypothesis with other known nutrients essential to plant growth, such as nitrogen, to see if the trends in root length would be the same. Because phosphorus is a component of key molecules such as nucleic acids, phospholipids, and ATP, and, consequently, plants cannot grow without a reliable supply of this nutrient [Schachtman, Reid, and Ayling : 1998]. It is beneficial to know how plants are effected by an increase of phosphorus in soil when growing crops.

The ratio for controll (orange bar) was 0.8665 +/- 0.263696 and the ratio for phosphorus (blue bar) was 0.5121 +/- 0.08351. Plants were grown in a greenhouse for 2 weeks watered daily. Length was measured for the shoots from tip of the shoot to where shoot was cut. Root length was measured from the point of the cut to the end of the longest root.
