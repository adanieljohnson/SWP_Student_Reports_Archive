Title: Intraspecific Agonistic Behaviors between two male betta splendens in the presence of sustenance

Abstract:
The study of agonistic intraspecific behavior has been important in the study of ethology since its conception. It relates to how species interact and compete with each other for dominance and resources. Specifically, food is a resource that can cause increased aggression between two members of the same species. Betta splendens, or Siamese fighting fish, have long been used in studies due to their consistent and observable agonistic behaviors. This experiment was designed to test the effects of food on the observed behaviors of two male B. splendens. The data collected from this experiment revealed that there is a significant and noticeable difference in the agonistic behavior of the two fish after the food was introduced to them. This gives credence to the idea that an external factor can influence agonistic intraspecific behavior.

Introduction:
Siamese fighting fish, or Betta splendens, are a relatively common aquarium fish. They have long been known for their highly aggressive and easily distinguishable behavior [Bronstein: 1983]. Because their behavior is easy to observe and record, they are often in used in experiments regarding aggressive intraspecific agonistic behavior. In particular, the intraspecific agonistic behaviors displayed by B. splendens can be categorized into one of two types; broadside movements and facing movements [Johnson: 2016]. The broadside movements consist of, in order from least aggressive to most aggressive: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements consist of, in order from least aggressive to most aggressive: facing an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading the operculum, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes to create a red “mane”.The introduction of food into a tank containing two male B. splendens should increase the level of aggressiveness both fish display towards each other as they are now competing for a source of food.  B. splendens have been historically observed to interact more and display increased levels of aggression when in the presence of a desirable external resource [Johnson: 1973]. This experiment was designed to observe these intraspecific agonistic behaviors between two male B. splendens in the presence of food. 

Materials and Methods:
Prior to the experiment, all six B. splendens were not given any food for twenty four hours in advance of the experiment so that they would have a greater interest in the food they would be presented with. The two male B. splendens were placed in a tank that contained an opaque barrier which physically separated the two males and prevented them from seeing each other. The barrier was then removed and the fish were observed for a period of five minutes. Each of their distinguishable intraspecific agonistic behaviors that were observed were recorded with a number that represented that specific behavior. In this experiment, one represented the least aggressive observable behavior, pelvic fin flickering, and six represented the most aggressive observable behavior, creating the aforementioned red “mane”. These numbers were then added up to produce a score of aggression for each fish. After five minutes, the barrier was put back down and the fish were given five minutes to rest. Then, the previous procedure was repeated with the addition of a pinch of Tetra Pro being added to the water. The fish were observed for five minutes and their agonistic aggression score was recorded. After five minutes, the barrier was put back down and the fish were once again allowed to rest. This entire procedure was repeated twice more with four separate male B. splendens in order to run the experiment a total of three times. 


Results:
The mean and standard deviation of the score of the male B. splendens’ Intraspecific Agonistic behavior of the male B. splendens before the food was introduced was 8.6667 +/- 5.465 (Fig. 1). The mean and standard deviation of the score of the male B. splendens’ Intraspecific Agonistic behavior of the male B. splendens after the food was introduced was 22.5 +/- 7.12. (Fig. 1). The experiment used a paired t test to analyze the results. When the food was introduced into the tank, the fish were noticeably more active and aggressive than before the introduction of the food, which was supported by the data (Fig. 2). The mean of score of the B.splendens’ Intraspecific Agonistic behavior after the food was introduced was found to be significantly different than the score of the B. splendens’ Intraspecific Agonistic behavior before the food was added to the tank (T-value = 9.003, df = 5, P-value = 0.0003). 

Discussion:
The data collected supported the initial assumption made, that the introduction of something desirable to the two male B. splendens, in this case food, causes their behavior to become more hostile towards each other. This finding is also consistent with past studies done on the subject of B. splendens’ aggression, which examined intraspecific communication between B. splendens  [Bronstein: 1983]. When conducting this experiment a few concessions had to be made. First, by the time the experiment was conducted the six fish involved were noticeably more habituated to the tank and behaved less aggressively towards each other than the B. splendens observed a week prior to the experiment. Second, all observations regarding the different intraspecific agonistic behaviors was subject to human error. This refers to the fact that some of the demonstrated behaviors of the fish could have been misinterpreted due to the angle of the observer or the low visibility of the water in the tank, i.e. Tail beating could have been misinterpreted as tail flashing, which would have made the fish’s score higher than it was originally supposed to be. In conclusion, B. splendens have truly earned their nickname as the Siamese fighting fish, as the presence of an external element such as food served to heighten these levels of aggression displayed.
