Title: The Mechanism of Action of the Gastrocnemius Muscle with the Injection of Caffeine 

Abstract:
Our experiment focused on the skeletal tissue of a frog leg. The stimulation of the sciatic nerve and the subsequent contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle are used as a baseline for the injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemus. The frog legs were skinned and prepared to be used with the iWorx software. After a baseline was taken, the muscle was injected with caffeine to chemically induce tetany. We found that caffeine chemically induced tetany of the gastrocnemus muscle.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle exists in both vertebrates and invertebrates. For this lab, the primary focus will be on vertebrate skeletal tissue. Skeletal tissue consists of thousands of myofibers. These myofibers form muscle tissue to which motor neurons attach themselves. Motor neurons are a part of the nervous system, which is responsible for the transmission of signals which either contract or relax the muscle tissue. The muscle activity will be examined when the nerve has been stimulated. The sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle will be isolated from a frog leg to display basic properties of the neuromuscular system. After a baseline is established, using iWorx software, caffeine will be injected in the gastrocnemus muscle to induce chemical tetany. Caffeine has been known to produce a muscle twitch in low doses and has the potential to produce muscle contractions in high doses [Endo: 1975]. By injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with caffeine, which a stimulant, and recording the twitch using iWorx software we will be able to get a numeric value of the electrical activity of the sciatic nerve. An increase in voltage stimulus as well as caffeine, the caffeine should create a chemical induced tetany of the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog. 

Materials and Method:
Frog legs will be used for this experiment. The leg will be prepared, exposing  its gastrocnemus muscle will be exposed for easy observations. This will be done by separating the gastrocnemus from the tibia by cutting the achilles tendon. The end of the achilles will be strung to a strength measuring device. The sciatic nerve will also be exposed so that it may receive the voltage stimulus, by placing a probe across the nerve. Three trials will be run using three separate frog legs. Each frog will be their own controll and experimental group. Muscle contraction will be measured throughout the entire experiment: before, during, and after the introduction of caffeine. Each frog will be stimulated with a voltage of 1.0(V) with a probe on the sciatic nerve, and then the same frog will be given an injection of  0.1(Ml) of 200(mM) caffeine. The myogams of this continuous recording will be photographed to see if chemically induced tetany occurs or not. The gastrocnemus muscle is then applied pressure with fingers to physically test tetany. The voltage at the highest muscle contraction is then recorded and the averages of each controll and treatment trial for each leg will be calculated. Any other observations will also be recorded throughout the duration of the experiment to describe the strength and appearance of contractions. A paired t_test will be used to determine the significance of the data collected.


Results:
The first leg had a strong baseline. As soon as the caffeine was injected, the gastrocnemus muscle immediately swelled. After the trial was ran, we felt the muscle with our fingers. The frogâ€™s gastrocnemus was quite firm to the touch. The second frog leg went similar to the first one. However, as the caffeine was injected, the excess solution along with extra fluid was ejected from the injection sight. The similar observations to the first two legs were seen in the third one. Its contractions were much more intense than the first two. A paired t_test was used to analyse the collected data, its values (t_stat = 6.0276, d.f. = 2, P value = 0.0264) were then used to draw conclusions.

Discussion:
The hypothesis of an increase in voltage stimulus as well as caffeine, the caffeine should create a chemical induced tetany of the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog, was supported. Overall, the caffeine produced a chemically induced tetany in all three frog legs. Caffeine induced calcium release works similarly to normal muscle contraction [Endo: 1975] . In this case, the caffeine released the calcium more rapidly that normally, which in turn, results in faster and faster muscle contractions which ends with tetney of the gastrocnemus muscle. The figures show three controll contractions followed by the injection of the caffeine and the subsequent tetney. The tiny blips on the far right of the graph show the three voltage stimulations. The small size of blips show, graphically, that tetney has been reached. Further areas of study would be to inject the gastrocnemus with other stimulants such as dopamine or adrenaline to see if chemical tetney will be reached.
