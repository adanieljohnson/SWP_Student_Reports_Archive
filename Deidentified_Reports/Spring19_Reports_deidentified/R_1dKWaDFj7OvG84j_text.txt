Title: The Effect of Soil Salinity on phenotypic variation in radish plants

Abstract:
Available resources in an environment can have a large impact on how an organism translates its phenotype. Studying plant phenotypes depending on their ecological factors can help further understand the concept of resource allocation. For plants, roots and shoots are an integral aspect of their survival in any environment. However, they can use more energy one aspect over the other depending on their resources. This experiment studies the effects of salt salinity on phenotypic plasticity. It was hypothesized that there would be a difference in the root to shoot ratio between plant groups watered with salt water versus tap water. Using radish seeds, an experimental and controll group were created over a two-week span, the former being treated with salt water while the latter was treated with tap water. A two-sample t_test showed statistical significance between groups. The data suggests that the plants watered with salt water expended more energy in growing their roots to obtain fresh water deeper in the soil while controll group plants showed more similar lengths between their roots and shoots. These findings bring up the possibility of future research involving the effect of road salt runoff on the surrounding environments.

Introduction:
Resource allocation plays an important role in revealing a species’ limited resources. The process itself is a pattern in which a species distributes and uses the resources available in its environment. Depending on the biotic and abiotic factors in an ecological system, organisms will expend more energy to increase their ability to obtain resources that not are as easily accessible over others. The leaves, stems, and roots are some of the parts of a plant that can be affected, depending on ecological factors like soil nutrient concentration, sunlight availability, temperature, and rainfall. Phenotypic variation within a species gives evidence into what kinds of factors affect the life in that environment. Particularly, salinity of soil is found to affect plant growth in general. Research on the effects of salinity stress on plant growth concluded: “saline soil induces physiological and metabolic disturbances in plants affecting development, growth, yield, and quality of plants” [Jouyban: 2012]. This experiment observes the effect of soil salinity on radish plants and how they use their available resources to adapt to salt water treatment. Differing lengths between roots and shoots of these plants will help to understand phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of these plants to adapt its phenotype to its environment. We hypothesized that there will be a difference between root to shoot ratio of radish plants watered with salt water versus tap water.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we planted four small beds of radish plants in trays with vermiculite. Two of these plant groups received salt water treatment (experimental groups) every other day over the course of two weeks while the other group received the same treatment with tap water (controll groups). After two weeks, each bed of plants was pulled out of the tray and the roots were separated from the vermiculite in a tub of water. 10 individual experimental radish plants were separated from either of the two experimental plant beds. For each plant, the root and shoot to the tip of the tallest leaf was measured and recorded. This process was repeated for 10 individual controll plants. The root: shoot ratio was calculated using the measurements recorded for each plant. We used a two-tailed two sample t_test to test the data. 

Results:
The data in Figure 1 shows that on average, the salt water treatment plants had longer roots compared to their shoots. The mean root to shoot ratio for the experimental group was 2.94 while the plants treated with water showed an average ratio of 1.47. The two-sample t_test revealed statistical significance between the groups (t_stat = 5.507, d.f. = 18, P = 3.14E-5)



Discussion:
The data shows that the plants treated with salt water had, on average, a higher root to shoot ratio, revealing an important impact of salt in soil on plant growth (Figure 1). The data is statistically significent, supporting the hypothesis that there is a difference between root and shoot growth resulting from salinity treatments. When salt water was put into the soil, the plants expended more energy growing the roots rather than their shoots in attempt to obtain fresh water deeper in the soil. This conclusion supports the idea that in saltier ecological conditions, plants need to dig deeper into the ground to obtain fresh water. These plants would most likely use more of their energy trying to get fresh water than growing their shoots because sun availability was not as limited as water. Consequently, a study on soil salinity revealed that: “In general, salt stress decreases the photosynthesis and respiration rate of plants” [Jouyban: 2012]. Expending more energy on root growth can limit the shoot growth, inhibiting maximal leaf growth, thus decreasing the potential for efficient photosynthesis. In the controll group, the average ratio of roots to shoots was significently lower (Fig. 1) because the plants had continuous access to fresh water, so it was not necessary for the plants to expend energy on growing their roots deeper into the soil and allowed them to grow their shoots more efficiently. The findings of our experiment bring up larger questions of application within society, specifically looking at the salt runoff resulting from our industrial use of the substance on our sidewalks and streets. Further research could examine the effects of salt runoff on larger populations within ecosystems.
