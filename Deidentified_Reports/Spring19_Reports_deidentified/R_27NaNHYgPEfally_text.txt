Title:  Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta Caterpillar Growth

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta or tobacco hornworm has four distinctive life stages. As the caterpillar transitions from its larvae to adult stage, it undergoes molting which is the periodic synthesis and replacement of cuticle which allows for insect growth. JH is present in the larval molting stage of the caterpillar. Excess JH hormone exposure can lengthen the larva phase, and therefore prevent the caterpillars from molting. We hypothesized that if we expose Manduca Sexta caterpillars to excess JH hormone, it will inhibit their overall weight gain. To understand these weight gain patterns, we placed four caterpillars in an experimental group, which was fed a diet of normal food with JH hormone additives and four caterpillars in a control group, which was fed a normal diet with distilled water. After two weeks of weighing the caterpillars daily, we found no significant difference in the average weights between the groups. The difference in these two groups could be attributed to chance, and therefore we conclude that the hypothesis cannot be supported. JH is an essential hormone in the Manduca Sexta that is present in many developmental stages of their life cycle, so it is key to understand the role that this hormone plays in their lifecycle by studying the effects of the hormone.

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is a tobacco hornworm that has four distinctive life stages. As the caterpillar transitions from its larvae to adult stage, it undergoes molting which is the periodic synthesis and replacement of cuticle which allows for insect growth [Jindra: 2013]. JH is present in the larval molting stage, and reappears in the adult stage to assist in regulating female reproduction [Jindra: 2013]. Prolonged exposure to Juvenile Hormone (JH) hormone can lengthen the larva phase, and therefore prevent the caterpillars from molting [Riddiford: 2012]. It is important to study hormones and their effects on species in order for us to understand what the effects of hormones are in the development and function of the species. JH is a hormone specific to the development and molting of the Manduca Sexta, and therefore manipulating the level of the hormone in their body can show how the normal hormone effects the species. Due to their obvious, quick stage transformations, ease of study and dieting habits, the Manduca Sexta is a model organism to study modifications of JH hormones in insects. In this experiment, we studied the difference between caterpillars that had JH hormone additives in their food and caterpillars that ate a regular diet with distilled water. By examining the two groups weight gain over a two-week period, we were able to observe and measure whether adding JH hormone would have a significant effect on the caterpillar’s weight gain. Due to previous research studies and our knowledge on JH hormone, we hypothesized that if we expose Manduca Sexta caterpillars to excess JH hormone, it will inhibit their overall weight gain.


Materials and Methods:
To conduct this experiment, we gathered eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars in the early larva stage. The caterpillars were split into two groups four: the experimental and control groups. Each caterpillar was placed in a sealed plastic container, with air holes punched out on each side. The caterpillars were labeled in their respective homes so that data collection would not be confused. They were all placed in a refrigerator in the same area for the two-week duration. Each caterpillar was given 10g of food and their food supplies were replenished at the same time. The control group had eight drops of distilled water mixed in with the food, and the experimental group had eight drops of JH hormone added to their food. Otherwise, no differences occurred between the two groups. Each day the caterpillars were weighed on a compact scale, weights were recorded and observations were noted about their behavior, size and weight gain patterns. This was repeated for exactly 14 days. At the conclusion of the trail, statistical analysis was used in a one-tailed two sample t-test to compare the average weight of the eight caterpillars. This analysis determined whether the results were significant or not.


Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the average weight of the control group was 6.25g and the average weight of the experimental group was 4.85g at the conclusion of the two-week trail. The statistical analysis showed a p-value of 0.21, which is not a significant result. Upon observation, at the end of the trail three of the four control caterpillars were completely brown, indicating the beginning of pupation. Only two of the experimental group caterpillars had brown tips, indicating the start of molting. 


Discussion:
Although there appears to be a noticeable difference in the average weight between the two groups, the p-value indicates insignificant results. The difference in these two groups could be attributed to chance, and therefore we conclude that the hypothesis cannot be supported. Biologically, this indicates that adding additional JH into the body of the Manduca Sexta will not change their growth pattern or influence weight and molting. The background literature that we found influenced our hypothesis, but the results found cannot support the statement and the data cannot prove that JH effects weight gain in the caterpillars. The only apparent outlier in the trends was caterpillar one in the experimental group. It had a very delayed growth pattern and did not gain significant weight until day 11. This made the average weight noticeably smaller than any other caterpillar, and made the overall experimental group average much smaller. A next step in this study would be to conduct the experiment with a larger group of caterpillars. Since there was only one experimental group with a set amount of JH hormone additives, exploring different levels of hormone additives could be an indication of what amounts of JH hormone have a significant effect on weight gain. Looking at previous studies, it is clear that there JH hormone effects the development of insects generally. At a molecular level, steric and electrostatic fields indicate inhibitory growth activity within molecules of the Manduca Sexta [Garriga: 2011]. Additionally, data from a study by [Jindra: 2013] shows how introducing JH hormone at the N5 stage of larvae introduces a “new stage” N6 instead of transitioning the Pyrrhocoris apterus to an adult stage. Since this insect develops similarly to the Manduca Sexta it would be predicted that their behavior with JH hormone levels would be similar. It is known that JH hormones two main roles in insect hormones are the transition to the molting phase and assistance in regulating female reproduction. Additional studies indicate that this is true and that weight gain is related to JH hormone levels. However, since the data we found cannot be supported by these claims it is clear that further studies should be attempted. JH is an essential hormone in the Manduca Sexta that is present in many key developmental stages of their life cycle. Because of this it is key to understand the function and role that this hormone plays in their lifecycle by studying the effects of the hormone.
