Title: Effects of increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the photosynthetic activity of Brassica oleracea var. viridis chloroplasts

Abstract:
CO2 is an essential reactant in the process of photosynthesis. As the CO2 levels in the atmosphere rise at an alarming rate, it is essential that the effects of elevated CO2 concentration on plants is examined. In this experiment, we look at the rate of photosynthetic processes in the chloroplasts of Brassica oleracea var. viridis in response to the addition of carbonated water. We hypothesized that the additional CO2 from carbonated water would increase activity of Photosystem II in the chloroplasts due to the presence of more reactant. Absorbance values were recorded throughout a 30-minute DCIP decolorization assay among four groups, in which the control group did not receive carbonated water, while the three experimental groups received varying amounts of the treatment. After applying statistical analysis, our data did not demonstrate a significant difference between the percent change in absorbance between the groups, despite visual trends observed in the raw data and the graphs.

Introduction:
The topic of interest of this experiment is the effects of elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in plant photosynthesis. The kale plant, or Brassica oleracea var. viridis, is the model organism in this experiment because it is a leaf vegetable with high phylloquinone content. Phylloquinone, or vitamin K, is an electron carrier during photosynthesis in the chloroplast of plants [Kessler: 2014]. Plants require photosynthesis to produce glucose molecules from CO2 and water (H2O). Environmental conditions, such as the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, influence the production of glucose in the process of photosynthesis [Erwin: 2017]. The atmospheric CO2 concentration is currently the highest it has been over the past 26 million years and is expected to double within this century [Long: 2004]. With the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it is important to investigate the effects of excess carbon dioxide on photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis is a 3-stage process that occurs within the chloroplast of plant cells. The first two stages of photosynthesis, Photosystem II and Photosystem I, are collectively known as light-dependent reactions. The light-dependent reactions use energy from light to create a proton gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP for the third stage of photosynthesis, the light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, ATP generated from the light-dependent reactions, are used in carbon fixation reactions joining CO2 to 5-carbon ribulose to synthesize glucose. Therefore, higher levels of CO2 are expected to stimulate photosynthetic activity. We hypothesized that if carbonated water is applied to the chloroplasts of the Brassica oleracea var. viridis, the rate of photosynthesis will increase.

Materials and Methods:
2 leaves of Brassica oleracea var. viridis were used to test our hypothesis. The experiment requires the enrichment of chloroplast through differential centrifugation (Fig. 1), and chloroplast activity is measured through the use of the Hill reaction. After removal of veins and rinsing of the leaf pieces, 20 mL cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added. The leaf pieces and buffer were subsequently ground to a thick paste through the use of a mortar and pestle and strained through a cheesecloth to leave the contents of conical tube “A”. The final B-pellet aliquot underwent centrifugation twice and resuspension through gentle stirring in order to attain the optimal balance of chloroplasts and the smallest amount of debris for use in the experiment (Fig. 1). The enriched chloroplasts were stored on ice. To quantify Photosystem II activity in the chloroplast, 130 mM 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) was used the alternative electron acceptor for the Hill reaction. For the DCIP decolorization assay, one blank and three replicates for the control group and each of the three experimental groups were prepared for a total of thirteen samples (Table 1). All thirteen samples contained 2 mL reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). The control group and the three experimental groups received 2 mL DCIP. The blank and the three experimental groups received 100 µL enriched chloroplasts. The experimental groups received either 5 µL, 6 µL, or 7 µL of carbonated water (Table 1). The absorbances for the mixtures were immediately measured using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm to represent time zero data points. All samples were placed under a grow light for 10 minutes before absorbance values were taken at the 10-minute, 20-minute, and 30-minute time points. Percent change between the absorbances at each time point and time zero was calculated. An ANOVA test and Tukey-Kramer test were used to determine differences in percent change between the control group and the experimental groups.

Results:
We used the one-way ANOVA test to statistically analyze our data. There was no significant difference (P = 0.413) in the average percent change of absorbance between the four groups (Fig. 2). When observing the raw data for absorbance values, we noticed a trend of decreasing absorbance throughout the 30-minute period for the experimental groups treated with carbonated water, while the absorbance values for the control group remained stable during the 30-minute period. The final average percent change after 30 minutes for the control group was observed to be less than the experimental groups (Fig. 3).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis stated that the presence of excess carbon dioxide would increase photosynthetic activity. In our results, the absorbance values between each experimental group demonstrated a decrease after every 10-minute interval, demonstrating higher photosynthetic activity among the groups that received excess carbon dioxide. However, based on the statistical tests applied to our data, we did not calculate a significant difference between the percent change in absorbance of the control and experimental groups. Our raw data and the trends in our graphs demonstrate a practical significance that is worth further investigation. As leafy green vegetable options become more popular due to the reported nutritional benefits, it is necessary to understand role of increased CO2 in the growth of such plants due to potential benefits in maximizing photosynthesis processes [Erwin: 2017]. However, it has also been demonstrated that elevated CO2 concentrations can cause nutrient decline in crops due to nutrient allocation during photosynthesis [McGrath: 2013]. Such nutrients include key minerals that are at the base of human nutrition, indicating the urgency of the current high levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration [Loladze: 2014].  If we were to repeat the experiment, we propose increasing the number of biological replicants and increasing the length of time in conducting the DCIP decolorization assays to allow reactions to run towards completion. We also propose measuring Photosystem I activity and Calvin Cycle activity in response to the addition of CO2. These adjustments may yield statistical results that reflect the trends that are currently visible and offer insight into the role of CO2 on specific photosynthetic processes.
