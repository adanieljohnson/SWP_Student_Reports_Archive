Title: Tetany frequency in frog gastrocnemii treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor

Abstract:
Acetylcholine communicates nerve impulses to muscles at neuromuscular junctions, and acetylcholinesterase removes the neurotransmitter once the impulse has been communicated. We hypothesized that inhibiting acetylcholinesterase in frog gastrocnemii would decrease the frequency necessary to induce the muscle to tetany. We stimulated untreated frog gastrocnemii at increasing frequencies until they displayed a myogram indicating tetany, then stimulated legs injected with one millimeter of 2% Sevin solution, an acetylcholinesterase, until the myogram likewise displayed tetany. Our data showed that the frequency of the stimulus which induced tetany was the same regardless of the presence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.

Introduction:
 Motor neurons enervate multinucleated skeletal muscle cells called myofibers at neuromuscular junctions. [Johnson: 2016] When an action potential depolarizes an axon terminal in a pre-synaptic neuron, the neuron releases acetylcholine, ACh, into the neuromuscular junction, where ACh binds to nicotinic receptors, ligand gated sodium channels, on the myofiber’s membrane. [Johnson: 2016] The resulting depolarization of the myofiber stimulates the muscle’s contraction. [Johnson: 2016] Acetylcholinesterase or AChE hydrolases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, allowing the muscle fiber to revert back to its resting state while preventing the overstimulation of nicotinic receptors. [Duysen: 2002] Sevin solution is an AChE inhibitor. [Johnson: 2016] The AChE inhibitor paraoxon produces prolonged muscle fasciculations or twitches, leading to muscle fiber necrosis, when it is injected into the diaphragm of rats, and mice without the gene encoding AChE not only developed slowly and died young, but also demonstrated absent grip strength. [Wecker: 1978][Duysen: 2002] We thought that the overstimulation of the muscles lacking AChE would cause such deleterious effects; in other words, muscles lacking AChE would be stimulated more easily, because ACh would never be removed from the neuromuscular junction. Rather than testing rodents, we tested the effect of 2% Sevin solution, an AChE, injected into the exposed gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg. We hypothesize that a frog leg injected with 2% Sevin solution will experience tetany at a lower frequency than that same frog leg not injected with the solution.

Materials and Method:
We dissected three frog legs by skinning them, separating their quadricep muscles and freeing the sciatic nerve from surrounding tissue. We cut the Achilles tendons close to the heel and suspended the legs by the tendon from a force transducer so that the leg and the upright gastrocnemus muscle formed a right angle. We stimulated the sciatic nerve at an amplitude of 0.7 V, at a pulse width of 5 ms and at a frequency of 2, 4, 5, 10, and 25 Hz for 3 to 4 seconds each time, recording the response of the muscle by describing the myogram, especially when the myogram depicted the plateau characteristic of full tetany. We then injected the gastrocnemii with 1 milliliter of 2% Sevin solution. Then we stimulated the nerve in the same way as before, at an amplitude of 0.7 V, at a pulse width of 5 ms and at a frequency of 2, 4, 5, 10, and 25 Hz for 3 to 4 seconds each time, recording the response of the muscle by describing the myogram. We evaluated the frequencies at which the muscles experienced tetany with a paired t test.

Results:
Except for the controll of the first frog leg, both controll and treated frog legs displayed tetany in their myograms when stimulated at an amplitude of 0.7V, a pulse width of 5 Ml and a frequency of 25 (Figure 1). The result of the paired t_test indicates that there is not a significent difference in the stimulus frequency for tetany between treated and untreated frog legs (t_stat = 1.00, d.f. = 2, P = 0.42265). The second leg quivered visibly without stimulation.

Discussion:
Because the frequency at which the treated legs reached tetany was not significently different from the frequency at which the untreated legs reached frequency, the alternate hypothesis is rejected. Injecting a frog leg with 2% Sevin solution does not alter the frequency at which tetany will occur. The myograms for the second and third treated frog leg differed from the myograms of the untreated legs in that the maximum muscle tension at tetany or at any lower frequency was lower. The first treated leg was the first time I had used a syringe, and some of the 2% Sevin solution ran out of the leg, a possible reason why the myogram of the first leg differed from the second two. Of the several abnormalities present in mice whose gene for AChE has been knocked out, one of these abnormalities was absent grip strength. [Duysen: 2002] In future experiments, the dependent variable we study ought not to be the frequency at which tetany occurs, but the amount of force generated at tetany in a treated leg as opposed to an untreated leg, in alignment with Duysen’s observations in knockout mice, and our own observation that the force produced at full tetany was much less for the treated legs than the untreated legs. Furthermore, the duration and intensity of AChE inhibition influences the degree of muscle fiber necrosis, [Wecker: 1978] so an injection of a more concentrated AChE  such as Sevin solution would have a larger degree of difference, if any difference were to be detected. On the other hand, because the experiment was run twice on each leg, once untreated as the controll and once treated, by the time we collected data for the treatment group, some percentage of ATP present in the leg had already been used. The treated legs could have responded less vigorously simply because they had less ATP by the time we tested them.
