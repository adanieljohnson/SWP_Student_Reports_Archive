Title: The Effect of Nitrate on the Root to Shoot Weight  Ratio of Pisum Sativum

Abstract:
Due to limit resources of their environments, Pisum sativum, like many plants, are forced to undergo evolutionary cost-effective trade-offs and allocate their resources. For Pisum sativum, one of these limited resources is nitrogen. In Pisum sativum, nitrogen is primarily absorbed via the roots in the form of nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+). To investigate how nitrogen-rich soil affects Pisum sativum’s ability resource allocates and grow,  2.5  grams of nitrate was placed into soil with seeds of Pisum sativum and allowed to grow for two weeks; after the two weeks, the root to shoot weight ratio of the plants in nitrate soil were compared to their respective control groups. To measure the root and shoots of the plants, we separated the plants at the where the shell of the seed was. It was predicted that field peas, Pisum sativum, will have a lower root to shoot ratio when placed in  nitrogen rich soil compared to other field peas that were in normal untreated soil.Ultimately, no significant difference was discovered between the root to shoot weight ratio of Pisum sativum, therefore, our data was not successfully able to prove that nitrogen lowers the root to shoot weight ratio

Introduction:
Field Peas, Pisum sativum, are a common domesticated annual legume plant that is grown all over the world. They are primarily grown as a food source due to their high fiber, protein, vitamin and mineral content [Pavek: 2012]. Like many plants in the legume family, Pisum sativum, have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria allowing them to take up nitrogen gas (N2) from the atmosphere and convert it into nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) which end up in the soil[Masson-Boivin : 2009]; The process of N2 converting into NO3- or NH4+ is called nitrogen fixation [Mengel:2001]. The nitrate and ammonium act as a fertilizing agent by adding nitrogen-based nutrients into the ground [Masson-Boivin : 2009].

Nitrogen is a common component and nutrient in many fertilizers due to nitrogens’ ability to promote plant growth. In taking nitrogen is vital due to nitrogen’s role in amino acids, nucleotides (DNA and RNA), proteins, chlorophyll, and the photosynthetic pathway.  Due to vital role nitrogen plays in essential macromolecules and physiological processes, plants need sources of nitrogen to grow and function. [Baethgena:1995].

In ecological communities, there are a limited amount of resources that are present and available such as nitrogen.  Limited resources lead to organisms to make cost-effective trade-offs.  Species, such as Pisum sativum,  must resource allocate in order to effectively distribute their limited resources. For plants, resource allocation patterns change depending on the variable in the immediate external environment such as soil content and exposure to sunlight. [Johnson:2016].

A method of measuring resource allocation for plant growth is to measure the root to shoot ratio(S:R). The root to shoot ratio value is calculated by taking the biomass of the shoot of the plants and divide that number by the biomass of the roots. Two distinct places where a plant can resource allocate are the roots and shoots.  Shoots are composed of the plant’s stems and leaves which both play a vital role for photosynthesis, a way to convert sunlight energy into sugar glucose. A high rate of resource allocation to the shoot suggests that light is plentiful; light is resource most worth competing for. Roots, on the other hand, are located in the soil helping plants stay in one place and absorb water, minerals and ions/molecules for nutrients. A high rate of resource allocation to the roots suggests that water-scarce resource, therefore, making it resource worth competing for [Johnson:2016]. 

	Understanding how plants resource allocate based off their environment could lead to more effective methods of growing plants. In our experiment, we hope to answer the following question: Does increasing the concentration of nitrogen by adding nitrate to soil affect the root to shoot ratio of field peas? It was predicted that field peas, Pisum sativum, will have a lower root to shoot ratio when placed in nitrogen-rich soil compared to other field peas that were in normal untreated soil.


Materials and Methods:
Preparing Plants:
First, we obtained four containers that had openings that allowed for water drainage. Next, we label two of the containers control and two of the containers experimental.  Then, we filled all four of the containers two-thirds of the way will soil. Next, measured out 2.5 grams of nitrate pellets for each of the experimental group (five grams total). Then, we placed and mixed in 2.5 grams of the nitrate pellets in each of the experimental groups. Next, we added a handful of field pea seeds into each of the four containers.  Next, we filled the last third of all four of the containers with soil; the containers are full at this point. Lastly, we watered each of the containers till the soil of each container was saturated.


Incubation of the Plants:
Immediately after preparing the plants, we placed all the containers in a greenhouse incubator. For the next two weeks, we watered the plants everyday. We watered each container until the soil of each container was saturated. 


Measuring the Roots and Shoots:
First, we removed the containers from the greenhouse incubator. Next, we carefully removed the control plants from their containers. We put the soil and roots of those plants in water to break up the vermiculite and soil. Next, we carefully separated three whole plants from the clump for each of the control containers (six whole plants). Next, we separated the shoot from the roots from each of the plants; we separated the plants at the where the shell of the seed was. Next, we weighed and recorded each plant's roots and shoots and calculated their weight root to shoot ratio via Excel.

Lastly, after all the root to shoot weight ratios were collected for the control and experimental group, we compared the data of the two group by running a two sample, one-tailed T-test.


Results:
In order to understand how nitrate-rich soil affects the root to shoot weight ratio of Pisum sativum, 2.5g of nitrate was placed into the experimental group’s soil. The control group in this experiment were not treated with nitrate. As shown in Figure 1, the average root to shoot weight ratio of the control group was 0.5855土0.1575 (n=6). The average root to shoot weight ratio of the nitrate group was 0.495土0.073 (n=6). Compared to the nitrate group, the control group’s root to shoot weight ratio was 15.46% larger (t-stat=1.182, df=10, p=0.132).Based off of figure 1, nitrate did not have a significant impact on the root to shoot weight ratio of Pisum sativum. All statistical analysis was done through a two sample, one-tailed T-test. 


Discussion:
It was predicted that Pisum sativum plants in soil with a higher concentration of nitrate would have a lower root to shoot weight ratio than Pisum sativum plants in untreated soil. Despite not being statistically significant, the nitrate’s group average root to shoot weight ratio was 15.46% smaller than the control group. 


In research published in Annals of Botany, scientist researched how the root to shoot weight ratio was affected by different nutrients and found that different plants react to nitrogen in different ways. In high nitrogen-rich environments, birch trees showed a rapid decrease in their root to shoot ratio while tomato plants saw minimal changes  [Ågren:2003]. Unlike birch trees, tomato plants had a higher capacity to store nitrogen, therefore, they had no immediate physiological use for the nitrogen. In our experiment, the Pisum sativum plant was able to allocate some of their resources to their shoots like the birch tree but not as efficiently. 


A separate study conducted on the effects of nitrogen on the root to shoot weight ratio was published in the Plant, Cell and Environment Journal; they found that soil containing NH4+ or NO3- resulted in a decrease in the root to shoot weight ratio of  Pisum sativum, Phaseolus vulgaris and Triticum aestivum [Andrews:1999]. Similar to the birch tree results found in research published in the Annals of Botany, nitrogen-enriched soil was shown to boost shoot growth thus resulting in a lower root to shoot weight ratio. 


In both studies, nitrogen in either the NH4+ or NO3- form is capable of lowering the root to shoot weight ratio of Pisum sativum. The smaller value for the root to shoot weight ratio is due to Pisum sativum allocating less resources to their roots when nutrience (nitrogen) is plentiful in the soil. The increase in nutrient availability allows for the plant, in this case, Pisum sativum,  to expend less energy allocating root growth and allowing it to use the saved energy in other endeavors such as shoot production and development [Ågren:2003].


In conclusion, there was no significant difference between the weight of the root to shoot ratio of Pisum sativum, therefore, our data was not successfully able to prove that nitrogen lowers the root to shoot weight ratio. To improve the experiment, I believe that having more time would have allowed for more distinct changes to occur. In addition to that having plants with different concentrations of nitrogen would allow for better analysis of nitrogen’s effect on Pisum sativum. For potential and future experimentation, investigating Pisum sativum’s ability to fixate nitrogen into the ground and how that may affect its ability to absorb and resource allocated nitrogen could be a logical next step. The ability of nitrogen fixation could make Pisum sativum shares similar qualities with the tomato plant and is able to store nitrogen thus allowing it to have no immediate physiological use for the nitrogen and therefore not resulting in higher or more distinct ratio. Better understanding, how nitrogen is processed and how Pisum sativum allocates its resources could lead to innovations in agriculture efficiency and production.
