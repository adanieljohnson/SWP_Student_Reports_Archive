Title: Effects of Caffeine on Muscle Contractions in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Rina Pipens

Abstract:
In today’s world, millions of people drink coffee daily. Although caffeine is understood to increase the muscles AMP of contraction and allow for increased energy levels, it is not truly understood how that compares to the AMP of muscles without caffeine. In this experiment, we experimented with the effects of caffeine when injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rina Pipens. My group predicted that the response AMP of the gastrocnemius muscle, after the injection of caffeine, would be higher than the recorded response of the control gastrocnemius muscle. Although our data did not illustrate any statistical significance in the difference between the groups, our data seemed to imply that there is a slightly higher AMP recorded in caffeinated muscles. The information gathered throughout the course of the lab demonstrates how caffeine, such as coffee, does slightly increase the AMP of muscle contractions.  

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are made up of thousands of myofibers that are bound together by pieces of connective tissue. The muscles are then connected to the brain and the spinal cord by the motor neurons that connect to the myofibers at the neuromuscular junctions. When the nerve impulses are sent from the brain, they jump across the neuromuscular junction and prompt the release acetylcholine. The acetylcholine opens the sodium channels in the muscle fibers and generates the action potential. This action potential instigates the release of calcium ions which prompts the contraction of the muscle, shortening it[Johnson, 2016].  
In this lab, we focused on how injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rina Pipens affects the recorded amp of the muscle when stimulated. In an experiment performed by Isaacson and Sandow, the effects of caffeine on the sartorius muscle of the frog was tested. Their experiment indicates that the injection of the caffeine increases the recorded amp of gastrocnemius muscle significantly when stimulated. Caffeine is a stimulant that increases the release of calcium ions in cells. Thus, when caffeine is injected into muscles, contraction occurs [Isaacson, 1967]. Thus, if the gastrocnemius muscles of three frog legs are injected with caffeine, the amp of contraction should increase. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, the group obtained 3 severed legs of the Rina Pipens, a species of frog. All three legs were placed onto a dissection pan, and using forceps, we peeled away the skin on the legs, revealing the gastrocnemius muscles. The skinned legs were placed back onto the pan and kept moist with the Frog Ringer’s solution. Next, using the dissecting probe, the group separated the inner thigh muscle to reveal the white sciatic nerve and blood vessels in the leg. Using the forceps, we freed the nerve from the muscle tissue. Afterwards, the first leg was tested at the stimulus amp of 0-2.0. We determined the best stimulus amp to be 0.2 amp. Next, we attached the BNC banana adaptor to the exposed gastrocnemius muscle. We recorded the response amp of the leg when stimulated at an amp of 0.2 three times. Then, the leg was injected with caffeine, and the muscle was stimulated at 0.2 amp three more times. The response amp of the leg was recorded, and the same procedure was followed for the remaining legs. Finally, using the data, a T-Test was performed, and standard error and deviation were calculated. 

Results:
The mean AMP response for the gastrocnemius muscles before the injection of caffeine was determined to be 0.6971, while the mean AMP response for the muscles after the injection of caffeine was 0.9381 (Fig. 1). We used a two-sample T-Test to analyze the results. The mean change in mass of the control group, or the gastrocnemius muscles before caffeination, was statistically insignificant compared to the gastrocnemius muscles injected with caffeine (t-value = 1.505809, df = 4, P = 0.103289). When observing the effects of the injection of caffeine on the gastrocnemius muscles, we noticed that immediately after injection the muscles contracted. As the legs were contracted, the first and last AMP response were smaller than the second response. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemius muscles of the frogs would result in higher AMP responses when stimulated, was supported. Although the p-value (P = 0.103289) showed that the averages of the experimental and control group were not statistically significant, the results suggest otherwise. The statistical insignificance may have been due to the physiological effects of the continuous stimulation of the muscles. As they continued to be stimulated, the release of calcium ions fluctuated, with the most being released during the middle stimulation. Thus, the recorded AMPs were higher for all three stimulations of the experimental but were close in value to the other runs of the control. The results gathered by the group mirrored the results gathered by the experiment performed by Weber and Herz. When they injected the muscles with caffeine, they experienced a similar data curve that demonstrated a significance in each individual stimulus but no statistical significance in the average responses [Weber, 1968]. If further research were to be done on the effects of caffeine on the contraction of muscles, it would be interesting to examine the response curves of the muscles overtime. Rather than performing only three stimulations, we would perform more and compare the response stimulation at each point. Thus, we could truly see if the effects were significant or not. Understanding how caffeine effects the muscles of animals allows for scientists and everyday coffee drinkers to understand the consequences and impact of what they ingest into their body.
