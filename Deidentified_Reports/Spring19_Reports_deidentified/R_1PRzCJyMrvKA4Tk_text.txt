Title: Effect of lidocaine on function of Rana pipiens leg muscles

Abstract:
Understanding basic neuromuscular function of animals and the mechanisms which affect it is instrumental in the development of effective pharmaceuticals and other biochemical agents. In this experiment, our lab group sought to determine the impact of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on the function of leg muscles in Rana pipiens. We accomplished this by measuring the voltage generated when a 1.0 amp current was applied to the sciatic nerve of each leg before and after treatment with a lidocaine solution. In our final results, the voltage of the control legs was nearly double the voltage of the lidocaine-treated legs on average, and we found a p-value of 0.0429. This is indicative that our results were statistically significant and that lidocaine has a clear negative impact on the function of leg muscles in Rana pipiens.


Introduction:
In animals, voltage-gated ion channels are essential in determining the sodium permeability of the plasma membrane, facilitating the action potentials, and allowing the excitation of nerve and muscle cells (Gilchrist: 2014). Specifically, it is the presence of sodium ions outside the cell and potassium ions within the cell which creates an electrical potential and enables this process. Disturbing this electrical potential in some way likely has a negative impact on the efficacy of muscles cells to properly relax and contract as it would hinder the neuronal signal received by them and consequently limit the function of the muscle as a whole (Lera Ruiz: 2015). In this experiment, we sought to determine the impact that lidocaine, a known sodium channel blocker, has on the function of Rana pipiens leg muscles. If there is no difference in muscle function between the control and the lidocaine-treated legs, we accept the null hypothesis that that lidocaine does not have a notable impact on the function of Rana pipiens leg muscles. However, if there is a difference in the data, we accept the alternate hypothesis that it is a direct result of lidocaine’s role in inhibiting voltage-gated sodium ion channels that negatively impacts muscle function.


Materials and Methods:
To start, our lab group was given three Rana pipiens frog legs for the experiment. We carefully degloved each leg and sufficiently moistened them with a Ringer’s solution. These legs acted as controls. We then carefully dissected each leg until the sciatic nerve could be isolated. Once isolated, we placed the electric impulse apparatus underneath the sciatic nerves. Using the LabScribe software, we applied a given stimulus of 1.0 amps to each leg and measured the subsequent voltage generated. We completed three trials for each leg and averaged the results. After this, we repeated the procedure again, with each frog leg being directly injected with 0.1 mL of a 25 mM lidocaine solution. We repeated the three trials and collected the results. We analyzed our results with a paired t-test.




Results:
The mean voltage prior to the lidocaine treatment was 0.866 volts, with a standard deviation of 0.628, while the mean following the lidocaine treatment was 0.485 volts, with a standard deviation of 0.622. The mean voltage after the lidocaine injection was significantly less than before the injection (t-stat = 4.67, df = 2, p = 0.042). Results from the paired t-test are shown in the figure below.


Discussion:
According to our raw data and the statistical tests we conducted, our results appear to be statistically significant, with the lidocaine treatment clearly impairing the neuromuscular function of the Rana pipiens frog legs. Because the experiment was in a controlled setting, and there aren’t any potential unforeseen variables which may have impacted our results, there is likely little experimental error. Thus, the alternate hypothesis is supported, and the difference in the data is likely a consequence of the effect of lidocaine on inhibiting the movement of sodium ions through voltage-gated ion channels. This in turn creates a less substantial action potential which provides a less prominent neuromuscular response. Aside from simply limiting the neuromuscular function of frog legs, though, lidocaine and other sodium channel blockers have a variety of pharmacological functions. In humans, sodium channel blockers are commonly used to treat many ailments including epilepsy, respiratory and neuromuscular disorders, cardiovascular disease, and chronic pain (Lera Ruiz: 2015). Moreover, many different venomous organisms including spiders, scorpions, sea anemones, cone snails, and various insects employ toxins which function to block sodium ion channels with varying negative effects (Gilchrist: 2014).  Since we have experimentally verified the effectiveness of lidocaine in lessening muscle function, future experiments could investigate the effect of a sodium channel blocker on a particular organ, like the heart or brain, and determine the benefit or detriment of the physiological outcome.
