Title: The Effect of Lidocaine on the Amplitude of Gastrocnemius Muscle Response in Frog Legs

Abstract:
Rania Pipien frog legs are comprised of two main parts, the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve; both are involved in the process of muscle contraction.  The gastrocnemus muscle is a voluntarily controllled muscle and also coordinated to contract based on stimuli from the sciatic nerve.  In the experiment, the gastrocnemus muscle is treated with lidocaine, a common anesthetic.  The leg is monitored and tested at varying stimuli to see the affect the nerve blocker has on the magnitude of response.   It was hypothesized that if lidocaine is injected into the muscle, then the response will be lower.  3 Rania Pipien legs are tested, all three are tested before a lidocaine injection to determine a threshold.  After the threshold is determined, the lidocaine is injected, and the stimulus is applied.  The controll groups had an average response at 0.153 v, 0.222 v, and 0.235 v.  The treatment groups had an average response at 0.05 v, 0.034 v, and 0.136 v.  The P-value was 0.047 making the results significent.  The hypothesis was supported, the lidocaine blocked the sodium channels, limiting the significance of the action potential fired, creating a lower average response.      

Introduction:
In all animals, there are 3 main types of muscle, smooth, cardiac, and skeletal [Picture: 2016].  Skeletal muscle is a voluntarily controllled muscle group, operated within our controll, or controllled through the peripheral nervous system [Picture: 2016].  Frog legs contain two main parts that controll the muscle contraction, the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle.  The gastrocnemus muscle is considered a skeletal muscle and is monitored by motor neurons [Johnson: 2018].  External stimulus causes the release of neurotransmitters and fires an action potential down a membrane [Brian, 2016].  Sodium channels exist in the muscle fiber and become opened when nerve impulse causes the release of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.  The opening of the sodium channels causes the action potential to continue down the muscle fiber and eventually release calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The calcium ions eventually bind to troponin, opening up the myosin binding sites on the actin. [Brian: 2009].  Action potentials occur in the muscle fibers and eventually lead to muscle contraction and response [Johnson: 2018].  Based on the information about how muscle fibers work and the neuromuscular junctions, we decided to introduce a chemical blocker to observe how the amplitude would change.  Specifically, a local anesthetic know as lidocaine, was introduced directly to the gastrocnemus muscle.  Lidocaine, considered a local anesthetic, blocks nerve transmission by inhibiting the function of the sodium channels [Perkins: 2005].  As we know, sodium channels are required to be active during an action potential.  Furthermore, the injection of lidocaine will reduce the reception of impulses sent by the nerve in that specific area [Perkins: 2005].  We hypothesized that if lidocaine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle, then the response of the muscle at a certain stimulus will be on average lower than the controll group muscle.  The independent variable in the experiment will be the lidocaine added to the frog leg.  The dependent variable will be the amplitude of the response from the frog leg.  External conditions will be held at a constant, such as adding ringer solution or keeping the stimulus constant for each individual leg.

Materials and Method:
In order to discover the effect of a lidocaine injection on the amplitude of response, 3 different frog legs were obtained.  First, each leg was skinned, and the gastrocnemus muscle was separated from the bone.  During this step, the sciatic nerve is isolated from the upper part of the leg and exposed to the electronic stimulator.  Then the gastrocnemus muscle is suspended in the air by a string that is tied around the tendon.  Meanwhile, all skinned frog legs are soaked with ringer's solution every 5-10 minutes to assure optimal contractions will occur.  Once the leg is suspended, and the sciatic nerve is over the electronic stimulator, various stimuli are applied to determine a threshold.  When the threshold is determined, the stimulus is increased by .1 amp and the response is recorded.  After the responses are recorded, the gastrocnemus muscle is injected with 0.1 milliliters of lidocaine and allowed to sit for 5 minutes.  The 5 minutes allows the lidocaine to spread throughout the entire muscle.  After 5 minutes has passed, the threshold that was determined from the previous step is tested and also increased by .1 amp.  Once again, the muscle response is recorded.  The exact same procedure is repeated for the other two frog legs and the various responses are recorded.  A two-paired t test was used in the experiment to P and T value.

Results:
For controll groups (no lidocaine) 1-3, an average response occurred at 0.153 v, 0.222 v, and 0.235 v (Fig 1).  Each of the controll groups had a standard deviation of 0.007, 0.008, and 0.04 respectively.  The treatment groups (lidocaine injections) had an average response at 0.05 v, 0.034 v, and 0.136 v (Fig 1).  The standard deviation for each of the treatment groups was 0.004, 0.004, and 0.006 respectively.  Based on the data, the P-Value was 0.047 and T-Value was 4.453.  Overall, the lidocaine injected legs displayed a less significent response to the stimulus.  It was evident that the gastrocnemus muscle would have a smaller twitch each time a stimulus was applied in comparison to the non-treated leg.        

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that the if the lidocaine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle, then the response of the muscle in volts will be on average lower compared to the gastrocnemus muscle with no lidocaine injection.  After the experiment was completed, the hypothesis was supported.  The muscles with the lidocaine injection had on average a lower response in volts.  The most likely explanation for this result was that the lidocaine blocked some of the sodium channels and limited the action potential.  Therefore, when the stimulus was kept constant between the controll and the treatment groups, the treatment group would not generate as large of a response [Perkins: 2005].  Based on our data and calculated P-value, a significent difference does exist between the controll and treatment groups.  Throughout the experiment, external factors were attempted to be controllled, such as properly skinning the legs, separating the sciatic nerve, and keeping enough tension on the string.  Although the hypothesis was supported, error is possible at all steps of the experiment.  One of the major errors that can occur is not keeping ringer solution on the frog legs at all times.  Ringer solution is typically a solution with multiple salts dissolved that creates an isotonic environment [Rogers: 2009].  Failing to reapply the ringer solution on the muscle every 5 minutes may not allow for the muscle to reach its maximum possible contraction.  Inconsistent application of the ringer solution could alter the accuracy of the results as each trial could have the ability to reach the maximum response or exhibit a small response.  Overall, this error creates a large amount of uncertainty.  Another possible error could occur after the lidocaine has been injected into the gastrocnemus muscle.  If the lidocaine is injected and then the stimulus is applied before the chemical has circulated throughout the entire muscle, then there may not be any observed effect of the lidocaine or a less substantial effect.  Another error could occur while injecting the lidocaine into the muscle.  At least one time, when the needle was injected, it went all the way through the muscle and poked out the other side.  Luckily, this error was caught before the lidocaine had been pushed out of the chamber.  However, if injecting the lidocaine is not done with precision, the treatment group data can be completely inaccurate.  For example, fatigue may be the main factor in altering the data as opposed to the lidocaine.  While on the topic of fatigue, it must be noted as an external factor that has the potential to alter the results.  Because the experiment uses real frog legs, the muscles canâ€™t contract at maximum force forever, as the muscle will eventually run out of ATP.  When the muscle runs out of ATP, the actin and myosin cross bridges will disconnect, which is different than the relaxation stage of contraction [Johnson: 2018].  Although the experiment yielded a significent difference, there are always further experiments that could be done to understand more about the subject.  One experiment that could be done that would yield more data to the effects of lidocaine in muscle contractions is changing the amount of lidocaine injected.  In this experiment, 0.1 Ml of lidocaine was injected each time.  As a further experiment, injecting 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 Ml of lidocaine into different legs would tell researchers a lot about local anesthetics and the optimal amount of lidocaine for a small response.  It also has the potential of determining if too much lidocaine is detrimental to the leg and if a certain amount of lidocaine will actually inhibit muscle function for a longer period of time than intended.  Further experiments in all of these areas could allow for more precise data regarding the function of lidocaine in the muscle, the time takes to work, and when lidocaine is at its optimal function.
