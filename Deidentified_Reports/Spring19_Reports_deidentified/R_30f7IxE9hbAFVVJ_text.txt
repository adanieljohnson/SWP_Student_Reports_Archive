Title: The Effects of Lidocaine on muscle movement in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test how a sodium channel blocker like lidocaine will affect the muscle movement of the gastrocnemius of the Rana pipiens. This is done by testing the legs without the lidocaine as a control and with the lidocaine to interpret the difference. We hypothesize that the lidocaine would hinder or completely block the action potential leading to the muscle movement. We were able to conclude that our hypothesis was correct due to the p-value through the statistical analysis of the data.

Introduction:
Muscle movement is something that every animal must do, especially the Rana pipiens, or the Northern Leopard Frog which moves through fast twitch motions. Through outside stimulus, the muscle can be moved even after death of the animal. This is due to the action potential being run by ion gradients [Sadava:2017]. One of the main ions that is necessary for an action potential, hence necessary for muscle movement is sodium. Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker, and because of this lidocaine will slow down the chance of a twitch to occur [Johnson:1970]. We will be testing the effect of lidocaine on the neuromuscular function of the Rana pipiens. We hypothesize that the lidocaine will hinder or completely prevent the contraction from happening. 


Materials and Methods:
To start off this experiment, we had to deglove three frog legs. Next we had to seperate the gastrocnemius from the rest of the leg so it was able to be hanged. Next find the sciatic nerve and gently place it to be used later. After, we hanged the first leg up by the gastrocnemius and placed the electrode on the sciatic nerve. Then we sent out 1 mV of electricity and recorded the returning electrical pulse generated by the gastrocnemius. We repeated this for 3 total runs. Next we injected 1 mL of 25 mM lidocaine into the gastrocnemius and pour a few drops on the sciatic nerve and did 3 runs of 1 mV electrical impulses and recorded the data. We did this with each leg and recorded all the data. We averaged out each of the legs for before and after the lidocaine was introduced and conduct a paired T-test with 95% confidence.

Results:
Figure 1. The average electric response in mV of Rana pipiens through the sciatic nerve before and after the introduction of lidocaine. The average for the before group was higher than the average of the after group (t-stat=4.67, df=2, P=.043).

Discussion:
This supports our hypothesis of the lidocaine having an effect on the response of the gastrocnemius contracting through stimulating the sciatic nerve. This is due to the p-value being .043 which is less than .05 which is necessary for it to be statistically significant. This means that the sodium channel blocker slowed down the amount of sodium ions that can travel through the channel, hence slowing down the action potential and lowering the energy output. In other words, lidocaine lowers the chances of a twitch to occur from the nerve [Johnson:1970]. This is due to the necessity of sodium during muscle contraction. Sodium is what initially diffuses into the cell to begin the muscle contraction, so if given enough time and lidocaine, a contraction may not even occur. Another option that we can test is using a potassium channel blocker and see how that affects the energy output of the muscle contraction. Potassium is another ion that is necessary during muscle contraction; potassium is a part of the muscle relaxing, but too much potassium can cause a higher initial energy output necessary for the contraction to occur.
