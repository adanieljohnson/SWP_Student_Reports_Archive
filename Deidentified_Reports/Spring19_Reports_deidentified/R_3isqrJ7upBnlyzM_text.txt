Title: Effect of Martin’s IGR on Manduca sexta caterpillar’s Development 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillar’s development is propagated through two main hormones within the insect: Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). When the balance of one of these hormones is disrupted, a malfunction in molt, pupation, and development occurs. Within this lab, Martin’s IGR, or methoprene, a JH hormone analog, was used to test the growth rate over time as well as what impact it would have on the development of the Manduca sexta. So, .3Ml of methoprene was added to the experimental group of caterpillar’s 10 grams of given food. The controll Manduca sexta received the same food and same amount, however, they received water rather than hormone. The hypothesis applied to this lab detailed that Martin’s IGR would impact the growth of the caterpillars in a way that prevented them from pupating. However, there was very little distinguishable difference between the controll group and experimental group (t-value=0.503, d.f.=4, p_value=0.317). Therefore, we failed to reject the null hypothesis.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta caterpillars have a multitude of hormones that regulate their many bodily process. Specific to growth and developmental changes within the caterpillars are three main hormones: Prothoracicotropic hormones, Ecdysteroids, and juvenile hormones. However, in this experiment, the focus will only be on the latter hormone, but more specifically, its analog, methoprene. For a Manduca sexta to properly develop past the fifth instar and molt, it must have a low amount of juvenile hormone and a sharp increase in its ecdysteroids. A way of disrupting this natural process is through the introduction to an insect growth regulator. An IGR can cause growth and development abnormalities that inhibit the Manduca sexta from “normal” life cycle and biological processes. An example of this being that, when used in a separate experiment on Ephestiu cuutellu, more commonly known as Almond Moth, whom infested a stored container of in-shell peanuts, methoprene effectively caused a greater than 90% reduction in adult development (the transition from larvae to moth) [Oberlander: 1997]. The IGR used in this experiment is Martin’s IGR which contains methoprene. The purpose of this lab experiment is to see the effect of this methoprene sample on the biological systems and development of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. Therefore, in conjunction with the Ephestiu cuutellu failing to reach adulthood, it is predicted that the Manduca sexta will remain in their larval stage and fail to pupate into adults.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta of which were at the 2nd to 3rd instar of development were selected and split into two groups of four. One group was labeled the controll and the other experimental. Then, each groups were placed into their respective plastic containers of which had four separate living sections for each of the caterpillars. Each section of the controll container had ten grams of the Great Lakes Manduca diet with .3Ml of water mixed in. Each section of the experimental container had ten grams of the Great Lakes Manduca diet with .3Ml of Martin’s IGR mixed in. These drops of water and IGR are considered the independent variable. When the Manduca sexta ran out of their diet, it was immediately replaced with diet of the identical formula. They were then placed in a regulatory incubator with a natural 12-hour light and 12-hour dark light cycle. In accordance with the dependent variable, their weight and developmental process, were observed every day at 6:00 pm. The data collected will be examined through a two-sample t_test.

Results:
The experiment observed change in weight of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars in the experimental and controll groups over the time span of fourteen days. It was noted that both groups, experimental and controll, grew in mass each day. However, in the last three days of the experiment, the Manduca sexta caterpillars of the experimental group began to turn brown and lose weight. Figure one shows that the Manduca sexta of the controll averaged a change in mass over two weeks of 11.96 grams +/- 1.73. The average of the mass of the experimental group over the allotted two weeks was 12.66 grams +/- 2.18. Singular caterpillar’s total growth in mass in the allotted time period of the experiment. However, the mean change in weight failed to be statistically significent (t-value=0.503, d.f.=4) and our two tailed p_value ended up being 0.317.

Discussion:
The lab experiment relayed no statistically significent data, therefore, our hypothesis was supported (t-value=0.503, d.f.=4, p_value=0.317); our hypothesis being that methoprene would impact the growth of the caterpillars in a way that caused them to grow, yet, fail to reach peak adulthood. None of the caterpillars reached pupation, as predicted because of methoprene’s known ability to impact development and growth and inhibit it from a “normal” life cycle as well as biological processes. The Manduca sexta continued to grow, but towards the end of the experiment, began to turn brown and die rather than pupate. This brings the study done with Ephestiu cuutellu back into focus. The Ephestiu cuutellu were effectively locked into their developmental stage (and died rather than pupating into moths) due to the intervention of methoprene much like the Manduca sexta within our own lab. However, there was a 20% likelihood that our results occurred by chance according to the P-value. It can be interpreted that Manduca sexta failed to reach the 5th larval instar due to their continued exposure to methoprene, which can also be seen in the almond moth’s inability to reach the adult moth stage [Oberlander: 1997].
