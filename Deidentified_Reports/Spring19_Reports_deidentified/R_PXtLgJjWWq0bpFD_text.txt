Title: The Effect of Caffeine Injection on Frog Muscle 

Abstract:
Caffeine is a substance easily abused and widely accessible by people starting from a young age. The experiment tests the effect of caffeine when injected directly to the frog muscle. The muscle goes into tetany when one milliliter of caffeine is injected which is when the muscle goes into fatigue because it can no longer contract anymore. More calcium is released from the endoplasmic reticulum when caffeine is injected making the muscle contract more than normal and therefore go into tetany. The frog legs’ sciatic nerve is connected to the stimulator and probe in order to record the hertz given off from the frog leg and to activate a stimulation. It is hypothesized that if muscle is injected with calcium, then the muscle will quickly go into tetany. The experiment had a low p_value meaning it was statistically significent and supports the hypothesis. 


Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effect of caffeine injected directly into a frog’s leg. Caffeine, a form of stimulant, today is widely consumed by many implemented in their daily diet. It can be found in tea, coffee and other soft drinks. Ingestion of caffeine is quickly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and can easily pass the blood brain barrier, a mechanism made up of endothelial cells to protect the brain from possible harmful toxins. [Jacobson: 34] Motor neurons found in the spinal cord are made up of thousands of myofibers. The axons at the end of these neurons creates a point called neuromuscular junctions. Acetylcholine gets released from the presynaptic nerve terminal opening the sodium channels and creates an action potential. Caffeine is found to increase the amount of calcium released in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a membrane bound structure that receives signals from neurons to contract the muscles. [Fumar: 64] Muscle contraction goes through different stages: latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase. The latent period is the time after stimulation and before contraction. The contraction phase is when the chemical change happens within the fibers and the muscle contracts creating a rise in muscle tension on the myogram. The relaxation phase is after the maximum contraction has been reached and the muscle returns back to its resting stage. When a motor neuron is activated multiple times in a short span of time, it is in temporal summation where the muscle contracts continuously. If temporal summation is continuous over a period of time, the muscle goes into tetany after its maximum force is generated. The muscle becomes fatigued and will not be able to contract again if quickly stimulated again. If calcium is injected into the frog leg, then it is hypothesized that the muscle will quickly go into tetany due to an increase in calcium making it contract for a longer duration than normal.


Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were cut from the thighs and used for both the controll and treatment groups Then each were degloved from the skin exposing the leg muscles. The gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve was detached through the use of a tweezer and scissor in order to get access to the sciatic nerve making sure not to damage or cut the nerve. Frog Ringer’s solution was continuously put on the muscles to keep it moist. Two pins were used to hold down the leg muscles to prevent movement during simulation. The achilles tendon was detached with scissors and tied to string to the force transducer to measure the force of movement in the frog leg. Then the stimulator was set up with the probe on the sciatic nerve and making sure that the string connecting the leg was taut to get an accurate reading on the computer. One hertz was exerted for each of the five pulses pre and post injection. One milliliter of caffeine was injected with a syringe into each frog leg on the gastrocnemus muscle after the controll group was tested and recorded. The average and standard deviation was then calculated and a sample paired t_test was run.


Results:
A paired t_test was run and the data shows that the frog leg muscles went into tetany during the five pulses of one hertz when caffeine was injected. The mean of the post injection group was significently greater than the mean pre injection and the p_value was statistically significent (t_stat =7.649, d.f.= 2, P= 0.016663). Leg one had a standard deviation of 0.363, leg two had a standard deviation of 0.4016, and leg three had a standard deviation of 0.551. Nevertheless, the muscle also turned into a hard solid mass right after injection and thawed down a little bit after the experiment.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the gastrocnemus muscle will go into tetany after caffeine injection, was supported due to the low p_value. Caffeine increases the release of calcium which causes the contraction of muscles and the stimulation of causes it to depolarize. Due to the increase amount of calcium, the muscle contracts until it can no longer and goes into tetany due to the loss of ATP. [Kumar 62] This response is shown through the frog legs after it contracts and goes into tetany  Many athletes and people from all ages use caffeine as a stimulant and muscle performance enhancement without much knowledge on its effect on the physiological body. Further studies must be conducted on this but the effect of caffeine can alter one’s mental activity [Goldstein 159]. People can develop a tolerance towards caffeine increasing their intake without understanding the effects it has on their bodies. Other experiments can also be conducted to see how we can help those with a calcium deficiency or how to controll one’s twitching from calcium release.
