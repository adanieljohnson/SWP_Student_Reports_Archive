Title: Neuromuscular Effects of Caffeine on the [Rana pipiens]

Abstract:
Neuromuscular stimulation in the [Rana pipiens] is largely based on myofibers that release Acetylcholine, causing the release of Ca2+ and the contraction of the muscle.  The goal of this experiment was to test the effects of caffeine on the gastrocnemius of the [Rana pipiens].  We predicted that electrical stimulation of the gastrocnemius with caffeine will create a larger threshold in the muscle, causing tension.  To test this hypothesis, we injected caffeine into the gastrocnemius, and fired electrical impulses and recorded the amplitude response using LabScribe software.  Our results revealed that caffeine did create a higher threshold voltage than without caffeine.  These results are due to caffeine prolonging the action potential during stimulation, therefore creating tension and a suppressed rate of Ca2+ release.

Introduction:
The [Rana pipiens] is an amphibian more commonly known as the northern leopard frog.  Neuromuscular control to the animal is similar to humans, as nerve impulses are used to stimulate the muscles of the [Rana pipiens].  They occur at the neuromuscular junction with the release of acetylcholine.  ACh binds to receptors that open sodium channels that creates an action potential, releasing Ca2+ [Johnson: 2018].  Therefore, our experiment aimed to discover how this process is altered with the injection of caffeine in the calf muscle of the frog.  Similar experiments have shown that injecting caffeine into a [Rana pipiens] muscle prolongs the action potential when stimulated and created tension due to the suppressed rate of Ca2+ release [Poledna: 1983].  We also decided to use the leopard frog for its ability to easily isolate its gastrocnemius, and its similarities with the neuromuscular system of humans.  We hypothesized that stimulating the gastrocnemius with caffeine would create tension and a larger threshold response than without.

Materials and Methods:
First, the legs of three frogs were isolated and dissected to expose the Achilles tendon and suspended it with a string to stimulate the gastrocnemius.  Each leg was first used as a control without caffeine, using a ringer solution to hydrate the legs as needed.  The legs were stimulated three times at an amplitude of 0.5 V and averaged the stimulus response from the myogram on the LabScribe computer software. Next, each leg was stimulated three times with electrical impulses from the software at 0.5 V while caffeine was injected by a syringe into the gastrocnemius.  200 mM of caffeine was inserted with a syringe while electrical impulses were fired.  Each stimulus response shown on the computer was averaged.  We also performed a paired T test to determine the statistical significance of our results.  



Results:
The summarized data of each response before and after the injection of caffeine in shown in figure 1.  Leg one of the Rana pipiens was physically the largest and resulted in an overall higher mean amplitude (0.786 V and 1.470 V).  Legs two had a smaller mean before and after the injection (0.471 V, 1.256 V).  Leg three followed the same trend (0.483 V, 1.315 V).  The overall mean amplitude for non-caffeinated and caffeinated was graphed in figure 2.  The caffeinated frog leg had the highest mean amplitude response overall (1.347 V vs. 0.565 V).  Our paired T-test also reflected these statistically significant results (t-stat= 17.56, df=2, P= 0.0032). 

Discussion:
From our experiment, we can infer that the injection of caffeine increases the muscular stimulus response in the [Rana pipiens], with the average response amplitude being higher than the non-caffeinated response. Comparing these results to other experiments, we can infer that the biological reason is due to the inhibited response of ryanodine, the Ca2+ releaser in skeletal muscle. With the delayed release of Ca 2+, the muscle creates more tension with a prolonged action potential, which increases the threshold response overall [Hendricson: 2002].  Therefore, the null hypothesis can be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis can be supported.  For future experiments, we could use caffeine to stimulate the gastrocnemius to determine if an increased number in injections would decrease the amount of stimulation needed to fatigue the muscle.  We could test both the gastrocnemius and the sciatic nerve to observe the difference between thresholds in different areas of the [Rana pipiens.]
