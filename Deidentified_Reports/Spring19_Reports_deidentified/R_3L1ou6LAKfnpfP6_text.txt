Title: No reported correlation between muscle contraction strength and the addition of Ca2+

Abstract:
Calcium, or Ca²⁺, is necessary for the contraction of voluntary skeletal muscle and is responsible for allowing actin and myosin bands to connect, initiating a muscle contraction. In conditions such as central core disease (CCD), the muscle lacks sufficient calcium to initiate stable contractions, result in prolonged muscle weakness. Due to calcium’s necessity in the muscle contraction process, it is possible that an addition of Ca²⁺ in the muscle could prevent the muscle weakness associated with CCD. This study hypothesized that an injection of Ca²⁺ into the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg would result in an increased contractile strength for that muscle. The contraction strength of three frog legs was measured pre-injection of Ca²⁺, and then measured again after an injection of A23187, a Ca²⁺ solution. This study found no correlation between the addition of Ca²⁺ solution and increased contractile strength (t_stat = 1.011, d.f. = 2, p_value = 0.4185). As a result, further study is required to determine if Ca²⁺could be a possible treatment for the symptoms of CCD. 


Introduction:
Skeletal muscle, the muscle responsible for voluntary movement, is composed of myofibers, which contain smaller micro-units that initiate muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. When movement is needed, a neural impulse triggers the release of acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter necessary for muscle contraction, which then binds to its appropriate receptor [Cho: 2017]. The binded ACh then initiates the release of sodium ions, and for the release of sodium ions to initiate a muscle contraction, the concentration of sodium ions must reach a specific threshold. After this threshold is reached, an action potential is produced and carried through the myofiber, and Ca²⁺ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a storage site within the myofiber [Johnson: 2018]. The release of Ca²⁺ is responsible for changing the structure of tropomyosin, a protein blocking myosin from binding to actin, allowing the myosin filament to bind to the actin filament [Cho: 2017]. The binding of these two filaments initiates the visible muscle contraction process, by changing the length of the respective muscle. The muscle stops contracting when Ca²⁺ is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing tropomyosin to change its conformation and return to its position preventing the binding of actin and myosin [Cho: 2017].
Central core disease (CCD) is caused by a genetic mutation that affects the ryanodine receptor that regulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Gommans: 2002]. In CCD, the muscle is calcium deficient, and is often unable to contract when required, leading to consistent muscle weakness [National Institute of Health]. As of now, no cure or treatment exists for muscle weakness associated with CCD, and physical therapy can only decrease the severity of the symptoms, not eliminate them. If the addition of Ca²⁺ shows an increase in muscle contraction strength, it could indicate that some form of Ca²⁺ treatment could help to alleviate the muscle weakness associated with CCD. Furthermore, if the addition of Ca²⁺ showed increased contraction strength, further research could be conducted on the effect of additional Ca²⁺ on contraction duration, which could alleviate the spasticity associated with certain muscle disorders, including CCD. 
 This study hypothesized that an increase in the concentration of Ca²⁺ in the muscle would allow more action potentials to occur, resulting in an increased contraction strength at a given voltage. This study utilized frog legs due to their similarity to human muscle structure, their ability to withstand manipulation, and their attainability. The independent variable is the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg specimen and whether it is pre- or post-injection of A23187, which contains Ca²⁺. The gastrocnemus muscle was utilized because it is easily isolated from the remaining muscular tissue, and can be readily stimulated by the sciatic nerve. 
The dependent variable is the contraction strength of the respective frog leg specimen. 


Materials and Method:
A singular frog leg was placed onto a clean dissecting tray, and the frog leg was deskinned by gently pulling the skin away from the muscle. A dissecting probe was then used to separate the sciatic nerve from the surrounding thigh muscle. In addition, the gastrocnemus muscle was then separated from the muscle surrounding the tibia. The gastrocnemus was then cut away from the leg dorsally by cutting the achilles tendon towards the frog foot. Using a piece of string, a small knot was tied around the now loose achilles tendon. The frog leg was then pinned to the dissecting tray, but the gastrocnemus muscle was kept suspended by tying the other end of the string to a raised securing platform. At this point, the frog leg was flat on the dissecting tray, but the gastrocnemus muscle was suspended in the air and kept taut by the suspending string. The frog leg specimen was kept moist by repeated saturation of Frog Ringer’s solution. A forked measurement probe was placed under the exposed sciatic nerve, making sure to avoid all contact with the metal dissecting pins. 
The measurement probe was attached to an electrical impulse unit, which was reporting information to the LabScribe program. The program was set to 0.00V, one pulse, and 0.1W(ms) for the pulse width. The voltage was then increased by 0.1V until the minimum threshold for muscle contraction was found. The threshold of the action potential was determined by finding the lowest voltage required to see both a visual twitch in the frog muscle and a visible muscle contraction in the LabScribe program. The threshold of each frog leg muscle was determined to be 0.2V. At this point, a 0.2V impulse was applied to the sciatic nerve, and the total contraction strength was calculated by subtracting the initial contraction strength from the final contraction strength. This contraction strength was recorded three times for each frog leg specimen, for a total of nine contraction strengths prior to injection. 
0.2Ml of A23187, which contains Ca²⁺, was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of each frog specimen, and the muscle massaged to ensure optimal dispersion of the solution. The total contraction strength of each frog leg was then taken three times at 0.2V. The averages of each frog leg contraction strength prior to injection of A23187 and post-injection of A23187 were then taken and statistically compared using a paired t_test and one-tailed p_value. 




Results:
Figure 1. shows the average contraction strength of each frog leg specimen prior to the injection of 0.2Ml of A23187 and after the inject of 0.2Ml of A23187. For the results of this study to be deemed statistically significent, the calculated p_value should be less than 0.05. The p_value of these results is 1.011, which is greater than 0.05, so these findings are not statistically significent (t_stat = 1.011, d.f. = 2, p_value = 0.4185). Frog Leg 1 reported a much stronger pre-injection contraction strength than the other two specimens, and was 0.4705V stronger than the next strongest contraction strength. In addition, frog leg 1 did not exhibit a contractile response after the injection of A23187. In contrast, frog legs 2 and 3 exhibited post-injection contraction strengths that were very close to the contraction strength of the frog leg prior to injection of A23187. 


Discussion:
Statistical analysis reveals that because our p_value is greater than 0.05, Ca²⁺ played no significent role in impacting contraction strength in the gastrocnemus muscle. As a result, our hypothesis, that the addition of Ca²⁺ would increase muscle contractile strength, was not supported by the findings of our study. It is important to note that unlike the other two specimens, one of the frog legs portrayed outlier data and did not contract post-injection of A23187 at 0.2V. Although this specimen was an irregularity, the similarity of the pre- and post-injection contraction strengths of the other two frog leg specimens are similar enough to be compared and the data of just those specimens still reveals that there was no correlation found between the addition of  Ca²⁺ and muscle contraction strength. 
Additionally, a previous study found that older mice displayed a reduced contraction strength when compared to young mice, and this resulted from the ineffective calcium storage system of the older mice [Cho: 2017]. Although this previous study did not examine frogs, the study’s findings may be still be generalizable to additional species. If the specimen that the frog leg that produced irregular data was obtained from was much older than the other specimens, the difference in age may be an explanation for the lack of contraction at the standardized voltage.  Thus, normalizing the ages of the frog leg specimens could help to reduce any potential outlier information; however, research would first have to be performed to determine if the relationship between age and contractile strength that was observed in mice was also observable in frogs. In addition, the sample size of this study was relatively small, and additional research with larger sample sizes could provide more insight into the effects of additional Ca²⁺ on muscle contraction strength. Although this study did not show a correlation between the addition of Ca²⁺ and increased contractile strength, further research may contradict the results of this study. If Ca²⁺ is not found to have an impact on muscle contraction strength or duration, additional research into method of increasing strength of muscle contraction could provide insight into possible cures or treatments for the muscle weakness affecting those with central core disease.
