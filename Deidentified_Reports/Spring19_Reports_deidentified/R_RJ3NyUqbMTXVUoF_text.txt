Title: Testing the Neuromuscular Controls of Rana Pipiens Gastrocnemius muscle

Abstract:
In this experiment the lab used Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, to alter the muscles contractions in Rana Pipien’s gastrocnemius muscle. Various concentrations of sodium channel blockers can affect typical muscle function because action penitential are released by the opening of sodium channels and when said channels are blocked, muscle contractions and action potentials are inhibited. The muscle contractions were measured before and after, the lidocaine injections. Due to the assumed correlation, the lab hypothesized that when lidocaine (sodium channel blocker) are injected into the leg, a decrease to an eventual halt of the action potential in-between nerves would occur. The data as well as our visual observation showed that the Lidocaine did cause a prominent decrease in action potential waves, resulting in the alternative hypothesis being supported. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to explore the fundamental properties of the neuromuscular control system of the Rana pipien’s, also known as Leopard frogs, gastrocnemius muscle by stimulating several muscle contractions. The goal of the experiment is to test the properties of the sciatic never and the gastrocnemius muscle neuromuscular controls; via stimulation. The muscular system of both vertebrates and invertebrates is very complex and detailed system. This process is made up of thousands of myofibers, cylindrical, multicellular, fused groups of cells. These myofibers are bound together and can form skeletal muscle proper which switch by motor neurons. The motor neurons send a neurotransmitter that signal which instantiates muscle contractions. The typical presence of Sodium channels is crucial and plays a significant role in nerve function. Most of the body’s sodium can be found within blood and the intracellular fluid and sodium keep said fluids levels where it needs to be in order to sustain life. “During sustained stimulation of motor neurons, a release of acetylcholine by the neuron is sufficient to maintain tetany of the skeletal muscle” which is withstood by stimulation of the “presynaptic nicotinic receptors” via acetylcholine.”[Clarks: 2018] Acetylcholine (ACh), is a chemical, is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, binds to its receptor, resulting in the opening of sodium channels which generates an action potential in a muscle fiber. The potential then travels through the length of the fiber, releases Ca+2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing the muscle to contract. These contractions can be measured with a Myogram, which is a graphical recording of muscle activity via the electrophysiology (EP). Therefore, If the one was to injects sodium channel blockers (Lidocaine) then we hypothesize a decrease to an eventual sensation of the action potential in the nerve.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment called for the use of three frog legs. The skin was removed from the legs via hands and metal forceps and placed to the side of the dissection pan. The dissection probe was used to carefully separate the inner thigh muscle from the top to the lower muscle, until the white sciatic nerve was visible. Then, said nerve was carefully freed from its attached connective tissue with dissection needle or forceps. The gastrocnemius muscle was, then separated from the connective tissue, all the way down to the Achilles tendon and sniped away from the body. Periodically lightly moisten the exposed tissue with the provided frog ringer. Then, attach the tendon to a string and run it through the electrophysiology (EP).  Using the simulator provided on Labscribe, locate the amplitude and find the threshold stimulus which was (.3). The values were analyzed for stimulus parameters. The amplitude was then set to 0.0 volts. Then we changed said amplitude to .4 volts, .1 above the threshold, and applied to the simulator and watch for a change. The amplitudes of the contractions were recorded and the steps for each of the three legs were repeated. Then, after the voltage was measured, .1 ml of concentration of Lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle as well as carefully dropped 1 drop onto the sciatic nerve and waited for 3 minutes. Finally, Record the voltage and analyze the results using a two tailed paired T-test. 

Results:
The average amplitude for the control group was 1.396 volts, while the average amplitude for the experimental group was .2493 volts (Fig 1). A two-tailed paired T-test was used to analyze this data. The data concluded that due to the P-value being less than .05, at .02531. The data showed that are results were statistically significant. The observations as well as the data led to several trends through the process of the experiment. After injection of the sodium channel blocker (Lidocaine) into the frog’s leg, the voltage of the experimental continued to decrease and the leg muscle twitch would last longer. Also, the bigger the frog leg resulted in the higher amplitude voltage produce in both the experimental and control in comparison to the smaller legs. 

Discussion:
After the review of the results of the experiment the lab showed that the alternative hypothesis of if sodium blocker lidocaine was added that we would expect a decrease to a possible station of the action potential in the nerve was supported and the null hypothesis was rejected. Voltage was decreased in the action potential due to the sodium channel blocking (sodium propagates an action potential). Therefore, with the lack of the presence of sodium, the action potential is unable to travel down the neurons signaling other action potentials. The two tailed T-test showed yielded a .05 level meaning or data was supported and suggested an increase in the sodium channel blockers significantly affected the action potential and the amplitude. “The reason why we used the muscle contraction amplitude was because muscular contractions” show the index of the intensity of the impulses in the frogs leg [Tasaki: 1952]. This showed due to the smaller frogs having a lower voltage than the larger frogs simply because the larger would need more lidocaine for it to reach more muscle cells. The data concluded that due to the P-value being less than .05, at .02531, proving that are results were statistically significant. Thus, in the case of a hypothesis being supported one should redo there experiment exactly the same, in order to confirm that their findings. The case with this lab would be seeing if the threshold concentration at which lidocaine can be effective could be found at a lower threshold.

Figure 1.  This figure represents the average amplitude (in volts) of muscle responses from the three frog legs with the control group (the blue bar) and the experimental group, lidocaine sodium channel blocker, (orange bar). The error bars are the 1 standard deviation of the data. A trend appeared while analyzing the data and it was that as the lidocaine was injected the contraction amplitude decreased. *************************************************************************
