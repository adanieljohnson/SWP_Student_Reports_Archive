Title: The Effect of PreCore Methoprene Insect Growth Regulator on Manduca sexta Weight

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators are important components of hormone controll in biology. With many farmers dealing with crop growth, it is important to understand the creatures that are eating their plants and how to inhibit their reproduction. Here, we look at the effect of PreCore methoprene, JH hormone mimic on Manduca sexta growth patterns. The prediction was that the weight of the caterpillars would increase, since the caterpillars would be unable to reach the commitment pulse at an early time and would continue to ingest more nutrients. While the amount of JH in the caterpillar would not increase, the presence of the mimic would mirror that effect. The independent variable was the presence of PreCore methoprene in the caterpillar food, and the dependent variable was the weight of each caterpillar. However, the data showed no significent difference in the weights of the caterpillars fed food with the PreCore methoprene and the weights of those fed without the IGR. This lack of significance suggests that PreCore methoprene is an IGR that does not mimic the JH hormone in Manduca sexta. This experiment also suggests that there is an adaptation in the Manduca sexta that allows the caterpillar to inhibit the effects of the PreCore methoprene and grow at a normal rate.

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone present in the life cycle of Manduca Sexta. The hormone, primarily present before the commitment pulse, regulates the type of molt (or change in size/morphology) during development. When the level of JH decreases, the commitment pulse is produced signaling that the caterpillar can begin pupating. [Tunaz: 2004] However, what would happen if this hormone was manipulated? What if the caterpillar had more JH than needed? Insect growth regulators (IGRs) cause hormonal abnormalities in insects, that sometimes reduce the rate of insect survival [Staal: 1975]. In the case of Manduca Sexta, if the JH was exposed to an altering IGR, the overall effect would mimic that of an increased amount of JH. Thus, the commitment pulse would occur too late, and the caterpillar would pupate into a large adult. It should be noted that the presence of JH was not increased, but the resulting effect was similar to that action. This could potentially decrease its chance of survival, as the caterpillar may not be able to pupate at all. In order to prove this, different levels of JH, combined with the IGR, must be ingested by the caterpillars, to analyze their survival rates and developments. This is because the extra JH will elongate the time before the commitment pulse, allowing the caterpillar to intake a surplus of nutrients. A possible IGR that would manipulate the amount of JH produced by the caterpillar is PreCore methoprene, a JH mimic. If 8 drops of PreCore methoprene, juvenile hormone (JH) mimic, are added to the caterpillar food, then the caterpillars will increase in weight (g). Mimicking an increase in the amount of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent or delay the caterpillars from becoming pupae. This would cause the caterpillars to reach the commitment pulse later and pupate into larger sized adults. 

Materials and Method:
In this lab, two plastic bins, each with four compartments, were used as habitats for caterpillar growth. One bin was marked as experimental and the other was marked as controll. Each compartment was labeled with a number (1-4), to correspond with each caterpillar. To ensure that the caterpillars could breathe, a hole poker was used to create two holes in the external sides of each compartment. Then, eight Manduca sexta were selected from a container. We aimed to pick caterpillars that were smaller in size, as some of the larger caterpillars were closer to the commitment pulse. Next, each caterpillar was placed onto a scale, and its weight was recorded in grams. Each caterpillar, after it was weighed, was placed into one of the eight labeled compartments. It was important to remember when recording the measurements which caterpillar was which (based on number and experimental vs controll). After each caterpillar was weighed, 40 grams of stock Manduca sexta food was measured, via a weight boat. Then, in a separate container, the food was broken up into smaller pieces. Afterwards, for the experimental group, 8 drops of Precore methoprene were added to the food, using a pipette. The food and solution were then mixed together. Then, using the weight boat, 10 grams of food were measured out. Before the food was placed in each compartment, the food was squished together into one, collected ball (it was easier for the caterpillars to eat the food in this shape). This process of food preparation was then repeated for the other experimental compartments, and for the controllled caterpillars. Instead of the precore methoprene, the controllled caterpillar food was mixed with 8 drops of deionized water (ddH2O). For a period of 14 days, the process of weighing the caterpillars and restocking their food was repeated, along with cleaning out the containers. After the 14-day period, the caterpillars were discarded in a bag provided by our TA. In regard to analyzing the data collected, we used a sample two t_test, where the change in weight was our measured value and the percent precore methoprene in the Manduca sexta were the categorical value. The calculated change in weight was based off of the weight measurements from days 1 to 11. This was done for caterpillar 1-4 in the experimental group and caterpillars 1-4 in the controll group. Then, for each controll and experimental caterpillar, the quantities calculated were averaged. This resulted in an average change in weight for each group of caterpillars (controll and precore methoprene).

Results:
The mean change in weight for the controll caterpillars was 12.26 and the mean change in weight for the experimental caterpillars was 11.6 (Fig. 1). The standard deviation for the change in weight in the controll caterpillars was +/- 0.595 and the standard deviation for the change in weight in the experimental caterpillars was +/- 0.578 (Fig. 1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze the aforementioned results. The mean of the change in weight of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t-value=1.591, d.f.=6, p_value=0.08138). By using the recorded weights, we noticed a trend in both the controll and experimental groups. Each group of caterpillars had an increased in weight each day they were measured. There were a few days where the weight of the caterpillars decreased, and then increased. For almost each day, for the 1 and 2 caterpillars in each group, the weight of those in the controll group were greater than that of the experimental group. On the other hand, the 3 and 4 caterpillars in each group had a greater weight in the experimental group, whereas those in the controll group weighed less. There was no general trend for the daily average weight of the four caterpillars, as the numbers fluctuated as being greater than or less than the average of the other group. When observing the caterpillars on the last day, the only visible difference was that one of the caterpillars had died. Note, the last day of observation was day 14, not day 11 which was the last day the caterpillars were weighed. As a result of this experiment, both the controll and experimental caterpillars had around the same change in weight. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that 8 drops of PreCore methoprene added to the Manduca sexta food would cause the caterpillars to increase in weight, was not supported. Our independent variable is the presence of the juvenile hormone in the food. Our dependent variable is weight of each caterpillar. There was no significent difference observed in our statistics, at the 0.05 level. Thus, this suggests that the presence of the insect growth regulator PreCore methoprene in the caterpillar food does not manipulate the change in weight in Manduca sexta. Our prediction was the addition of PreCore methoprene would mimic the effect of an increased amount of JH (without actually increasing the amount of JH). It can be suspected that the PreCore methoprene did not produce a similar effect to an increased amount of JH, allowing the Manduca sexta to continue growing at a normal rate, even if a commitment pulse was not evident. We were unable to determine, however, if the controll and experimental caterpillars had the same pattern of growth, as the data showed the weights decreasing and increasing at various rates. Furthermore, past investigations have found that the disappearance of JH initiates the Manduca sexta metamorphosis [Browder: 2001]. In other words, if the experiment were to be repeated with another solution that prevented the disappearance of JH, the caterpillar would not pupate till later. Understanding the Manduca sexta’s growth development can further our understanding of how the caterpillar grows. It can also inform farmers or those facing problems with Manduca sexta how to naturally inhibit their growth and get rid of the caterpillars all together.
