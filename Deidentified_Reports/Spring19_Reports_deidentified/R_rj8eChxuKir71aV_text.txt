Title: The Effect of Nitrogen Exposure on Energy Allocation in Pisum Sativum 

Abstract:
Efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer is paramount to agriculture because farmers want to maximize crop production and minimize risk to the environment. This experiment studies the effect of nitrogen on energy allocation in Pisum sativum (pea plants). The expectation was that the root/shoot ratio for plants watered with a nitrogen rich solution would be greater than the ratio for the control plants watered with H2O alone. We cultivated two groups of Pisum sativum, one watered with 50 mL of nitrogen solution and 50 mL of H2O and the other watered with 100 mL of H2O. After 2 weeks of growth we harvested the plants and separated them into roots and shoots, which we weighed and measured their lengths to get ratios for each group. The data supports the hypothesis that nitrogen fertilizer increases the root/shoot ratios of Pisum sativum. 

Introduction:
This experiment tests energy allocation disparity among Pisum sativum (garden pea) plants grown in a nitrogen-rich environment and those in a standard environment. Photosynthesis is linearly dependent on leaf N per unit area [Sage: 1987]. The more nitrogen absorbed by a plant, the more efficiently it can perform photosynthesis. The positive effects of nitrogen application to plants, particularly crops, are not infinite. This is apparent in the study of grain plants [Junye: 2006]. The authors of that study found that more than 150 kg/ha of nitrogen solution supplied to the plants could not increase the amount of nitrogen accumulation, and contributed to the slightly lesser effects on nitrogen uptake during the later growth stage of wheat. With the increase of the rate of nitrogen fertilizer, the proportion of nitrogen allocation to the grain was decreased, and the amount and proportion of nitrogen allocation to the stem and leaves were increased dramatically [Junye: 2006]. The hypothesis is that pea plants watered with nitrogen rich solution will have higher root/shoot ratios than plants watered with water alone because they will be encouraged to allocate more energy to develop strong roots in their resource rich environment.

Materials and Methods:
The treatment and control garden peas were planted in separate containers filled with soil, each stored in a greenhouse. The planters were watered once daily for two weeks, the treatment planter with 50 mL of nitrogen solution and 50 mL of H2O. The control planter was watered with 100 mL of H2O only. The plants were harvested after the two weeks and separated from the remaining soil by means of running water. The plant roots were cut off from the shoots just above the seed casing. The specimens, separated into treatment and control groups, were individually weighed and their lengths measured. This data was used to calculate the root/shoot ratios for both groups. The data was recorded into a computer with Excel, which was later used to perform a statistical two-tailed unpaired T-test with a .95 confidence interval to calculate the root/shoot ratios.

Results:
The root/shoot ratio for weight was higher in the treatment group (Figure 1). 
The observed mean for weight root/shoot ratios was 1.789 and the observed mean for length root/shoot ratios was 1.100. The root/shoot ratio for weight and length in the treatment group was statistically different than that of the nitrogen group. 
(t-stat=2.409, df=18, P=2.101)
The observed mean for weight root/shoot ratios was 0.917 and the observed mean for length root/shoot ratios was 0.702. The root/shoot ratio for weight and length in the control group was statistically different than that of the nitrogen group.
(t-stat=2.150, df=18, P=2.101)


Discussion:
The hypothesis that pea plants watered with a combination of water and the nitrogen solution will have greater root/shoot ratios was accepted. The root/shoot ratio for the weight of the treatment group was .872 more than the control group, and the root/shoot ratio for the length of the treatment group was .398 (Figure 1). While this experiment supported the hypothesis that moderate nitrogen supplementation in fertilizer is beneficial to plants, it did not address the effects of nitrogen overuse in fertilizers. Nitrogen overuse is not only detrimental to plants, but the runoff can be devastating to the local ecosystem: disrupting the chemical balance of the soil, effecting plant growth and moving into the water supply diminishing its quality [Lin: 2014]. A possible limitation may be that the peas were only allowed to grow for two weeks, possibly limiting the time too much for full resource allocation.
