Title: Examining the Effects of Azadirachtin on the Weight of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta has three hormones that are essential to development. One of those hormones are Ecdysterones or 20E, which regulates the timing of molting. In this study, we hypothesized that if a chemical was added that blocked 20E production, then the caterpillar would increase in weight because the caterpillar would not get the signal to stop eating and to begin molting to advance in the organism’s next life stage. After feeding a group of tobacco hornworms 10 grams of food with .25Ml of Azadirachtin added and another group 10 grams with .25Ml of water added, the average change of weight was found. The controll group had an average weight change of 2.54 g +/- 2.68 g and the experimental group had an average weight change of 2.11 g +/- 1.56. These results were not statistically significent with a p_value of .4. This suggests that the hypothesis tested was not supported by the experiment.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm, has three main hormones that are critical to development: prothoracicotropic or brain hormone (PTTH or BH), juvenile hormone (JH), and ecdysterones (20E). [Johnson: 2016]. This fact makes the tobacco hornworm a great organism to use in this experiment. Since there is only a couple of hormones that are key for development makes it easier to isolate one of these hormones and study them individually. This, along with the fact that multiple studies have been conducted on the Manduca sexta, means that this organism is a great model to utilize. Juvenile Hormone regulates some functions in adult Manduca sexta but is most notable for regulating the type of molting. [Johnson: 2016]. PTTH regulates the availability of Ecdysterones, which are used to regulate the timing of molting. [Johnson: 2016]. So, if 20E was delayed for any particular reason, the insect would molt later than its nonaffected counterparts. This is important for scientists creating insect growth regulators, or IGRs, which are supposed to controll pest populations by using certain natural chemicals to affect the hormones present in insect development. One study found that Azadirachtin is very powerful 20E blocker that can also negatively affect other organisms like a  nematode, like Romanomermis iyengari. [Suman: 2013]. This nematode is a mosquito parasite that feeds on mosquitos. This is important and notable to this study because this is an instance of an organism having a decreased length after just ingesting Azadirachtin, [Suman: 2013] which is closer to how our caterpillars are getting the chemical. Another study found that a certain amount of ecdysones will trigger an extreme loss of weight by the way of “cessation of feeding” and “gut-purging”. [Truman: 1974]. If that amount is never reached, then the caterpillars will never purge and lose that weight for molting and will continue to feed as if they are still preparing for the next stage of life. Given that, we hypothesized that if 20E blockers like Azadirachtin was added to the food supply of the Manduca sexta, then the weight would continue to increase. This should happen because the caterpillars with the 20E blocker will not get the signal to stop eating (and begin pupating) so they will continue to eat and gain weight.

Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, two sets of four Tobacco Hornworms were gathered and placed into separate plastic containers with four individual “condos” or compartments in each, so that each individual had their own space but was still apart of either the controll or experimental group. In each “condo” the hornworms in the experimental group received 10 grams of food each with 5 drops (or .25Ml) of Azadirachtin with a concentration of 1: 1250. The controll group received .25Ml of water added per 10 grams of food. Then for 8 days, each caterpillar was weighed around the same time of day to check how much weight they either gained or lost. Their food was replenished with the same treatment (5 drops of whatever liquid per 10 grams of food) and their compartments were cleaned as needed. Then we analyzed the average change of weight between the experimental and the controll group using the one-tailed two sample t_test.

Results:
Generally, the controll group had a livelier and healthier shade of green throughout the experiment and was more active when they were being handled than the experimental group. Meanwhile the caterpillars treated with Azadirachtin was slightly more yellow and more sluggish than the caterpillars just getting water added to the food. As you can see in Figure 1, over the eight days span, the average change in weight within the controll group was 2.54 +/- 2.64 grams. This is possible because one of the caterpillars grew significently more than the others in this group. The average change of weight for the experimental group was 2.11 +/- 1.56 grams. The degrees of freedom was 6 and the t-value was .28 which left our p_value to be .40. 

Discussion:
The statistics suggest that our results are not significent and that our hypothesis was not supported at all. This might be due to the limitations on the study. We only looked at 4 and we only observed the caterpillars for 8 days. This means for the data to be significent the difference in the weights would have to be large and uniform, neither of which they were in our studies. Since there was not enough data collected, the full effects of the Azadirachtin might not have been able to be fully realized in such a small sample. The 20E blocker might not have had the time to really produce the effect that other studies have suggested that they would. There were decreased infectivity and length only when Suman looked at a larger scope within the organisms’ life [Suman: 2013]. This seems to suggest that the Azadirachtin works better, biologically, if given enough time, especially when it is not injected. If we would have had a bigger sample, the experimental group might have gained more weight on average at the end of the study without molting. If it was carried out even longer, we might have been able to see the change of weight due to the “cessation of feeding and gut-purging” that Truman and Riddiford found in their study. [Truman: 1974]. They found that late in the fifth instar they will lose weight drastically due to the caterpillars wanting to pupate. This is signaled by two huge releases of prothoracicotropic hormone. [Truman: 1974]. So, this seems to suggest that if the Manduca was studied a bit longer, then a drop in weight would have been seen in the controll group as they were beginning to pupate. If the study could be done again, I would suggest a bigger and longer study to fully see what fully blocking 20E would do. This type of study is important because more information about IGRs that block 20E from being produced would help agricultural businesses from loss of profits due to pests eating all of their crops.
