Title: Effects of Nicotine on the Twitch Threshold of Frog legs

Abstract:
The neurovascular system in animals’ controlls their response to stimuli broadly through muscles and nerves. Often, animals other than humans are used to study how different factors can affect that controll and how fast it occurs. This data helps us learn more about our own muscle controll. A commonly studied frog contains many similarities to humans concerning muscles and nerves. Here we look at the effect of nicotine on the twitch threshold of three frog legs. Our expected result is if we inject the frog leg with nicotine, then the twitch threshold will be lower than that of the controll. Our data revealed that there was no statistically significent difference between the controll group and experimental group, supporting the null hypothesis. This suggests that nicotine does not actually lower the twitch threshold. With these results, we can conclude that more experiments need to be done to find out exactly what the effect of nicotine actually is on the body. It is important for us to study muscle and nerve controll because it can help lead to new discoveries that help find important cures to diseases.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow animals to respond to stimuli through the neurovascular system. They do this by using neurons. These neurons then send nerve impulses or waves of electrical and chemical activity through the body [How does the nervous system work?]. This then signals your body to respond to the stimuli. Frog legs are frequently studied to observe how different factors will affect the twitch threshold and amplitude of muscles and nerves because the muscles and nerves of frogs are similar to humans. Frog leg muscles have nerves and muscles that respond to stimuli similarly to humans. By learning more about frog muscles, or any type of animal’s muscles, we learn more about our own muscles. Outside substances such as nicotine can drastically affect animals muscle abilities. In order to measure this, scientists use electrophysiology recording equipment to manipulate, observe, and measure the twitches. Specifically, in the frog leg we will place the probe from the electrophysiology recording equipment underneath the sciatic nerve and controll the stimulus that is applied to the nerve. The sciatic nerve is composed of many nerve fibers and controlls some muscle controll [Johnson: 2016]. Our hypothesis is, if we inject the frog leg with nicotine, then the twitch threshold will be lower than that of the controll.

Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis, we dissected the three frog legs with access to gastrocnemus muscle. We inserted the probe from the electrophysiology recording equipment under the sciatic nerve in order to measure the twitch threshold at different stimulus levels for the controll. Then we injected 0.1 Ml of nicotine into the leg, making it the experimental. After waiting one minute, we will reset the twitch threshold (hundredths) and measure the amplitude at different stimulus. We repeated this procedure on the other two legs. The independent variable in our experiment was nicotine and the dependent variable was the twitch threshold. After collecting all the data from the three trials, we used the paired t_test to analyze our data and see if was statistically significent.

Results:
The average amplitude for our controll frog legs was 0.26mV (Fig. 1) and the average amplitude for our experimental frog legs was 0.156mV (Fig 1). The average amplitude for all of our results was 0.2mV. The standard deviation of the controll group was 0.09 and the standard deviation of the experimental group was 0.04. This is shown by error bars in Figure 1. We used the paired t_test to see if this data was statistically significent. Our p_value was 0.7, which tells us our data was not statistically significent and could just be due to chance.  Overall, we cannot say our data was significent due to our results not having a statistical p_value under 0.05. 

Discussion:
In this experiment, by using electrophysiology recording equipment we were able to measure the twitch threshold from under the sciatic nerve and find If our hypothesis was statistically significent. Our hypothesis was if we inject the frog leg with nicotine, then the twitch threshold will be lower than that of the controll. This hypothesis was rejected. We found that our data could just be due to chance because it did not statistically hold up, but in order to be sure we could conduct more trials since visible we can see that there was a small change. Although by just looking at the averages there was a difference, since it is not statistically supported, we have to look at other explanations. Specifically, the nicotine could not have a significent effect on muscles. It is also possible human error, such as the probe being placed in the wrong spot on the frog leg, could have skewed the results. In a study conducted on Rabbit Corpus Cavernosum, it was found that the effect of nicotine on the muscles and nerves was significent. The strips tests revealed that high concentrations of nicotine cause contraction [Nguyen: 2015]. This study goes to show that it is probable that in the procedure a human error was made, and our results did not correctly reflect the affect nicotine has on muscles. Another experiment worth considering after this is testing nicotine’s effects on the brain. A study in 2009 revealed that if nicotine was as prone to bind to the muscle as the brain, it would be deadly [Why Nicotine Prefers Brains Over Brawn]. Still, its effects on the brain are large and learning more about them could led to new discoveries. Overall, learning more about nicotine’s affects on different parts of the body will help us learn more about muscle and nerve controll.
