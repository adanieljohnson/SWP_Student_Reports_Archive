Title: Application of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor on Gastrocnemius Function of Anura 

Abstract:
Neurotransmitter communication across neuromuscular junctions are crucial to muscle stimulation and contraction characteristics. In this experiment, an isolated gastrocnemus muscle of Anura descent was injected with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and electrically stimulated. Within muscle contractile sequences, acetylcholinesterase serves to break down remaining acetylcholine at the synapse, prevent continuous signaling for contraction, and maintain homeostatic conditions. If this process were inhibited, then the length of time for the muscle contraction would also increase due to more acetylcholine at the synapse. The results from this experiment did not show significent correlation between controll and treatment groups, failing to support this claim. The overall number of trials and maintenance of experimental design could be revised to portray a more complete representation of the relationship and role of neurotransmitters at the neuromuscular junction.  

Introduction:
This experiment analyzes the role of acetylcholine (ACh) on muscle contraction time. Skeletal muscle systems breakdown into basic components that include motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions. At neuromuscular junctions, electrical signaling from action potentials generate stages of muscle tension. The stages are defined as latency, contraction, and relaxation [Johnson: 2018]. The rate and magnitude of muscle contraction can be influenced by extracellular conditions and the chemical environment. The primary neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, moves through the muscle fiber and binds to a receptor, where it signals the release of sodium channels and facilitates further action potentials [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, frog leg treatment subjects are injected with a 2% solution of sevin, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. The frog leg contractions for both treatment and controll groups are measured (milliseconds) and evaluated for their variability. As the contractions for the experimental trials proceed, the ACh inhibitor will prevent the breakdown of ACh, increasing the continued supply of ACh available to lengthen the time of contraction. I hypothesize that treatment frog legs injected with the 2% solution of sevin will maintain continuous and longer contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle. 

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were randoMly selected and initially assigned to controll group trials, later being used as treatment subjects. After carefully dissecting the frog legs and rinsing with frog ringerâ€™s solution, stable test conditions were maintained while connecting the sleeve electrodes to the isolated sciatic nerve. The sleeve electrodes were connected to a computer software that controllled the amplitude, pulse, and frequency of twitches. For all trials (controll and treatment), the amplitude was set at 0.6 volts, single pulse, and 10 hertz. Starting with controll trials for frog leg one, the electrodes delivered three isolated shocks and the software recorded wave features and measurements. After the controll trials, the gastrocnemus muscle was injected with a 2% solution of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, sevin. After a 5-minute lapse to allow for adequate absorption into the muscle, the shocks were delivered, and the twitch characteristics were recorded. This process was repeated for the remaining two legs. For statistical analysis, a paired t_test was used to determine and compare the means from the groups.

Results:
The experimental design consisted of three major tests, subdivided into three trials for both controll and experimental groups. The first test, frog leg one, was statistically significent (t-value =46 , d.f. = 2, P = 0.000472). The mean contraction time for the controll trials (leg 1) was 181.6 msec +- 7.638. The mean contraction time for the treatment trials (leg 1) was 335 msec +- 13.2. The second test, frog leg two, was not statistically significent (t-value =2.364 , d.f. = 2, P = 0.141872). The mean contraction time for the controll trials (leg 2) was 195 msec +- 5. The mean contraction time for the treatment trials (leg 2) was 238.3 msec +- 32.15. The final test, frog leg three, was not statistically significent (t-value =3.4 , d.f. = 2, P = 0.076687). The mean contraction time for the controll trials (leg 3) was 175 msec +- 10. The mean contraction time for the treatment trials (leg 3) was 203.3 msec +- 7.638. In addition to running paired t tests for each major trials, the averages from each group were tested for statistical significance and shown insignificent (t-value=1.902765, d.f.=3, P=0.197404). Figure one displays the average contraction times for both groups in each leg. The average controll contractions from each leg are shorter than the treatment groups. The standard deviations from each group are represented with error bars. The data was synthesized and distributed using a paired t_test.  

Discussion:
The results from this experiment do not clearly depict a correlation between acetylcholinesterase inhibitor application and length of muscle contraction. Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyses and deactivates acetylcholine, maintaining ideal concentrations of transmitter at the synapse [Seidman: 2001]. The 2% solution of sevin utilized in the treatment trials sought to alter the concentrative conditions at the synapse and increase the duration of twitch activation. The results from this experiment do not support my hypothesis that treatment legs injected with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor would sustain longer contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle. The data collected and analyzed with paired t testing did not show significent differences in length of time between controll and experimental groups. In regard to potential explanations for these findings, the experimental design could be altered to alleviate external influences and statistical errors. In further studies, experimenters could utilize a greater amount of frog legs and trials to gain a better assessment of the independent variables affect, if any. Additionally, the time lapse between ACh inhibitor injection and trial testing could be more carefully regulated or manipulated. This experiment demontrated the statistical relationship between ACh inhibitors and the time (milliseconds) of contractions.
