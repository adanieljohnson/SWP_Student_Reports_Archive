Title: The Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibition on the Growth and Pupation of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
 Manduca sexta use hormones to regulate important bodily functions such as pupation. If an experimental group of Manduca sexta is given an ecdysterone inhibitor, they will grow at a normal rate but will not pupate due to the absence of the commitment pulse that signifies that they are ready to carry out pupation. Pupation is a process in which the Manduca sexta change from a caterpillar into a moth. The experiment was conducted through the use of a controll and experimental group and careful observation of weight (in grams) and length (in millimeters). It was found that both the controll and experimental groups experienced an increase in size, but the experimental groups increase was significently higher in comparison to the controll group. Neither the controll or experimental Manduca sexta pupated. The initial hypothesis was rejected by the statistical results.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, commonly known as tobacco-hornworms, use hormones to regulate bodily functions and aid them throughout their lifespan. Insect growth regulators (IGRs), either over activate or stop processes regulated by Juvenile Hormone (JH), Ecdysteroids (20E), Prothoracicotropic hormones (PTTH) and other hormones. These hormones can be either natural of synthetically developed, and they can affect reproduction and development [Hoffmann: 1998]. Ecdysteroid inhibitors play an important role in the survival of the Manduca sexta and can lead to abnormalities because they alter normal processes that are needed for normal development. During the fifth larval instar, ecdysterone is released as a small rise known as the commitment pulse. The commitment pulse signals that the Manduca sexta have acquired enough nutrients to go through pupation [Tunaz:2004]. It is hypothesized that if ecdysterone is kept consistently low through the use of an ecdysterone inhibitor known as Azaguard, the Manduca sexta will grow at a normal rate but will not pupate.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta were divided into two groups of four each; one group experimental and the other group controll. Each group was placed into separate containers and each Manduca sexta into a different container section. Holes were poked in the sides of the containers to allow respiration. The controll group was fed a diet that consisted of ten grams of Manduca sexta food with ten drops of water. The experimental group was fed a diet that consisted of ten grams of Manduca sexta food plus ten drops of the ecdysteroid inhibitor. Initial height (in millimeters) and weight (in grams) measurements of the Manduca sexta on day one of the experiment were collected and collection continued to measure height and weight for a period of two weeks, making sure to check their food levels each day to discern whether food replacement is necessary. Food replacement is needed when the food is gone or when the food is too dry. The Manduca sexta were stored in an incubator set at 25°C on a twelve-hour light and twelve-hour dark cycle. When the two weeks were over, recorded data was used to execute a statistical test, the two-sample t_test, to analyze the significance of the experiment. 

Results:
Throughout the duration of the experiment, the Manduca sexta in the experimental group continued to grow and be larger than the Manduca sexta in the controll group, which grew, but stayed relatively small in comparison to those of the experimental group. One Manduca sexta in the controll group was an exception to the general trend because it decreased in size until death. No Manduca sexta pupated, neither in the controll group nor the experimental group. The experimental Manduca sexta grew significently more than the controll group in terms of weight (t_stat = 4.8192, d.f. = 28, P = 2.27x10-5). The experimental group also grew significently larger in terms of height (t_stat = 3.8920, d.f. = 28, P = 0.000280). To summarize, both the controll and the experimental groups of Manduca sexta showed an increase in both weight and length, but the increase in weight and length for the experimental group was significently higher. Figures 1 and 2 both show the mean weight and mean height throughout the course of the experiment. Figure 1 shows that the mean weights for the controll Manduca sexta were significently less than those of the experimental Manduca sexta. Figure 2 shows that the mean lengths for the controll group were significently less than that of the experimental group.

Discussion:
The hypothesis says that if ecdysterone is kept consistently low, by the use of an ecdysterone inhibitor, the Manduca sexta will develop normally, but it will not pupate. The hypothesis was rejected based on the statistical results of the experiment, because they showed that the data was significent. Both the controll and experimental groups made it to the fifth instar larva stage, but none ever reached a pupation. The experimental group grew significently larger because the ecdysterone inhibitor blocked the commitment pulse, therefore, the Manduca sexta never recognized the need to stop the production of Juvenile Hormone. This is an example of how hormones inhibitors can change the development of targeted insects. [Hoffmann: 1998] It is important to note that neither group pupated, but that may be due to an insufficient amount of time in the experiment’s length or environmental factors (isolated and stored with other insect groups on top of them). The method worked well for the experiment because the controll group and experimental group were easily kept track of and observed, and the experiment was deemed successful based on the collection of good data. As mentioned in the results, one Manduca sexta in the controll group shrunk and died, possibly due to disease or environmental conditions. One addition to improve the experiment in the future is changing the food and cleaning out the Manduca sexta wastes daily so it will be done steadily for every caterpillar. Future studies could be completed about the effects of other hormones in the Manduca sexta, such as Juvenile Hormone or Prothoracicotropic Hormone and how they affect the normal physiological functions in them. [Tunaz:2004] This study is important because it could lead to new discoveries or ideas that could aid in human hormone regulation. For example, if a hormone inhibitor was beneficial to an animals health, it could possibly be determined that similar inhibitors may be beneficial to the health of humans.
