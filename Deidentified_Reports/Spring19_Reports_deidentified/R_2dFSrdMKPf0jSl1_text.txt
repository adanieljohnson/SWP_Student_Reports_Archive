Title: The Addition of Red Dye to the Water Does Not Increase Aggressive Behavior in Betta splendens.

Abstract:
 In this experiment, our group observed how the amount of aggressive behavior a Betta splendens, or Betta fish displays changes due to environmental factors. While there are many environmental factors that have been proven to effect behavior, the aspect our group decided to look at was the color of the water in the tank. We decided to choose this because the betta fish rely on sight to identify the other betta fish, which then leads to the aggressive behaviors. This change in water was done by adding red dye to one tank. Fish were exposed to each other in the dyed water for five minutes and then switched tanks to the water without dye in it and exposed for five minutes. During this time the number of aggressive behaviors were counted to determine if there was an increase in aggressive behaviors of the fish exposed to dye. The results of the paired t-test between the fish when tested in normal water and dyed water was not significant, and because of this, we could not support our hypothesis that the betta fish would display more aggressive behavior when exposed to water dyed red. 

Introduction:
Betta fish, such as other organisms must compete for resources in order to survive and must allocate energy into gathering these resources, along with protecting themselves. Male betta fish display aggressive behaviors to other male betta fish in an effort to avoid actual conflict while still protecting their resources. Male betta fish display many behaviors such as tail flashing, tail beating, and releasing their red mane to display their aggression. To avoid exhaustion, betta fish have evolved to only demonstrate these behaviors in the presence of other betta fish (usually males, however, due to breeding of brightly colored betta fish, females can be mistaken for males and cause aggressive behavior in other betta fish.) [Johnson:1973]. Betta fish recognize other betta fish by using their sense of sight. We were interested in the use of dye because the colors of the dye could change the way betta fish perceive information with their sense of sight and it may affect their ability to distinguish between betta fish and non-betta fish [Lattal:1994]. These fish would only attack non-betta fish if threatened by another species, however, because there is no competition for resources between betta fish and other fish, intra-species conflict is a lot more rare than inter-species conflict, due to this competition for limited resources [Johnson:1973].  In a study by Sturm and Thompson, Betta fish were exposed to different color lighting in their water, mirroring the effect of dye. The result of this study was that the fish responded the least to the color light that was most similar to the color of the betta fish. For example, red betta fish would show less aggressive behaviors when exposed to red lighting [Sturm:1965]. We only used one red fish in our study, so for the scope of our experiment, or group believed that the fish would have heightened aggression when exposed to other fish in the dyed water. 

Materials and Methods:
First we gathered 6 male betta fish and got two fish tanks, which were divided into three sections using opaque and transparent dividers. One tank was filled with six drops of dye in each compartment and the other was just filled with water. Each betta fish is exposed to another betta fish (Fish 2 was compared to fish 3 and fish 4 was compared to fish 5. Fish 1 was removed from the testing because of its exposure to dye for too long). The fish were then exposed to each other visually by removing the opaque dividers in the tanks for five minutes for both the control and experimental treatments. The fish were exposed to each other for five minutes and then rested for at least five minutes to prevent exhaustion. During the five-minute interactions between the fish, each fish was observed for pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, erect dorsal and anal fins, spreading of gill cover, and protruding of the red mane. Then the number of total aggressive behaviors is measured using a paired t- test. 

Results:
the measure of the averages for the aggressive behaviors of the control group were 17.5±6.57 (fig.1) and for the experimental group the average number of aggressive behaviors was 27±29.36 (fig.1). The result of the t-test are (p=.48, t=.80, df=3)

Discussion:
: Because our p-value for our t-test was above the critical value of 0.05, we could not accept the hypothesis that the red dye would increase the aggressive behavior of the betta fish. This is mainly due to the drastic change in aggressive behavior of fish 2 and fish 3 in comparison to fish 4 and fish 5. This likely results from the different colors of the fish. Fish 4 and 5 were both a dark blue and because of this, their details were very hard to see when dye was present in the water. Because the fish were hard to distinguish as other male betta fish, the fish didn’t show as many aggressive behaviors as when exposed to each other in ordinary water. Fish 3 was yellow and fish 2 was red. These fish seemed to have their colors enhanced because there was increased interaction between the fish [Sturm:1965]. For future experiments it would be interesting to see how other color dye affects perception of different colored fish and potentially see if males react differently to females if they are in dyed water. Another possibility would be to see if Also, as researchers, we would use more fish for samples to get more representative data of the whole population the next experiment that we do. The data obtained from this experiment carries scientific importance because, while our hypothesis wasn’t supported, there was clearly a drastic change for a few of the fish due to the color change, whether it was an increase or decrease.
