Title: The Effects of Alcohol on the Contractile Strength of Raina pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
The immediate effect of ethanol is tested on dead and dissected Raina pipiens frog legs. Many studies have looked into the chronic effects of alcohol on muscles and the nervous system, but little research exists on the acute effects of ethanol on muscle contraction and by association, strength of contraction. Analysis of three separate frog leg exams is done by measuring their contractile strength in mV before and after treatment with 0.2 mL of ethanol. The means of three legs pre and post treatment are taken (Leg #1: 0.18375, 0.600875. Leg #2: 0.1755, 0.31175. Leg #3: 0.3065, 0.202625) and used in a paired t-test to determine any possible statistical difference. It is determined with a p-value of 0.42 that there is no significant difference between legs with ethanol and those without. Further research should be conducted into variables such as gender and ethanol concentrations on the effects of the muscle and whether the physiological effects are on the muscle, neuromuscular junction or the nerve. 

Introduction:
Muscles in the body function through direct stimulation of nerves. Understanding how this information is sent, received and executed is imperative to understanding anything further on muscles. The gastrocnemius muscle of a frog works as a fantastic case study of analysis of muscle function, because it is a highly specialized muscle in the frog, which is analogous to muscles in many other animals [Johnson: 2018]. It also has the benefit of being easily isolatable in a dissection [Johnson: 2018]. Muscles function by responding to action potentials that travel down from the brain. At the neuromuscular junction, a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine diffuses to the muscle endplate and activates contraction [Johnson: 2018] Through direct stimulation of the sciatic nerve the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog can be stimulated, and its response analyzed. Equally as important is the effect of different substances on a muscle’s ability to perform its job. Alcohol for example, is a common substance in today’s society and it is important to understand its effect on muscles to better understand its effect on society. Alcohol is often seen as a depressant, and thus it would be assumed that it slows down the response and inhibit muscle function. Although it is known as a depressant because of its psychological effect, alcohol’s physiological effects are actually quite different. Ethanol has been shown in studies to actually increase muscle reaction [Knutsson: 1961]. This however, does not speak to the strength of the contractions. While muscle has shown to contract more quickly in the presence of ethanol, there is not a lot of information on the strength of these contractions. This experiment, then, tests the follow hypothesis: the introduction of alcohol into the gastrocnemius muscle of a Raina pipiens frog leg will increase the ability of the muscle to contract as strongly as if it did not have any alcohol. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, three different frog legs were used on at a time. The frog legs were dissected so the sciatic nerve was exposed, and the gastrocnemius isolated by cutting the Achilles tendon’s attachment to bone. While one leg was being analyzed the others were kept moist with frog ringer’s solution every ten minutes. A string was tied first around the Achilles tendon and then to the measurement apparatus so that the muscle was held up at a 90º angle relative to the table. The threshold of the muscle, 0.5 amps, was used as the stimulus for the muscles and this remained constant throughout the experiment. The muscle was stimulated a total of eight times, and its activity recorded. The muscle was then injected with 0.2 mL of ethanol distributed evenly along the length of the muscle by injecting at four different sites on the muscle. The leg was left to sit for eight minutes so that the substances could take effect. The leg was then stimulated the same way the same amount of times and the reactions were again recorded. The amplitude was used to determine whether the legs performed differently with and without the substance. After administrating ethanol, the fine adjustment knob of the apparatus was used for the tension in the string to be the same as before. This was done rather informally, but the amount required held constant at about 2 and a half turns clockwise for each leg. At the end of the experiment, the legs were disposed of and the amplitudes collected pre and post treatment were averaged per leg and analyzed using a paired t-test. 

Results:
All three legs remained active throughout the experiment and did not show any signs of exhaustion, such as a marked decrease in response strength over time or a myogram that began to plateau. As can be seen from the data in figure 1, while leg #1 improved significantly with the ethanol treatment, leg #2 only improved slightly and leg #3 in fact got worse. Further, leg #3 was so consistent with its responses that its standard error is very small. All three legs were approximately the same size and could be seen moving when the sciatic nerve was stimulated. Interestingly, we observed that when the frog leg was dissected, its ‘jumpiness’ was a good indicator of how large its responses would be when tested with the formal stimulus. Statistical testing through a paired t-test determined that the difference between the amplitudes before treatment with alcohol were not significantly different than those after treatment (t-stat = 1, df = 2, P = 0.42). 

Discussion:
Discussion These results show that the immediate effects of alcohol on the muscle do not include muscle weakness. Although the early results looked promising, statistical testing determined that there was no significant difference, and thus our hypothesis that alcohol would make the muscle’s contraction smaller was disproven. Previous studies have spoken to alcohol as an ion channel inhibitor [Rubin: 1975][Marquez: 2004], and so it seems that this only takes place at the neuromuscular junction and the neuron. Because the neuron was not tested in this experiment, it remains unclear if it is a primary factor in the acute effects of alcohol. This should be further studied in order to better pinpoint the cause of ethanol’s effects on muscle. Further, gender’s role on the effects should be extensively studied. It is well known that biological males and females have very different tolerances to alcohol because of different anatomies [Henriette: 2005], and so it should be studied whether ethanol’s effects are more severe or not present in one gender or the other. Such an experiment would involve both a female and male set of legs, in which both are treated with the same amount of alcohol. Designed to test the effects of alcohol on muscle in different gender, this experiment would have an alternative hypothesis in which the two muscle groups perform Differently. It is possible that the reason two of the legs Improved and the other did not was because of gender differences, and this must be tested as it was a variable not controlled for in this experiment. A potential source of error could be the failure to maintain the frog legs moist with frog ringer’s solution. This could be detrimental to the study’s result since some frog’s might have performed better simply because they were better maintained. In conclusion, this experiment demonstrates a need for significantly more research in the area.
