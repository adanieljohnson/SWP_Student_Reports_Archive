Title: The Effect of Ecdysterone Inhibitors on the Pupation of the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta regulates its development through the use of hormones that control the growth of the organism. We measured the effect that the insect growth regulator ecdysterone has when it is added to the food of the Manduca Sexta. We hypothesized that if the ecdysterone is kept constantly low, then the Manduca Sexta will develop at a normal rate, but will not pupate. To test this, the insects were divided into control and experimental groups, and their length and weight was measured everyday over a fourteen-day period. The experimental group grew exponentially, while the control group showed an average, steady growth. A two sample T test was used to measure the significance of the data. Our hypothesis was supported because the pupation stage was never reached, thus proving that the ecdysterone inhibitor caused the inability of the hormones to reach the commitment pulse.

Introduction:
 The Manduca Sexta, commonly known as tobacco hornworm, use hormones as a method to regulate processes that occur within various body systems. The purpose of this lab was to determine the effect that insect growth regulators (IGRs) have on the physiological regulatory development that is vital for the development of the insect. These IGRs such as Prothoracicotropic, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone, can lead to abnormalities that reduce the chances of survival by blocking or overacting the hormones. [Tunaz: 2004] It has been found that the inhibition of certain hormones can lead to swelling in certain regions, cuticular lesions, the body wall rupturing, and death. [Hughes 1989] In this experiment, an ecdysterone inhibitor was used to determine the effects it had on the growth and pupation of the Manduca Sexta. Our hypothesis is that if the ecdysterone is kept constantly low, then the insect will develop at a normal rate, but will not pupate. We speculate that the pupation will not occur because the commitment point will not be reached, due to the inhibition of the ecdysterone. This information will show how ecdysterone inhibitors affect these insects as well as how certain hormones aide or hinder their development. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out this experiment eight Manduca Sexta of relatively the same size and age we obtained and divided into two groups of four. The tobacco hornworms were then place in separate containers and two holes were poked in the side to supply adequate air flow. The control group was feed ten grams each with ten drops of water. The experimental group was feed ten grams of food with ten drops of the ecdysterone inhibitor. Each insect was weighed and had their length measured in order to obtain starting data. They were then kept in an incubator at 28°c in a twelve-hour dark and twelve-hour light cycle. Measure the Manduca Sexta’s length and weight every day for a total of fourteen days and replace the food and clean out the containers as needed. On the fifteenth day place all of the recorded data into an excel spreadsheet to find the results for the two sample T test, in order to determine if the data is significant.


Results:
Throughout the course of the experiment we found that the control group of Manduca Sexta continued to who grow but remained relatively small in comparison to the experimental group. The exception to this was insect number one in the control, which decreased in size, and ultimately died. The experimental group displayed exponential growth, as seen in figure 2 and 3, particularly insect number two which swelled in size and turned a light green color. This swelling also occurred in insect number one, but it remained a light blue color. We also observed that within the last four days of the experiment the amount of feces in the container decreased. We used the two sample T test and found the P value for length to be 0.00028 and the P value for weight to be 2.27E-5

Discussion:
The hypothesis that if the ecdysterone is kept constantly low, then the Manduca Sexta will develop at a normal rate but will not pupate was proven to be true. The null hypothesis was rejected because the alternative hypothesis was accurate. The increase in size in the experimental group was because the ecdysterone inhibitor potentially caused the receptors to have an inability to connect to the hormone that regulates the negative feedback to the commitment pulse. The experimental group showed dramatic swelling particularly in insect one and two, this has to do with the effect of hormonal control on the insect’s body walls. [Hughes: 1989] Both the control and experimental groups made it to the fifth instar larva stage, but never reached the pupa stage. This may due to certain environmental circumstance because they were kept in isolation and were stored with other insects above them. The death of insect number one of the control group may have been caused by a genetic disorder or an environmental factor that caused it to not thrive. For future studies the recommended suggestion is that the insects should not be placed on top of one another and that the containers be cleaned daily as well as the food be replenished. The P values for both the length and weight represent that our data was significant because it was below 0.05.

Figure 1, This graph depicts the average weight in grams of both the control and experimental groups. The control group is represented by the blue line, the experimental by the orange line, and the black markers represent the standard deviation. The average weight for the control group peaked on the second day at a high of 2.5 grams, while the average weight of the experimental group peaked on day six at 5.4 grams.

The control group is represented by the blue line, the experimental by the orange line, and the black markers represent the standard deviation. The average length for the control group peaked on the third day at a high of 48.75 millimeters, while the average length of the experimental group peaked on day six at 62.25 millimeters.
