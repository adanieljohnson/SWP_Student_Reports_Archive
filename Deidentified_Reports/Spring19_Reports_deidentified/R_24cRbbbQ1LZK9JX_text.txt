Title: The Increase in Aggressive Behavior of Betta splendens as Habitat Space Decreases

Abstract:
In order to survive animals must have access to resources. Many will compete amongst themselves and other animals for control of these limited resources. The selection of a mates is also frequently accompanied by competition. Animals will utilize agonistic behaviors and will display signs of aggression in order to ward off opponents of these resources. Betta splendens, or Siamese Fighting fish, have several agonistic behaviors used to ward off opponents. They utilize these displays to ward off opponents from their territory or from potential mates. In smaller areas, where resources are more limited animals have been shown to increase aggressiveness. We hypothesized that in decreasing tank sizes betta fish aggressiveness would increase. To test this, pairs of betta fish were placed in small, medium, and large tank sizes and the amount of aggressive behaviors displayed in one minute intervals were quantified. The results of this experiment were not significant but followed that same trend. The data of this experiment is valuable information to consider in the future as habitat loss continues due to human activity and ultimately animals are being forced to compete for smaller territories more. 

Introduction:
The ability to access necessary resources is a strong selection factor and is important for the survival animals. The access to these resources and later protection of them is usually accomplished by aggressiveness or agonistic behavioral displays. The evidence for this behavior in animals was noticed early by Darwin who said that functionally, aggression can be viewed as an expression of competition. [Darwin: 1859]. This idea was also further by the observation of aggressiveness in sexual competition that also exists among animals, and explains why aggressiveness is common during territorial defenses, especially during breeding [Tubert: 2012]. Betta splendens, also known as Siamese Fighting fish, are known to be an aggressive species of fish that will compete ferociously for territory and mates. They do this by displaying a variety of intraspecific and easily noticeable agonistic behaviors, which also makes them useful for observational studies [Johnson: 2018]. These agonistic behaviors are frequently used to ward off opponents from similar territory or to scare away other males. This has also been supported by the idea that when organisms compete for resources that can be easily controlled, and are distributed in small areas the potential benefits of displaying aggressive behaviors are high [Isabel: 1991].  This experiment is of importance to conservation biology as humans continue to cause habitat fragmentation and landscape modification, both which are seen as treats to global biodiversity [Fischer:2007]. Understanding how animals interacting with each other in habitats of decreasing size is important to comprehending future inter and intraspecific interactions. Thus, we hypothesize that males will be more aggressive when together in a smaller tank than in a large tank, as they compete for control of resources in a smaller area, and thus display a larger number of aggressive behaviors.

Materials and Methods:
First, 6 male betta fish were obtained and each was placed in two tanks, separated into 3rds by opaque sliders. The opaque sliders must be in place to prevent the fish from seeing each other before needed. Next, another large fish tank (test tank) was separated into 3rds by two opaque sliders. Once prepared, two male bettas were randomly selected and placed into the middle 3rd of the test tank (small environment), leaving the outer 2/3rds empty. All aggressive behaviors were counted for one minute. After the minute, the fish were separated and were allowed to rest for two minutes. After the rest, using the same fish, one fish was placed in the middle 3rd of the test tank and the other fish placed in one of the outer 3rd, leaving one 3rd empty. The opaque divider was lifted and aggressive behaviors were counted for one minute in the medium environment. After the minute period, the fish were separated and allowed to rest for 2 mins. Finally, after the rest period, using the same fish, one was placed in one outer 3rd of the test tank, and the other fish in the other outer 3rd. Aggressive behaviors were then counted for one minute when both dividers were lifted creating the large environment. Once finished, the fish were separated. The procedure describe above was then repeated with two other sets of randomly paired betta fish, except for the second group, the tank sizes were measured in medium, to large, to small. For the 3rd group the tank sizes for the experiment were recorded in the large tank first, then to medium, then to small. An ANOVA test and the 95% confidence interval was then performed on the recorded data to determine statistical significance of the data

Quantifying aggressive behaviors:
The Bettas display two main types of agonistic behaviors: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are displayed when a fish turns its side to an opponent. This includes pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements are more aggressive and describe the behavior of when a fish directly looks at its opponent head-on. This can include erecting the pectoral fins, spreading of gill covers, and protruding brachiostegal membranes. To quantify aggressiveness, a tally was taken of each time any of the above behaviors were displayed in each one minute period. Care was taken to ensure that if at any point the fish made aggressive contact with each other the trial was ended.

Results:
Overall, the number of aggressive behaviors displayed in the small tank (42.0+/- 18.5) was greater than that displayed in both the medium tank (20.0+/-11.5) and large tank (12.3+/-3.5). Notably, as shown before, the number of aggressive behaviors counted in the medium tank was also greater than that of the large tank. The results of the experiment were not significant at the 95% confidence interval. (p-value=0.086, df=2, F=3.795)

Discussion:
Overall, the data recorded followed the trend hypothesized but was not significant. The average number of aggressive behaviors in the small tank was greater than the number of aggressive behaviors counted in the large and medium tanks. Furthermore, the amount of aggressive behaviors counted in the medium tank was also greater than that counted in the large tank. This trend, that showed greater number of aggressive behaviors as tank size decreased, was expected as the fish confined in smaller spaces, with less resources will compete more to obtain control of the limited resources present. The results of the experiment also supported the previous studies of agonistic behaviors explaining that aggressiveness is more likely when an individual organism has the potential to control a small area of resources [Isabel: 1991]. A possible explanation for the significance of the results may be explained by the “dear enemy” effect, which explains that the familiarity of an opponent is often accompanied by a reduction in aggression [Temeles:1994]. Due to this effect, future studies should explore the possibility of having random fish interactions for each trial. Furthermore, the significance of the experiment was not far from the 95% confidence interval and future experiments may just need more trials to possibly observe a more profound effect. Despite this, he results of this experiment are still valuable because it allows for better understanding of how behaviors will impact completion of smaller spaces and habit loss continues worldwide. Humans continue to significantly contribute to habitat fragmentation and landscape modification both which decrease the habitats of other animals [Fischer:2007]. Therefore, understanding the behaviors of animals in more confined spaces is valuable to science and beneficial to understanding how these behaviors can affect population sizes and biodiversity in the future.
