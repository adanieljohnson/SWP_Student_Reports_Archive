Title: The effects of ecdysterone inhibitor in Manduca sexta larvae

Abstract:
Hormones are used to coordinate the function of biological processes within organisms. In the Manduca sexta, different hormones, including ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, controll the growth of the larvae until the pupation process. Ecdysterone (20E) focuses on timing of the molt process when leading up to pupation. If 20E is manipulated by an external stimulus that inhibits the production of ecdysterone in the Manduca Sexta, then the molting process will be delayed in the experimental group. Weight (g) changes were monitored and recorded for 14 days as part of the measurement variable. After determining the p_value to be not of significance through a two-sample t_test, it cannot be determined that the changes in weight in the experimental group didn’t happen by coincidence. However, it was observed that the controll larvae did reach pupation, while the experimental larvae failed to gain much weight. Understanding this experiment can help scientists understand how hormone production affects growth and development within organisms.

Introduction:
Hormones are typically defined as a chemical molecule that is secreted to coordinate the function of another biological process. In the Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta, the process of insect molting that leads into metamorphosis are influenced by ecydsteroids and juvenile hormone (JH) [Riddiford: 2003]3. This means that hormones affect the organism’s development by either promoting progression or causing regression. Why is it important to understand hormone function? Are hormones necessary for the development of healthy life? Can hormone manipulation cause abnormalities? The central role of the ecdysteriods within the Manduca sexta, primarily 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), is to initiate and coordinate the larval molts and metamorphosis [Fujiwara: 1995]2. This metamorphosis is important, as the insect is considered a pest to tomato crops as larvae. The metamorphosis of Manduca sexta is the transition of a larvae to a pupate, which then leads to the creation of a moth. 20E affects the timing of this metamorphosis, specifically between the larvae and pupation stage. The commitment pulse, a spike in 20E that declares the organism has enough resources to begin pupating, is sent out right before the 5th larval stage. If 20E is manipulated by an external stimuli that inhibits the production of it in the Manduca sexta, then the molting process will be delayed in the experimental larvae.

Materials and Method:
There were a total of 8 4th instar-larvae used in the experiment. Four were placed into a controll group, while the other four were used for experimentation. The larvae were kept in plastic containers for 14 days that was placed inside an incubator. During these 14 days, the larvae were weighed (in grams) and fed. Food was replaced when the supply was consumed. For the controll group, we fed them 10g caterpillar food with 10 drops of water mixed in. For the experimental group, we fed them 10g caterpillar food with 10 drops of Aza-guard, an 20E inhibitor, at a 1: 1250 concentration. For statistical purposes, we used a two-sample T-test and calculated the average rate of change for each group. Using this averaged rate of change, we were able to perform the t_test and receive a p_value. This p_value was measured at the 95% confidence, with results being less than 0.05 having significance.

Results:
At the 95% confidence and a one-tailed p_value, p is equal to 0.0681. This means that the alternate hypothesis is rejected. Represented in Figure 1 is the growth of the larvae overtime. As seen here, there is a visible increase trend between both groups, but then at about the 8th day, some larvae fluctuated. C4 went through a steady decline, while C2 weight’s fluctuated the whole time. When looking at day 8 for the experimentals, E3 dropped in weight and E4 gained weight. However, their roles switched on day 9, to where E3 gained weight and E4 dropped. All of the experimentals died by the eleventh day. 

Discussion:

Since the results were not shown to be significent, it cannot be suggested that ecdysterone inhibitor has an effect on the timing of the molting process. This also means that it cannot be shown that coincidence played as a factor within the experiment. Referring back to the hypothesis, the manipulation of 20E did cause change in development, but it cannot be confirmed whether or not if it delayed the molting process. When examining the results at the end of the experiment, all of the experimental larvae failed to continuously gain weight when given the 20E in their diet. However, there could be error through food processing, as some food could’ve dried out, causing the larvae to not eat it. Manipulating 20E enables scientists to study the growth process of the caterpillar by monitoring how much and at what time the hormone must be administered to maintain homeostasis. The central role of the ecdysteriods, primarily 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), is to initiate and coordinate the larval molts and metamorphosis [Fujiwara: 1995]2.  The study of hormones also enables scientists to learn about other biological processes, and their benefits that could possibly pose to modern medicine.  In one experiment, food limitation also caused changes in immune system gene expression, the activity of key immune enzymes, the concentration of a major antioxidant (glutathione), resistance to oxidative stress, and resistance to bacteria (Gram positive and negative bacteria) [Adamo: 2016]1. Understanding how the larvae altered their own gene expression would provide future biologists application for those skills in human physiology. Biologists could also repeat this experiment, and potentially receive better results by using a larger sample size to better represent the population. The ecdysterone inhibitor itself can be switched to a different product, which would provide a comparison on which pesticide manipulates hormone production the most. Hormone production is an important factor in determining the growth and development of organisms. Being able to understand this production can enable scientists to create better medicines, learn new biological processes, and create new products that can benefit the consumer world.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 – This represents the growth of the larvae over the course of 14 days, with the first day being marked as ‘1’ and the last being marked as ’15.’ Markers named with ‘C’ represent the controlls, and markers named with ‘E’ represent the experimentals. This confirms that the experimentals lacked to gain weight when given the 20E inhibitor.*************************************************************************
