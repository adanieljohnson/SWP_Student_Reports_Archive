Title: Effects of increased temperature on isolated chloroplast activity in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Climate change and global warming continue to cause temperatures to rise on a global scale. As temperatures rise, they have varying affects on crops that are in common circulation. The effects of increasing temperatures was measured on chloroplasts in spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves. These measurements were taken by first creating a liquified solution then separating the chloroplasts in solution using a centrifuge so that they would be isolated in order to increase testable data. An assay was run on four different groups with no chloroplasts, and then with chloroplasts at room temperature, 30°C, and 45°C. These temperatures were achieved using hot water baths but simulate an increased temperature of the air while the sun was simulated using an incandescent light source. From the data collected, the supposition that a lower absorbance would be read for temperatures greater than room temperature and less than 45°C was not supported. Temperatures of 45°C showed an increase in absorbance rather than a decrease as predicted. 

Introduction:
Heat stress (HS) temperatures, temperatures categorized as greater than the global optimum, can lead to growth issues in plants which can effect crop yields. This is because the normal homeostasis of the cells is disturbed as the temperature rises [Mathur:2014]. This temperature stress will continue to increase as the global climate fails to adequately adapt to climate change. Much of plant growth is associated with photosynthesis, the process in which they draw their energy from light photons. This process occurs in light and in dark through two separate processes, Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI). In PSII a light capturing enzyme breaks apart water and light photons into electrons, this then begins the process of PSI. PSI completes its cycle then restarts the entire process which happens simultaneously as light photons are collected. PSII is highly dependent on regulated temperature to maintain its function. It is particularly susceptible to thermosensitivity because higher temperatures can lead to increased fluidity within chloroplast membranes, specifically within the thykaloid [Mathur:2014]. Plants, such as Spinacia oleracea (common spinach), respond to increased temperatures by increasing photooxidation while decreasing the rate of carbon dioxide consumption, this can potentially lead to excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS can be in the form of harmful hydrogen peroxide despite mechanisms to detoxify the cell [Chen:2012]. S. oleracea was chosen for this experiment due to its widespread use as a crop in North America and its widespread availability and deep green color. Because S. oleracea is a cold-tolerant plant, it has been used repeatedly in studies related to temperature change [Boese:1990]. For this study we will show how being a col-resistant plant does not transfer to heat-resistance and the effects that this could mean for other crops on a global scale as temperature continue to rise. As temperature is increased from room temperature of approximately 24°C to 45°C we expect to observe a lower absorbance at room temperature when compared to the absorbances from samples kept at 30°C and to those of samples kept at 45°C.

Materials and Methods:
The procedure was started by collecting the following items and placing them on ice to cool: ceramic mortar and pestle, a 150 - 250 mL beaker, and 3 50 mL centrifuge tubes. While these cooled, six medium-sized spinach leaves were acquired, and the large veins were removed from them. The veins were thrown away and then the leaves were rinsed with tap water and patted dry to remove excess moisture. The mortar and pestle were removed from the ice, wiped dry, and the six leaves were added to the mortar. Next, 15 mL of cold grinding buffer were added before grinding the mixture into a paste in which no large chunks remained. This paste was then mixed with an additional 15 mL of grinding buffer, waiting for three minutes so that the buffer could wash out the chloroplasts, and then the entire mixture was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. This liquid was then transferred into one of the chilled centrifuge tubes marked with an “A” before it was placed in the centrifuge for 10 minutes at 200 x G and 4°C. The tube was removed and the supernatant within was poured into the second chilled centrifuge tube labeled “B”. Care was taken to leave the pellets of debris in the bottom of tube “A” for use in the next portion of the experiment. The second half of this experiment started with labeling 19 test tubes from blank and then numbered from one to 18. These were placed in a tube rack while a spectrophotometer was set to read at an absorbance of 600 nm. A blank and five replicates of each of the following reaction mixtures were prepared. “Blank” contained 8 mL of water and 2 mL of a 100 mM phosphate (pH = 6.5) reaction buffer. The remaining 18 tubes were categorized as follows: No chloroplasts (#1-3), Chloroplasts at room temperature (#4-8), Chloroplasts at 30°C (#9-13), and Chloroplasts at 45°C (#14-18). To each of these, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer were added. After adding this to all tubes, an assay was started by adding 100 µL of enriched chloroplasts (Centrifuge tube “B”) to test tubes “blank” and #4-18, being careful to mix them immediately after this addition. These mixtures were transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes and their absorbances were read at 600 nm for use as Time Zero data points. Samples “blank” and #1-8 were placed on the table underneath a light source, #9-13 in a30°C water bath under a light source, and #14-18 in a 45°C water bath under a light source. After 15 minutes, the spectrophotometer was blanked using the solution in test tube “blank” and then all absorbances were read and recorded a spreadsheet. The samples were replaced into their correct locations as quickly as possible after taking the readings. At 15-minute intervals the absorbances were measured again, data was collected in this manner for a total of 60 minutes. Significance of the differences in the average absorbances for each group in comparison to Time Zero, and to one another at each 15-minute interval, was calculated using an ANOVA test. 

Results:
There was a significant difference between the four test groups at each of the four 15-minute intervals (At 15 minutes: df = 3, mean square = 0.018, p-value = 0.000021, At 30 minutes: df = 3, mean square = 0.023, p-value = 0.001151, = At 45 minutes: df = 3, mean square = 0.02, p-value = 0.021, At 60 minutes: df = 3, mean square = 0.018, p-value = 0.038). Tukey-Kramer results showed a decrease in the number of groups with significant differences as time increased. Tukey-Kramer test also showed that significant difference was maintained between the No chloroplast group and the Chloroplasts at room temperature group throughout the experiment. The average absorbance for the samples with no chloroplasts increased from 0.047 to 0.067, however, decreased to 0.025 at 60 minutes (Figure 1). A similar trend was seen in the group Chloroplasts at room temperature where the mean increased from 0.148 to 0.226 and then decreased to 0.148 at 60 minutes (Figure 1). Samples which contained chloroplasts and were kept at 30°C did not show any consistent trends and fluctuated at each measurement. Sample group Chloroplasts at 45°C showed no decrease in average absorbance and continually increased from 0.043 to 0.148 (Figure 1). 

Discussion:
Our results did not fully support our hypothesis that the absorbances recorded would decrease as temperature increased. Our hypothesis was supported by the data from the no chloroplast group after 60 minutes but not before. This can be seen as the average absorbance shows a decrease in the time zero absorbance to the time 60 absorbance but at 15, 30, and 45 minute it increases. All of the sample groups showed a decrease from the initial absorbance, at the end of the 60 minutes except for the group containing enriched chloroplasts that was kept at 45°C. This group showed an initial decrease at 15 minutes but then increased steadily until the end of the 60-minute testing interval (Figure 1). This increase appears to be an example of tolerance in which the chloroplasts adapted to the high temperatures of the 45°C water bath [Mathur:2014]. This tolerance would be beneficial if global warming continues on its current path so that crops would be resistant to the rising temperatures. The experiment could be improved if the growth of the spinach leaves used was monitored before harvesting them. According to research done by Peet and Krol, using leaf tissue of a similar developmental age can help eliminate unbeknownst environmental factors [Boese:1990].  If the environment is monitored during growth, then any factors that may have affected chloroplast growth prior to running the assays can be accounted for.
