Title: Affect of Nitrogen on the root shoot ratio in Field Peas 

Abstract:
The main objectives of this lab were to measure the effects that the presence of nitrogen in soil had on the growth of field peas. As I do not have the data for the experiment, it is hard to make a conclusion, but it is safe to say that the experiment was carried out in a matter that was safe and consistent in obtaining accurate data.  

Introduction:
Nitrogen is present in the soil in most areas, and the absence or presence of nitrogen can play a role in the growth of the plant. In the case of the field pea, we will be looking to see if the absence or presence of nitrogen plays a positive or negative role in the growth of our field peas. While we were not the specific group that planted and cared for these plants, we did measure the data ourselves and recorded the length for both the roots and shoots of the controll and experimental group. Our original experimental design ended up being mixed up with other plants, and was lost after the two weeks of caring for the plants was over. Another group was kind enough to let us use their experimental design in order to be able to record data. We used their experimental design but obtained our own data  

Materials and Method:
The materials that were used was soil with either nitrogen or without nitrogen, as well as pots, water, field pea seas, and time. The seeds were planted in their respective pots, either with or without nitrogen. The seeds were then planted in their pots and left to grow over two weeks, with one member of the group going to the greenhouse every other day in order to water the plants and check on their growth. After the two weeks were over, the plants were collected and the roots/shoots were taken out of their pots, cut apart, and measured using a ruler (cm). The data was recorded and the waste was disposed of 

Results:
In our data, we measured the root to shoot ration in cm of the field peas we planted two weeks ago. After measuring our data, we ran a one-tailed t_test in order to see the significance of the difference in the two plants. Once I receive the data, I will be able to for a figure that shows the difference in growth between the field peas that both grew in nitrogen and in the absence of nitrogen. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that we had was that those plants that grew in the presence of nitrogen would grow smaller than those that grew without the presence of oxygen. In order to test this, we measured those that were grown in the exact same conditions and looked to see what was the differences in the root to shoot ratio​ for the length of field peas 

Literature Cited:
For our citations we only used the lab book provided to us by our TA, the lab book that was used throughout​ the entirety of the semester
