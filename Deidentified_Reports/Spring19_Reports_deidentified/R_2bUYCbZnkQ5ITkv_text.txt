Title: Reduced contractions of Raina pipiens’ legs when treated with lidocaine

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to examine how the introduction of Lidocaine in the leg of a Raina pipien frog would effect the neuromuscular response. The hypothesis that we tested was if Lidocaine is used to block Na+ channels, then the voltage of the maximum contraction will decrease. We determined the twitch threshold for 3 different frog legs and then tested the frog leg at 0.1 V more than the threshold. The individual frog legs were stimulated 3 times without Lidocaine and 3 times with Lidocaine, and the separate trials for the control and treatment groups were averaged out. Our results showed that the introduction of Lidocaine does produce a smaller response when the voltage was applied ultimately supporting our hypothesis. The results from our one-tailed t-test gave us a p-value of .089957. We did not reject the null hypothesis because while our data shows that there is a difference when Lidocaine is injected into the frog leg, our p-value was greater than .05. Based on our results, we were not able to determine that the addition of Lidocaine into the leg of a frog does reduce the neuromuscular response when a voltage is applied.


Introduction:
The Raina pipiens was used in this experiment. This frog is a good choice because they produce very distinct reactions when the stimulus is applied and the legs are small and easy to handle. The neuromuscular system is what allows organisms to respond to their environment based off of a certain stimulus they encounter. The somatic neuromuscular system consists of skeletal muscle, which is made up of myofibers. In order to stimulate contractions, motor neurons innervate skeletal muscles by attaching to neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. The excitation of the muscle can be measured through the use of a myogram, which shows the amount of force generated over time. The different stages of muscle twitch include the latent period, which is a short time lapse between the time of stimulation and start of contraction; the contraction phase, which is when muscles shorten; and the relaxation period, which is when muscles return to the relaxed state [Johnson: 2018]. Another important factor is summation, which is the force generated by multiple motor units added together to produce muscle tension [Johnson: 2018]. The two types of summation are spatial summation, which is accomplished by increasing the voltage used to stimulate the nerve. Temporal summation occurs when axons are stimulated repeatedly. The hypothesis that we tested was if Lidocaine is used to block Na+ channels, then the voltage of the maximum contraction will decrease. The dependent variable in this experiment was the voltage response that was measured and the independent variable was the stimulus applied to each frog leg. An experiment such as this is performed because it is important to understand how the neuromuscular system is able to respond to certain stimuli in a very quick amount of time. The speed of the reaction allows the organism to react quickly to potentially dangerous situations.


Materials and Methods:
We took 3 frog legs and skinned them using forceps and moistened the legs with frog Ringer’s solution. The inner thigh muscles were spread using a dissecting probe, which revealed the sciatic nerve. The twitch threshold was determined for each individual frog leg by indirect stimulation. Each frog leg was administered 0.1 V above their respective thresholds three times without Lidocaine and then three additional times with Lidocaine injected. 0.1 mL of Lidocaine was injected into each frog leg. The voltages for each frog leg were averaged and we then used a one-tailed t-test to find our p-value and determine if our results were significant.


Results:
The results from our one-tailed t-test gave us a p-value of .089957. The stimulus applied to each frog leg was .3 V as the threshold was .2 V for each frog leg. The average responses for the respective control groups were .367, .745, and .101 while the average responses for the respective treatment groups were .115, .129, and .052. It can be observed from figure 1 that each control group had a greater response than the treatment group. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if Lidocaine is used to block Na+ channels, then the voltage of the maximum contraction will decrease, was not supported. We did not reject the null hypothesis that states there is no difference between the the control and treatment groups because the results clearly indicate that the response in the control group was much higher than the response in the group treated with Lidocaine. We could not reject the null hypothesis because our p-value was greater than .05. This data does not support our experimental hypothesis that the addition of Lidocaine to the R. pipien would reduce the response observed in the twitch of the muscle. Sodium plays an important role as it is one of the main components allowing for the contraction of muscles [K. O. Ellis: 1972]. The addition of Lidocaine blocks Na+ channels, which reduces the action potential thus producing a smaller response. “Na plays an important role in the determination of the resting membrane potential” [M. D. Sitrin: 1971] and so the fact that the Na+ channels were blocked played an important role in reducing the overall neuromuscular response. The first 2 frog legs showed a considerable difference between the control and the treatment groups, which was expected. The third frog leg also showed a difference, but it was significantly smaller compared to the other 2 frog legs. If the experiment were to be performed again, we could test frog legs at different voltages to see how this would affect the contractions observed on the myogram. This experiment is important because the neuromuscular system is essential to the movements of the body, so it is good to know how certain chemicals affect the functioning of the system.
