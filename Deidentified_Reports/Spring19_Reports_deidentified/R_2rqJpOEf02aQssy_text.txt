Title: Comparing the relationship of intraspecific behaviors in Betta splendins and turbidity of environments

Abstract:
Animal behavior can be grouped into two method; intraspecific behavior and interspecific behavior. This lab studies intraspecific behavior, displays between two of the same species, of Betta splendins. Bettas are a territorial species that commonly partake in agnostic behavior when in the presence of another fish. In a turbid environment, a betta will not be able to detect its surroundings as well due to low-visibility. If two male bettas are put in a turbid environment there will be less agnostic behavior than in clear water.  We separated six fish into three groups of two. Each set of fish were placed together in clear water and turbid water, with five minutes of rest between the two tanks. Their agnostic behavior was measured through time spent flaring their gills and creating the red “mane.” After aggressive contact the fish were immediately separated, so in order to obtain even results a ratio was created from dividing the amount of time the gills were flared by the amount of total time spent in the tank. The ratio of agnostic behavior to tank time for the clear water was approximately 0.2 seconds greater than the turbid water. The p_value was 0.017, supporting our hypothesis. This means it is more beneficial for bettas to live in murkier environments to better survive.

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior, ethology, is often observed in non-isolated environments. We seek to understand the physiological purpose for such behaviors and how those behaviors have been shaped throughout evolution and selection [Johnson: 2018]. This is often done through observing how an animal sees the world and stimuli around it. There are two different types of behaviors an animal exhibits in the presence of another animal; intraspecific and interspecific agnostic behaviors. We will be observing intraspecific behaviors, display in the presence of other members of their own species, of Betta splendins in this lab. Bettas are a Siamese fighting fish that originated in southeast Asia and are common in aquariums. They are widely found in ponds, ditches, drains, and murky waters [Bronstein: 1981]. Betta splendins also are easily excited by another male of their own species, and commonly change color and display agnostic behaviors [Lynn: 2007]. An interesting feature about bettas is they are not only dependent on their gills for oxygen intake. They have an accessory labyrinth organ that can extract oxygen from air that they gulp at the surface. This allows them to be able to better tolerate oxygen-poor water and gives males additional oxygen when displaying aggressive behaviors, allowing them to not expend too much energy [Johnson: 2018]. There are two different types of movements a betta can display, broadside and facing movements, with facing being more aggressive. The most aggressive move of a male betta is to protrude the branchiostegal membrane located under the opercula, also called the red “mane” [Lynn: 2007]. In this experiment we decided to test the relationship between aggressiveness of Betta splendins and turbidity of the environment. We hypothesize that if two male bettas are put in the same turbid environment, due to the lower visibility and inability to detect each other, there will be less aggressive behavior than in a clear environment. 


Materials and Method:
We used six Betta splendins and split them into three sets of two. We used two types of tanks in this experiment, one tank was clear water and the second tank had five drops of green food coloring to simulate a turbid environment. In order to gather data on aggressiveness, we timed the amount of time the red “mane” was present by stopping and starting a stopwatch. As soon as the bettas started physically attacking each other they were immediately separated and the trail was ended. The total time of a present red “mane” was divided by the amount of time the bettas spent in the tank to get a ratio for comparison. The first set of betta fish had their first trial in clear water. After five minutes of rest, the fish were moved to the turbid water and observed. The second set of betta fish also had their first trial in clear water then were moved to turbid water after five minutes of rest. The third set of fish started in the turbid water then were moved to the clear after five minutes of rest in order to avoid habituation. After the three trials, the ratios were averaged and a paired t_test was run with a 0.05 alpha value.



Results:
The betta fish displayed more aggressive behavior in the clear water than in the turbid water. The ratio of gill flare time to time spent in tank average for the clear water was 0.403 +/- 0.184 seconds. The average for the turbid water was 0.242 +/- 0.174 seconds.  The average ratio for clear water was about 0.2 second greater than the turbid water, as seen in Figure 1. A paired t_test was run from the raw data and a t-value recorded was 3.51 with degrees of freedom of 5. The data of the ratios of time of gill flare to time spent in tank was significent with a p_value of 0.017. 


Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis. The average ratio of gill flare time to tank time p_value was significent. Betta splendins display agnostic intraspecific behaviors in the presence of another male of their species. This lab found that if they bettas are placed in an environment with lower visibility then they may have a better chance of survival. The bettas in the turbid water did not display as aggressive behaviors as the bettas in the clear water. When a betta feels threatened for their own territory, especially by another male of their own species, they commonly display very aggressive behaviors like the gill flare. If a betta can not see its surroundings as well, and thus detect other fish around them, they will not feel as threatened and thus save energy and not run of the risk of losing their life in a fight with a larger fish [Lynn: 2007]. We believe this is why bettas commonly reside in dark, murky waters like ditches, ponds, and rice paddies. It it more beneficial to the life of bettas to reside in turbid water than clear in order to save energy and prevent agnostic behaviors. In future experiments, we could explore how bettas act in turbid water with another female present in the tank to see if it changes their behavior.
