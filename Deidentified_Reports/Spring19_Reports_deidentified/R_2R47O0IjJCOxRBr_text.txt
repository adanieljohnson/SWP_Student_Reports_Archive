Title: Influence of IG Regulator on Manduca Sexta Caterpillar during Life Cycle

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of insect growth hormones on the Manduca sexta organisms. After preparing the experiment with plastic containers and food prepared with water (the control) or the IG regulator (the treatment), it was observed that the hypothesis of the experiment was supported. With p-values and graphs created from the means of the raw data that can be found under the results section of this report, a significant statistical difference was found between the control and the treatment of weight, but not length. This means that the IG regulator made a significant impact on the growth and development of the Manduca​ sexta. 


Introduction:
Hormones play a very crucial role in the development of plants and animals. They serve as the messengers, controlling and coordinating activities throughout the body. This ability of control occurs by hormones binding to a receptor upon reaching a target site, locking into the receptor in order to transmit a message, and then the message is interpreted by the body so a specific action can take place. The location of these specific hormone receptors ranges from the nucleus to the surface of a cell.    
Manduca sexta, more commonly known as tobacco hornworms, are insects that are commonly used for research. These hornworms are fast-growing herbivorous insects that eat tobacco and tomato leaves as caterpillars, while the adults eat nectar. [Deel:1999] Due to the fast-paced holometabolous life cycle, the Manduca sexta is very useful for undergraduate research [Deel:1999] so they will be used in this lab to research the effects of hormones on insects. A holometabolous life cycle has four stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. [Johnson: 2018] Most of the ​insect development and molting result from the effects of 3 different hormones: Brain hormone (BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). BH is mainly produced by the neurosecretory organ behind the insect’s brain, also goes by PTTH, and regulates the release of 20E. Different insects produce ecdysterone slightly differently, but this hormone mainly regulates the timing of molting during insect development [Johnson:2018]. Juvenile hormones are generally produced by the corpus allata. The main function of JH is the regulation of the type of molting during development.
The purpose of this lab is to use insect growth regulators (IGRs), which typically inhibit and speed up the life cycle of a pest, to determine the effect on the natural growth of M. sexta. The IGR that was selected to use as a treatment is the IG Regulator. This hormone is known to speed up the insect’s development cycle. If the IG regulator is incorporated into the diet of the organism, it is hypothesized that the M. sexta treated with the IG regulator will weigh more at the end of the experiment than the control, which did not receive any hormone. Specifically, the group will be looking for a distinct difference between day 1 weight and length of the organism and day 7 weight and length of the organisms. 

Materials and Methods:
2, 4-cell containers for the manduca sexta homes 
2 lids 
“Hole making” tool
Spoon
Electronic scale
Transfer pipette
Sharpie
Food 
Square tupperware
Reagent
Water
IG Regulator


To prepare for the caterpillars, the plastic homes were made. Two small holes were punctured into each small cell of the manduca sexta home containers to allow air flow. To do this, a black took was placed behind the plastic and the orange puncture tool was used to puncture the plastic. It was punctured by pushing the orange tool fully through and into the black tool. Afterwards, the containers were labeled with group names, TA, section, treatment (including control groups), and a number to determine which organism is which when in the home. Ten grams of food was measured to be placed in each cell of the home. The food was stirred and formed into small balls once their appropriate reagent is added. There were four control group caterpillars, which received 8 drops of water with their 10g of food, and four treatment caterpillars, which received 8 drops of IG regulator with their 10g of food. After drops were added, we continued to clump and mix the food. The newly mixed food was placed into their respective container and cell. Before the caterpillars were placed into the contained with the food, food mass, mass and length of all the caterpillars, and the cell each component was placed in was recorded. The caterpillars were checked on each day to ensure the organisms still had moist food. If the food was gone, the food was replaced and the new food masses were recorded. After all the measurements were collected, a two sample t-test was used to determine if the differences between the control and the treatment were significant. The means of the difference in M. sexta weight and length were the data sets that were used to run the test. A p-value of 0.5 was used to mark the cut off of a statistically significant difference between the two groups. 


Results:
As seen in table 1, the treatment group tended to be heavier and longer than the control group of the caterpillars. The measured differences of the length and weight, which was the difference between the measurements made on day 1 of the experiment versus day 7, tended to be larger in the treatment group. The results of the t-test run for the difference in weight between the M. sexta showed that the p-value for the two-tailed t-test was .046514. Based on this statistic and the cut off that we established for whether or not a value is statistically significant, the two means are statistically different. The results of the t-test run for the difference in length between the M. sexta showed that the p-value for the two-tailed t-test was .569714. This value is over the established cut off so the difference between the means of the lengths are not statistically different. 


Discussion:
After executing the experiment, taking observations, and making measurement, our initial hypothesis was partially supported. As seen in table 1 and the p-values found, there were significant statistical difference in the weight measurements and not the length. However, two organisms died so the treatment group only had two data points instead of the four in the control group. Biologically, it is understandable that there was a significant difference in weight. The IG regulator is supposed to speed up the speed of development, so the treatment caterpillars should be plumper. The IG regulator causes the development hormones to work at a faster pace within the body. This error in the lab is suspected to be due to the fact that these to caterpillars were very weak and close to death at the beginning of this experiment. This weakness is due to the growth inhibitor used on them during the first portion of the lab. They were unable to jump back to a healthy state after their growth cycle was drastically altered. The other caterpillars were plump and healthy. The only difference between the caterpillars in the control group and the live caterpillars that received IG Regulator was the color. This difference in color was most likely due to the growth inhibitor that a portion of the caterpillars received in the first portion of the lab that is not outlined in this report. Overall, apart from some outliers, all of the caterpillars grew in the expected way. The general knowledge of how IGRs affect insects is important to understand pest control. For example, some insecticides have IGRs that disrupt the biochemical pathways and processes that are essential for insect growth and development. [Tunaz and Uygan:2004]
