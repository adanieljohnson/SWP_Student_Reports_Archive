Title: The Introduction of Tubocurarine (a Nicotinic ACh Receptor Antagonist) into the Gastrocnemius of Frogs and its effect on the Neuromuscular System 

Abstract:
Invertebrates like humans, have skeletal muscles innervated by motor neurons that dictate how and when an organism moves. The contraction and lengthening of these muscles are facilitated by neurotransmitters like acetylcholine (ACh). Here the group investigated the effect of the suppression of ACh through the introduction of tubocurarine (a nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist) through injection directly into the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg. The expectation was for muscle contractions and activity to decrease as sufficient amounts of ACh would be unable to facilitate the desired motor function. The group's data showed no significance between the inhibition of ACh through tubocurarine on resulting muscle contractions. However, despite not being significent, a pattern of decreasing muscle contraction amplitude was observed during the experiment as a result of decreased levels of ACh present in the gastrocnemus. This trend, despite its statistical insignificance, suggests nicotinic substances like tubocurarine have negative effects on motor function and muscular contractions and therefore should be avoided.

Introduction:
Within the skeletal muscles of vertebrates that dictate movement exists a multitude of muscular fibers called myofibers. These myofibers are connected directly to motor neurons forming motor units that govern and coordinate movement through contractions and extensions of muscle fibers. The nerve impulses that facilitate these actions travel down the axon of the motor neurons to arrive at neuromuscular junction at which point innervates the myofiber to cause the release of the acetylcholine: a type of neurotransmitter. Once acetylcholine is released, it binds to protein receptors on the muscle fibers allowing for sodium channels to open and generate action potentials throughout muscle fibers. These action potentials lead to the release of Ca2+ ions activating contractile mechanisms of muscle fibers to occur (and eventual re-uptake of Ca2+ and repetition of the process) [Johnson: 2016].

To investigate the role of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction and mechanisms that facilitate movement, the group would introduce a chemical called tubocurarine into an isolated gastrocnemus muscle of a frog. Tubocurarine is a compound that acts as an antagonist for the acetylcholine receptors (ACh) along the muscle fibers of vertebrates (and thus frogs). The chemical, being an antagonist, inhibits the release of ACh from motor neurons, especially during repetitive stimulation [Magleby: 1981]. Therefore, blocking the ACh receptors will prevent the opening of sodium channels and thus possible potential action potentials [Hinman: 2002]. The group would study this process in the gastrocnemus of a frog as the muscle is well developed and robust relative to its size thus ensuring compelling results. 

As stated, the group wanted to understand and investigate the role of ACh in the neuromuscular system of frogs (from the order Anura). The group wanted to understand how the system would behave in a situation with an inadequate amount of neurotransmitter (ACh). The group hypothesized that if tubocurarine were to be injected in the gastrocnemus of the frogs at a set stimulus, the resulting contractions and their amplitudes (dependent, measurable variable) would be lesser compared to a muscle without the injected substance (independent, categorical variable). 


Materials and Method:
The began the experiment by first selecting three frog legs and exposing the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve: being sure to isolate both from the rest of the leg’s tissue. The leg’s skin would also be peeled back to allow for direct access to the muscle tissue. A force transducer that both supplied the set stimulus and recorded the resulting muscular activity was injected directly into the frog leg’s muscle.

To make sound conclusions on the effect of ACh on the neuromuscular system, the group would supply three rounds of 0.75V stimuli to the muscle absent of tubocurarine to provide controll data on muscular activity. Muscular activity and potentials were measured through contraction amplitude (measured in volts) which was the difference in the peak and baseline on the myogram software measuring muscular movements and twitches. After collecting three contraction amplitude values in the leg, 0.2 Ml of tubocurarine was injected directly into the muscle. The muscle was then massaged adequately to ensure the chemical diffused sufficiently throughout the tissue. Following this, the muscle was again provided with three rounds of 0.75V stimulus. The resulting amplitude was collected. This process was repeated a total of three times for the three separated legs. 

For each frog leg, the contraction amplitudes measured before injection were treated as the controll group of data for the contractions that followed injection that would thus be administered as the experimental data values. After the measurements were collected, the group utilized the paired t_test to examine the resulting figures of contraction amplitudes in both groups. Paired t_test was used as the group compared two means that came from the same group. 


Results:
After completing all trials and averaging the resulting data points, there appeared to be a pattern and difference between the contraction amplitude before and after the injection of tubocurarine. Tubocurarine through the majority of trials decreased the contraction amplitude: across the three legs, on average, contraction amplitude decreased by 0.187V (Fig. 1). The group did have a trial that did not fit this pattern as frog leg #1 contraction amplitude increased following the injection of tubocurarine. Outlier test did not prove trial to be worthy of being disregarded. While data did show a trend, that trend was not consistent as the effect on contraction amplitude did not have a consistent impact on the baseline value of the muscle’s contraction. For example, in leg #2, contraction amplitude was nearly decreased by a factor of 0.5 while in leg #3, contraction amplitude was completely suppressed. Contraction amplitude before injection calculated to be 0.642V (Fig. 1); post-injection calculated to be 0.455V (Fig. 1). Using the paired t_test, the results gathered were deemed insignificent as p_value= 0.713 (dF=2, t-value=0.424). 

Discussion:
While the group’s presented biological hypothesis was loosely supported by results gathered by legs 2 and 3, the calculated p_value from the paired t_test indicated the data gathered rendered the group’s results insignificent. The group hoped to see a clear, statistically supported relationship between the suppression of ACh and decreased muscle contraction amplitude but was statistically not supported. With that being said, however, in the two legs that did follow the pattern expected, it is clear that the tubocurarine did fulfill its expected role in inhibiting the release of ACh into the neuromuscular junction thus resulting in decreased values of contraction amplitudes [Hinman: 2002]. In the trials before injection, the contractions observed had uniformed peaks with clear contractions. Following injection, with exception to frog leg #1 results, the contractions were suppressed and altered by the ACh inhibitor.

Concerning the results gathered by frog leg #1, the data collected indicated the exact opposite of what was expected. The contraction amplitude following the injection of tubocurarine increased by nearly a factor of four. It is likely not all of the .2 Ml of tubocurarine was injected and/or diffused properly into the gastrocnemus muscle. This would cause the muscle to behave relatively normally as sufficient amounts of ACh would be active in the contraction mechanism [Johnson: 2016].

Understanding the relationship between the inhibition of the release of ACh through a nicotinic agent, such as tubocurarine, in the neuromuscular system, the resulting motor function and muscle activity has both relevance and significance to the health of all vertebrate life. The results gathered, while not significent, do show that nicotine and other nicotinic substances suppressed muscle contractions and alter normal motor function [Thesleff: 1955]. It can be concluded substances like these should be avoided as they pose acute and chronic health risks to organisms who rely on ACh to facilitate neuromuscular processes.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1- Contraction amplitude, in volts, of each frog leg before and after the injection of tubocurarine into the gastrocnemus. Pre-injection contraction amplitude between three frogs’ legs: 0.642V. Post-injection contraction amplitude between three frogs legs: 0.455V. Introduction of tubocurarine is seen to decrease contraction amplitude as tubocurarine inhibits release of acetylcholine from motor neurons. Each frog leg was stimulated with 0.75V three times before the injection of .2Ml of tubocurarine and three times after injection. Following this, each group of three trials was averaged and run through the paired t_test statistical test. The average difference in contraction amplitude between pre-injection and post-injection was -0.187. The resulting paired t-value was 0.4242 with a P-value of 0.713. Therefore, the results of the experiment were insignificent as P-value= 0.713.*************************************************************************
