Title: Allocation of nitrogen in Raphanus sativus as determined through observation of no nitrate, low nitrate, high nitrate conditions and measurement of root to shoot ratio

Abstract:
Nitrogen is a nutrient essential to the photosynthetic and respiratory functions in plants. However, when nitrogen or other resources are limited by environmental conditions, a plant must allocate its resources to the organ where its resources can be utilized most efficiently. In this study, we investigated how varied soil nitrogen levels affected the resource allocation and resulting phenotypic plasticity in Raphanus sativus or radish plants. We had one control group (contained no added nitrate in the soil) and two experimental groups (one low nitrate group with 2 grams of nitrate and one high nitrate group with 7 grams of nitrate). After 14 days, individual replicates were separated out and masses of the whole replicate, its roots, and its shoots were measured. The root to shoot average ratio was calculated and an ANOVA test was conducted. These tests revealed that there was a significant difference in the root to shoot ratio of the no nitrate group vs the low and high nitrate groups. These results suggest the radish plants allocated their resources toward the shoots (leaves and stem) because the roots did not need additional resources to absorb nitrogen that was already available. 

Introduction:
Plants require several essential resources in order to survive, grow, and reproduce. These resources include solar energy, carbon dioxide, and nutrients from the soil including nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and sulfur. However, based on a plant’s environment, these resources are limited. As a result of competition and a limitation of resources, plant species have developed a system to allocate their resources to each organ (Johnson, 2018). 

Each plant organ contains its own highly specific purpose and function. For example, the leaves are the principal photosynthetic organ of the plant, responsible for the absorption of sunlight. The stem provides structure and increases the competition of light capture by lifting the plant towards the sun. Finally, the roots function as the primary absorptive organ of the plant and extract nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and sulfur from the soil. The roots are also responsible for anchoring the plant in the soil. In response to a limitation of resources, a plant will allocate its available resources to the organ that will most efficiently utilize the resource. For example, when nitrogen is a limited resource, weeds allocate the available nitrogen to the leaves, leading to increased photosynthesis and therefore increased growth (Johnson 2018).

In allocating their resources, plants are forced to make certain trade-offs when they spend more resources in one stage of their life cycle more than others. These trade-offs cause a deviation from the plant’s predetermined genotype. This deviation causes phenotypic plasticity or the ability of the plant to alter their expressed phenotype, regardless of their genetic code. The change in the phenotype allows the plant to operate most efficiently and adapt to a given environment (Johnson, 2018).

Nitrogen is a component essential to the growth and reproduction of plants. It is one of the key building blocks of enzymes, genetic structures, and cellular systems. It is also an important element in photosynthetic and respiratory processes (Zhang et al., 2017). Plants with a nitrogen deficiency have been found to have a reduced leaf area and leaf chlorophyll content, further resulting in a decreased biomass (Zhao et al.,2004). Due to the importance of nitrogen in plant growth processes, allocation of nitrogen can be assessed by measuring the biomass of the plant’s roots and shoots (includes the stem and leaves) (Johnson, 2018).  

Due to the significant role of nitrogen in a plant’s survival and growth, we predicted that there would be a significant difference between the root to shoot ratio of plants grown with no added nitrate (the control group with 0 grams of nitrate) and the plants grown under low and high nitrate conditions (experimental groups with 2 grams of nitrate in the low group and 7 g of nitrate in the high group). The objectives of this lab were to determine the effect of nitrogen in radish plant growth and how it is allocated among plant organs. This information is useful in determining the effectiveness of nutrients in the soil. It can be used to determine the impact of nitrogen on plant growth and yields. 

Materials and Methods:
The radishes were grown under three conditions: 0 g of added nitrate, 2 g of added nitrate, and 7 g of added nitrate. Two plots of each condition were grown. All other environmental conditions were kept constant including the amount of sunlight, water, Miracle- Gro, and CO2 content. Initially, radish seeds were placed in a plot half filled with vermiculite and then covered with additional vermiculite. Plots were given 50 mL of Miracle- Grow and 200 mL of water each day. Plants were grown for 14 days in a greenhouse.

After 14 days, the plants were removed from the greenhouse to be evaluated. To obtain individual replicates, the entire plot was placed in a tub of water to loosen the vermiculite. Individual replicates were carefully removed in order to ensure that no roots or shoots were broken off. Individual replicates were chosen at random. For each of the three conditions, 6 replicates were chosen, 3 from each plot. Each replicate was dried thoroughly and weighed as a whole. Then, each replicate was carefully cut at the root-shoot junction and the roots and shoots were weighed separately. 

The root to shoot ratio of the control group (0 grams of nitrate added) and the 2 experimental groups (2 grams of nitrate and 7 grams of nitrate added) were analyzed and compared through an ANOVA. 

Results:
From the averaged data (Table 1), it is clear that there is a difference between average root to shoot mass of the no nitrate group and the high and low nitrate groups. The no nitrate group had an average root to shoot ratio mass of 0.11658952  0.0374458 grams while the low nitrate group had a root to shoot ratio mass of 0.07816087  0.01055979 grams and the high nitrate group had a ratio of 0.07715174  0.0157961 grams. Directionally, Figure 1. shows that the root to shoot ratio is much lower in the low and high nitrate groups than the no nitrate groups. 

Additionally, we can look at the average root and shoot masses of each experimental group. The no nitrate group had an average total mass of roots of 0.098333333  0.03250641 grams. The low nitrate group had an average total mass of roots of 0.131666667  0.038686776 grams and the high nitrate group had an average total mass of 0.09  0.045166359 grams. The no nitrate group had an average total mass of shoots of 0.84 grams. The low nitrate group had an average total mass of shoots of 1.67  0.366060104 grams and the high nitrate group had an average total mass of 1.128333333  0.314605573 grams.

Our one- way ANOVA test showed there was a significant difference (P=0.02) between the average root to shoot ratio of the no nitrate group and the root to shoot ratio of the low and high nitrate groups. The Turkey- Kramer test (the minimum significant difference test) showed that there was a significant difference between the no nitrate and low nitrate groups. It also showed there was a significant difference between the no nitrate and the high nitrate groups. However, the Turkey- Kramer test found no significant difference between the low nitrate and high nitrate groups (Table 3).

Discussion:
This study explored the impact of differing levels of nitrogen on the resource allocation and resulting phenotypic plasticity of radish plants. We predicted that there would be a significant difference in the root to shoot ratio between the control group (no nitrate added to soil) and the experimental groups (low nitrate levels with 2 grams added and high nitrate levels with 7 grams of nitrate added). Our results confirmed this hypothesis and showed that there was a significant difference between groups. The root to shoot mass ratio in the no nitrate group (0.11658952   0.0374458 grams) was much higher than the two experimental groups (low nitrate group had a root to shoot mass ratio of 0.07816087  0.01055979 grams and high nitrate group had a ratio of 0.07715174  0.0157961 grams) (Figure 1.). This indicates that the roots had a greater biomass in the control group. Because there was no nitrate in the soil, a greater share of the plant’s resources was directed towards the roots to absorb all available resources. These results agree with earlier studies conducted on sorghum that show that nitrogen deficiencies significantly reduced leaf area and photosynthetic rate and increased root length (Zhao et al.,2004). This study also found that nitrogen deficiencies most significantly affected the biomass of the plant’s shoots rather than the plant’s roots (Zhao et al.,2004). This is reflected in our results when the mass of shoots showed much more variance than the mass of roots. For example, the no nitrate group and the high nitrate group both had 0.9 grams for their average total root masses but showed a significant difference between the average total masses of their shoots (no nitrate total shoot mass was 0.84 grams and high nitrate total shoot mass was 1.128333333).

On the other hand, plants in the experimental groups (low nitrate and high nitrate) had significantly lower root to shoot mass ratios than the control. The experimental groups had a ready, available supply of nitrate. Acquisition of nitrate from the soil was relatively undemanding therefore it was unnecessary to designate resources to the roots of the plant. It is important to remember that plants allocate resources to the organ that will most aid in their survival and reproduction (Johnson, 2018).  Therefore, the plant allocates resources towards its shoots (stems and leaves) to expend energy on growth and reproduction rather than the collection of nutrients from the soil (Johnson, 2018). This is consistent with other studies conducted on forests and grasslands in which allocation was measured in a more direct manner through the extraction of nutrient levels from each plant organ (Zhang et al., 2017). This study found that leaves received the highest allocation of the plant’s resources because of their important role in photosynthesis and respiration (Zhang et al., 2017). Stems and roots require significantly less energy in their roles of absorbing nutrients and providing structure to the plant, therefore, their nutrient levels were significantly lower than the leaves (Zhang et al., 2017).

To further support and reinforce the validity of the results of this study, the original procedure can be modified to achieve additional valuable results. For example, more replicates from each plot could be collected in order to gather a larger pool of data. Additionally, the measure of resource allocation could include the direct measure of nutrients in each plant organ. This study has many practical applications including the growth of higher plant yields given a certain amount of resources in farming and industry. Growers could alter plant environments in a controlled setting in order to obtain plants with the desired phenotype. 

From this study, we can conclude that a plant possesses a considerable response to the biotic and abiotic factors in its environment. A plant’s genotype does not have exclusive control over the plant’s expressed phenotype. Largely, the expressed phenotype is determined by the plant’s environment. Nitrogen, when in excess, is easily absorbed and the plant does not need to designate energy to retrieve this resource. As a result, the plant is able to allocate its resources to other organs such as the stems and leaves. With the additional resources, plant organs can operate with greater efficiency and achieve higher growth rates in order to survive and reproduce successive generations.
