Title: Caffeine causes chemically induced tetany in frog legs

Abstract:
Muscles contract when presented with electrical stimuli. The strength of these contractions can be altered by presenting drugs, such as caffeine, into the muscle. In this experiment, caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog, and the strength of muscle contraction was observed. It was expected that caffeine would cause a chemically induced tetany, or maximum contraction. The data showed that there was statistical significance between the contraction strengths of the control and treatment groups. Adding caffeine to the muscle meant that tetany was reached, and therefore the muscle could not contract as much compared to the control contractions.

Introduction:
Muscles contract because of action potentials. A neuromuscular junction is where motor neurons and muscles meet at a synapse. When an action potential reaches the terminal end of a neuron, acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the synapse. When ACh binds to the postsynaptic cell, voltage gated sodium channels are triggered to open, which create another action potential in the postsynaptic cell through the opening of sodium gated ion channels. As this action potential moves down the axon, calcium ions are released into the cell, which triggers the contraction of muscles. Skeletal muscles can only contract a certain amount before reaching tetany, a state of complete contraction. Many studies show that caffeine may affect the maximum contraction of a muscle [Kalmar: 1999]. The research question of this experiment aimed to answer whether caffeine raises or lowers the maximum contraction of a gastrocnemius muscle (a skeletal muscle) of a frog and to see if the addition of caffeine causes tetany. If there is an increase in caffeine in the gastrocnemius muscle, then the muscle will experience a chemically induced tetany.

Materials and Methods:
There were three frog legs sampled. The sample was prepared such that the skin was removed from the leg, and the gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the sciatic nerve. An electrode, connected to the iWork system, sent an action potential to the muscle via the sciatic nerve. First, this was done three times without the addition of caffeine (control) in order to get baseline data for a stimulus on the leg. Second, 0.1mL of 200mM caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle and it was then stimulated three more times. The difference between the control and treatment contraction strengths for each leg were evaluated and physical observations were noted. The amplitude of the electric current was kept constant at 1V for all trials. A paired t-test was done because two sets of data were related to each other in each individual frog leg sample. The control and treatment for each leg were paired.

Results:
Using a paired t-test, the results were statistically significant (t-value = 6.028, degrees of freedom = 2, p-value= 0.027). This means that the contraction strengths of the control and treatment groups were different enough to be statistically significant (see Figure 1). The muscles reached tetany when caffeine was introduced into the muscle. The difference in contraction strength for leg 1 was 0.102 V. The difference in contraction strength for leg 2 was 0.066 V, and the difference in contraction strength for leg 3 was 0.062 V. The caffeine caused the muscle to swell, and after being shocked with caffeine, the muscle was firm. The contractions were observed to be stronger in the treatment phases of all three legs than during the control trials. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that an increase in caffeine would result in tetany was supported. The hypothesis was supported because there was statistical significance between the control trial and caffeine trial for each of the three legs. When caffeine was added, the muscle went into chemical induced tetany. When it was stimulated in this state, it was not able to contract much more because it was already in a highly contracted state. This resulted in a smaller contraction strength during the control trials and a larger contraction during the treatment trials due to tetany. While there was statistical difference between the contraction strengths with and without caffeine, this does not mean that the data is biologically significant. A frog leg that contains 0.1mL of 200mM caffeine in its natural environment would not experience any dramatic effects to its biological functions. This is because the contraction difference was consistently around 0.1V for each trial, which would not create a large difference in the frogâ€™s actions. Other studies suggest that the chemically induced tetany experienced by the gastrocnemius muscle is due to an interaction between caffeine and ryanodine receptors [Bazzucchi: 2011]. This interaction causes more calcium to be released inside the cells, which leads to tetany because the muscle contracts more in the presence of excess calcium [Bazzucchi: 2011]. This experiment can be furthered by seeing how much caffeine is required in frogs to make a biologically significant change. This information could be useful in examining the jumping or moving capabilities of frogs when they are trying to escape from predators in their natural habitats.

Figure 1. Average difference in contraction strength for control and treatment groups. The paired t-test showed that there was a statistical difference between the contraction strength of the control group and the caffeine treated group (t-value = 6.028, degrees of freedom = 2, p-value= 0.027). The error bars represent one standard deviation from this average, which was +/- 0.091 for the control group and +/- 0.111 for the treatment group.*************************************************************************
