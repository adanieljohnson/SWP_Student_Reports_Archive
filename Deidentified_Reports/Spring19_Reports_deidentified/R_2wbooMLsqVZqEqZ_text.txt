Title: Heated Environments Increase the Growth of the Root Lengths of Secale cereal

Abstract:
In this experiment, our group observed how resource allocation in plants varied when the plants were exposed to different conditions. While, many factors can contribute to a different allocation of a resources, the objective of the experiment was to determine how the root to shoot (R:S) ratio differs from plants grown in environments with different temperatures. Plants were grown in a green house and a heated incubator for a week to determine the differences between the growth of the roots and shoots of the plants. The primary focus of the experiment was to see the differences of the ratio between the roots and shoots of both incubated and greenhouse plants. We hypothesized that the plants in the incubator would have a higher root to shoot ratio for both length and width. The result of the paired t-test revealed that the R:S of length was the only significant data in the experiment. Because the plants did not appear to allocate energy into lengthening the roots and only to increasing the root weight or shoot weight/length, our hypothesis was not supported. This was important to the scientific community because our results suggested that rye plants acquired more water by increasing the mass of their roots with root hairs instead of deepening their roots to reach more water sources

Introduction:
Plants require many nutrients to stay healthy. These include sunlight, water, and soil nutrients, such as nitrogen. Plants will allocate resources to different parts of them to stimulate growth for better getting all the vital nutrients that they require [Bennet:2012]. Plants mainly divide their resources to their leaves, stem, and roots. The ratio between the lengths and weights of each type of plant part can be used to show how resources are distributed in a plant. For example, the root to shoot ratio in this paper refers to how heavy or large the roots are in comparison to shoots.   Plants can have different ways of allocating resources based on its species. Herbaceous plants without woody stems divert most of their resources to the leaves. Many parasitic vines have strong stems to attach themselves to other plants, and because of this, the vines focus much of its resources to develop it. Many plants also allocate resources based on the environment which they live in. For example, to obtain more sunlight where it is highly contested for, such as in a rainforest, plants will focus on the growth of their stems so they can grow taller [Larigauderie:1990]. We decided that plant resource allocation in response to temperature is important because in many ecosystems, climate between seasons can drastically vary. The rye plant is generally grown in the grassland biome, which has drastic changes in temperatures that can range from -40 degrees Fahrenheit to above 100 degrees Fahrenheit depending on the season [Buschbaum1995]. Because of this drastic change in climate, the rye plant is a good subject because it must change and adapt to temperatures in its natural habitat to survive. Relative to temperature, plants will grow their roots larger because in arid climates, the water is concentrated deeper in the ground, where it is cooler, opposed to the rainforest, where the roots of plants are required to be as large [Bennet:2012]. Because of this phenomenon, our group hypothesized that the plants in the incubator would have a larger root to shoot ratio for both length and weight due to the act that water is more of a necessity in dry climates. 

Materials and Methods:
Method:
First, our group planted seeds into ten pots with each pot containing ten rye seeds. Next, we divided the pots into two equal groups of five plants. One group is placed in a greenhouse and the other placed inside an incubator (which was at a constant temperature of 37 degrees Celsius). Each plant was watered each day for a week. The plants would be watered enough so the top layer of soil was covered. After a week elapsed, our group took three seedlings from each pot to measure. To do this, we poured water into a larger tub and then took the entire pot and emptied it into the larger container. We used the water to loosen the dirt around the roots of the seedlings so they weren’t torn off when removing the plant. Next, we cut the plants where the roots and shoots met. This is where the stem begins to turn white. We made sure not to separate the roots and shoots from each other so we could tell which shoots and roots were paired together. Then we measured the lengths and weights for both the roots and shoots of each plant. Next, we calculated the R:S ratio between the two groups for both lengths and the weights. Lastly, the averages and standard deviations for the R:S ratios were calculated, and a paired t-test with a critical value of 0.05 was used to analyze the results. 


Results:
Our measures for the R:S ratio for length are (1.48±0.37) for the incubated plants and (1.54±0.38) for the plants inside the greenhouse (fig.1). The R:S ratio for the weights are (2.55±1.32) for the incubator and (0.57±0.25) (fig.2). The results of the t test for weights are as follows: (p=0.02, t=3.93, df=4)(fig.1). The results of the t test for lengths are as follows: (p=0.79, t=0.29, df=4)(fig.2). 

Discussion:
Even though the p value of the R:S for the weight of the plant is statistically significant towards the incubated plants, we cannot accept our hypothesis because the lengths were not statistically significant. Because the mean is larger in the incubator group than the greenhouse group, the larger average root weight of the plants exposed to the increased temperature of the incubator coincides with our hypothesis. The reason that the length between the two groups was similar and the weights were significantly different is likely due to the increased surface area of the roots because of the growth of more root hairs [Greison:2002]. Root hairs are involved in the uptake of nutrients in the soil, but more importantly in the scope of this experiment, water. With more surface area exposed to the soil, the roots are capable of absorbing more nutrients and water into its roots to compensate for the amount lost through transpiration [Greison:2002]. Generally, the R:S ratio of weight and length will both increase if a plant is exposed to dry or hot environments [DeLucia:1991]. This is because the plants allocate growth towards different areas to ensure that they receive all the necessary nutrients to survive, in this case, towards the roots because it is the scarcest resource in a dry environment. It is important to note that we only actively tried to change the air temperature of our experiment but had no way to regulate the temperature of the soil. This is important because soil temperature is more correlated with a change in root length and weight, while air temperature is more associated with changes in shoot length and weight, which could explain why the results from the root length differed from each other [Poorter:2011]. Future studies could explore how much root surface area affects the acquisition of nutrients and water. If we could find out how large a role roots have in growth and nutrient gathering, we could have gained a better representation of how accurate this experiment is. If the roots don’t seem to have much effect, it would indicate that the findings of this particular experiment are likely incorrect and likewise, it would provide further support for the results if it is found that roots do have a large effect on nutrition acquisition. This experiment’s data is important in a scientific aspect because, assuming the results are correct, it would explain how Secale cereal allocates its resources when exposed to an arid climate. Some plants increase root length to reach deeper sources of water. However, the rye plant spreads more root hairs instead[Greison:2002].
