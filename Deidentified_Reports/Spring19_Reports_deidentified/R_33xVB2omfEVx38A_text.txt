Title: The Effect of Creatine on the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Understanding the neuromuscular system is an important topic in animal biology. Nerves and muscles allow organisms to respond to external and internal stimuli. The neuromuscular system communicates through electric potentials. Here we look creatine’s role in generating electric potentials muscles. Rana pipiens’ gastrocnemius muscles and sciatic nerves were used to study this topic. We hypothesized that injecting creatine into the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle would cause a change in its twitch/voltage threshold. Our data showed no significant difference in the threshold voltage between the experimental and control groups. This significance suggests that creatine does not play a significant role in generating action potentials. In response to these results, we are interested in analyzing creatine’s role when paired with creatine kinases. Overall, the results of the experiment points towards the notion that creatine does not influence the threshold voltage in muscles. 

Introduction:
Much like hormones, nerves and muscles allow organisms to respond to external and internal stimuli. The neuromuscular system uses electric potentials to respond and communicate in the body. Skeletal muscles are stimulated by motor neurons that stem off of the spinal cord. These motor neurons activate contraction in muscle fibers also known as myofibrils [Matsuo: 2008]. The neurons release acetylcholine which binds to receptors on the muscle fiber membrane. The ACh receptors cause sodium channels to open which depolarize the cell. If a depolarization is strong enough than an action potential is generated and the muscle fiber will contract. The key to action potentials is that they are an all or nothing reaction. If the muscle fiber is depolarized enough to cross the threshold than an action potential is generated but if the threshold is not crossed than there is no action potential at all. The threshold needed for muscle contraction can be studied by electrically stimulating the nerve connected to that muscle. The electrical properties of an action potential are sensitive to the solution that the muscle is submerged in. So, by measuring the threshold of a muscle contraction, one can study the physical effect created by the solution that the muscle is submerged in [Burnstock: 1958]. We hypothesized that if a creatine solution is injected into the Rana pipiens’ gastrocnemius muscle, then there will a significant difference in its twitch/voltage threshold.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were obtained. The first leg was skinned and the gastrocnemius muscle was dethatched from the lower connective tissue. The upper thigh of the frog leg was dissected, revealing the sciatic nerve. The leg was then pinned down and the muscle was strung up, creating a slight tension in the string. Thin electrodes were then placed in contact with the exposed sciatic nerve. The electrodes were connected to a computer using LabScribe hardware and software. LabScribe was used to stimulate the sciatic nerve with varying intensities of electric pulses. The settings for the electric pulse were: # of pulses (1), frequency (1 Hz), pulse width (5 ms). The pulse amplitude was set at 0.01 mV and was increased by 0.01 V until a twitch was seen in the gastrocnemius muscle. When a twitch was seen the threshold voltage was recorded. The same procedure was done again on the same frog leg accept this time the muscle was injected with roughly 2 mL of a creatine solution. Three minutes were allowed for the creatine solution to take full effect and then the new threshold voltage was recorded. The procedure was repeated for each of the three frog legs. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze the results of the experiment.

Results:
The mean threshold voltage was 0.09 V for the control group and 0.11 for the experimental group (Fig.1). The standard deviation of the threshold voltage was ±0.06 for the control group and ±0.08 for the experimental group. The mean threshold voltage of the control group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (p-value = 0.442). Analyzing the appearance of the muscle twitches did not provide much information because there did not seem to be any difference in the strength of time of the contraction. Overall, the control and experimental caterpillars had similar threshold voltages. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the frog gastrocnemius muscle injected with creatine would have a significant difference in threshold voltage compared to the non-injected muscle was not supported by the results. We reject the alternate hypothesis and accept the null hypothesis. This implies that the data we received was likely due to chance. We did not see any difference in the threshold voltages which suggests that creatine does not play a significant role in the neuromuscular system. It is possible that creatine did not cause any change in threshold voltage because it is a larger molecule than most ions. Action potentials are driven by the diffusion of small ions like sodium into the muscle cell. Creatine’s molecular weight is over 5 times that of sodium, thus it could be too large to diffuse throught the membrane in the synaptic cleft. Although, having these larger molecules in the synaptic cleft could have served as an inhibitor slowing down the binding of acetylcholine. If this is the case then we should have measured the time between the electric pulse and the muscle twitch. The statistical analysis suggests that creatine does not interfere with the threshold voltage of muscles. The literature disagrees with this notion, saying that creatine is vital to creating enough ATP in muscles, leading to stronger contractions [Shields: 1975]. This impels us to relook at our experimental methods. It is possible that we should have also injected creatine kinases into the muscle so that the creatine was usable by the muscle cell [Shields: 1975]. A future experiment should look at injecting both the creatine molecule and kinase enzyme to see changes in threshold voltage. In conclusion, this experiment suggests creatine does not play a significant role in regulating the threshold voltage of the gastrocnemius muscle. Action potentials may not be affected by larger molecules because they cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane. Our results make us question the ability for larger molecules to influence the neuromuscular system at all.

Figure 1. A graph showing the average threshold voltage between the three frogs. The “without creatine” group is the control and the “with creatine” group is the experimental. There was a slightly higher threshold voltage in the experimental group. The averages only differed slightly and the two-tailed paired t-test reflects this observation.
