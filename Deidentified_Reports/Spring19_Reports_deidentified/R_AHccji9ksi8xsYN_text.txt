Title: Addition of mycorrhizal fungi to R. Raphanistrum increases the root to shoot ratio despite logical objections

Abstract:
Resource allocation in plants is a vital function that allows immobile organisms to compete with those around them. By changing how they use and acquire nonessential resources such as sunlight, nitrogen, or phosphorus, plants can adapt to survive in different environments. Soil microbes, such as mycorrhiza, a type of fungi, can often form symbiotic relationships with roots and help them gain nutrients as well as rapidly grow. We performed an experiment to observe this feat in action, as well as seeing how these other biotic factors like fungi in the soil would affect this process. We used two groups of R. Raphanistrum plants, one planted with mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and one planted without. We hypothesized that the fungi would cause the plants to reallocate to their shoots, and thus grow them larger, but this reallocation would be outpaced by the rapid root growth from the fungal symbiosis. Our hypothesis was in the end supported, and while the weights of the two groups had no significant difference in their means, the difference in lengths was very significant.


Introduction:
Resource allocation is an essential function carried out by plants that allows them to alter the ways in which they compete with their neighbors, despite being immobile themselves. Tall, fast growing trees that dominate canopies, such as oak trees, act as a formidable foe for their low growing friends, as the shade from the canopy astronomically decreases available sunlight. As a result, these non canopy trees reallocate their resources to favor their shoots, referring to the stems and leaves, over their roots in order to maximize the amount of photosynthesis they can perform under these adverse conditions[Johnson:2018]. This relationship of resource allocation between roots and shoots can be referred to as the “Root:Shoot Ratio” of plants. Plants who grow in poorly nutriented areas will likely favor their roots, increasing the R:S ratio, while those who grow in poor lighting will do the opposite. Other biotic factors have large effects on resource allocation, such as the presence of helpful organisms in soil, like the fungi mycorrhiza. This is a type of fungus that has a unique ability to form a mutualistic relationship with plant roots that increases uptake of soil nutrients like phosphorus. The large complex that forms from this relationship vastly increases the surface area available for absorption and decreases diffusion distance for P ions [Bolan:1991]. Understanding and observing this symbiosis is important for gaining knowledge on how greatly outside biotic factors can affect the health or biodiversity in certain places. Areas with extremely poor soil, for example, could have the opportunity to host a large diversity of species on account of nutrient-gaining help from fungi. In order to observe the effects of mycorrhizal fungi in a controlled environment, we performed an experiment with R. Raphanistrum in a greenhouse, with one control group being given no fungi, and the other being planted alongside it. We believe that the presence of mycorrhizae in the treatment group will increase the root:shoot ratio, because the expanding surface area from the fungi will outpace the likely reallocation to the shoots.


Materials and Methods:
To set up the experiment, we first soaked a handful of R. raphanistrum seeds in water for half an hour while we prepared the soil. To do so, we used 6 separate containers for soil, three control and three treatment. We filled each container with soil, and pre-watered the soil as well as putting miracle-gro in each one. The treatment group got a few pinches of mycorrhizal fungus in the soil as well. We then planted seeds in each of the soil containers, and allowed them to grow for two weeks in the greenhouse, watering them every day. After two weeks was up, we removed 3 individual plants from each container, and weighed them after removing the soil. After that we cut the plants in order to separate the roots from the shoots, and weighed them individually, allowing us to see the root:shoot ratio of weight. Finally, we measured each root and shoot with a ruler, in centimetres, in order to get the root:shoot ratio for length, as well as finding the max length shoot and max length root for each group of 3. We used a one tailed T test in order to test the statistical results of the experiment.


Results:
Our collected data showed an obvious trend favoring a higher root:shoot ratio within the treatment group. It was easy to see within the soil their more intricately connected and expansive root systems. It was also evident within the treatment group that the shoots grew as well, they were much taller and had longer leaves than the control group. As shown in both figures one and two, the treatment group was larger in both weight and length, but length was a more noticeable difference. The standard deviations were much higher for weight (Fig. 1) than for length (Fig. 2). 
It was also shown that there was a significant difference between the lengths but not the weights of the two groups.  (Control Mean Length: 1.0416 ± 0.2529; Weight: 0.2595518375 ± 0.2004175401).  (Treatment Mean Length: 2.306243386 ± 0.4514465798; Weight: 0.4241777292 ± 0.1584662011). (Weight Stats: T=1.12, DF=4, P=0.16) (Length Stats: T=4.23, DF=4, P=0.006) 


Discussion:
Based on the data we acquired it is evident that our hypothesis was supported. Despite the fact that we saw no significant difference in the weights between the groups, the difference in lengths was very significant. This is likely a result of what we initially predicted: the symbiotic complex formed between the fungi and roots vastly elongates the roots of plants in order to maximize surface area and nutrient gain. This results in incredibly long roots whose growth outpaces the increase in overall growth in the plants. The weight of a plant is made up more from the shoots than the roots, so the additional growth in roots was enough to produce a large difference in length, but the thinness of the longer roots meant that the weight was not made up. The fungi aims to maximize surface area to gain more nutrients like phosphorus [Bolan:1991], and as such it creates very long and thin roots over thick ones. This helps to maximize surface area because thick roots would waste potential surface area to make up the inside of the roots, so making long and thin roots will provide the plant and fungi with the most additional nutrients. A limitation of this experiment as a whole was the short time period; I don’t believe we had an adequate time to see how the plant would react fully to the presence of fungi in the roots. It may be possible that further reallocation of resources would have occurred if we allowed the plants to grow longer as they adapted to the microbes in the roots. Understanding and utilizing the relationship between these fungi and plants is not only important to agriculture for humans, but also for understanding the ways in which different areas and ecosystems achieve biodiversity. Under conditions in which phosphorus is very low mycorrhizal interaction within plant roots can influence the blossoming ecosystem even if soil nutrients are very low [Jefferies: 2003]. This knowledge can help us to not only understand how certain ecosystems function, but also how to cultivate or help ecosystems that are failing. Areas suffering from poor soil quality could potentially be “saved” if we utilize these symbiotic relationships. It would be important for the future to test how capable these relationships are when it comes to helping ecosystems as well as finding a lower bound for just how little nutrient depleted soil can be to still receive benefits from these microbes.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Mean Root:Shoot ratio in terms of weight(g). Ratio was achieved by dividing the weight of the roots by the weight of the shoots. Control group was planted with just miracle-gro and water, while the treatment group received mycorrhizal fungi as well. 

Figure 2: Mean Root:Shoot ratio in terms of length(mm). Plants were measured using a ruler, the shoot consisted of the vertical length of the stem, with no account paid to the leaves, while roots were from base to tip. Groups are the same as in figure 1.
