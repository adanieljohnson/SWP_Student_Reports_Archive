Title: Treating Manduca sexta caterpillars with a small dosage of IGR shows no significent difference in growth

Abstract:
Insects have hormones that regulate several physiological characteristics, including growth. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) have inhibitory effects on physiological development or over-activate development. In this experiment, we tested the effect of an IGR on the growth of a Manduca hornworm. We hypothesized that the IGR would cause a significent difference between the treated and controll groups. Our results indicated that there was no statistically significent difference in the growth of hornworms treated with IGR and those not treated. This suggests that the IGR had little to no effect on the treated hornworms. However, dosage is important, and here, we used a small amount. In the future, it might be better to increase the dosage to see a difference in treated and controll groups.

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is found in insects and helps in the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars, or tobacco hornworms. JH allows these caterpillars to go through larval stages, that is, it helps them molt and grow into adults.  After a certain number of larval stages, the amount of JH in hornworms decreases, and they enter the pupa stage, ready to become a moth. In this experiment, we will be giving two drops of 1 Gregulator 1: 1250, an insect growth regulator (IGR), which affects levels of JH in hornworms. IGRs can be synthetically made to affect insect processes such as growth, affecting JH and other hormones in insects [Tunaz: 2004]. The higher the levels of JH in an insect, the more time it remains growing. We hypothesize that the caterpillars given the IGR will grow larger than those that do not receive it.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca caterpillars were divided into two groups. Four received normal food with two drops of water each (the controll group). The other four received two pipet drops of the IGR, the experimental group. The hornworms were placed in containers with holes punched on the side and placed in an incubator. The weights of all caterpillars (in grams) were recorded for fourteen consecutive days. We recorded weights because they would allow us to see a change in growth, further helping us find out if the JH hormone levels were higher in one group over the other. A 2-sample t_test was used to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between the weights of the caterpillars in the controll and the treatment group.

Results:
The mean change in growth for the treatment group was 7.26g. This value was 6.31g for the controll group (Fig.1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our data. The mean of the weight for the controll group was not statistically significently different from that of the weight for the experimental group (t_stat = 0.968, d.f. = 6, P = 0.185). We obtained a p_value of 0.185, higher than the alpha p_value of 0.05, which means we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, which stated that there was going to be a significent difference in growth in the treatment group compared to the controll group, was not supported. The p_value was higher than 0.05. This suggests that the IGR had little to no effect on JH, and in effect, on the growth of hornworms, or that the amount of IGR that we placed in the Manduca food was not enough, being only 2 drops per 10 grams of food. A previous experiment similar to ours tested the effects of dosage of a substance called azadirachtin on hormone levels and growth of Manduca caterpillars. Azadirachtin inhibits development in insects. The conclusion of the study was that a low dosage of azadirachtin caused tobacco hornworms to pupate as they normally would, with slight defects, whereas a high dosage resulted fatal to the hornworms [Schlüter: 1985]. If our experiment is performed in the future, it would be advisable to increase the percentage of IGR placed in the Manduca food to obtain a noticeable difference.
