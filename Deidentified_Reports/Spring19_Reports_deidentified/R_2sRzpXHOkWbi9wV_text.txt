Title: Impacts of trace amounts of Insect Growth Regulators on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
 Understanding how the endocrine systems works in insects and what hormones are responsible for insect development is important to help artificially regulate pests in the environment. Recent research has looked at how Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) alter juvenile hormone levels, which are responsible for insect growth and development. Our experiment hypothesizes that minute traces of an IGRs introduced into the Manduca sexta's diet will alter its growth and development compared to a controll group. We observed Manduca sexta's in a controllled environment over two weeks, collecting their weights daily. We ran a statistical analysis on daily growth rate using a two-factor t test. After analysis, we determined our hypothesis was not supported and that further experimentation is needed to reject the null hypothesis. Further research on the efficiency of IGRs will help lower the economic cost of pest controll while limiting collateral damage of the environment. 

Introduction:
Our experiment investigates the effects of hormones on an insect’s life-cycle. Hormones are important for the lifecycle and growth of insects. Specifically, hormones in insects signal both the timing and type of molt completed by the insect. The insect of interest in the current experiment is the Manduca sexta and how one can alter its development. The Manduca sexta has 8 different stages in its lifecycle, 5 of which are instar stages. These stages of development are determined by hormone and directly correlate with the size and growth of the Insect. Recent research indicates that both juvenile hormone and target of rapamycin are the signaling components that are used by the Manduca sexta to regulate the final body size [Hatem: 2015]. Hormone functions in caterpillars (like the Manduca sexta) have been extensively studied by researchers because they have fewer more specific hormones than humans with a number of mediated behavioral outcomes [Nijhout: 2018]. Other studies have demonstrated how insect growth regulators (IGRs) have altered the growth and survival of insects [Tunaz: 2004]. IGRs affect the growth rate and survival of insects by disrupting their hormone production [Wang: 2016]. This stimulates the question of how much disruption to hormone production must occur to see a difference in the growth of the Manduca sexta. With this question in mind, we developed an experiment that alters the Manduca sexta’s exposure to IGR through all of its larval stages. We hypothesized that if you introduce a trace amount of IGRs to impact the juvenile hormone levels of the Manduca sexta, then the hormone imbalance will change the molting process and growth rate of the Manduca sexta. 

Materials and Method:
We randoMly selected eight Manduca sextas in the first instar larva phase and then randoMly assigned them into two groups consisting of four caterpillars. The controll group experienced no manipulation and was given ten grams of food with three drops of water added. The experimental group experienced a manipulation and was given ten grams of food with an added three drops of juvenile hormone. All Manduca sextas were placed into a divided container which was kept in a controllled environment of an incubator. We then documented their weight in grams and recorded visual evidence of growth through photos over the two-week period. After the two-week period, we calculated each caterpillar’s average daily growth rate. Finally, a two-tailed two sample t_test was then run to determine significance between the difference in average growth rate of the controll group and the experimental group.

Results:
 The controll group possessed a mean daily growth rate of .648 grams while the experimental group possessed a mean daily growth rate of .658 grams (Figure 1). The standard deviation of the weight for the controll group was .363 and the standard deviation for the experimental group was .205 (Figure 2). We used a two-tailed, two sample t_test to analyze the results. There was no significent difference between the mean daily growth of our controll group and our experimental group, t_stat = .049, d.f. = 6, P = .963. During the last days of observations there was no visible difference between the size of both groups. They all appeared to be around the fourth and fifth phase of the instar larva; some had begun the process of pupa exclusion through molting. Overall the same pattern of daily growth was observed between the two groups.  

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the introduction of trace amounts of an IGR to the Manduca sexta, would change its molting process and growth rate, was not supported. With the recorded p_value, .963, being  greater than .05 we can conclude that our results were not statistically significent; indicating that most of our results were due to probable chance. We should retain our null hypothesis that IGRs will not change the molting process and growth rate of the Manduca sexta. However, earlier studies have proven that IGRs do impact insect growth/development. For example,  linden bugs had slow hatch rate and failed to mature into adults due to being placed on paper towels soaked in an IGR compound [Tunaz: 2004]. Presently, specific IGR compounds have been developed to target certain biochemistry and physiology components of insect development to increase their effectiveness [Tunaz: 2004]. In our study, there was not a large enough ratio of hormone to food to allow the IGR to enter the Manduca sexta’s digestive system and take effect.  I believe that if there was more of the IGR in the food then the growth rate of the experimental group would be slower and the caterpillars would die before pupating. More research is needed to determine at what amount IGRs become effective to alter insect growth and development. Further research is important because knowing the lowest amount of IGR exposure to become effective will allow a more economical treatment of insect pest in agriculture with little collateral damage on the environment.
