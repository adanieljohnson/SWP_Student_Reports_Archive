Title: Effect of excess nitrogen on energy allocation in Pisum sativun (field pea) plants

Abstract:
In this experiment, we wanted to examine how field pea plants allocated their energy differently if nitrogen was added to the soil. Energy allocation is an organism’s way of adjusting to the environment in order to obtain what it needs in the most energy-efficient way. To test this, we compared the growth of two groups of field peas (Pisum sativun), with one group having 42.5 grams excess nitrogen in the soil. After 14 days, we measured this difference in energy allocation by examining root:shoot (R:S) ratios based on length of the plants. Our results showed no growth in the treatment group, which had an average R:S ratio of 0.000, while the controll group had an average R:S ratio of 0.5960. The seeds in the treatment group also had mold growing on them. The lack of growth was most likely due to an error in preparation, specifically too much nitrogen being added to the soil, most likely causing the soil to become toxic to the plant. In future experiments, we would use 0.8 grams nitrogen to prevent the soil from becoming toxic. Because of our results, our experiment was inconclusive. However, the findings did reveal the importance of considering the effect of nitrogen fertilizers on the mass agricultural production of food, considering the long-term effects it could have on the soi

Introduction:
In order for plants to survive, grow, and thrive, it is necessary for them to allocate their resources. In other words, they use the resources they have in the most effective way possible to adjust what they need based on what the environment provides. Resource allocation is the pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources [Johnson: 2016]. For plants, their limited resources could be sunlight, water, and nutrients in the soil such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur. Nitrogen is an important component of soil for plants because it is necessary for development and productivity [Kraiser: 2011]. Research has shown that it has an especially important role in the initial development of roots and shoots, finding that “root growth was reduced under both higher and lower fertilization levels” [Harper: 1974] [Costa: 2002] [Barraclough: 1989].
We can see how different plants allocate their resources based on environmental conditions through their leaves, stems, and roots. Leaves are the main area in which photosynthesis occurs. Stems are involved in light capture because they are the main source of structural support for the leaf. Roots are the primary source of absorption in the soil [Johnson: 2016]. In plants, energy is allocated to grow different parts of the plant depending on which parts need to be grown the most. Specifically, the plant can put energy toward growing shoots or roots. Growing shoots would allow for the plant to have better access to sunlight by extending the area in which its leaves can reach in order to effectively compete for available sunlight. Growing roots would allow for the plant to have better access to water or nutrients by extending the area that the roots can reach in the ground. Plants that allocate their energy towards their roots are most likely plants that are in dry areas thus allowing them to attain the little water that is available. However, if a plant has enough water in the soil, they will be less likely to allocate their energy toward their roots. By examining these aspects of plants, we can draw conclusions and make inferences on how they allocate their resources to adjust to environmental conditions.
We predict that if an excess of nitrogen is added to the soil, then field peas will allocate their energy to their shoots, thus having a smaller R:S ratio.


Materials and Method:
	We began with four pots of field peas, adding 10 Ml of Miracle-Gro to each one. Two of the pots were controlls, while the other two were our treatment plants. We added 42.5 grams of nitrogen to both treatment plants. After adding water to all the pots, enough to which the soil was damp but there were no puddles or excess water running off of the pot, we waited 14 days to allow the plants to grow before taking measurements. During this time, they were kept in warm conditions with access to sunlight, and were watered once every other day. After this period, we measured the length of the shoots and roots of the two groups of plants. Using a one-tailed two-sample t_test, we determined whether the difference in R:S ratio based on length between the two plants was statistically significent. 

Results:
The average R:S length ratio of the controll group was 0.5860 ± 0.1238. The average R:S length ratio of the treatment group was 0.000 ± 0.000. There was a significent difference between controll and treatment R:S length ratios (T-value = 11.6, d.f. = 10, P-value = 2.01E-7).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported. We were correct in predicting the treatment group having a small R:S ratio, however, the only reason it is small is because the plants in the treatment group did not grow [Figure 1]. The reason for this was most likely due to an excess of nitrogen added to the soil, causing the pH of the soil to change to the point where it became toxic [Ruan: 2007]. Based on findings related to nitrogen’s role in seed development and initial plant growth, high amounts of nitrogen can impede biomass production [Harper: 1974] [Costa: 2002] [Barraclough: 1989], as observed in this experiment. Without growth, the dark, moist environment of the plants fostered an environment for mold to grow on the seeds, providing an explanation for why mold was found on the seeds of the treatment group. 
In summary, the correct prediction in which group would have the larger R:S ratio is not adequately justified due to the error in preparing our experiment. However, the results of this experiment are relevant to agricultural applications. It is clear that a large excess of nitrogen on seeds can have catastrophic effects for development and growth. Yet, nitrogen fertilizer is understood to be a necessary use in agricultural food production to compensate for enormous population growth in the last century [Frink: 1999]. In addition, nitrogen follows a path in the atmosphere, moving (in different forms) through soil, plants, animals, and the atmosphere [Stein: 2016], a process known as the nitrogen cycle. However, the addition of nitrogen to the soil from fertilizers alters the amount of nitrogen in this phase of the cycle, which could have drastic effects on the process as a whole, leading to issues related to the ozone layer and enhancing the greenhouse effect [Fields: 2004]. Based on the results of this experiment, it is necessary to consider the effects that a buildup of nitrogen from fertilizers could have on plant growth, food production, and the environment overall. 
In future experiments, we would reduce the amount of nitrogen added to the soil. The ideal amount of additional nitrogen for field peas would be about 0.8 grams [Li: 2012]. If this experiment were to be redone, we would follow the same procedure, only changing the amount of nitrogen added from 42.5 grams to 0.8 grams.
