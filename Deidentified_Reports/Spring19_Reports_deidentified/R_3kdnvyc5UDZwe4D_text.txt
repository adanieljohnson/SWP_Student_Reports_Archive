Title: The Effect of Added JH Analog, Methoprine, on the Weight Gain of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. 

Abstract:
Pest controll is a controversial yet important topic in the world of agriculture. The problem is how to get rid of pests in the most humane way possible. IGR is a form of pest controll that inhibits a pest’s development and, as a result, its reproduction. Here, we observe the effects of an IGR that contains an analog to the Juvenile hormone, Methoprine. The prediction was that adding this analog to the caterpillars’ diets would result in more significent weight gain than the controll group. Our data showed no significent difference in weight gain between the two groups, therefore supporting our null hypothesis. While there was no difference in weight gain, there were observable differences between the two groups that show that Methoprine may possibly be an effective IGR. 

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone that affects the development of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. It regulates the type of molt the caterpillar has by delaying the commitment pulse, and therefore delaying pupation until the caterpillar is ready to develop.  Because of this, the amount of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca Sexta caterpillars naturally increases before the commitment pulse. Low levels of JH cause an early development into adulthood. Caterpillars in this case lack the nutrients it needs to thrive as an adult and lack resources needed to survive. Increased levels of the JH hormone before the commitment pulse would delay the commitment pulse, therefore pushing back pupation and development into adulthood. This is because JH inhibits something called “PTTH and ecdysteroid secretion. Once JH is cleared from the hemolymph some time after the larva passes the critical weight, secretion of PTTH and ecdysteroids is disinhibited,” ultimately causing pupation [Davidowitz, 2004]. This information can potentially be useful with IGR’s. An IGR can “accelerate or inhibit a physiological regulatory process essential to the normal development of the insect or its progeny” [Siddall, 1976]. PreCore is a specific type of IGR that acts as a JH analog, meaning it works to inhibit an insect’s natural development into adulthood or potentially causes “an abnormality which impairs the survival of the insect” [Siddall, 1976] The JH analog in PreCore is called Methoprene which shares similar chemical properties with JH hormones [Siddall, 1976]. Since adding JH delays the commitment pulse and pushes back development into adulthood, its analog works as an effective IGR because it prevents the insect from pupating and ultimately drops the rate of insects reaching reproductive age. The question is how the caterpillars’ physical appearance will stray from the norm if PreCore, the methoprene-containing IGR, was added to the caterpillars’ diets. If 8 drops of PreCore Methoprene, Juvenile Hormone analog, are added to the caterpillar food, then the caterpillars will increase in weight (g). The null hypothesis would be if 8 drops of PreCore Methoprene, Juvenile Hormone analog, are added to the caterpillar food, then there will be no difference in weight between the experimental and controll groups. 

Materials and Method:
1.	Get two plastic bins, with 4 compartments each. This will be where you place your caterpillars. Mark one bin as controll, and the other as experimental. Label each compartment with the number of your caterpillar. Using a hole poker, poke two holes in the external sides of each compartment. Make sure the holes are open, to ensure the caterpillars can breathe.
2.	Select 8 caterpillars from the container. Make sure the caterpillars are relatively small, larger sized caterpillars are normally closer to the commitment pulse.
3.	Place each caterpillar, one at a time, on the scale, and record its weight, in grams. After measuring each caterpillar, place them in an organized order on the table (make sure you remember which caterpillar is which). 
4.	Measure out 40 grams of the stock caterpillar food, in a weighboat. Then, in a separate container, break apart the 40 grams of food. Next, add 8 drops of PreCore Methoprene to the food. Mix everything together. Repeat this step for the controllled group, and add 8 drops of deionized water, instead of PreCore.
5.	Measure out 10 grams of the mixed food on the scale. Before placing the food in each compartment, squish the food together into one, collected ball. This makes it easier for the caterpillars to eat. After you place the food into each compartment, place each caterpillar into the compartment.
6.	Repeat steps 3-5 every day for a period of 7 days. Before adding the food, clean each bin out, and dump any excess waste into a trash bin.


Results:
The change in weight from day one to day eleven in each of the caterpillars was calculated. This was done for caterpillar 1-4 in the experimental group and caterpillars 1-4 in the controll group. Then, the quantities for each controll caterpillar and each experimental caterpillar were averaged, resulting in an average change in weight for the two groups (controll and experimental). The average for the change in weight in the experimental group was 11.6+/-0.578 and our average change in weight for the controll group was 12.26+/-.595. For this experiment, a two-sample t_test was conducted. Since the data only charted growth in one direction, a one-tailed p_value was necessary and was calculated it to be .081381. The degrees of freedom were also calculated to be 6. Over the eleven days recorded, both groups of caterpillars gained weight and ate all of their food. By day eleven, some of the weight began to decrease and the controll caterpillars began to display signs of reaching their commitment pulses. By day thirteen, the experimental caterpillars began to die. 

Discussion:
In this experiment, adding 8 drops of PreCore, an IGR containing Methoprene, to the caterpillars’ diet did not create a significent difference in weight between the experimental and controll groups. In fact, the controll group of caterpillars that had water in their diet instead of the methoprene drops experienced slightly more weight gain than the other group. Since our data was not significent, the slight difference in weight displayed in figure 1 is probably due to chance. Because of this, the null hypothesis that the JH analog, Methoprene, does not cause a difference in weight is supported. While there was no significent difference in weight between the controll and experimental caterpillars, there was a physical difference observed between the two groups that did not involve weight. By day 11, some of the controll caterpillars had reached their commitment pulse while the experimental caterpillars never reached it. demonstrates how an increased amount of JH Hormone in caterpillars delays the commitment pulse, pupation, and ultimately the development into adulthood. Instead, about the time that all of the controll group had reached commitment pulse, the experimental caterpillars started to die. Two of the experimental caterpillars died, both around day 13 and 14. Also after day eleven, both groups of caterpillars experienced decreasing weight. This occurred for the controll group because when the caterpillar reaches something called the “critical weight” it tends to “stop feeding, purge their gut contents, enter a wandering stage, and form a pupa about 6 days later” [Davidowitz, 2004]. This critical weight tends to be about 12 grams which corresponds with the data because the caterpillars started losing weight when they reached that point. The experimental group also experienced a decrease in weight most likely because they were about to die. This experiment shows the potential effectiveness of using a JH analog in an IGR. In the world of pest controll, the specific weight gain of the caterpillar is not as important as reducing its opportunity to develop and reproduce. If this was the focus, the experiment was definitely successful in showing how adding a JH analog can prevent the caterpillar from developing naturally, ultimately resulting in the caterpillar’s death. In order to determine exactly how much of the JH analog, methoprene, will delay the caterpillars’ development long enough to ultimately result in their death, further experiments must be conducted.
