Title: Proline effect on spinach leaves photosynthetic activity while under salt stress

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is driven by electron carriers and photosystem 1 and 2. Under salt stress, plant’s photosynthetic activity goes down, however, in response to environmental stress, proline is produced which is an amino acid that helps stabilize conditions within the stressed cell. Thus, we wanted to see how additional proline affects photosynthetic rates when spinach leaves are under salt stress. We tested rates with proline concentrations of 20mM, 40mM, and 60mM against a controll group without proline, all in salt stress. We used a Hills Reaction procedure and a series of assays to test absorbance using the electron acceptor DCIP. The effects of proline on salt stressed plant’s photosynthetic rate are examined and interpreted in the following report.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the chemical process plants undergo in order to obtain energy. In this experiment, we focused on the first stage of photosynthesis called the light dependent reaction. In this stage light excites an electron in photosystem II which passes it along the thylakoid membrane driving a proton gradient into the thylakoid lumen. The excited electron finally gets passed to photosystem I where it is captured by an electron acceptor NADP (Johnson:2016). In this experiment, we are measuring the activity of photosystem II by using an alternate electron acceptor known as DCIP. This acceptor will lose its blue color when electrons bind to it, so we will measure activity with a spectrometer and a series of assays. Salt stress causes an excessive accumulation of Na+ and Cl- ions in the plants and this can cause inactivation of enzymes and decrease the efficiency of photosynthesis(Sudhir:2004). Thus, in response to salt stress, many plants use proline which is an amino acid that plants release in excess while under environmental stress. It specifically acts in osmotic adjustment to help stabilize the cell, but it also acts as a buffer in cellular redox potentials and stabilizing sub-cellular structures (Hayat:2012). Furthermore, Proline can cause salt stress responsive gene expression. Ashraf noticed in his experiment that proline had different effects depending on the plant species. Ashraf’s experiment found that proline has positive effects on salt stress plants, but if too much proline is added, it can be harmful to the cell (Ashraf:2007). In a different experiment done by Ben Ahmed, he tested Olive Trees photosynthetic rates under salt stress in regard to proline. He found that proline helped stabilize and reduce the salts effect on photosynthetic rates (Ben Ahmed:2010). Thus, in our experiment we wanted to see the effects exogenous proline has on salt stressed plant’s photosynthetic rate. We believe that the addition of proline will help increase photosynthetic activity when under salt stress.


Materials and Method:
We enriched chloroplasts by differential centrifugation. We took the central veins from 4 spinach leaves, ground them up, and added 10 Ml of 400 mM sucrose in tricine buffer (pH8). We then strained the paste through a cheesecloth and into a beaker adding 10 Ml more of the buffer. We stored 200 microliters on ice. Next, we put the remaining paste into a chilled centrifuge tube and spun it at 200x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. This sample was placed in a chilled centrifuge leaving out the debris. We then removed 200 microliters of this liquid and stored it on ice. We spun the 50 Ml tube at 1000xG for 10 min at 4 degree Celsius and poured this solution into a clean 50 microliter tube. We took the remaining liquid and added 200 microliters of grinding buffer and gently stir. This will be the liquid you use for the next step.
	The second part of the experiment involved quantifying PSII reduction activity using the Hill Reaction procedure. First, we labeled 16 test tubes: 1 blank(8 Ml of water and 2Ml reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), 3 with chloroplast(6Ml water, 2Ml 130mM DCIP, 2Ml reaction buffer), 3 with chloroplast under salt stress (5Ml water, 2Ml 130mM DCIP, 1Ml 2M NaCl), 3 with chloroplast salt stress and 20 mM proline (4.96Ml water, 2Ml 130mM DCIP, 2Ml reaction buffer, 1Ml 2M NaCl, .04Ml proline), 3 with 40mM proline (4.92Ml water, 2Ml 130mM DCIP, 2Ml reaction buffer, 1Ml 2M NaCl, .08Ml proline), and 3 with 60mM proline(4.88Ml water, 2Ml 130mM DCIP, 2Ml reaction buffer, 1Ml 2M NaCl, .12Ml proline). All of these tubes had 100 microliters of chloroplasts. Lastly, there were 3 tubes of no chloroplast with 6Ml water, 2Ml reaction buffer, and 2Ml DCIP. All of these tubes had their absorbance measured at 420nm at time zero, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes after the reaction buffer was added. The percent change from time zero was also recorded. We performed a one tailed t_test to determine the significance of our results between the percent change in absorbance over time.


Results:
After the Hill Reaction procedure had been done and the assays had been run we compared the absorbance levels from time zero in order to check the percent change in absorbance. The groups all started out at different absorbance changes after the first 10 minutes. The 60mM proline group had the biggest change in absorbance at 1471.72 percent followed by 40mM at 1279.09, 20mM at 1064.89, salt stress at 1029.15, no chloroplast at 755.3, and no salt stress at -22.89. However, after 20 minutes of reaction, the percent change from time zero dropped dramatically to around -25 percent for all groups besides the no chloroplasts which was closer to -4.86 percent. After another 10 minutes, the percent changes stayed very similar, but they all increased 3-10 percent from time 20 minutes. You can see these trends in figure 1 which shows how the groups drastically increase after 10 minutes of reaction and drastically decrease the last 20 minutes from that 10 minute point. In the first ten minutes the proline groups increased absorbance more than the groups without proline with 60 mM having the highest absorbance rate followed by 40mM and 20mM proline groups. This may show the effects of proline, however, the effects seemed to stop taking effect after 10 minutes. In order to compare the changes in absorbance, we ran a one tailed t_test between the salt stress groups and the three proline groups. For the 20mM proline groups, the degrees of freedom, t-value, and p_value were 4, 0.018, and 0.493 respectively. The 40mM groups yielded 4, 0.150, and 0.444. The 60 mM groups yielded 4, 0.240, 0.411. This shows how there was no difference significent difference between the proline groups and the salt stressed groups in photosynthetic rates.


Discussion:
After evaluating the activity of DCIP as an electron activity in the spinach chloroplast under salt stress and exogenous proline, we found that there was no significent difference in photosynthetic rates between the groups tested with proline and the ones without it, contrary to what we originally thought. Although Ben Ahmed found that proline helped photosynthetic activity in salt stress plants (Ben Ahmed:2010), there may have been a different effect on spinach leaves that may not have impacted activity. Ashraf said that proline can have different effects on different species of plants, thus, the spinach leaves may react differently to proline. According to Hare proline stabilizes NADH/NAD+ levels which helps photosynthetic activity under salt stress (Hare: 1997). Thus, since we used DCIP to show photosynthetic activity, it may not have had the same effect on this alternate electron acceptor. This is one explanation, but because proline helps enzymatic activity this is a less likely explanation. Thus, we can say that proline most likely does not have the same desired effect on the species of spinach leaves and their photosynthetic activity. However, it may be interesting to look if proline has benefits for a short time since we did see increases after 10 minutes that then went away at 20 minutes. This result may help the spinach agriculture business understand how to help crops grow when impacted by salt stress. If proline is no help over long periods of time, then they can save time and money by not using it. This experiment also may support how proline has different effects on different species. In the future, we may want to test how proline does impact spinach leaves under environmental stress, perhaps it stabilizes structure more than enzymatic activity or perhaps it has no impact at all.
