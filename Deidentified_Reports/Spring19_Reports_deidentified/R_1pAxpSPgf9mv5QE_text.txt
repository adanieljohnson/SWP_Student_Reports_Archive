Title: The Manduca Sexta has a Negative reaction to Juvenile Hormone

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta tobacco hornworm is very sensitive to hormones, as they can be detrimental to their growth and development stage of life. In this experiment, the experimenters  tested the effect of juvenile hormone in their food by separating them and giving out controll and experimental food. The results of their study were not shocking, because they found that most of the experimental group died. They used a t test to determine if the differences they found were significent and in the end they were. 



Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta caterpillar is a tobacco hornworm with an extreme sensitivity to hormones, both inside and out of its body, specifically juvenile hormone and E20. When it has reached full maturity, these hornworms metamorphosize into moths. This pupation is heavily reliant on these hormones and if their exposure to them is altered, it can be fatal to these hornworms (Roundtreer: 1986). The specific hormone that the experimenters worked with is the juvenile hormone. In their experiment, they be tested the Manudca Sextaâ€™s reaction to an increase of juvenile hormone in their diet. If the Manduca sexta is exposed to an excess of juvenile hormone, that will stagnate their life cycle, causing them to remain in their early juvenile stages, which in turn means that they will fail to pupate. This experiment was conducted so that the experimenters could understand the effect that hormones can have on the growth and development of an organism. 



Materials and Method:
The experimenters created uniform environments for our manduca sexta caterpillars to live during the time of their experiment by placing them in an incubator and allowing them to remain there when we were not weighing them. Initially, they began by choosing our caterpillars and putting them in plastic containers. Using a scale, they measured their initial weight (in grams) and recorded it in a shared Excel spreadsheet. They gave each subject 10 grams of food, and in the controll group we used 6 drops of distilled water to soften and hydrate it and with the experimental group, they also used the 6 drops of water but in addition to this we used 6 drops of juvenile hormone. Everyday, a single team member returned to the lab, weighed each caterpillar, replaced the food respectively, cleaned/disposed of excrement left by the caterpillar, and returned it to the incubator when we were done. After 12 days, the experiment was concluded and they weighed the final weight of each caterpillar and disposed of them and the containers when we were done. As a group they gathered to complete the statistics necessary and we decided to use a 2-tailed, 2-sample t_test. They gathered the information from our shared spreadsheet and used the spreadsheet provided to us to run the test. 



Results:
In the experiment, the experimenters found that their hypothesis was supported in that most of the experimental group did not make it to the end of the experiment. They found that the controll group consistently gained weight throughout the experiment and towards the end they began to lose weight. However, the experimental group that received the hormone in their food began losing weight on day 2, and some died before the week was over. 

Discussion:
In the experiment it is seen that the Manduca Sexta that were exposed to the juvenile hormone did not increase in size as the controll group did and this means that we would fail to reject the hypothesis and it is supported. In an experiment done by the University of Washington, these experimenters also found that the Manduca sexta that they gave juvenile hormone to also failed to grow and develop properly, which also means they failed to pupate (Kinguchi: 1978). Due to the excess of Juvenile hormone, and the role that it plays in the development in the caterpillar, they failed to pupate and in the end, most of the caterpillars we experimented with died, because of this. On a broader scale this means that if these Manduca Sexta do not receive the proper amount of hormones, depending on which hormone is specifically being experimented with, they will either fail to pupate altogether or pupate too early. This can now not only be applied to these organisms, but in a way can translate over to all organisms. Every living thing had hormones that regulate the growth and development of its life just as the Manduca Sexta.

Figure #1: The Average weight change in the Manduca sexta, where the blue represents the controll group and red is the experimental group. We see that our experimental group had the greatest amount of change within the Manduca Sexta. The t value was 2.65, the p value is .037, and the degrees of freedom is 2.
