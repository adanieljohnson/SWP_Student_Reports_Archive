Title: Presence of female conspecific audience increase male Betta splendens’ display of agnostic behavior

Abstract:
Animals have intraspecific and inter specific behaviors. In sexual selection, the direct male to male competition is a kind of intraspecific behavior. Betta splendens (Siamese fighting fish) have interesting pattern of agonistic displays and thus is a good subject for studying animal intraspecific behavior and sexual selection. Effect of presence or absence of a female audience on B. splenden male-male agonistic display was studied. The expectation was that with presence of a female B. splenden, males will exhibit an increase in aggressiveness (assessed by score of aggressiveness per minutes) due to greater competition for mating. The resulting data rejected this hypothesis, as it showed non-significant increase of aggressiveness of the experimental group (with female audience) in comparison to the control group (without female audience). This result shows that presence of female conspecific audience does not increase B. splenden male-male aggressive behavior.

Introduction:
Betta splenden is a species of commonly seen aquarium fish and is known as Siamese fighting fish. Betta splendens are originated from Thailand with wild types that usually have bigger body size than the domesticated ones [Johnson: 2018]. The wild type B. splendens change their color and behavior (especially motions of its fins) with presence of another male Betta. Male Betta has two main types of intraspecific behaviors, broadside movement and facing movement. In the broadside movements, Betta splendens turn their turn its side towards the opponents. The broadside movement include: (with ascending aggressiveness) pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. In facing movements, the Betta male face opponent and may display behaviors include (with ascending aggressiveness) pectoral fin erection, gill cover spreading and red mane, in which the Betta flip its gill and expand the branchiostegal membrane.
From our previous experiments, two males with significant body size difference are used, the male with larger body size displays more aggressive behavior and higher aggressiveness than the smaller male. While the smaller male shows fewer agonistic behaviors shortly before becoming submissive. This behaving pattern remain unaffected after 5 minutes resting period, with or without male-male physical contact/ with or without presence of a female. However, from previous studies, researchers found that with presence of female conspecific audience the tested males display more aggressive behaviors in comparison to absence of female audience. The two males perform significantly more tail beatings and spend longer time on gill cover erection [Doutrelant: 2001]. One possible reason for our previous test result might be caused by individuals’ relative dominance inhibiting the submissive male’s agonistic behavior. According to previous researches, larger body size is an important determinant for dominance in males [Schuett: 1997]. 
In this experiment, changes of male Betta intraspecific agonistic behavior in response to presence or absence of conspecific female is tested. Since direct male-to-male competition is a very important way of sexual selection, we hypothesize that with presence of a female conspecific audience, two male Betta with similar body size will display greater level of aggressiveness per minute interacting with each other.

Materials and Methods:
Three B. splendens male with similar body size and a female B. splenden were used in this experiment. All individuals were placed in an aquarium separated with removable non-transparent partitions. For trail without female Betta audience, each male individual interacted with other two males for once. During experiment, one partition was removed, which limited all movement in 2/3 of the total length of the aquarium. For trail with female audience presence, two males (still each male interact with the rest two males individually) were placed in the same amount of space with the female B. splenden. 
The aggressiveness of male B. splendens were assessed via a scoring system. For which we assigned scores of aggressiveness for each agonistic behavior in the scale of 1 to 5. In this scale: for broadside movements, pelvic fin flickering=1, tail beating=2, tail flashing=3 and for facing movements, pectoral fins erection=1, gill covers spreading=2, and red mane=3. For more aggressive behaviors like physical contacts/ conflicts, we assigned darting=4 and biting=5. Each trail is 2 minutes, the male individuals might be separated before the time limit, if any vigorous physical contact were observed in order to prevent injury. 5 minutes resting time were required between trails to prevent habituation. The overall aggressiveness of B. splendens was measured by score per minutes, average was calculated for both control group (without female audience) and experimental group (with presence of female). Paired t-test was used to assess the difference between the score of aggressiveness per minute of males with and without female B. splenden present.

Results:
The mean score per minute of the control group (no audience) is 6.133 ±4.274 (point per minute).  The mean score per minute of the experimental group (with audience) is 12.795 ±11.805 (point per minute). The paired t-test shows that the score per minute of experimental group is not significantly higher than the control group (t-stat = 1.426, df = 5, P = 0.213). During the experiment, the agonistic behavior with higher aggressiveness is observed in shorter time with female audience presence in comparison to the control group, the male B. splendens lunch into physical contacts faster with female audience presence. The female B. splenden did not display any kind of aggressive behavior. The male B. splenden with no losing experience (male 2) show the highest aggressiveness in comparison to both of its opponents (male 1 and 3) and will actively perform behaviors like darting and biting.

Discussion:
This experiment rejects our hypothesis, that with the presence of a female audience, aggressiveness per minute of male to male agonistic behavior will not increase significantly. We observed decrease in time the males needed to display the most aggressive display (darting or biting) with the presence with female during the experiments. This experiment gave us a result different from previous studies suggested that the males will show significantly higher aggressiveness with the presence of a female B. splenden [Doutrelant: 2001]. 
However, further studies could be done with a larger sample size of males, without testing each male for twice within 24 hours or repeat the study with longer resting time for each male individuals. Since as previous studies suggested, dominance effect is related to past winning or losing experience. B. splendens with the similar mirror display but with different winning or losing result display differently. The male B. splenden with wining experience became dominant, while the B. splenden with losing experiment would not display [Wallen: 1985]. This matches our observation in the experiment, the trails with the two males with injured fin (male 1 and male 3) from a previous losing experience has much less interaction with one another. The male with more severe injury did not display (score=0) within 2 minutes limit both with or without the female presence, while the male with less severe injury displayed and showed a slight increase in aggressiveness with presence of a female audience within 2 minutes time limit (score without female=6, score with female=9). The two injured male B. splendens did not show any physical contact that may lead to any injury towards its opponent, thus for both trails (with or without female audience) with male 1 and 3, we do not have to separate them before reaching time limit. Thus, the losing experience and injury of the fin might be inhibiting the agonistic display of the male B. splendens. With more male B. splendens and longer resting time, we would be able to minimize the effect of the past losing and wining experience. By learning effect of a female audience on B. splendens male-male aggressive behavior, we can understand better on how to breed B. splendens in a more efficient way.
