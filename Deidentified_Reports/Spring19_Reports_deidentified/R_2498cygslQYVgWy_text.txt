Title: Effects of temperature on the Hill reaction and photosynthesis in spinach leaves

Abstract:
Temperature variation has a significent effect on plant biology and the various chemical reactions that drive photosynthesis, and drastic shifts can cause damage and inhibit the process of photosynthesis. An experiment was performed to test how excessive heat or cold affected photosynthesis in the PSII stage of photosynthetic reactions in spinach leaves. This was tested using the Hill reaction to monitor reduction of DCIP in chloroplasts in various ambient temperatures, simulating the reaction that takes place during photosynthesis. No significent difference was found between room and low temperatures, but significent difference was found between room and high temperatures and low and high temperatures, as high temperatures caused DCIP reduction to halt while cold and room temperature had no significent difference in reduction of DCIP, most likely due to spinach’s resistance to cold, suggesting cold resistance in spinach may be tied to the processes in PSII, opening future study possibilities.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a vital part of life on Earth, allowing for the fixation of light energy into chemical energy that is usable by almost all forms of life. Photosynthesis at its core is a series of chemical reactions that take place within a photosynthetic cell, with many steps leading from initiation to synthesis of a final product. An important initial step is the aptly named light reactions, in which light energy from the sun is taken in through chloroplasts in the producing cell and used create chemical energy. In a specific part of the light reactions called Photosystem II or PSII, light is captured and used to split water molecules, resulting in the release of electrons, which are taken up by the electron carrier NADP and used to create a usable form of chemical energy, ATP [Ostrovsky: 1981]. This important reduction of NADP is a vital first step in photosynthesis, and its success determines whether the rest of the light reactions and photosynthesis can continue. An important question to ask is what factors affect the success of this reaction, and how these factors can be manipulated to improve or maintain photosynthetic production. One important factor that affects plants and their photosynthesis is temperature. The effects of excessively high and low temperature have been extensively documented, with temperature affecting things like pollination, leaf development, and root structure [Hatfield: 2015]. In addition, photosynthesis has been shown to be affected by lower temperatures, as long term damage can be caused to both PSI and PSII, with PSII being more heavily damaged [Zhang: 2004]. In order to observe the effects of a certain condition on photosynthesis, the respective reactions must be simulated in a way that behaves similarly to the way the reactions occur within the cell. One such method of simulating the actions of PSII is the famous Hill Reaction. In the Hill reaction, chloroplasts are separated and isolated from their original cells and placed in buffer solution along with dichlorophenolindophenol, or DCIP. DCIP acts as an electron acceptor similarly to NADP, which is not accessible to the chloroplasts once they have been removed by the cell. DCIP is a dark blue solution which becomes lighter as it reduces to DCIPH, allowing for the progress of the reaction to be monitored and measured using a photo spectrometer.  By measuring the absorbance of the DCIP+chloroplasts solution, one can determine the nature and progression of the light reaction, and determine if certain factors positively or negatively affect photosynthesis. Given the nature of the photosynthetic light reactions and plant biology, as well as past research, excessively high or low temperatures are predicted to have a negative effect on photosynthesis reactions in PSII. The effects of temperature on photosynthesis will be observed to determine how temperature affects photosynthetic reactions in PSII by using the Hill Reaction in chloroplasts isolated from spinach leaves to reduce DCIP to simulate the first step of photosynthesis using in order to gain a better understanding of photosynthetic production.

Materials and Method:
To begin, veins were removed from several spinach leaves and then rinsed. The de-veined leaves were then placed in a chilled mortar and pestle along with 10Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), and then ground into a fine paste. An additional 10Ml of buffer were added, and the solution was then strained through cheesecloth into a chilled tube. The tube was then centrifuged at 1200rpm for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then removed,  leaving a pellet of material which contained the chloroplasts needed. An additional 20Ml of grinding buffer were added to the tube and gently stirred. 16 test tubes were then prepared and labeled, the first being labeled blank and the others being numbered 1-15. 100 uL of chloroplast solution was added to each tube along with 2Ml DCIP and 2Ml reaction buffer, as well as 8Ml of water for the blank and 6Ml of water for the numbered tubes. The spectrometer was then set to 600nm and blanked using the blank tube, and the initial absorbances of each tube were measured and recorded. After that, tubes 1-5 were placed in room temperature conditions (about 21°C), tubes 6-10 were placed in a hot water bath set to 48°C, and tubes 11-15 were placed in an ice bath, all of which were underneath light sources. The tubes were left there for 10 minutes, after which they were removed for a short time. The spectrometer was blanked again, and absorbances were measured. This step was repeated 2 more times every 10 minutes, with % change from the original absorbance being calculated between measurements. Once 30 minutes had passed and absorbance had been measured from 0 to 30 minutes, the average % change of each group (both temperature and time groups) were calculated, and tested for significent difference using a Two-Way ANOVA with Repeated Measures at an alpha of 0.05 to test the differences in the interaction between temperature groups overtime. If significent difference was detected , the averages were further analyzed using Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference Test of means in order to specify which means have significent difference from each other.

Results:
Overall the results showed significent differences between temperature groups, time groups, and the interaction between temperature and change over time. The results of the ANOVA shown in Table 1 show that there is a p_value of around 0.01 for the interactions mentioned,  which is smaller than the given alpha of 0.05, denoting significent difference among all 3 groups. Figure 1 shows the average % change in absorbance between temperature groups over the course of the experiment, with groups in room and low temperature having steady and somewhat constant reduction of DCIP for lower absorbance, while the high temperature group sees an initial increase in reduction, followed by a sharp decrease and cessation of reduction. The results of the Tukey’s HSD test(qcrit(d.f.=30, alpha=0.05)=2.89), shown in Table 2, indicate a highly significent amount of difference between room and high temperature reduction of DCIP(q value=3.3), a close to significent difference between low and high temperature groups (q value= 2.61), and an insignificent amount of difference between room and low temperature groups (q value= 1.1). 

Discussion:
The significent difference in reduction  of DCIP suggests that extreme temperatures can have a significent affect on reduction of DCIP, and by extension the process of photosynthesis. The presence of significent difference over time is to be expected given the nature of chemical reactions, meaning that the real source of difference comes from the main independent variable; temperature group. As shown in both Figure 1 and in the results of the Tukey’s HSD test show an insignificent amount of difference between low and room temperature groups, suggesting that photosynthesis is not significently hindered by excessively cold temperatures. While the difference between high and low temp was just under the q critical value for alpha of 0.05, it is close enough (p_value of around 0.07) that it can be considered somewhat significent, at least suggesting the possibility of significance if more replicants are used in future tests. The significent difference between room and high temperatures, and the absorbance trend of the high temperature groups, suggests that the higher temperature severely limited or completely halted DCIP reduction. A possible explanation for this fact is the nature of the reaction itself, and its requirements for successful completion. A study from Macquarie University found that extreme temperature shifts in the range of 2-38°C did not have a significent effect on photoreduction of DCIP, but temperatures higher than 38°C caused a irreversible thermal inactivation of the chloroplasts, completely stopping the Hill Reaction [Nolan: 1976]. This is likely what occurred in the high temperature group, which is why reduction of DCIP halted and seemed to almost decrease. As for the effect of cold temperatures, the data did not suggest a significent effect of cold on DCIP reduction. Research from the University of North Wales has shown that old temperatures can reduce the ability of the Hill Reaction to reduce DCIP as a result of the chloroplast membrane going from a fluid state to a more solid gel-like state, as well as raising the necessary activation energy needed for the reaction to take place [Rosinger; 1982]. However, this same study also noted that species with increased resistance to cold temperatures, such as wintergreens, were able to maintain their original activation energy, and showed no significent reduced efficacy of the Hill reaction. Spinach has been documented to be very hardy and resistant to cold, typically starting growth in early spring, and maintaining cold resistance from the earliest stages of development through growth [Guy: 1987]. This would suggest that while normally cold could have a significent effect on the reduction of DCIP, spinach has been shown to be resistant to the effects of cold on photosynthesis. As such, the results of the Hill Reaction experiment suggest the effects of temperature shifts on photosynthesis in spinach plants are not significent in lower temperatures compared to normal, but higher temperatures have a inhibiting effect that prevents reduction of DCIP, suggesting reduced activity of the light reactions. The effect of cold temperature compared to hot temperature is also significently different, and while cold may have some slight effect, the inherent cold resistance of winter grown plants such as spinach reduce or eliminate this effect. Possible future experiments can be performed to determine the mechanism for cold resistance in spinach, and what allows it to maintain both membrane integrity and original activation energy for the Hill reaction under colder conditions, as this may be significent in determining how plants can remain unaffected by significently decreased temperatures.
