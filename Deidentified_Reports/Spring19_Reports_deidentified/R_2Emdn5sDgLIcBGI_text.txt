Title: Differing tank sizes have no effect on the aggressiveness of Betta splendins

Abstract:
Animal behavior are thought of as existing in complex systems, being impacted by the environment through evolution and selection. One of the most well documented types of animal behaviors is agnostic behavior. In this experiment, Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendins, were used to test whether different tank volumes resulted in different levels of aggression, defined by the “red mane” behavior. A paired t_test was used to analyze the results. Ultimately, the aggression of betta fish in the larger tank was not significently less than in the smaller tank, suggesting that differing tank sizes does not play a large role in level of aggressive behavior in betta fish. However, habituation or excessive energy expenditure may be responsible for the lack of a difference in aggression between the larger and smaller tanks.

Introduction:
Ethology is defined as the study of animal behavior. This includes the physiological purpose of behaviors as well as how the behaviors have been shaped and changed by evolution and selection. Behavioral research is a product of patient observation in which the researcher observes certain animals and forms questions and hypotheses about the behaviors exhibited that can then be tested. One of the most studied types behaviors is agnostic behaviors, which are commonly referred to as aggressive behaviors. 

The animal used in this experiment is Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish or simply betta fish, is a practical organism to test due to its easily distinguishable agnostic behaviors [Johnson: 2016]. Bettas have two main types of aggressive movements: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements include erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and a “red mane.” The red mane is produced by protruding branchiostegal membranes, located under the opercula, and it is the one of the easiest agnostic behaviors to see [Johnson: 2016]. Agonistic behaviors arise in Betta splendins most commonly when they are in the presence of another male. This is an example of an interspecific behavior because it arises in response to an individual from the same species. 

The aggressiveness of betta fish can be modulated according to multiple factors. One of the most studied factors in habituation, which is a decline in the response to a single, constant stimulus [Johnson: 2016]. Betta splendins have been known to display less aggressive behavior after exposure to a mirror or another betta fish separated by a glass partition [Meliska: 1976]. Because the fish are exposed to another of the same species over a period of time, they habituate to this stimulus and exhibit less agnostic behavior. Aggressive behavior in betta fish is also dependent on energy expenditure of the fish. The elaborate aggressive behavior rituals require a significent amount of energy, which may factor into the amount of energy that can be expended in successive aggressive displays [Castro: 2006]. This would result in a decreased response and less aggressive behavior over time.

Because aggressive behaviors depend on stimuli and the environment, changing the environment could theoretically impact the aggressiveness of betta fish. For this reason, one major question was determined: how does the size of a tank, specifically volume, impact the aggressiveness of the betta fish. In theory, the fish would not have to interact with each other as much in a larger tank, so they would not express as much aggressive behavior compared to closer quarters [Old.f.ield: 2011]. As such, we hypothesize that betta fish will exhibit the red mane for a longer period of time in the smaller tank than in the larger tank.


Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, we obtained three betta fish and labeled them orange, red, and brown. We then obtained one small tank and one large tank. The small tank, when filled, had a volume of 3,135 cubic cm and the large tank had a volume of 6,750 cubic centimeters. First, the orange fish and the red fish were both placed into the large tank and a five minute timer was started. The time that each fish exhibited a red mane was individually recorded. After five minutes, the fish were separated for a five minute relaxation period. This process was repeated with the orange and brown fish, followed by the red and brown fish. Once all permutations of fish had interacted in the large tank, the same procedure was followed in the smaller tank. Once all the data had been collected, each fish had two times for exhibiting the red mane for each tank. A paired t_test was performed, with the two groups being small tank and then large tank.

Results:
As displayed in Figure 1, the average time of exhibiting a red mane was 83.33 +/- 98.15 seconds in the small tank. In the large tank, the average time of exhibiting a red mane was 26.10 +/- 47.01 seconds. There was no significent difference between the average time exhibiting a red mane in the smaller tank than the larger tank (d.f.=5, p=0.07539, t-value=2.2381, a value=0.05). The general trend shows that the betta fish exhibited the red mane for less time when in the larger tank than in the smaller tank.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the the larger tank size would result in the red mane being exhibited for a shorter period of time is rejected by the results of this experiment. It was found that the betta fish did not exhibit the red mane for a significently longer period of time in the smaller tank than in the larger tank. This means that there was not enough evidence provided to conclude that the larger tank size had a non-random effect on the aggressiveness of the betta fish.
	
One possible reason for the aggressiveness in the smaller tank not being significently greater than that in the larger tank is that the trials run in the smaller tank were done after the larger tank, so it is possible that the fish had been somewhat habituated to the presence of another male betta fish. This would result in the expected aggressive behavior response being less in these trials [Peeke: 1970]. Similarly, the betta fish were given a minimum of five minutes rest in between each trial, which may have not been enough time for the fish to regain the energy needed to carry out a strong aggressive response to another male betta. As such, the aggressive behaviors in the smaller tank may have been hindered by this.

Contrasting with these results, previous studies have observed that a larger tank size does in fact result in less aggressive behavior exhibited by betta fish. For example, when allowed to interact in a 128-liter tank, betta fish were found to “display” and “bite” more frequently than when in a 64-liter tank [Johnson: 1972]. Similarly, the bettas also displayed more aggressive behavior when placed in intraspecific situations with fish of other species [Johnson: 1972]. This makes sense because a tank with a larger volume means that the fish would have a much easier time avoiding the other fish and any aggressive confrontations.

One common explanation for betta fish exhibiting aggressive behaviors rather than simply attacking other fish is that the risk of fighting is not worth the benefit of winning the confrontation [Castro: 2006]. As such, betta fish tend to settle conflicts with aggressive, yet non-violent behaviors. A large tank gives betta fish a greater opportunity to avoid these conflicts by just swimming further away from the other fish. This also makes sense from an energy usage standpoint because if the fish are able to avoid conflict, they are able to avert unnecessary energy expenditure required in aggressive behavior rituals [Castro: 2006]. 
	
Ultimately, this experiment displayed that a larger tank size did not result in decreased aggression in betta fish. In order to better understand the full effect that the size of a tank or environment has on the aggressive behaviors of betta fish, a future study could be conducted to determine whether betta fish are not just more or less aggressive in their displays, but also whether they tend to swim further away from the other fish. If the fish tended to swim further away from each other (relatively), it would lend evidence to the idea that betta fish would rather avoid conflict and save energy than engage in aggressive ritualistic behaviors. By better understanding the aggressive tendencies of betta fish, one could better determine the optimal environment for these fish to live and coexist in.
