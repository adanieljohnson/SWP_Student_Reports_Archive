Title: How the Blocking of Ecdysterone with Azadirachtin Alters the Weight of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta are a type of hornworm caterpillar that have been studied for many years because of their hormone regulation and development. The two most influential hormones involved in the growth of the caterpillar are the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone (20E). The main objective of this experiment is to understand the effect azadirachtin—which blocks 20E--has on the weight of a Manduca sexta. If the ecdysterone hormone is blocked, the weight of the caterpillar will increase, but the caterpillar will not pupate. The controll group was given 5 drops of water and the experimental group was given 5 drops of azadirachtin in their food. Their weight was measured every day for a 10-day period. The data presented a significent difference in the averages of weights between the experimental and controll groups based on the statistics of the one tailed t_test; therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected. However, the controll group gained the most weight and pupated, while the experimental group gained very little weight and never pupated. Based on these observations, the blocking of the 20E hormone caused major defects in the growth and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta because this hormone is crucial to the timing of the molt. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta has a life span of about 39 to 48 days and undergoes a holometabolus life cycle. This cycle includes four stages: the egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult stage. [Johnson:2018]. The main hormones that affect this development are the juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E). The juvenile hormone, produced by the corpus allata, regulates the type of molt the caterpillar goes through; therefore, the number of instars is affected with the amount of hormone [Johnson:2018]. The major hormone being studied in this experiment is ecdysterone. 20E activates the genes related to molting and metamorphosis via the EcR/USP heterodimer that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily [Nakagawa:2016]. When there is a small rise in 20E, the commitment pulse occurs, which signals that the caterpillar is large enough for pupation [Johnson:2018]. If the Manduca sexta needs both the JH hormone and 20E hormone to function properly, how will the caterpillar be affected if one of these hormones is not present in their systems? Our hypothesis is, if you block the 20E hormone, using azadirachtin, then the weight of the larvae will increase because the commitment pulse will never happen; therefore, it will never pupate and it will just keep eating. The independent variable is the blocking of the 20E hormone with the azadirachtin and the dependent variable is the average change in weight in grams of the caterpillar. 

Materials and Method:
Eight caterpillars were weighed before they were put into their new environment. Four Manduca sexta were placed in one plastic container and were labeled as the controll group. Another four caterpillars were placed into a different plastic container. 10 grams of food was initially given to each caterpillar. Using a transfer pipet, five drops of water (2.5 Ml) was added to each piece of food for the caterpillars in the controll group. With a different pipet, five drops of azadirachtin was added to each piece of food for the caterpillars in the experimental group. The caterpillars were placed into a fridge that was set at 25 degrees Celsius and was set for a 12-hour light and dark period. For ten days, the weights of the caterpillars were recorded. The food was replaced when needed and with the drops of water or azadirachtin. The container was also cleaned when needed. The statistical test used to evaluate the average weights for the experimental versus controll group was the one-tailed two sample t_test. 

Results:
In general, the controll group gained weight continuously until they started to pupate. Based on the graph that visualizes the average weight of the controll group versus the experimental group, the average weight of the controll group is 5.07 grams with a standard deviation of 1.4066. The experimental group weight stayed smaller throughout the experiment, but it did increase at the beginning and decrease at the end without pupating. The average weight of the experimental group is 1.4725 grams with 1.1628 as its standard deviation. The number of values allowed to vary based on the statistics, otherwise known as the degrees of freedom, is six. The t-value calculates to 3.94 and the p_value is 0.003802, which shows that there is a significent statistical difference between the mean of the experimental and controll group. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, which stated—if you block the 20E hormone using azadirachtin, the larvae’s weight will increase because of the lack of a commitment pulse; therefore, it will not pupate and just keep eating—is not supported. The alternate hypothesis was not supported because the experimental group did not gain weight like the controll group was able to. The null hypothesis was rejected because of the significent results. This shows that the lack of ecdysone hormone caused a reduction in growth and metamorphosis, which causes the overall development of the caterpillar to be abnormal compared to the controll group. In a past experiment, the haemolymph ecdysteroid titre of individuals treated with 2 ug azadirachtin/g bodyweight showed characteristic changes which are presumed to cause the disorders in the last stages that normally lead to pupation [Schluter: 1985]. Since the caterpillars were able to gain weight at the beginning, then the ecdysone affected the commitment pulse, because there was never a rise in 20E due to the blocking of the hormone; therefore, they began to lose weight from mid-experiment until the end.  Because these caterpillars need both the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone hormone to develop properly, blocking the 20E hormone revealed a stunt in growth and instar development. In a different study, caterpillars were put in a higher temperature, which increased metamorphosis rates. This was due to the higher levels of PTTH (prothoracicotropic hormone), which secrete ecdysone. So, the higher levels of PTTH secreted ecdysone readily and sped up the process of pupation [Debinsky: 1999]. The Manduca sexta is known for causing extreme defoliation in key crops. The larvae stages of the caterpillar are destructive to the foliage of the tobacco leaves. During the caterpillar’s adulthood, they pollinate flowering plants [Bollenbacher: 1981]. In order to save crops, gardening tobacco plants in higher heats could decrease the chance of the leaves being destroyed because the caterpillars will develop out of their larvae stages faster. Another option would be to give the caterpillars an increased level of ecdysone so they will stop eating and start metamorphosis to become adults, which help the crops. [Nijhout:2006].
