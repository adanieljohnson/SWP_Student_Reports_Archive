Title: Impact of Additional Juvenile Hormone on the development of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
The manipulation of the levels of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca Sexta caterpillars was used to understand how this hormone impacts the growth and development of the insect. Two groups of four caterpillars were monitored under uniform conditions except for a difference in diet. The experimental group received an addition of Juvenile Hormone in its daily diet. After the experiment, the mean weight gain of the controll group was greater than the average weight gain of the controll group. Using a two- sample t- test, the results were significently different and the presence of higher levels of JH decreases the growth and development of Manduca Sexta caterpillars.


Introduction:
Hormones dictate numerous biological processes and play a vital role over the entire course of life of living organisms. Scientists conduct many experiments to understand the role and function of hormones. The manipulation of hormones can lead to a difference in an organism’s natural growth and development, behaviors, and physiology. For example, it may be important to study a plant’s hormones to understand how pesticides may be created to prevent growth. On the other hand, animal and human hormones can be studied to promote or alter growth. Juvenile hormone is a regulator of growth and change during the early phase of an insect’s life cycle. There was an experiment conducted which studied the impacts of synthetic Juvenile Hormone in cabbage aphids. The study determined there was a greater mortality rate among first instar aphids treated with the synthetic hormone. Others demonstrated abnormalities and underdevelopment (White 1968). In lab, Manduca Sexta caterpillars were used to determine the effects of added Juvenile Hormone through different diets with or without the presence of added hormone. These caterpillars have a life cycle of approximately forty-five days under constant temperature and constant indoor conditions.  In the experiment, two groups of Manduca Sexta were studied under identical conditions except one group had six drops of Juvenile Hormone added to their food in order to understand the impact of the hormone one group. To understand the impact of the hormone, weight was recorded each day. Weight is a proper indicator of health and growth of the organism and quantitatively demonstrates the phase of life of the insect. If the Manduca Sexta is provided with an excess (6 drops added to food) of Juvenile Hormone, the progression of the lifestyle will stagnate and the caterpillars will remain at a smaller weight.


Materials and Method:
There were two uniform environments for two groups of young Manduca Sexta caterpillars to live throughout the duration of the experiment. Each group had four caterpillars. Both groups received the same quantity of food (10 grams and refilled to this quantity each day), had the same volume of living space, lived in the same incubator of the same temperature. The uniform conditions of the two groups ensured there wasn’t another variable impacting the outcome of the experiment. The difference in the two groups was that Group One did not receive any Juvenile Hormone in their food, just water, and Group Two received six drops of JH. Specifically, six drops per ten grams of food. At the start of the experiment, each caterpillar was weighed and the initial weight was recorded. For two weeks, each day, the caterpillars were weighed, their environments were cleaned, and the food was replaced and Group Two received six drops of JH in their food. If a caterpillar died, it was removed from the experiment. After two weeks, the change in weight was calculated between each caterpillar’s peak weight and initial weight to compare like scenarios in the larvae phase (including those which had died). The one tail two sample t_test was used to compare the change in weight between the two groups at the end of the experiment because the hypothesis was directional.


Results:
The mean weight gain of the controll group was 11.99 grams and 5.70 grams for the experimental group over the course of two weeks (Figure 2). The standard deviation of the controll group was about 0.86 and for the experimental group it was 2.68. A one tailed t_test was used to determine the relationship between the data values. According to the comparison of the obtained p value, which was 0.004, and comparing it to .05, the results of the controll and experimental groups were statistically significent because it is a lesser quantity. The results also had a degree of freedom of six and a t value of 3.87. At the end of the experiment, one controll caterpillar had died at the beginning of the first week but three out of the four experimental caterpillars had died throughout the second week of treatment. When a caterpillar died, it was removed from the experiment and did not receive more hormone or food, but its initial and peak weight were still part of the data set. The difference in weight was measured between each caterpillar’s initial weight and its greatest weight during the experiment.


Discussion:
The hypothesis created at the beginning of the experiment was supported through an analysis of the results. Further, the mean of the weight gain in the controll group was over six grams higher than the average weight gain of the experimental group. In addition, the p_value indicates the data to be statically significent so it can be concluded based off this experiment that an excess of Juvenile Hormone does in fact decrease growth and development of the Manduca Sexta. Biologically, Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone exist in rations during development and molting. When the levels of Juvenile Hormone are consistently high, the level of Ecdysterone cannot rise and fall with respect to changing JH levels, and a commitment pulse cannot occur. Due to the smaller amount of weight gain of the controll group, it can be deduced that Juvenile Hormone impacts the growth and development of the Manduca Sexta. An excess of JH prevents pupation, extends the initial stages of the life cycle, and limits growth. Weight is a helpful characteristic to analyze to understand the impact of the hormone. This is because weight change is characterized by the phase of life being affected by Juvenile Hormone. A typical caterpillar usually experiences a commitment pulse followed by very low amounts of Juvenile Hormone. The experimental group was expected to develop differently and gain less weight because since they were receiving JH. The results showed that not only did most of the caterpillars in the experimental group die, but they gained less weight, and did not pupate, demonstrating the effects of added JH. Similarly, in an experiment to understand the controll of molting and pupation of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca Sexta, results demonstrated that there is a correlation between weight and JH function. Further, the caterpillars in the experiment stopped secreting juvenile hormone at about 5 grams during the 5th- instar larval phase. With extra juvenile hormone, other processes were delayed and did not happen (Frederik, 1974). This experiment connects because it conveys the relationship between the biological effects of Juvenile Hormone and the correlation between the hormone and weight. The caterpillars continued to grow more than 5 grams because that is approximately the threshold weight for the secretion of JH to end. When JH was continually added, the caterpillars did not grow as much. The added JH in the experiment conducted in lab prevented weight gain and development of the caterpillars. The smaller weights of the experimental group represent the inability to mature with added JH. Based on the results of this experiment, after multiple trials to increase validity of the conclusions drawn, experiments can be conducted in order to manipulate Juvenile Hormone in other pests to reduce their development or change the way they develop to benefit the human population. In addition, perhaps JH can improve different insects that are deficient in certain phenomes or genomes by promoting development.
