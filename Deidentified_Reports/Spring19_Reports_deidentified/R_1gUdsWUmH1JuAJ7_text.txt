Title: Domesticated male Betta splenden agnostic behavior not significently impacted by presence of soil in habitat 

Abstract:
Male Betta splendins are known for their agnostic intraspecific behaviors. The clean water tanks that domestic bettas are kept in contrast to the muddy habitats of their wild type counterparts. This study sought to investigate how an increase in soil in the betta habitat impacts male agnostic behaviors. It was hypothesized that the change in habitat would impact behavior. The study employed a method of qualitative analysis of behaviors, as behaviors were ranked on a point system based on level of aggressiveness. Three male bettas were allowed to interact in pairs for up to five minutes in both a clear water tank and a tank with soil and water. One fish was focused on during each of the three rounds of interactions in each tank, and observations were quantified as points per second (PPS) for each fish under each water condition. A paired, two-tail t_test was run on the average difference in PPS values to find that there was not a statistically significent difference in the PPS in dirty verses clean water. However, there was an obvious trend of more interaction and aggression in clear water. It was accepted that soil in tank water did not have an impact of male aggression, however, significent results might be seen given a larger sample size or using wild type betta comparisons.

Introduction:
Betta splendins, otherwise known as Siamese fighting fish, are well-known for their colorful and dramatic displays when interacting with each other [Johnson:2018]. Though domesticated bettas do not show all the same intraspecific behaviors of wild bettas, they are still a valuable species to use when studying ethology, as they are easy to come by and large enough to see with the naked eye, and male domesticated bettas are known to present six main agnostic behaviors mostly towards other males with whom they compete for mates and defend their territories against. Betta fish and knowledge of their behavior are quite relevant in biomedical research of today, as many cancer and immunology labs are using them as specimen and need to know how to breed and care for them [Wei: 2018]. The infamous male agnostic behaviors can be categorized into the categories of broadside and facing behaviors. Within each, there are three main behaviors that vary in intensity of aggression. In order of increasing aggressiveness, broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing and facing behaviors include pelvic fin erection, opercula spreading, and the red “mane” (protruding branchiostegal membrane) [Johnson: 2018]. There are other aggressive behaviors bettas can intermix with these, but these main behaviors provide a basis for this study to attempt a quantitative analysis of betta intraspecific behavior. It is known that in the wild, bettas inhabit muddy waters of southeast Asia [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment sought to investigate how the presence of dirt/soil (an attempt at a recreation of the betta wild habitat) in the domesticated Betta splenden habitat impacted male agnostic behavior. Studies have shown many differences between wild type bettas and domesticated bettas including their color and sex determination and their range of aggressive behaviors that are thought to be adaptive for competing in the natural environment. Some Wild type bettas put into domestic environments have had an increase in aggression around fish of certain sizes and colors in a domestic setting, but this was not always the case in prior studies [Lucas: 1968]. The domesticated fish used in the experiment were bred and raised in captivity in tanks with clear water, and it is suspected that they would experience a sensory shock when put into a foreign environment that may put them on high alert and increase their aggressiveness or possibly distract them from interaction. Considering all this, it was hypothesized that increasing the presence of soil in the betta habitat would have some impact on male agnostic behavior.

Materials and Method:
Two tanks were prepared: one with clear water (controll) and one with water and several cups of soil added. The clear tank was divided into thirds using opaque dividers, and one male Betta splenden was placed in each of the three compartments. Then the fish were designated numbers (1-3), and it was planned which pairs would interact in each of the three trials in each tank so that each fish’s behavior could be focused on once under each water condition. A system for quantifying agnostic behavior was established based on the varying levels of aggression of broadside and facing behaviors. A points system was established so that each display of pectoral fin erection and flickering constituted one point, tail beating and opercula spreading was worth two points, and tail flashing and red manes equaled three points. Fish 1 and Fish 2 interacted first with a focus on Fish 1. The barrier in between them was removed and a stopwatch was set. The occurrence of each behavior/corresponding points was observed and recorded (along with other qualitative notes) for Fish 1 in clear water for five minutes or until the fish began to injure each other and were separated by the opaque barrier again. The total number of points was then calculated and divided by the number of seconds of observation to find the “points per second” (PPS) for Fish 1 in clear water. A five-minute rest time was given upon separation before Fish 2 interacted with Fish 3 with a focus on Fish 2. The process of observation and then rest was repeated before the final interaction in clear water between Fish 1 and Fish 3 with a focus on Fish 3. Then, starting with the initial pairing, the pairs of fish were transported into the tank with soil and the rounds of observation were repeated as they were in clear water with the fish placed back in the divided clear water tank for the rest periods (left there when not interacting). Once PPS’s had been calculated for all three fish in each tank, a paired, 2-tail was run on the mean difference between the PPS’s in the different conditions.

Results:
The average points per second (PPS) for the fish when they interacted in clear water was 0.138 ± 0.0931 while the average PPS for those fish in the water with soil was 0.0133± 0.0231 (Figure 1). The average difference between a fish’s PPS in clear water verses water with soil was 0.125 ± 0.0769 PPS. There was not a statistically significent difference between the average PPS values found under the two water conditions (t_stat = 2.80, d.f. = 2, P = 0.107). Qualitatively, it was noticed that one fish always settled into lower corners of the tank no matter the water condition and the other two fish seemed to spend much of their initial few minutes in the tank with soil very close to the top of the tank’s waterline. For two out of the three fish, no agnostic behavior was displayed in the dirty water.

Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis that increased soil/dirt content in the Betta splenden habitat would alter male agnostic behaviors. However, the PPS for all fish in clear water was consistently higher than their PPS in water with soil and the results were not terribly far from statistical significance. It is highly possible that given a larger sample size, statistically significent data would have been seen. While it is true that soil content in the water provides the bettas with a more accurate recreation of their wild habitat, it should be noted that the fish observed were bred and raised in captivity, and thus clear water is essentially their natural environment that they would be expected to interact in. At the onset of this experiment, it was suggested that being placed into such a foreign environment rather suddenly might put the fish on high alert and make them more sensitive to the presence of other fish and increase aggressiveness, but it is likely that it was more disorienting to the fish and sensory shock overwhelmed increased sensitivity or aggression or at least suppressed it to a great extent so no statistically significent difference in PPS was seen. 
The trend towards increased PPS in clear water generally makes sense given prior research. First, in support of the idea that when being placed in the dirty water the fish faced a shock that kept them preoccupied from many aggressive interactions (and often from any interactions at all), is a study on water ecosystems that concludes that floating material on top of bodies of water can interfere with the dissolving of oxygen in water [Wang: 2014]. There was quite a bit of soil floating in a layer at the top of the waterline in the dirty tank. It had settled there for thirty minutes by the time fish were placed in the dirty tank, and it is possible that the fish (who were so acclimated to their clear water environments) were shocked by the reduced oxygen content, and thus the majority of trials in the dirty tank had a fish sitting still at the top of the tank for the majority of the five minutes trying to get more oxygen and acclimate to the new environment (rather than swimming into contact with the other fish). Betta splendins’ ability to gulp air at the water’s surface is a well-known adaptation that allows them to survive in oxygen-deficient water, but wild type bettas participate in an extreme aggressive behavior that has them in head on assault before breaking to get air in their muddy habitat, while domesticated bettas have lost this behavior [Johnson: 2018]. It is possible, given the statistical insignificance of the data, that the behavior observed was not significently different from how these betta would behave in a natural habitat, and they were truly not significently affected, but the qualitative observations showed just a general lack of activity in the dirty water that led bettas to only interacting if they happened upon each other – they did not seek out conflict from a distance like in clear water (which speaks to a decreased tendency towards aggression), and it is very likely that as domesticated bettas do not have the ability to successfully take on an opponent in muddy water, they do not seek conflict like wild type bettas would in the wild.
Also, a study concluded that male bettas are most aggressive towards bettas of a different color than themselves [Thompson: 1965]. It stands to reason that the dirt impairs the vision of the fish, making it harder for them to recognize other fish in the dirty tank unless they are in very close proximity, and making it harder for fish to quickly recognize a fish of a different color. This could explain why the two fish with bolder, more red colorings barely interacted and displayed no aggression while the most aggression in the tank with soil was seen between the white fish and a darker fish that it approached and could easily recognize as different from itself. However, this could also be attributed to the activity levels/movement of the fish that happened to bring the white fish in close contact with another fish unlike in other trials.
Given the results of this study, owners of Betta splendins and researchers who work with them should be aware that placing male Bettas in a rather unfamiliar environment with dark floating particles that impair their vision can sometimes be seen to decrease their agnostic tendencies, though it should not be expected that it always will, as there is a lack of statistical significance pointing to one trend verses the other. Depending on whether aggressive behavior and stress is desired or not, one can bare this information in mind in experimental design in the laboratory setting or when an owner is in a bind with multiple Bettas that need to be temporarily kept in one bowl/tank.
This experiment would ideally be redone with a greater sample size. It could also be redone with more fish of the same species and/or other species interacting during each trial (with a focus still on one fish during each round) to increase the likelihood of interactions especially in the dirtier tank and to better replicate a natural environment, as that was the goal of the experiment. With more fish, immediate observation while keeping fish from harming each other would be difficult, so a camera could be used. Or, like in other studies, artificial fish could be constructed [Thompson: 1965]. Allowing the fish to sit for a while alone in the water with soil and rest there in between interactions could help controll for the shock of the environment change. The experiment could also be redone with testing on wild type bettas that have just been caught to see if they are more active and aggressive in dirty tank water than domesticated bettas and to see how they react to the foreign environment of clear water. Actual mud that sticks to the base of the tank could also be used rather than dirt that floated so much in the water and possibly impaired vision more than in a natural environment.
