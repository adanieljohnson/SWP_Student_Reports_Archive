Title: Tank size and its lack of significant effect on aggression in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Intraspecific behavior is behavior exhibited between members of the same species.  Aggressive behavior between a species uses a lot of energy so the cost of the act must be lower than the benefit of the act in order to utilize limited resources, in this case energy.  The experiment performed focused on the effects of tank size on level of aggression exhibited between two male betta fish.  Betta fish are naturally very territorial and aggressive towards one another.  We hypothesized that as the size of the tank was increased the level of aggression would decrease due to less competition over a greater territory.  In our experiment, we compared the number of aggressive acts performed by the fish for three different sized tanks and our results were not statistically significant.  Our hypothesis, although not supported statistically, was supported by trends seen in the data collected.  The larger the tank the lower the number of aggressive acts.  In the future this information may be used to design future experiments between members of the same species and the costs/benefits associated with aggression in different types of environments. 

Introduction:
The finite amount of energy organisms have must be allocated in the most efficient way possible to give an organism the best fitness possible.  Therefore it is important to understand the costs and benefits of various types of behavior.  Acts of aggression may be performed to gain territory, assert dominance, ward off predators, or warn a challenger of an impending battle [Levy: 1941].  These acts can be as mild as a lizard showing its colored dewlap as a warning or as severe as elephant seals fighting to the death on a beach [Vanhooydonck: 2005].  The cost of the act of aggression must be lower than the benefit to be advantageous of the organism to perform the act.  The study species used in this experiment was Betta splendens.  The betta fish is known for being very territorial and aggressive making it an ideal species to study.  Betta fish perform acts of aggression towards other betta fish and this is known as interspecific behavior.  The acts of aggression of betta fish vary in severity and may be affected by several factors.  Tank size will be manipulated to see if it has an effect on levels of aggression.  We hypothesized that as tank size increases the level of aggression will decrease due to less competition over territory. 

Materials and Methods:
We set up a fish tank and divided it into three equal sections separated by dividers. We put two betta fish in a small tank, in one-third of the tank together for one minute and then separated them for two minutes of rest. We also put the two betta fish in a medium tank, two-thirds of the tank with one divider being taken out and a large tank where both dividers were removed.  Each trial was a minute long and between trials, the fish were separated by a divider and given two minutes to rest.  We counted the number of aggressive acts performed in one minute for each tank size and compared them to one another.  A total of three trials were performed and the order of tank size was determined by a random number generator.  We found the averages and standard deviations for the three trials and performed an ANOVA test with a critical value of α=0.05. 

Results:
The small tank had 42±18.52 acts of aggression, the medium tank had 20±11.53, and large had 12±3.54 as seen in Figure 1.  There was no significant difference between tank size and the number of acts of aggression (f: 3.33, df: 2, p-value: 0.08).  There was a trend in the data, but at (α=0.05) it was statistically insignificant. 

Discussion:
Our results did not statistically support our original hypothesis.  However, the trends in the data did support our hypothesis.  As tank size increased the number of aggressive acts decreased.    A previous study’s results supported our hypothesis by showing that aggressive acts and territory size are inversely proportional [Bronstein: 1981].  This supports our hypothesis because the decrease in competition for territory decreased the number of aggressive acts due to the cost of the act no longer being lower than the benefit of performing the act.  The trials done in our experiment also showed this trend where aggressive acts increase as the tank becomes smaller.  Our results may have been insignificant statistically because the betta fish were aggressive toward one another even in the largest tank size where they had a large territory.  A limitation of our experiment may have been not using a substantially larger tank to see if aggression continued to be displayed.  The territory of our “large” tank may have been small enough to elicit aggressive behavior over the provided territory.  In a future experiment, we could add varying amounts of food to the tank to see if it increases aggressive behavior because food is an important resource or decreases aggressive behavior because there is plenty for both fish [Hogan: 1974].  Our results should be taken into consideration when getting a pet betta fish because they must be housed alone and not with other fish regardless of tank size.
