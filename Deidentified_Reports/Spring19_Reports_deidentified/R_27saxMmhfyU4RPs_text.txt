Title: Caffeine Injections into Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rana pipiens Results in Quicker Tetany and Fatigue

Abstract:
In order to determine the impact of caffeine upon muscle contraction, we first measured our control frog legs without any caffeine added to them and measure the hertz values as the summation compounds and tetany is reached. Then we will add caffeine to the frog legs and measure the hertz values for the same outcomes. We will determine caffeine effect by measuring the hertz at which summation and tetany is reached in the legs. The Rana pipiens was the organism that was chosen. Our hypothesis is if we add caffeine into the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg than it will experience summation of the twitches at a faster rate and at a lower hertz value compared to the frog leg with no caffeine. However, this was not supported as the results from the test and control were similar, meaning that the caffeine allowed for higher contraction levels than the control, but it wasn’t able to maintain it, due to fatigue. Whereas the control just increased. 


Introduction:
The skeletal muscle of invertebrates and vertebrates consist of myofibrils, which are fused aggregates of cells and are bound together by connective tissue. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons which are located in the spinal cord. The axons of motor neurons extend to a muscle, and then branch out to innervate myofibers, which forms neuromuscular junctions. The signals arriving at this area cause actin to be released, allowing for an action potential to be generated, and a result of this is a shortening in the length of the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2016]. However, how do other factors affect this mechanism? The question being answered is how does caffeine affect muscle contraction and alter muscle voltage levels? We hypothesized that when caffeine is introduced to the Rana pipiens leg, it will create an excess of calcium resulting in it continuing to twitch. Each leg will be tested with and without caffeine to show its true effects. Caffeine blocks adenosine, which allows for a surplus of calcium, resulting in the muscle to continue twitching. With the introduction of caffeine, summation will and tetany will occur faster. This will be measured through stimulus frequency (Hertz). This mechanism will be examined by isolating the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a Rana pipiens leg so the basic properties of neuromuscular control can be demonstrated with and without the effects of caffeine. The Rana pipiens was chosen because they are cheap and sterile compared to other organisms, and have the desired muscles. They were chosen specifically for their synaptic efficacy at the neuromuscular junction [Warburton: 2007].

Materials and Methods:
We began with three frog legs and prepared by putting them in a dissecting pan. With a pair of forceps, we grasped the shin at the top of the leg and pulled the skin down towards the foot until it came completely off. The frog skin was discarded, and throughout this process the frog legs would be continuously rinsed with frog ringer. A dissecting probe was then used to safely separate the inner thigh muscles beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. Doing this revealed the white sciatic nerve and a few blood vessels. The nerve was freed from the tissue using a needle and forceps. Then, the gastrocnemius muscle was cut from the rest of the leg so it could be elevated with a piece of string on the platform. The sciatic nerve was then layed on the pulsing needle used to deliver and measure the voltage. Each of the three Rana Pipiens legs received three volts at three different intensities, which were ten Hertz, twenty-five Hertz, and fifty Hertz. Each leg was tested normally with no treatment or modification and immediately preceding the control test, the gastrocnemius muscle was injected with one milligram of caffeine. The same three levels of Hertz were delivered to each leg after the injection. Using the connected computer program, the level of volts for each Hertz was measured and recorded. The statistical test used for this was the paired t-test, where the result for the control group was 0.15406 with a standard deviation of 0.26684 whereas the results for the treatment were 0.00584 with a standard deviation of 0.01012.

Results:
There was a total of six legs, and each leg endured three different voltages, at 10, 25, and 50. Each leg was tested twice, the first time being without any alterations and the second being with an injection of one milligram of caffeine. The control started at a lower voltage, but steadily increased and had a larger value than the treatment group. The treatment group started out at high values, but just decreased after the initial voltage of ten. It didn't decrease by a lot, but it was still present. 

Discussion:
We originally guessed that caffeine would result in higher contracts, or higher levels of voltage, and that tetany would be reached rafter than without caffeine. This was not supported by our data because our results showed that both the control and treatment groups produced similar levels, but due to the injection of caffeine, there were lower ATP levels in the treatment legs so the treatment had lower recorded values in volts. The caffeine allowed for higher contraction levels than the control, but it wasn’t able to maintain it, due to fatigue. However, an error in this methodology would be that the leg was slightly fatigued from the control tests, so when the treatment was applied to the same leg, there was already slight fatigue resulting in a lower recorded level of Hertz. The chemically induced tetany is similar to the normal tetany we already tested. In a similar test, researchers bathed frog legs in a caffeine solution, resulting in a stronger contraction but a weaker and altered contractile system [Kumbaraci: 1981]. The data we collected didn’t reach these depths, but it showed little variation between the test and  control, which is much different than this study. A way to expand this research is to conduct more tests with caffeine and also different substances to see what has the  biggest impact on muscle contraction.
