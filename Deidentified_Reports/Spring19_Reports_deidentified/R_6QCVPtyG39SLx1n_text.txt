Title: Effect of JH Analog, PreCore Methoprene, on Weight Gain during Larval Development of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
In our experiment, we tested if adding eights drops of PreCore Methoprene to the experimental diet would result in larger Manduca Sexta compared to that of the of our controll group. Methoprene is a Juvenile hormone analog and is also known as an insect growth regulator, which results in hormonal changes in insects. We were inherently testing how an increase in Juvenile hormone would play a role in the development and growth of the Manduca Sexta. On daily occurrences, we weighed both our experimental and controll groups to examine the overall changes in weight observed as well as the physical differences in development. We measured the average change in weight for the controll group to be 12.26+/- 0.595 (Fig.1) and 11.6+/- 0.578 (Fig.1) for the experimental group. We concluded that there was no significent difference between the average changes in weight and therefore our hypothesis was unsupported. Further testing needs to be done to examine the actual concentrations and times needed to prevent pupation of a Manduca Sexta with a JH mimic such as Methoprene or our experiment provides no significent benefit to society or IGR users.

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone that plays a significent role within the development and growth of the Manduca Sexta.  Specifically, JH regulates the type of molt a Manduca Sexta caterpillar undergoes during its development [Johnson: 2016]. Once JH is reduced during its development, the commitment pulse begins, and the caterpillar begins to pupate. For Manduca Sexta, the commitment pulse is characterized by a signal that lets the caterpillar know that it is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to begin pupating [Johnson: 2016]. Usually, Manduca Sexta have five larval instars or better understood as phases of development where they continue to grow until pupation occurs. Manduca Sexta need both JH and ecdysterone (20E) hormones to foster their development and metamorphosis. The absolute concentration and ratio of these two hormones in the hemolymph combined with the Manduca Sexta’s development stage determine what effects both hormones will have [Johnson: 2016]. Insect growth regulators or IGRs cause hormonal abnormalities within insects. IGRs work to inhibit various biochemical pathways needed for normal growth and development [Tunaz: 2004]. If Manduca Sexta were exposed to an IGR that contained JH, then its JH levels would increase. Theoretically, this would result in the caterpillars hitting their commitment pulse later than naturally expected and developing into a larger adult. The excess nutrients built up to sustain a healthy pupation past the normal pupation stage will be exhausted as the caterpillar grows larger. Consequently, this larger weight could put the caterpillar at risk of dying due to its potential inability to sustain a larger weight. To further analyze the effects of this, our experiment is designed to compare the weights of two caterpillar groups, one fed with the addition of deionized water, and the other fed with food with an IGR additive. For this experiment, we will be using the IGR PreCore Methoprene which acts as a JH mimic. If eight drops of PreCore Methoprene are added to the caterpillar food, then the experimental caterpillars will increase in weight (g) compared to the controll. Within our experiment, we identified the independent variable as the JH in the caterpillar food and the dependent variable as the weight of each caterpillar (g). 

Materials and Method:
Two plastic bins were acquired as a housing environment for our eight rather small caterpillars. Each caterpillar was placed in its own quadrant within either the controll or experimental bin and two holes were added to the sides of the bins to allow air flow. Next, each caterpillar was individually weighed, in grams, on the scale and returned to their respective quadrants in the bin. Following this, forty grams of the stock caterpillar food was weighed out on the scale and added, in ten gram increments, to each plastic bin. The food was rolled up into a small ball and each caterpillar was put back in following this procedure. For the experimental group, eight drops of precor methoprene were added to each ten-gram food sample and mashed together. This step was repeated for the controll group, however instead of using precor methoprene, eight drops of deionized water were added to the caterpillar food. For the remainder of the experiment, one group member will weigh the caterpillars daily and resupply food if necessary. Finally, we used a two-sample t_test which correlates with a one tailed p_value for the experiment.

Results:
The independent variable in our experiment was weight of caterpillars as noted previously in the introduction. We observed the trend that the average change for the controll group was greater than that of the experimental group over the course of collecting data. We calculated the average changes in weight of both the controll and experimental groups over an eleven-day period finishing on the eleventh day. For the experimental group, we concluded with 11.6+/- 0.578 (g) (p=0.08138) (Fig. 1) and 12.26+/- 0.595 (g) (p=0.08138)(Fig. 1) for the controll group. In addition, our calculated t value was 1.591. Finally, we calculated the degrees of freedom to be 6 which measures how many values in our final calculation are susceptible to variation.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that an addition of eight drops of Precor Methoprene, a JH mimic, added to the caterpillar food would result in increased weight of our experimental group compared to the controll group was not supported. We found little significent difference between the calculated and observed weights between both groups, and evidently the controll group ended up producing a larger change in average weight than our experimental group. There are various causes that could explain this result, however the most plausible cause could be that the increase in JH in the experimental diet affected the release of ecdysterone, and their interaction at the fifth instar caused regressive developmental and growth issues. Normal Manduca Sexta exhibit high levels of ecdysterone and lower levels of JH around the fifth instar prior to pupating [Johnson: 2016]. The experimental group most likely exhibited smaller levels of ecdysterone prior to normal pupation and failed to achieve the hormonal concentration ratio ample enough to provide for normal development [Johnson: 2016]. By day eleven, around half of our controll group exhibited a visible commitment pulse compared to the experimental group which showed signs of death. By day fourteen, two of our experimental Manduca Sexta had died and both groups showed decreased weight. In comparing these results to a broader spectrum, our data shows the importance of IGRs in an environmental setting with the goal of limiting pupation amongst the Manduca Sexta. Most of our experimental group had died off by day fourteen and for someone using IGRs to limit the population of the Tobacco Hawk Moth, our data is representative of a potential track that could lead to this result. Yet, the use of specific IGRs contaminates the environment and creates an obstacle for industries to develop and test less harmful IGRs [Tunaz: 2004]. Further testing would need to be done to examine how much Methoprene, JH analog, would be needed to delay the development process long enough to prevent the pupation of the Manduca Sexta.
