Title: Herbivory Does Not Induce Resource Sequestration In Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
This study aims to show how herbivory on Raphanus sativus plants does not result in induced resource sequestration, a method by which resources are shifted away from areas exposed to herbivory towards parts of the plant that are less accessible to herbivores. This is due to several traits expressed by the R. sativus plants used in this experiment, such as being a developing plant and having the root as the primary storage organ of the plant. R. sativus was grown in optimal conditions in two groups- a control (not exposed to herbivory) and experimental (exposed to herbivory). Herbivory was performed by cutting off leaves at the branching point. The root: shoot ratio of mass and length of the plants were calculated and a one-tailed two-sample t-test was performed. The results showed no significant difference between the mean root: shoot ratio used to measure growth in the control and experimental groups. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported. This might be due to the nature of simulation of herbivory, which might be biologically different than how herbivory occurs in the real world.

Introduction:
Resource allocation in plants in the use of resources for the growth of different parts of the plant depending on the environment a plant is growing in. This phenomenon is affected by a large number of biotic (eg. other organisms) and abiotic (eg. light, soil) factors. Any factor that constitutes the environment of the ecosystem a plant lives in can affect its resource allocation individually, and in combination with other factors. Most abiotic factors affect the availability of resources, thus affecting the growth and reproduction of plants through resource allocation. Biotic factors don’t always directly influence plants in this way. There are various ways biotic factors can influence resource allocation, which can be direct or indirect depending on the method. The effect of other trees of the same species or different species will have a different effect compared to insects and animals living in the same ecosystem [Johnson: 2016].
Herbivory is a very common act performed by many biotic factors such as insects, birds, and animals. It consists of a part of a plants being consumed by these organisms for their sustenance. Unlike predation, where an organism is killed for consumption, herbivory generally leaves plants alive. Herbivory results in a loss of useful resources of a plant, from leaves (for photosynthesis or gas exchange) to sap (sugary fluids used by tree) to fruits (for reproduction) [“Herbivory”: n.d]. The effects of herbivory on different plants differ greatly, but it has been found that plants try to replace stems and leaves consumed through herbivory if growing conditions are favorable (eg. if there is less competition, ample amount of required resources) [Pratt: 2005]. However, this replacement may be only partial, and come with a price of a lowering of rates of reproduction [Pratt: 2005]. Another method some plants might use to cope with herbivory is induced resource sequestration, where plants allocate more resources to “tissues inaccessible to foraging herbivores” [Orians: 2011]. 
The organism used in this experiment, Raphanus sativus (also known more commonly as Radish), is a common agricultural crop that is cultivated as an annual plant around the world for its thick taproot [The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica: 1998]. R. sativus grows at a fast rate, which is useful for the experiment, which takes place over a duration of two weeks [L: n.d]. 
The fact that there are many methods plants can use to cope against herbivory makes it hard to predict the effect of the coping mechanism of a particular plant, in this case R. sativus (Radish), on its resource allocation. However, in a paper published in 2011, a model is introduced where, depending on traits expressed by plants, they could either follow induced resource sequestration or a more general growth and/or defense strategy [Orians: 2011]. According to the model, annual plants that have higher storage in roots compared to shoots which are developing favor growth and/or defense [Orians: 2011]. R. sativus satisfies all these conditions in this experiment. There are other factors in the model, and the conditions of the experiment have traits that lead to both induced resource sequestration and growth and/or defense. However, most of the traits lead to R. sativus following a growth and/or defense model. This means its resources will be focused on replacing or compensating for leaves lost by herbivory, suggesting there shouldn’t be a significant difference between control and experimental groups. 
Following this, the main hypothesis will be-
Herbivory does not alter resource allocation to parts inaccessible to herbivores and instead focuses on compensating for parts lost due to herbivory in Raphanus sativus. 


Materials and Methods:
Around 30 R. sativus seeds were planted in four small pot containing vermiculite. Water and miracle grow were added to the soil of all pots. Two pots were labelled as Control 1 and Control 2. The other two pots were Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. They were placed in the greenhouse of Winston Hall and would grow for two weeks.
All plants were watered every two days. The pots had holes in the bottom so that excess water could escape during watering. One week after they were planted, herbivory was simulated. It was conducted by cutting off half the leaves of each seedling in the Experiment pots. Since each seedling only had two leaves, one leaf was cut off at the branching point of each plant. The mass of all the cut off leaves were weighed to calculate average leaf mass that was cut off each plant, which would be added to the mass of the shoot to reduce significant difference between control and experimental plants. The significant difference stems from the removal of biomass (the leaves) due to simulation of herbivory. 
The leaves from Experiment 1 were weighed separately from Experiment 2. The total weight of removed leaves from Experiment 1 was 6.31g, while the total weight of removed leaves from Experiment 2 was 5.02g. 
After two weeks, 3 plants were taken from each pot and their total mass, mass of shoot, mass of root, length of shoot, and length of root were measured. The length of the shoot was measured from the bottom of the shoot to the tip of the leaf of the shoot. 
Then, the average leaf mass was calculated by dividing the total weight of removed leaves from each pot by the total plants in each pot (which was calculated by counting the number of plants in the pot). This average leaf mass was then added to the weight of the shoot. The average leaf mass for Experiment 1 was added to the plants taken from the Experiment 1 pot, and the average leaf mass for Experiment 2 was added to the plants taken from the Experiment 2 pot. 
From these measurements, the root-to-shoot ratio was calculated based on weight and length. 
A one-tailed two-sample t-test was used to check for significant differences between the root: shoot ratios based on both weight and length. 


Results:
The mean root: shoot ratio± S.D in terms of mass (g) for Control R. sativus plants was 0.066±0.027. The mean root: shoot ratio± S.D in terms of mass for Experimental R. sativus plants was 0.078±0.041. 
The mean root: shoot ratio± S.D in terms of length (cm) for Control R. sativus plants was 1.053±0.387. The mean root: shoot ratio± S.D in terms of mass for Experimental R. sativus plants was 1.284±0.243. 
As seen from the graphs (Figure 1 and Figure 2), in both mass and length, the experimental mean root: shoot ratio value increased compared to the control. For mass (g) it increased from 0.066±0.027 (Control) to 0.078±0.041 (Experimental). For length (cm) it increased from 1.053±0.387 (Control) to 1.284±0.243 (Experimental). 
The standard deviation for both control and experimental for both mass and length is quite large. 
The one-tailed two-sample t-test showed that the mean root: shoot ratio based on mass (g) was not significantly different between the control and experimental groups (t-stat = 0.639, df = 10, P = 0.268). It also showed that the mean root: shoot ratio based on length (cm) was not significantly different between the control and experimental groups (t-stat = 1.238, df = 10, P = 0.122). 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that herbivory does not alter resource allocation to parts inaccessible to herbivores and instead focuses on compensating for parts lost due to herbivory in Raphanus sativus is not supported.
The t-test results show that the resource allocation patterns for the control (herbivory not simulated) and experimental (herbivory simulated) were the same. This means that there was no change in resource allocation in the experimental group to compensate for parts lost due to herbivory by allocating more resources to the shoot. More resources were not allocated to the shoot to grow and repair parts lost due to herbivory. 
This could be because herbivory was simulated in a controlled setting. There could be a difference in response to herbivory by insects or animals that eat specific parts of the leaf or shoot or are only able to eat small parts of the leaf. This is obviously different from the simulated form of herbivory where a whole leaf was removed at the branching point from another leaf. This biological difference might result in different effects on resource allocation. 
The ways herbivory can be simulated, thus, can be very diverse and can use other variables. Perhaps an experiment where the design included a way herbivory is simulated that is closer to what happens in the real world could show some interesting results. Furthermore, other measures than root: shoot ratio, such as biomass, can be measured. 
This experiment can also be repeated with added factors that might make one strategy by plants in the face of herbivory more favorable than another according to the model introduced in a previously published resource paper [Orians: 2011]. This experiment is just a stepping stone to jump off of to explore the various effects of herbivory on plants.
