Title: The Effect of Temperature on Agonistic Behaviors in Betta Fish

Abstract:
In order to understand behaviors in animals, specifically behaviors that require a high energy expenditure, it is important to understand their metabolism and the factors that affect it. Metabolism is directly dependent on temperature, meaning that as temperature decreases, metabolism also decreases. In order to study the effects of decreased metabolism, we studied aggressive behavior, a high energy behavior, in Betta splendens. It was hypothesized that if the betta fish had a reduced metabolism in colder water, they would display aggressive behaviors less frequently. As predicted, the betta fish displayed significantly less aggressive behavior, measured by time spent displaying a red mane, when they were in cold water than when they were in room temperature water. Future studies should examine various fish species that live in various temperatures to see if the fish have adapted their metabolism for different environments. 

Introduction:
Metabolism is the process in which organisms exchange energy and materials with their environment [Gillooly: 2001]. This exchange may occur when animals are obtaining food, protecting themselves or their offspring, courting a mate, or fighting with another organism. Thus a metabolic rate is an organism’s ability to use energy in order to promote growth and survival [Pettersen: 2018]. This metabolic rate is dependent on mass and temperature, where an increase in temperature results in an increased metabolic rate [Gillooly: 2001]. Examining how these factors impact metabolic rates allows for a better understanding of the behaviors that are dependent on metabolism. 
In the majority of fish species, their body temperature is relatively close to the temperature of the environment, meaning that the fish are very sensitive to the temperature of their environment. [Guderley: 2004]. Thus, behaviors that require significant metabolic energy will also be sensitive to the temperature. In order to examine this concept further, we studied Betta splendens, a fish commonly found in aquariums. Betta fish are known for their fighting behaviors, making it an ideal organism for observing metabolic behaviors. Male betta fish display agonistic behaviors toward one another due to their instincts to guard their eggs. Thus even when there are no eggs around, male bettas are aggressive when they recognize another male betta due to their territorial instincts. These aggressive behaviors are displayed as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes, also called the red “mane”. [Johnson: 2018]. As these behaviors are energetically costly, it was hypothesized that if the fish were exposed to colder temperatures and thus have a lower metabolic rate, they will display agonistic behaviors, in the form of the red mane, less frequently. 


Materials and Methods:
First, two aquariums were filled with room temperature water (around 17 degrees Celsius) and ice was placed in one of the aquariums until the water was 14 degrees Celsius. Then a barrier was placed in each aquarium and two fish were put in the container with room temperature water, with one fish on each side of the barrier. We removed the barrier and observed the fish behavior for five minutes, recording the time in seconds each fish displayed the red mane. The fish were separated and this same procedure for two other fish was repeated. In the next phase, the first two fish were placed in the cold water aquarium, with one fish one each side of the barrier. The fish rested in the cold water for ten minutes before the barrier was removed in order for the fish’s metabolism to adjust to the colder temperature. Fish behavior was then observed for five minutes, recording time the fish displayed red mane. After the five minutes, the fish were separated and this phase was repeated for the second pair of fish. All of the fish were separated and placed back in room temperature at the end of the experiment. The time the fish displayed red mane in both conditions was averaged. A paired two-tailed t-test was ran to test for significance.


Results:
Figure 1 shows the average time spent displaying a red mane was significantly higher when fish were in room temperature water than when fish were in cold water. The average times spent displaying the red mane in room temperature water was 204.75 ± 34.33 seconds and 56.41 ± 50.12 seconds in cold water (t-stat = 5.20, df = 3, P = .014). 

Discussion:
As hypothesized, the betta fish that were in room temperature water spent significantly more time displaying a red mane than when they were in cold water. The betta fish that were in the cold water had a decreased metabolic rate, thus the fish could not expend as much energy toward agonistic behaviors such as the red mane. Additionally, the fish in the cold water did not move  as frequently as they did when in the room temperature water, further indicating a lowered metabolic rate. This reduced movement and aggressive behavior in the cold water allowed the fish to conserve maximal energy. Furthermore, a 2011 study by Taniguchi showed increased competitive and aggressive behaviors in various trout species as temperature increased, the same direct relationship we observed between aggressive behavior and temperature, further supporting our results [Taniguchi: 2011]. 
While our results are supported by numerous previous studies that found direct relationships between metabolic rate and temperature, other studies have also found mass and lifestyle to be important in determining metabolic rates [Killen: 2010]. Future studies should use fish that were all born at the same time and raised in similar conditions in order to ensure fish with similar lifestyles are being compared. If a fish had been raised in a particularly hostile environment, a higher metabolic rate may have resulted and impacted the results of this study. Additionally, fish of similar size should be used to further reduce confounding variables. Future studies could look at various species of fish, to see if fish accustomed to living in colder water display a similar response.
