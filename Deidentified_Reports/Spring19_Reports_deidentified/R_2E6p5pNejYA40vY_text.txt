Title: The Effects of Caffeine on the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog Leg

Abstract:
Muscle contractions rely on calcium channels letting calcium in and out of the cell. Caffeine is a known stimulant that generally excites an organism when it is ingested. This experiment was done to examine whether the direct injection of caffeine into a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle would induce a tetanic contraction and increase the average voltage response to a shock. In order to perform this, researchers shocked unaffected frog legs. Then, using the same frog legs, researchers injected them with caffeine and shocked the leg again. The researchers observed that the injection of caffeine did, in fact, induce a tetanic contraction and respond to the shock much stronger. These results supported the hypothesis of the research group.

Introduction:
Lower leg skeletal muscles in vertebrates are known as the gastrocnemus muscle. Muscle contractions occur because of motor neurons sending signals in the neuromuscular junction. These contractions are also affected by calcium channels allowing calcium into a cell. These contractions can be heightened by outside materials being added, such as caffeine. This experiment’s design was based from another experiment which took place on frogs in 1961 by C.P. Bianchi at the National Institute of Health. Bianchi injected caffeine into the sartorius muscle of frogs. Bianchi found that injecting caffeine in the frog’s leg increased twitch height in the sartorius. Bianchi determined the reason behind this discovery was that Caffeine increases the rate of resting calcium influx by three times as much as normal [Bianchi, 1961]. Based on this experiment, this group decided to study the effects of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle. This laboratory experiment concerns the effects of outside stimulation of caffeine on the gastrocnemus contractions. If caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog, then the average voltage measured in the gastrocnemus will increase during contraction, and there will be an obvious tetanic contraction.

Materials and Method:
To perform this experiment, researchers obtained three frog legs and removed their skin, exposing the gastrocnemus muscle. They placed two needles with electric currents in the gastrocnemus muscle and applied shocks at 1.0 V. These shocks were given without any outside stimulant, and three shocks were given. The data were recorded in myograms to observe the amount of direct voltage in the muscle. After the initial shocks, the same frog legs were injected with 0.1 Ml of 200mM caffeine. The same procedure occurred for the treated frog legs: three shocks were applied, and the results were recorded using myograms. In order to compare the controll to the treatment group, the researchers used a paired T-test.

Results:
The mean voltage measured during the gastrocnemus contraction for the controll group frogs was 0.284 V +/- 0.14 (Figure 1). When the controll group was given the shock, there were regular gastrocnemus contractions. The myogram revealed normal peaks for these contractions. The mean voltage for the treatment group was 0.854 V +/- 0.22 (Figure 1). The error bars in figure 1 denote the standard deviation. When the treatment group was given the shock, the caffeine created a more visibly intense contraction. This contraction maintained itself much longer than the controll, in a state of tetany, and the muscle appeared to stay in a flexed position. Also, on the myogram, it created a large peak that sustained themselves with tiny contractions at the top of the peak. The average difference in voltage between the two groups was 0.570 V. The paired t-value for the experiment was 10.03. The P-value was 0.009. The results contained 2 degrees of freedom. 

Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment, the hypothesis that there would be an increase in average voltage measured in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog after being injected by caffeine was supported. Since the hypothesis was supported, the null hypothesis was rejected, as there was obvious statistical and visible evidence that caffeine a huge effect on the gastrocnemus muscle. As the results suggest, the treatment group was significently affected by the injection of caffeine. There was an obvious physical difference in qualitatively observing the muscle, as it maintained the state of tetany for a significent portion of time. This is due to the effects of caffeine on calcium channels in the neuromuscular junction. In reference to Bianchi’s study, the caffeine injected obviously allowed much more calcium to rush in to the muscle cells very quickly [Bianchi, 1961]. Bianchi’s study supported this notion for the sartorius muscle, and this experiment supported the notion for the gastrocnemus muscle. There are vast opportunities for further study on the effects of injecting a skeletal muscle with a chemical. For example, researchers could attempt a similar experiment with ethanol, calcium channel inhibitors, or sodium inhibitors. Researcher Evert Knutson researched the effects of injecting ethanol in frog muscles to measure the changes in membrane potential [Knutsson, 1961]. A tweak in this experiment, such as measuring the voltage response of a frog’s skeletal muscle injected with ethanol would be a great idea for further study on the matter. This could give researchers insight as to how consuming ethanol affects skeletal muscle contraction.
