Title: The Prolongation of the Juvenile Phase of Manduca sexta given Additional Juvenile Hormone

Abstract:
This experiment examines the effect of juvenile hormone on the juvenile phase of tobacco hornworms, or Manduca sexta. Given that juvenile hormone, Precor in this experiment, prolongs the juvenile phase of insects, the purpose of this experiment is to determine how long the juvenile phase lasts in treated and nontreated caterpillars and observe their size based on mass. A group of four young Manduca sexta caterpillars was given regular food and another group was given food containing Precor. It is hypothesized that caterpillars treated with additional juvenile hormone will remain larvae longer than caterpillars in the controll group and will therefore grow larger. Although at the end of this experiment all of the caterpillars were still larvae and did not begin to pupate, the caterpillars treated with juvenile hormone grew significently more than those in the controll group.  

Introduction:
In experiments researching the relationship between growth hormones and insects, a hormone that biologists continue to learn about is juvenile hormone. The physiological effects of juvenile hormone including its toxicity and morphogenic effects are studied. According to Thomas G. Wilson, juvenile hormone has a role in many aspects of physiology including reproduction, development, and timing of metamorphosis [Wilson:2004]. Juvenile hormone is best known to prevent premature metamorphosis by regulating larval molts that are driven by ecdysone [Wilson:2004]. This hormone is mostly inactive during metamorphosis itself but is present beforehand to help controll when metamorphosis will be and after to controll aspects of reproduction [Wilson: 2004]. 
One insect in particular that reacts to varying levels of juvenile hormone is Manduca sexta. The Manduca sexta caterpillars studied in this experiment are considered larvae beginning at about three to five days of age. At this stage, as a first instar larva, the caterpillar typically weighs between one and six milligrams. Under constant, normal conditions in a laboratory, the tobacco hornworm can weigh eleven grams by the time it is a fifth instar larva [AD Johnson].
This lab examines Manduca sexta and its response to juvenile hormone. Juvenile hormone, in conjunction with ecdysone, is necessary for these caterpillars, also referred to as tobacco hornworms, to live. The hormone is produced in the gland called the corpus allata and regulates the type of molting in insects. Juvenile hormone also regulates some functions in adult insects.
	This study was done to determine how the duration of the juvenile stages of Manduca sexta is affected when the larvae are fed food containing about three percent juvenile hormone. It is hypothesized that Manduca sexta fed three percent juvenile hormone will have a prolonged juvenile phase of life compared to those not receiving juvenile hormone. 


Materials and Method:
Eight young tobacco hornworms were first obtained and their initial masses were recorded. They were divided into two groups of four caterpillars each. One group is the controll group and the other group received the juvenile hormone treatment. Each caterpillar was given a separate compartment of a plastic container with two air holes in each section.
To prepare the food for the caterpillars in the controll group, forty grams of food were obtained. About twelve drops of distilled water were mixed in with the food to prevent it from drying out. Ten grams of the controll food was then given to each of the four caterpillars in the controll group. 
The source of juvenile hormone used in this experiment is Precor. To prepare the food to be given to the caterpillars in the treatment group, about twelve drops of Precor were mixed in with forty grams of caterpillar food. Ten grams of the food containing Precor were given to each of the four caterpillars in the treatment group. Twelve drops were used because after dividing the food into ten-gram portions, there is about three drops of Precor, which is roughly equivalent to three percent per ten grams in each portion. 
The concentration of juvenile hormone in the food for the caterpillars in the treatment group was determined by observations made from other experiments. It was found that too little juvenile hormone did not have an effect on the juvenile phases of caterpillars, but too much juvenile hormone was detrimental to the caterpillars [A.D Johnson]. Therefore, about three percent of the hormone was given to the treated caterpillars to ensure that a difference in the duration of the juvenile phases of Manduca sexta would be seen but is not too much to be toxic. 
The caterpillars were kept in an incubator throughout the two weeks. For two weeks, the Manduca sexta caterpillars were weighed and observed each day using a scale and the masses were recorded. More food mixture was made and given to the caterpillars throughout the two weeks as needed. 
After data was collected, a two-sample t_test was used to analyze the data. A t_test was used to determine if the data is statistically significent. This statistical test was used because the mass of caterpillars from who different groups was being measured. 


Results:
Overall, the caterpillars in the treatment group grew about an average of four grams more than the caterpillars in the controll group. The mean growth of caterpillars in the controll group was 5.94 grams, while the mean growth of caterpillars in the treatment group was 10.6 grams (Figure 1). There is a statistically significent difference in the growth of the caterpillars between the controll group and the treatment group (3.014, 6, 0.012). All of the caterpillars remained a bright green color. On day twelve, two of the caterpillars in the treatment group had a noticeable commitment pulse. 

Discussion:
The initial hypothesis was that the caterpillars in the treatment group would stay in the juvenile phases longer than those in the controll group and therefore would grow larger while the caterpillars in the controll group would begin pupating. Because the p_value from the two-sample t_test was less than 0.05, it can be concluded that there is significance in the data. There was a significent difference in the mean growth between the groups. The caterpillars in the treatment group grew significently more than the caterpillars in the controll group.
	A study led by Laura Grunert can help explain this occurrence. It was expected that juvenile hormone would lengthen the juvenile stages of a Manduca sexta caterpillar, and the treated caterpillars would therefore grow larger. The experiment by Grunert states that Manduca sexta treated with juvenile hormone may grow up to 50% larger than those not treated with juvenile hormone [Grunert: 2015]. This means that the caterpillars given juvenile hormone could remain in the juvenile stage longer than those in the controll group, just at a greater mass. 
	In our experiment, to conclude whether or not juvenile hormone allows the caterpillars to grow larger and remain in the juvenile phase longer than caterpillars under normal conditions, the caterpillars would need to be observed for a longer period of time. This would allow the researchers to see which group of caterpillars, controll or treatment, begins to pupate first. If the caterpillars treated with juvenile hormone did not pupate before the caterpillars in the controll group, it could be concluded that juvenile hormone does extend the juvenile phases of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. Another factor that would allow the data to be more trustworthy is to use more individuals rather than only four in each group. 
The reason that juvenile hormone should prolong the juvenile phase of caterpillars and not begin their pupation is because it “allows ecdysone action to initiate the molt but prevents its actions in switching genetic programs necessary for metamorphosis” [Riddiford: 2012]. During the fifth instar larval stage, juvenile hormone levels decrease to almost zero. This loss of juvenile hormone “allows prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) release that stimulates a small amount of ecdysone release” [Riddiford: 2012]. Ecdysone allows the caterpillar to end feeding and begin pupating [Riddiford: 2012].
	Another factor that could influence the growth and metamorphosis of Manduca sexta caterpillars is to examine the effect of different levels of ecdysone. Because ecdysone and juvenile hormone are related in the morphisms of caterpillars, it could be beneficial to determine how these two both effect caterpillar growth.
	The relevance of information discovered about juvenile hormone can be related to species other than Mandiuca sexta. In fact, most insects contain juvenile hormone [Wilson: 2004]. Perhaps the ideal concentration of juvenile hormone in certain insects can be useful to humans. Some insects as adults are considered pests and can be detrimental to plants, whereas if they are provided more juvenile hormone, they are larvae for a longer period of time and could be less damaging. Not only do some insects negatively affect plants, but some are unfavorable to humans, like mosquitoes [Wu: 2006]. If mosquitoes remain larvae longer due to more juvenile hormone than they do under normal conditions, they could not affect humans as much and could therefore cause less disease in humans. 
	To further examine the physiological effects of juvenile hormone, researchers should further their study by observing the effects on organisms other than Manduca sexta. The period of time that organisms are studied can also be altered to observe a more specific difference in the amount of time that the juvenile phase is prolonged.
