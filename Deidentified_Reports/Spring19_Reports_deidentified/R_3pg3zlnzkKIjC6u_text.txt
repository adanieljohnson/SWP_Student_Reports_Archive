Title: The Impact of IGRs in the Development of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Abstract:

In the development of an insect, there are many factor that play a part to make sure its development is successful. In order to understand the growth and development of such species, knowledge of their physiological aspects is necessary. From this, you can determine how and what you can alter to make their development quicker or slower; factors such as weight and length are evidence of such alteration. 

In this experiment, the objective was to determine the effect of tampering with the juvenile hormone (JH) with IGRs to see how it would affect the growth and continuous development of the tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta). The prediction was that the Manduca sexta with its food contaminated with IGRs would have a less chance of survival. The end results were not significant, rejecting this prediction.

Introduction:
Introduction:

The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is a multivoltine leaf feeder that grows rapidly up to 10g in the larval stage… [Reinecke et al.:1980]. It is a common pest found in plants; their name comes from their worm-like body shape as well as the presence of its horn [Byron and Gillett-Kaufman: 2017]. From egg to an adult moth, it take about 39-48. The main hormones responsible for the growth and development  of the tobacco hornworm are: prothoracicotropic or brain hormone (PTTH or BH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). 20E and JH are especially essential, as if either is removed entirely, the insect dies; these two together work together to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. However, the completion of the life cycle of the tobacco hornworm depends on outside conditions, the quality of the diet available, and the average daily temperature [Johnson: 2018]. 

The greatest impacts on a insect, is the manipulation of its hormones that allow it grow and develop into an adult. The inputs from the insect’s body, the hormones, are released into the body. This is where IGRs come into play. IGRs act like a juvenile hormone. They regulate the time periods in which the insect stays young; by increasing the IGRs, it will cause a increase in youth time, preventing the insect, in this case the tobacco hornworm, from developing into an adults at its normal rate. An increase in youth usually concludes to an increase in diet, enlarging the body weight as well as the body length. Some insects exposed to such compounds may die due to abnormal regulation of hormone-mediated cell or organ development [Tunaz and Uygun: 2003]. Other insects may die either from a prolonged exposure at the developmental stage to other mortality factors (susceptibility to natural enemies, environmental conditions etc) or from an abnormal termination of a developmental stage itself [Tunaz and Uygun: 2003].

Hypothesis:
If we add and increase the amount of IGR present in the Manduca sexta, it will reduce the chances of it surviving.


Materials and Methods:
Materials and Methods:

Take eight containers with lids and puncture holes on top of the lids. Label four of the container 1-4 with the name controlled. Do the same with the last four except with the name treatment. You must be able to know which caterpillar is which. After setting up the containers, you need to set up their food as well. Each caterpillar gets 10g of food. Using a small container, you could measure each food on the scale individually or measure 80g of food altogether and then measure it again individually to get 10g. As you measure each food individually, roll them into a ball. This will make the distribution of the IGR equal. Once you are done, place this food container to the side. Place each of the measured food into its container. For the containers that say control, add 6 drops of distilled water onto the food using a pipet. Do the same with the treatment group using the IGR precor but with a different pipet. This is to avoid cross-contamination. Finally, measure the length and weight of each Manduca sexta before placing them into the containers. Clean up your area. Throw away the pipettes and wash the container used to measure the food. Before leaving wash your hands. For the next 14 days, collect the weight and length of the Manduca sexta. If the food seems dry, replace it again with a fresh 10g along with its correct liquid (distilled water or precor). Make sure to keep their environment clean and write down any observations. 


Results:
As we see in figure one, towards the beginning of the first couple of days, the treatment and control group had a small significant difference in length. The treatment group had the higher average compared to the controlled group. However, between the 4th - 9th day, the difference between the groups increased. The last couple of days, the difference decreased again. On days 1-10, the treatment group had the higher average. By day 11-12, control had the higher average. Figure two had a similar progression. From day 1-9, the difference between the controlled and treatment was more significant. Treatment had the higher average between those days. By day 11-12, the progression had reversed. Instead, the controlled group had a higher average on those days.


Discussion:
Discussion:

Our hypothesis, that adding and increasing IGR in the diet of the Manduca sexta will lower its chances of survival, was not supported. Based off our data, results, and observations, there was no significant data suggesting that the IGR, precor, caused an decrease in survival for our treatment group. All but four of our caterpillars died; two from the control group and two from treatment group. Therefore, these observations do not give evidence nor support. While our hypothesis was not supported, there were possible errors or mistakes conducted that could have lead to the downfall of our hypothesis. There were two days in the week that were missing data. Possibly, those two days could have made an impact. Another possible error was the incubator in which the caterpillars were kept. Due to multiple people conducting the same experiment, there was limited space. The containers our group used was not supposed to be stacked on top of one another. However, when we came to check on them, there were several time where the containers were stacked on top of each other. This could have prevented the air circulation of the Manduca sexta, possible decreasing the chances of them surviving. All these outside conditions affected the output (behavior, growth, development) of the caterpillars. The final data that rejected our hypothesis was the p-values. The p-value for the average length was 0.192 and the p-value for the average weight was 0.219. Both of these were greater than 0.05, there the data was insignificant. Being able to understand the life cycle of the Manduca sexta and the impacts involved with its growth and development helps us to understand its way of adapting to certain circumstances in order to survive. Not only does this help us in learning about the Manduca sexta, we helps us with any other species.
