Title: Effects of Caffeine on Muscle Tetany

Abstract:
Muscles help us to move every day. Organisms do about their everyday movements by contracting and expanding muscles. We explore how muscle activity is affected by caffeine. We tested the frog legs at various voltages to observe myograms with and without caffeine injected into the legs. The average voltage needed to reach tetany for the control was 0.474 and that of the experimental was 0.932. The standard deviation for the control was found to be 0.119 and the experimental was 0.178. The p-value from the paired t-test was determined to be 0.049. These results suggest that the caffeine indeed had a significant effect on the voltage needed to reach tetany in the frog legs. The caffeine provided the frog muscle with abundant ATP and as a result, cross bridges continued to form in the frog leg that helped the muscle contract provided there was calcium. Meaning that the caffeine caused the frog legs to have room for more voltage before reaching tetany. Studying muscles is still an ongoing process important for the well-being of humans and understanding how to improve muscle activity and stress on muscles. Further research into this field can help improve and understand the everyday movements in organisms.

Introduction:
Organisms do about their everyday movements by contracting and expanding muscles. The skeletal muscle of vertebrates and invertebrates consists of thousands of myofibers. The individual myofibers are bound together by connective tissues to form groups of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. They do so by using neurons neuromuscular junctions and a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh). The nerves impulses at the neuromuscular junctions cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh then binds to its receptor on the muscle fiber causing a release of sodium to generate an action potential in the muscle fibers. Through a process called excitation-contraction coupling, calcium ions released in the sarcoplasmic reticulum make the muscle move at the will of the brain by activating the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber [A.D: 2002]. In this experiment, we will be monitoring myogams which are electrical pulses in the muscle that are generated as they twitch. This experiment serves to determine what voltage will cause the gastrocnemius muscle in the frog leg (Rana pipiens) to reach a state of tetany and fatigue when caffeine is induced into the muscle. Muscles can usually only take a certain amount of voltage. We hypothesize that if we stimulate the leg of the frog that has been injected with caffeine, we expect the frog leg to reach tetany at a higher voltage than the regular frog leg.  

Materials and Methods:
My group received three frog legs and placed the legs in a dissecting pan. With a pair of forceps, we grasped the skin at the top of the leg and pulled the skin down towards the foot. The skinned leg was laid in the dissecting pan and moistened with frog Ringer's solution. A dissecting probe was used to gently separate the inner thigh muscles beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. The nerve in the frog leg was freed from its attaching connective tissue using dissecting needle and forceps. The frog leg was then connected to a voltmeter to observe myogams at rates 5, 10, and 20 Hz. After the frog legs reached tetany, the voltage at which that happened was recorded. Caffeine was then injected into the frog leg and the same process was done a second time. Meaning that each frog leg was both its control and experimental. After the raw data was collected, a paired t-test was performed.

Results:
Form Table 1, the average voltage needed to reach tetany was more in the experimental than in the control. The average voltage in the experimental was 0.9327 volts whereas the control had an average of 0.4743 volts. From Table 2, the standard deviation for the control is 0.1194 and for the experimental is 0.1781. The p-value was found to be 0.04967. The frog legs became very stiff after the caffeine was injected and the myogams were recorded. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the frog legs will reach tetany at a higher voltage was supported as the p-value was less than 0.05. That means that the results we obtained for the experiment weren’t due to mere chance. The caffeine had an effect on the frog legs by allowing it to make room for more voltage needed to reach tetany. The caffeine caused the frog legs to have an “adrenaline effect” [Prado-Franceshi: 2002]. The results of this experiment were supported by the primary literature as we observed a higher voltage to reach tetany as described by the primary literature. The caffeine provided the frog muscle with abundant ATP and as a result, cross bridges continued to form in the frog leg that helped the muscle contract provided there was calcium. It was also observed that the frog legs became stiff after the experiment and this can be a result of the myosin heads being bonded to the myosin binding sites. As the muscles continued to contract, they lost ATP and couldn’t detach from the myosin binding sites because the myosin heads needed to act as an ATP-ase to return back to its original expanded state. With this in mind, further research can be done to find the optimum dosage of caffeine humans can take in when we desperately need a boost. Studying muscles is still an ongoing process important for the well-being of humans and understanding how to improve muscle activity and stress on muscles. Further research into this field can help improve and understand the everyday movements in organisms.
