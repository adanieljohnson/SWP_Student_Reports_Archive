Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The importance of insect controll is growing rapidly as more and more farmers are having their crops destroyed by plant-eating pests. However, the use of insecticides is dangerous not only for humans, but for the rest of the natural environment. The use of Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) is far healthier than the normal pesticide, because it targets only processes that do not occur in mammals. In this experiment, we studied an IGR called Martin’s Hormone, and its effect on juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars. While we expected an increase in juvenile hormone to alter the maturation of the caterpillars, our data showed no significent difference between the treatment group and the controll group. 

Introduction:
In this experiment, we will test the effects of Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) on Manduca caterpillars. IGRs hinder development in the insect; however, unlike other pesticides, they are not directly toxic. By targeting processes that do not occur in mammals, IGRs are far more selective than pesticides and therefore do not pose as great a threat to the environment. In this case, we will be observing the effects of a specific IGR called Martin’s Hormone on juvenile hormone levels in the caterpillars. Manduca sexta caterpillars have five larval instars; along with ecdysterone, juvenile hormone (JH) controlls the timing of these instars [Kingsolver: 2007]. This hormone prevents the larvae from maturing into pupae until they have attained the appropriate stage and size. When the larvae are ready to molt, there is a significent drop in JH secretion [Symkal: 2014]. If the natural level of JH is altered, the normal development of insects should be affected as well. We hypothesize that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent the caterpillars from maturing into pupae.

Materials and Method:
Using a balance and a ruler, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars with relatively the same length, weight, and age were selected. Four caterpillars were identified as the treatment group and four were identified as the controll group. Each caterpillar was placed in its own individual cell in two containers (treatment and controll), each cell including punctured air holes. 80 grams of caterpillar food were measured out in a square container, and the balance was zeroed out making sure to zero out the scale before measuring. For the controll group, weigh 10 grams of food for each caterpillar. Add three drops of diluted water to each 10 grams of food. Place a 10-gram piece of food in each controll caterpillar cell. For the treatment group, weigh another 10 grams of food for each experimental caterpillar. Add three drops of Martin’s Hormone to each 10 grams of food. Place a 10-gram piece of food in each treatment caterpillar cell. Close the lid on both containers and place the caterpillars in an incubator. Each day use a balance and ruler to measure and record the length and weight of each caterpillar. Replenish the food if it is dried out. A two-sample T-test was used to determine the differences in average length and weight between the controll group and the treatment group.


Results:
The average weight of both the controll and treatment groups increased steadily for the first eleven days, although the treatment group seemed to gain significently more than the controll group (Fig.1). From day eleven to day fourteen, the treatment weight seemed to decrease and level off (Fig.1.) The controll weight increased slightly between days eleven and twelve, then rapidly decreased (Fig.1.) The length of both the controll and treatment group seemed to increase at a relatively consistent rate from days one through twelve, although there were some slight fluctuations in the length of the treatment group (Fig.2). From day twelve to day fourteen, the controll length seemed to level off while the treatment length continued to increase (Fig.2). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean weight of the controll group was not statistically significently different than the mean weight of the treatment group (t_stat = 0.513508, d.f. = 26, P = 0.611933). The mean length of the controll group was not statistically significently different than the mean length of the treatment group (t_stat = 0.023993, d.f. = 26, p = 0.981041). Based on these results, we determined that the controll group and the treatment group had relatively similar maturation patterns. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent the larvae from maturing at a rate different than that of the controll group, was not supported. While we did see some variation between the controll group and the treatment group, the difference between the two was not significent enough to reject the null hypothesis. An explanation could be that we did not increase the amount enough, and therefore did not see a significent change. Perhaps increasing the amount of juvenile hormone would lead to more substantial results.
