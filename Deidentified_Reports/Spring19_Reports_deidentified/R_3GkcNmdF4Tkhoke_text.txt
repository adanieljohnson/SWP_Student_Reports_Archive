Title: The effects of ecdysterone inhibitor in Manduca sexta larvae

Abstract:
Hormones are used in an organism as a way to coordinate the function of other biological processes. In the Manduca sexta, different hormones, including ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, control the growth of the larvae until the pupation process. Ecdysterone (20E) focuses on timing of the molt process when leading up to pupation. If 20E is manipulated by an external stimuli by inhibiting the production of it in the Manduca Sexta, then the molting process will be delayed in the experiment group. Weight changes were monitored and recorded. After determining the p-value to be not of significance, it cannot be determined that the changes in weight in the experimental group didn’t happen by coincidence. It was observed that the control caterpillars did reach pupation, whilst the experimental caterpillars failed to gain much weight.

Introduction:
Hormones are typically defined as a chemical molecule that is secreted to coordinate the function of another biological process. In the Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta, “insect molting and metamorphosis are governed by the ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone (JH)” [Riddiford: 2003]. This means that hormones affect the organism’s development by either promoting progression or causing regression. The central role of the ecdysteriods, primarily 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), is to initiate and coordinate the larval molts and metamorphosis [Fujiwara: 1995]. This metamorphosis is important, as the insect is considered as a pest to tomato crops when larvae. The metamorphosis of Manduca sexta is the transition of a larvae to a pupate, which will ultimately lead to the creation of a moth. 20E happens to affect the timing of this metamorphosis, specifically between the larvae and pupation stage. The commitment pulse, a spike in 20E that declares the organism has enough resources to begin pupating, happens right before the 5th larval stage. If 20E is manipulated by an external stimuli by inhibiting the production of it in the Manduca sexta, then the molting process will be delayed in the experimental larvae.

Materials and Methods:
There were a total of 8 4th instar-larvae used in the experiment. Four were placed into a control group, while the other four were used for experimentation. These insects were kept in plastic containers for 14 days in an incubator. During these 14 days, the caterpillars were weighed (in grams) and fed. Food was replaced when the supply was consumed. For the control group, we fed them 10g caterpillar food with 10 drops of water mixed in. For the experimental group, we fed them 10g caterpillar food with 10 drops of Aza-guard, an ecydsterone (20E) inhibitor, at a 1:1250 concentration. For statistical purposes, we used a two-sample T-test and calculated the average rate of change for each group. Using this averaged rate of change, we were able to perform the t-test and receive a p-value. This p-value was measured at the 95% confidence, with results being less than 0.05 having significance.

Results:
At the 95% confidence and a one-tailed p-value, p = .0681. This means that the alternate hypothesis is rejected, and therefore there is not enough significance to prove that ecdysterone inhibitor has an effect on the timing of the molting process. This also means that it cannot be proven that coincidence played as a factor within the experiment. Represented in Figure 1 is the growth of the larvae overtime. During this time frame, the caterpillars would have transitioned from the fourth-instar larvae stage to the fifth-larvae stage, which is approximately the time when the commitment pulse is sent to begin the molt process. As seen here, there is a visible increase trend between both groups, but then at about the 8th day, some caterpillars fluctuated. C4 went through a steady decline, whilst C2 weight’s fluctuated the whole time. When looking at day 8 for the experimentals, E3 dropped in weight and E4 gained weight. However, their roles switched on day 9, to where E3 gained weight and E4 dropped. All of the experimentals died by the eleventh day. 

Discussion:
Even though the results were not proven significant, understanding the trends created helps us to interpret the research behind why we picked this hypothesis. All of the experimentals failed to gain weight when given the 20E in their diet. However, there could be error through food processing, as some food could’ve dried out, causing the caterpillar to not eat it. The use of ecdysterone inhibitor to experiment on Manduca sexta caterpillars enabled us to observe the effects of hormone manipulation. Manipulating 20E enables scientists to study the growth process of the caterpillar by monitoring how much and at what time the hormone must be administered to maintain homeostasis. The study of hormones also enables scientists to learn about other biological processes, and their benefits that could possibly pose to modern medicine.  In one experiment, “Food limitation also: altered immune gene expression, changed the activity of key immune enzymes, depressed the concentration of a major antioxidant (glutathione), reduced resistance to oxidative stress, reduced resistance to bacteria (Gram positive and negative bacteria) but appeared to have less effect on resistance to a fungus.” [Adamo: 2016]. Understanding how the caterpillars altered their own gene expression would provide future biologists and biomedics to apply those skills to human physiology. This gene expression alteration came from the caterpillar’s internal system’s manipulation of its own hormones. Hormones are important for growth and development, and the altercation of these hormones have the possibility to leave effects on the organism.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 – This represents the growth of the larvae over the course of 14 days, with the first day being marked as ‘1’ and the last being marked as ’15.’ Markers named with ‘C’ represent the controls, and markers named with ‘E’ represent the experimentals. This confirms that the experimentals lacked to gain weight when given the 20E inhibitor.*************************************************************************
