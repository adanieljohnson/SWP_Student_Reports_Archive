Title: The Impact of Intraspecies Coloration Differences on Aggressive Behaviors in Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Male competition for access to females for reproductive success is common in many species and is especially visible in Betta Splendins, a colorful species of fish known as “fighting fish” for the males’ highly aggressive behaviors towards each other. This experiment studied whether coloration difference between male Betta fish placed in proximity had a significent impact on the aggression displayed by those males involved. It was hypothesized that males would display heightened aggression towards conspecific males of different coloration compared to those with like coloration, likely to compete more intensely with males representing a higher reproductive threat. Individual males of certain coloration were successively placed near conspecific individual male of like and unlike coloration patterns and the amount of time spent with an aggressive display, flared operculum and brachiostegal membranes, was recorded over a five-minute exposure period between the two fish. The results of the groups were not significently different, and therefore did not support the hypothesis, but more study on the impact of coloration on aggressive behaviors in male Betta fish is recommended as there were some sources of error in the experimental plan. 

Introduction:
All species of animals display unique inter- and intraspecific behaviors motivated by various goals, largely for survival and reproductive success. Competition between males for female mates is recurrent in many known species, and Betta Splendins, more commonly known as Betta fish, exemplify an especially aggressive form of this behavior. These colorful Asian fish, especially males, are known for their agnostic behaviors towards other males of the same species. As male Bettas don’t attack females, only engage with conspecific males, and become increasingly aggressive towards these males in the presence of a conspecific female, it is largely believed that their levels of intraspecific agnostic behaviors are driven by competition for reproductive success [Elcoro: 2008]. Betta fish are known for their bright skin coloration, especially prominent in males; brighter coloration in males can often lead to increased selection by females, signifying the linkage between brighter, more unique color and reproductive success [Blakeslee: 2009]. Therefore, differing coloration patterns is likely a factor in sexual competition between males and should lead to increased agnostic behaviors, as differently-colored fish represent a higher threat to reproductive privileges. Based on this theory, we hypothesized that male Betta fish would display increased agnostic behaviors towards individuals of a different coloration than their own. To quantify this hypothesis, the length of time each fish spent with a spread operculum and/or brachiostegal membrane (“red mane”), which are aggressive behaviors displayed in the facing position [Elcoro: 2008], was recorded and compared. 

Materials and Method:
		To conduct the experiment, four domesticated male Betta fish were obtained from the lab classroom, two of a bright red color and two with a darker blue, almost purple color. The behavior of the individual fish was observed when each was presented with another male fish of the same color and then of different color, respectively. The fish were revealed to each other for a period of five minutes in neighboring tank compartments with a glass divider between them to avoid having to physically separate aggressive fish for their safety yet allowing them to be aware the other fish was present. The two red fish were placed next to each other, then the two blue fish, and finally two pairings of a red fish with a blue fish. Five minutes of rest was given between each trial so that the fish could adequately rest. During the five-minute period where fish were exposed to each other, researchers held stopwatches and timed the individual fish while their branchiostegal membranes were flared, adding up total time spent with the aggressive display at the end of the period. The average data was then collected comparing trials using fish of different colors versus fish of the same color and a paired student t test was conducted to determine significance. 

Results:
Fish in this study spent an average time of 85.87 91.90 seconds with red mane displayed when presented with another male fish of the same coloration pattern, and these same fish spent 96.7136.82 seconds with the same aggressive display when presented with males of a markedly different coloration (Fig. 1). The paired student t test resulted in a p value of 0.87, a t value of 0.18 and 3 degrees of freedom. 

Discussion:
The results gathered did not significently support our hypothesis, with the p value of 0.87 much higher than the acceptable 0.05, meaning no significent evidence was collected to indicate increased levels of aggression in male Betta fish when presented with males of a different coloration pattern from their own. However, this does not necessarily disprove the hypothesis as a whole but may rather reflect error in the data collection of this experiment. It is well-known that Betta fish can see color and social groupings and association are highly impacted by coloring patterns of individuals [Blakeslee: 2009]. A study by Thompson and Sturm successfully linked coloration to male Betta fish aggression, finding that the fish responded more to other males with coloration unlike their own than they did to males with like coloration [Thompson: 1965]. This result indicates that our experiment was likely flawed to not have obtained the same result. Sources of error may have included the small sample size, as only four fish were used total and behavior can vary between individuals of a species. Behavioral variation between individuals may have also contributed to our result as our method of quantifying aggressive behavior depended on a single display of aggression: the flaring of the operculum and brachiostegal membrane. Also, although there is not strong evidence in literature for significent difference in aggression based on the color of a Betta fish individually, this may have served as a confounding variable as multiple colors of fish were utilized. Though our hypothesis was not supported by the data we collected, the impact of coloration on intraspecific agnostic behaviors in Betta Splendins fish is one that definitely merits more research, as this visual component for the fish is significent in other aspects of their lives.
