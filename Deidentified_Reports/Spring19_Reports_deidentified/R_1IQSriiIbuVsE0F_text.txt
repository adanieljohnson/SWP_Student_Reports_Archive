Title: Unsupported effect of Caffeine on increasing Maximum Muscle Contraction Force in Rania Pipiens

Abstract:

Using Rania Pipiens legs we tested the effects of caffeine on muscle performance, as a potential ergogenic aid, that could increase muscle strength through various possible mechanisms. We tested if injecting the frogs gastrocnemus muscles with caffeine would increase the maximum contractile force of the muscle at different frequencies of stimulation. We hypothesized that the caffeine would increase the muscle contraction force, by enhancing the release of Calcium from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum. We electrically stimulated the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog at different frequencies both with and without caffeine injected into the muscle. And recorded the myograms and data produced by a force transducer that was attached to the muscle. Our hypothesis was not supported by the results of our experiment, as only 1 out of 3 legs tested had a higher MVC in the Test trials than that of controll. Our P value likewise did not show statistical significance in the difference of contraction force between the test and controll groups as a result of caffeine. 


Introduction:
Introduction: 
Caffeine is one of the most popular drugs in the world. Its renowned for its effects of increasing perceived alertness and lack of fatigue in its users. There have been many studies on the effects of caffeine as an ergogenic aid for athletes, effecting either their endurance or strength in general but the exact mechanism of caffeine’s effect is not fully known[Beck: 2006]. There are however proposed method, such as the increased and enhanced release of Calcium from the sarcoplasmic Reticulum, which results in calcium binding to troponin, causing muscle contraction [Sadava:2016] or perhaps effecting the CNS to increase the motor units recruited during contraction[Warren:2010]. The data that supports whether or not there is a effect of caffeine on force of muscle contraction and endurance is mixed, although studies have shown that there is an increase in muscle strength and endurance [Warren:2010]. The objective of this experiment was to discern for ourselves whether or not caffeine did in fact have an effect on muscle strength or MVC (maximal voluntary contraction). In this experiment we would use the leg of the Rania Pipiens species of frog, specifically the gastrocnemus muscle with a force transducer to measure the fore of contraction. We will seek to determine the outcome of whether there is more contractile force in the muscle when caffeine is introduced into the system, compared to normal conditions. It is our hypothesis that once the caffeine is introduced into the test group the frogs legs will have a larger contractile force, which will be measured in volts compared to the controll group with no caffeine.

Materials and Method

In this experiment we used 3 frog legs form the Rania Pipiens species in this experiment. However each leg acted as both the controll group and the test groups consecutively. Meaning first conducted the experiment as the controll group on each leg and then introduced caffeine and tested each leg as the test group. We first degloved the legs, and isolated and identified the sciatic nerve as well as the gastrocnemus muscle. We then cut the gastrocnemus muscle with the achilles tendon off of the bone at that point, and then tied the tendon and muscle with a string to the force transducer so that the gastrocnemus is hanging straight underneath the transducer. We then pinned down the frogs leg with pins at both ends of the tibia so it stayed stable during contraction. Then we placed electrodes across the sciatic nerve of the leg. During the course of this preparation and rest of the experiment we kept the leg moist with frog’s ringer solution, applying approximately every 5 minutes. For the controll tests the frog legs received no caffeine or other solution added to the muscle. Then we used the stimulator and the labscribe software to apply 10Hz, with 0 pulse and 1 amp across the Sciatic nerve for a second and recorded the data and myogram generated by the force transducer. We then repeated this same test with 25 Hz and 50Hz for each leg. After the leg went through the full controll test we injected 1 mg of caffeine with a syringe into the gastrocnemus muscle of each leg and repeated the same test with the 10, 25, and 50Hz. Then we repeated this whole process with the other legs. We measured the force of muscle contraction by the maximum change in voltage or V that occurred  in the myogram during the application of the Hz, where a higher V represents more force. After we collected the data we applied a paired T-test as well as calculating the standard deviations for the V and a also calculated a P value. 


Results:
Our Results showed that in 2 out of the 3 legs the Test group had a lower average △V than their controll groups as can be seen in Figure 1. However in Leg #2 the Test Average △V was much larger then the △V controll average as can be seen in table 1. Table 1 also shows us that the maximum △V recorded in all of the series was the Test △V in Leg #2.  The P value for this data was 0.64  the Stand deviation was (0.26) in Test group and (0.02) in Control group. 
While we conducted the experiment we also did observe that while the caffeine was being injected into the frog leg, the muscles did contract Frequently to the point of tetany, even though no electrical current was being applied at this time. Also during our experiment we observed that during the Test group on leg 1 and 3 the △V consistently decreased as we increased the Hz value, something that was not seen in the controll group for either leg, or in any other run.  



Discussion:
DICUSSION 
Our hypothesis was not supported by the results of our experiment. We hypothesized that injecting the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens would result in a greater contractile force of the muscle, compared to when there was no caffeine present. However our results did not confirm this. In fact in our experiment in 2 out of the 3 legs in fact showed a greater force of contraction with no caffeine present than with caffeine. In one of the legs the force was greater with caffeine added, but overall this was not the general trend, and our P value showed that our data was not statistically significent. Leg #2 showed a Test △V much higher in the test rather than that of the controll, which does make it somewhat of an outlier in our data as not only did was this the only leg that showed increased force in the Test run, but there was also a rather large difference in force between the Test and Control runs. This could perhaps be explained by the fact that we did the controll runs first, which could have led to tetany in the leg and fatigue by the time that we had got to the Test group trials. This interpretation is supported by the observation that Leg 1 and 3 the △V decreased in the controll group despite an increasing Hz value which should have led to a increasing summation of twitches and therefore a greater overall △V and force. The myograms generated during these test runs also indicated tetany and fatigue in the muscle as the trials occurred. These muscles are obviously not connected to a living frog body and therefore only have a limited supply of ATP to supply the muscle of the frog leg, so with repeated trials of contraction in the leg, the leg could lose most of its ATP supply and lose its power to contract its muscles fully and forcefully before the Test trials. This may have been why other experiments involving caffeine involve living subjects [Beck: 2006] [Tarnopolsky:2016]. 
So if we take this inference and apply it to our experiment it may have been that Leg 2 was the only one where tetany and fatigue did not interfere with the contraction and force of the Test trials. Also in our experiment we did observe that all of the frog legs did contract with some force while the caffeine was being injected into the leg despite the absence of an electrical stimulus being applied artificially. This could suggest that the Caffeine affects the contractile force of the muscle by  potentiating calcium ion release from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum, which is supported by Tarnopolsky and Cupido’s findings [Tarnopolsky:2016]. This is one of the many theorized mechanisms in which caffeine could potentially effect muscle contraction and fatigue[Warren:2010]. The fact that in two of our legs showed fatigue could have been due to this as well, as the caffeine injection could have increased a constant calcium release from the SR, keeping calcium ions interacting with the troponin, therefore not allowing the muscle to relax fully in between the Control and Test trials, and possibly in between the individual test trials, leading to tetany, and fatigue of the muscles.
To combat this fatigue of muscles an experiment could be conducted in a different manner where simply the trials could be run in a much more quick fashion, as to not increase the time of partial contraction and therefore fatigue caused by caffeine. Or possibly this experiment could be run with living subjects, and allow recovery time in order to mitigate the effects of dwindling ATP supply in the muscles, and other potential complications. In addition we could Test only a smaller range of frequencies applied to the muscles specifically at frequencies of around 20Hz, which other studies have  found to be the Hz that showed most effect of caffeine on muscle performance [Tarnopolsky:2016].
 	Our mixed findings of the effects of caffeine do in fact support the mixed findings of other research papers where one claims that “caffeine ingestion can increase MVC strength and endurance”[Warren:2010] while others claim that only upper body strength is affected[Beck: 2006] while other conclude that “there was no effect on MVC” but does claim that it increases force in low frequency stimulation [Tarnopolsky:2016]. In conclusion our data from this lab does not support the hypothesis that caffeine causes an increase in contractile force of the muscles.
