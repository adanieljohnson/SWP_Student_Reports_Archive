Title: Resource allocation and plasticity of a plant changing its environmental temperature. 

Abstract:
Plant allocation provides a variety of strategies through which the plant can get enough resources for its survival. Natural resources are limited and all organisms compete against each other to get them. In this experiment, we want to demonstrate the importance of water in plants for photosynthesis to occur. Our experiment consisted of two Scale Cereal plant groups. The controll group was placed in a greenhouse to simulate normal growing temperature, and the experimental group was placed in an incubator with a higher temperature.  We measured both group and compared their mean  root to shoot ratios  as well as their lengths and weights. This study found a statistical difference between the mean weight of the experimental group and that of the controll showing that temperature is without a doubt a key aspect that affects a plant’s necessities. After using the paired t_test and observing the results the only variable that was actually significent was the Length R:S Ratio, which confirms that our hypothesis is not supported.

Introduction:
A plant’s needs dictates the plant’s growth. Consistent with the ‘partitioning’ perspective, changes in allocation patterns have been conceptualized and analyzed as ratios, e.g. root:shoot ratio or reproductive effort [Poorter & Nagel 2000]. The environment in which plants are placed will determine its total growth, the growth of the root and shoot and its weight, due to the plant need to get nutrients from the soil and sunlight. Because resources allocated to one function or organ are not available to other functions or organs, allocation implies tradeoffs [Stearns: 1992]. The lack of water will make the plant increase the length of the its roots so it can reach more parts of the ground to get enough of it. Water is a major resource that contributes to the plant’s photosynthesis processes and thus is important to get energy and accomplish its vital needs.
We want to study which parts of plants are more likely to grow longer in a specific environment. We studied the chances of growth in plants by varying characteristics of its location. The temperature in which the plant is living is key to determining the length,weight, and root to shoot ratio.
Because of the increase of the temperature we believe that the ability of water in the soil will decrease and the plant will grow bigger and longer roots in order to get water. So, we hypothesized that plants placed in a warmer setting will have the Root:Shoot ratio, weight, and length higher than the ones placed in a place with a lower temperature as a greenhouse (controll group), owing to the necessity of water of the plants located in a dry place.


Materials and Method:
We used Secale Cereal seeds and planted them in two sets of six pots filled with vermiculite. We introduced 10 seeds in each hole of the pot. After this, we buried them, applying vermiculite over the seeds. We placed them into the pots and then we labeled the 1st pot with ‘greenhouse’ and the 2nd with ‘incubator’. The 1st group was located in the greenhouse as our controll group, and the experimental group in the incubator at a constant temperature of 37°C. We applied the miracle gro formula to speed up its growth and irrigated the plants for 2 weeks. We let the plants repose for two weeks and let them grow with all their resources constant. After this, we took three plants of each pot by pouring water in a large tub, so it facilitated us to took the entire plant meticulously without breaking any part of the plant. Afterwards, we cut the plant at the root shoot junction (we decided the root shoot junction would be where the plant changes its color), we made sure that each shoot and root didn’t mix with the rest. We proceeded on measuring the individual weights of the roots and shoots (making sure to keep individual plants together). Later, we measured the length of the individual roots and shoots. Subsequently, after having all the data collected we calculated divided each shoot measurement by its correspondent shoot, and so obtained the R:S ratio of the length and weight, and then calculated the mean and the standard deviation. From this research, we made a graph with the data of the weight and length collected (R:S) 


Results:
Our measures for the R:S ration for length are (1.48+/- 0.37) for the incubated plants and for the plants in the greenhouse (1.54+/- 0.38)(fig.1). The R:S ratio for the weights are (2.55+/-1.32) for the incubator and (0.57+/- 0.25)(fig.2) for the greenhouse group. The standard deviation for the  length of the greenhouse group was 0.4 and for  the incubator group was 0.37.

Discussion:
The results don’t support our hypothesis. As you may observe in the table below, it’s been calculated each possible variable that exists in weight and length of shoots and roots and the overall weight and length of the plant grown in the greenhouse and incubator, and its R:S ratio. We didn’t have the mechanisms to change the temperature of the soil, then we just worked with the temperature of the air, and that can be the major reason why on the paired t_test result only supported our hypothesis on the R:S ratio weight and not the length . The P value was significent for he weight R:S located on the incubator so at first our hypothesis was validated, but when we looked at the P value of the length R:S it was not statistically significent between the two groups to determine that the hypothesis was confirmed. The reason why the plants located in the incubator had a higher difference referring to the weight and not the length compared with the plants located in the greenhouse is unknown. The  only  effect  of temperature    on   root/shoot    ratio   is   through   its influence   on   resource   acquisition   or   partitioning [A.Day: 1991]. It is expected that plastic responses in resource allocation should be the rule in species inhabiting a range of environmental conditions [Soule: 1981]. A plant may respond to the environment simply by altering its growth rate without affecting the allocation of resources or plant morphology. Alternately developmental patterns may be altered, resulting in marked changes in morphology or allocation [Schlichting: 1986]. In the allometric view, plasticity in allocation can be understood as a change in a plant’s allometric trajectory in response to the environment [Elsevier GmbH:2004]. Differences in resource allocation along an environmental gradient do not consistently agree with theoretical predictions, perhaps not unexpectedly for species whose individuals have great phenotypic plasticity.
Nevertheless, our plants just responded to the R:S weight. 

We concluded that the average R:S weight  ratio is larger in plants allocated in the incubator. Although, the mean in R:S length ratio is not larger in plants allocated in the incubator. Comparing the 1st graph that shows the average ratio in length, the difference between the two groups it is almost insignificent, so we cannot confirm our hypothesis, and so the temperature in which a plant grows doesn’t affect its length. It is unknown the reason why the plants didn’t respond to the change of temperature, even though the environment was more dry than the controll group.
However, on the 2nd graph reflects the average weight ratio there is a clear difference between plants harvest in the incubator and the greenhouse, which supports part of our hypothesis.
Our hypothesis was not supported. It might have been a lack of time that the plants were exposed to the experiment. It could also have been due to an insufficient amount of temperature that was applied to heat the incubator.
