Title: IGR Mimic Juvenile Hormone Longterm Effect on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment is to determine if the Manduca Sexta caterpillars were exposed to 8 drops of Juvenile Hormone IGR, what effects will be seen. We hypothesized that they will lose weight and decrease in length, thus giving them a lesser chance of survival. Using credible previous studies, IGR had an impact on the molting process, thus not allowing the caterpillar to pupate into an adult. We separated 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars into 2 groups, one controll and one treatment, and exposed the treatment to 8 drops of IGR hormone. We then recorded their weight and length for two weeks. Our data was insignificent due to human error in the data and our p_value being higher than 0.05. However, using previously published studies, their data supported our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
The experiment evaluates the effect of an IGR mimic juvenile hormone on the Manduca Sexta, a moth. Hormones produced are an extremely important component in all organisms but especially insects and mammals as they play an important role in stimulating various cells and tissues. They are also responsible for various phases in the human body such as puberty in which it transitions into adulthood. A similar effect is seen in insects in which they pupate and molt to become adults. Molting is the shedding or casting off of an outer layer or covering and the formation of its replacement. (Browder: 2001) The Manduca Sexta was chosen due to its widely researched background and it is a pest to various crops. (H Schmutterer: 1988) The multiple hormones that it secretes have a substantial impact on the multiple phases and transitions it undergoes. One of the most important hormone and the one that will be used in the experiment, IGR, regulates the type of molt during its development and controlls various functions within it. (Federick: 1974) Normally, it would undergo a commitment pulse after its 5th instar larvae stage, this would allow it to develop into a pupa and then an adult moth. (Federick: 1974) Just before the commitment pulse, the levels of juvenile hormone would drop substantially, allowing higher levels of ecysteroids, a hormone in charge of the timing of molting, to be produced and thus allow it to undergo the commitment pulse. (Truman: 1983) With the introduction of an increased amount of IGR, this would prevent the  from undergoing the commitment pulse and introducing abnormalities within it, decreasing the rate of survival. (Browder: 2001) A profound impact it has on the Manduca Sexta is the low egg hatch rates, thus preventing them from increasing their numbers. (Browder: 2001) This experiment treats the Manduca sexta caterpillars to 8 drops of Juvenile Hormone IGR and evaluate their weight and length for the effects. The independent variable in this experiment is the IGR hormone used on them and the dependent variables are the weight and length of the Manduca Sexta. This should have a profound impact on the functions and appearance of the caterpillars due to the nature of the IGR hormone. Our hypothesis is if the Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to 8 drops of Juvenile Hormone IGR, then they will lose weight and decrease in length, thus giving them a lesser chance of survival. 

Materials and Method:
We first collected 8, 11-12 day old Manduca Sexta caterpillars that weigh on average 1.5 to 2g and are 8-10mm when selected. They were then then divided into 2 groups, one for controll and another for treatment. They were placed into separate containers and individually numbered and placed in an incubator at 〖25〗^(0_C ). The controll and treatment groups were fed two separate diet, the controll had 10g of food and with an added 8 drops of water in it every day while the treatment group had 8 drops of IGR hormone using a pipette mixed in its 10g of food every day. This was repeated every day for 14 days and we weighed and measured them every day to collect data. We then performed a two tailed t_test to validate our data and its significance. 

Results:
A trend that occurs in both the averages of the length and weight of the Manduca Sexta is that they both increase at a steady pace until the 9th day in which it starts to drop. The length and weight of both groups, controll and treatment, increased until the 9th day, after which, it drops with slight variations on a per day basis. The controll group grew much larger and heavier than the treatment even though they started off with similar properties. The general trend for length and weight were similar in both groups. A two-tailed two sample t_test was ran for the average weight and length. Our p_values for the average weight and length is 0.40522 and 0.251871 respectively and any value &gt;0.05 treats the data as insignificent.



Discussion:
The results do not support our hypothesis, not due to its being disproven biologically but instead due to human error. Our P-values are well above the threshold of 0.05 and such our data is insignificent. By utilizing a credible previously published study, it showcases that a similar experiment did support our hypothesis. At the critical stage of the 5th instar larvae, the caterpillar’s weights were determined to be 6.0 to 6.5 grams. The final weight of normally-feeding larvae in their colony was 11 to 12 grams. (Browder, 2001) The juvenile hormone introduced various abnormalities within the caterpillar and induced them into starvation as they refused to undergo commitment pulse. It affects the typical molting stages as it primarily regulates molting of the Manduca Sexta. While our data does not support our hypothesis, data from previous studies do and this comes down to our inconsistencies when recording down data. A logical next step for this study is to repeat it as is but have a more robust measuring and weighing system as while as having a group member check the data every day for inaccuracies. It would also be advisable to use the same scale and the same ruler for all the measurements. The ability to prevent the Manduca Sexta from going through the commitment pulse is akin to a human being unable to undergo puberty due to manipulation of the hormones that allow it to do so. The result of being able to eliminate the caterpillars rather harMlessly to the environment would greatly benefit crops as they are a pest to it. The more research about hormones would allow us to greater controll the negative effects of insects and mammals and instead retain more of the positive effects of them.
