Title: The less-aggressive nature of male Betta splendens in the presence of a female audience

Abstract:
Betta splendens, or Siamese Fighting Fish, are an interesting organism to study because they express different behaviors depending on their current circumstance. This experiment focused on intraspecific behaviors and how the audience effect would alter the aggressiveness of males when a female Beta splenden was introduced. It was expected that the presence of a female in the tank would increase male aggressiveness because they would be protective over their potential mate. The behaviors of the males were observed and rated on a 3-point scale during 5-minute sessions in which they were either only in the presence of another male or they were accompanied by females (one in each section with a male). The fish were given 5 minutes after each session to rest and a coin flip was used to determine the order of procedures as to reduce chances of habituation. The results of the paired t-test did not indicate a statistically significant difference between the aggressiveness of males with or without a female audience, though the trend indicated the males were actually less aggressive in the presence of females, meaning our hypothesis was not supported. Future studies could explore the effects if only one male was accompanied by a female to observe differences in competitive behavior.  

Introduction:
The agonistic behaviors exhibited by Betta Splendens and many other animal species brings forth the idea that physiological purpose for behaviors, learned actions and the animal’s perceptions to situations can be useful for better understanding how species weigh the costs and benefits of circumstances. Betta splendens, common aquarium fish commonly called Siamese fighting fish, are an interesting organism to study because they express different behaviors depending on their current situation. Betta splendens are sexually dimorphic, meaning the male and female fish possess different characteristics aside from their sexual organs. Males tend to be larger in size and become more aggressive in the presence of another male and can even change colors. A phenomenon called the audience effect suggest that a change in signaling behavior is due to the presence of observers in the environment [Matos, et. al., 2002]. This experiment focused primarily on intraspecific behaviors and how an audience of a female Beta splenden could the aggression of males. It is important that behaviors such as these (agonistic) are studied because it can give researchers insight into reproductive fitness of this species and the evolution of certain behaviors. It was expected that the presence of a female in the tank would increase male Beta splenden aggressiveness because they would be protective and territorial over their potential mate. 

Materials and Methods:
A coin flip was used to determine which condition the male fish would be placed in first. The two potential scenarios are either a male is placed in a tank next to another male fish (separated by glass) and observed for five minutes. The other potential scenario is the same set up, but with a female fish placed in the same tank as the two males. There were three sets of male/female pairings, and each male was observed with the other two males. After each five-minute observation session, the fish were given 5 minutes of isolation for relaxation. During each session, the behaviors were rated on a scale of 1-3. A score of 1 indicated pelvic fin flickering or erect pectoral fins (less aggressive). a score of 2 indicated tail beating or spreading the opercula (moderately aggressive). A score of 3 indicated tail flashing or red “mane” (very aggressive). The frequency of these behaviors was recorded during each session and summed to a total number (per interaction). The reactions of the fish to each condition were then compared using a paired one-tailed t-test (critical number was 0.05). 

Results:
The total mean aggressiveness of males without the female audience (after summing the recorded scores) was 11.83  15.97, while the total mean aggressiveness of males with the female audience was 3.33  3.06. These results of the paired t-test did not produce significant results, since the p-value= 0.38 (higher than the critical value of 0.05), meaning the two groups were not significantly different in their levels of aggressiveness due to the female audience (df= 2, N= 3, t-value= 1.09). 

Discussion:
Though the results of the experiment did not show significant results, it can still be noted that the general trend indicated less aggression was displayed in the presence of the females. This does not support our hypothesis that the presence of a female in the tank would increase male Beta splenden aggressiveness due to their protective and territorial nature. It could be the case that the males placed more of their energy into courting the females as a potential mate instead of focusing on the other male. It is also possible that the results would have been different (and more significant) if only one male take contained a female audience (instead of both). This could potentially cause increased aggression and competition for the female mate. Previous studies have actually found similar results to ours; that the presence of a female audience decreased the frequency of agonistic behavior of males. It was suggested that this was due to differing costs and benefits in the presence of females; one example being that females might not mate with a male that shows too much aggression due to the risk of being injured during courting [Matos, et. al., 2002]. Another study suggested there are different types of behavior that should be categorized while observing these interactions; aggressive displays toward males and conspicuous communication behaviors toward both males and females (performed to attract the other’s attention). This study found that, though there was decreased aggression toward other males in the presence of a female, there was increased intensity in their conspicuous communication displays [Doutrelant, et. al., 2001]. Further studies could explore the findings of Dzieweczynski et. al., which indicated an interaction between the audience effect and territorial status of the male’s nest. This study suggests that it is not useful to explore the consequences of the audience effect of B. splendens without also taking into account the context of the situation [Dzieweczynski et. al., 2005]. Though our study did not produce significant results, it is important to consider the factors that impact animal behaviors in order to be able to understand evolutionary context and reproductive fitness.
