Title: Increased Chloroplast Activity at Cold to Moderate Temperatures in Spinacia oleracea 

Abstract:
In order to better understand how different temperatures impact chloroplast activity in Spinacia oleracea, we recorded the absorbances of samples containing chloroplasts and DCIP over a thirty minute period. We hypothesize that there will be a statistically significant difference in chloroplast activity between the samples exposed to room temperature and the samples exposed to other temperatures, with the samples exposed to room temperature water showing more chloroplast activity. In order to test this we collected enriched chloroplasts samples from spinach leaves, divided them into four groups of three, and exposed each groups to a different temperature over a thirty minute period. Using the average recorded absorbances, we calculated a percent change in chloroplasts activity for each group. We used a one way ANOVA test to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in chloroplast activity between any of the temperature groups. We got a p value of .398, which meant that our results were not statistically significant.  Despite this, we observed a trend of increased chloroplast activity at room temperature in comparison to at other temperatures. This trend occurred because exposure to temperatures outside of the crop’s ideal range alter the chloroplast structure.

Introduction:
All living organisms must produce energy in order to survive. In plants this form of energy is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is produced in the organism’s chloroplasts and mitochondria. During the daytime ATP is synthesized in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts, where electrons in an antenna complex are excited by ultraviolet rays from the sun. This energy is passed around the antenna complex until it reaches the special pair, which holds its electrons at a lower energy level than the other electrons in the antenna complex. This effectively traps the energy in the reaction center. The excited electrons are then passed on to an electron carrier. In photosystem II, Q accepts the electrons and passes them on to the cytochrome b6f complex, which pumps protons into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase uses the electrical chemical gradient produced by the pumping of protons into the thylakoid space to bring protons back across the thylakoid membrane and synthesize ATP. In photosystem I ferredoxin accepts the electrons and passes them on to FNR. FNR then uses these electrons to synthesize NADPH. The electrons in photosystem II are replenished by water, which causes them to give off oxygen as a waste product. The photosystem I electrons are replenished by those from photosystem II. It is possible to measure the overall activity of chloroplasts. Specifically, one can measure the activity of photosystem II using the hill reaction. In this reaction an alternate electron acceptor receives the electrons from the photosystem. One example of an alternative electron acceptor is DCIP, which transforms from dark blue to colorless as it is reduced. Therefore, one can measure photosystem II activity by measuring the absorbance when DCIP is used an electron acceptor. Chloroplasts activity is known to be affected by various external factors. In his study on factors that affect chloroplasts activity in cotton plants, Kenneth Fry identified light intensity, light duration, pH buffer presence, and temperature as external factors that can have an effect on chloroplast activity [Fry: 1970]. One can observe how these specific factors influence chloroplast activity by using the hill reaction. It is important to understand how external factors such as temperature affect chloroplast activity, because optimal conditions must be utilized in order to maximize crop production in the agriculture industry. In order to better understand how different temperatures impact chloroplast activity in Spinacia oleracea, we decided to record the absorbances of samples containing chloroplasts and DCIP over a thirty minute period. We seperated twelve spinach chloroplast samples into four groups of three and exposed each group to a different temperature level. The four temperature levels that we used were 0°C, room temperature (23°C), 40°C, and 55°C. We hypothesize that there will be a statistically significant difference in chloroplast activity between the samples exposed to room temperature water and those exposed to 0°C, 40°C, and 55°C, with the samples exposed to room temperature water showing more chloroplast activity. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to test how differing temperatures affect chloroplast activity in spinach leaves we first collected enriched chloroplast samples. In order to do this we removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves and washed them with cold water. We then added the leaves and 10 ml of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer (grinding buffer) to a mortar and pestle and grinded the spinach until it became a thick paste. Following this, we added an additional 10 ml of grinding buffer to the paste and strained it through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Next, we transferred the liquid to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun it in a centrifuge at 200 x G  for 3 minutes at 4°C. After, we poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. We then centrifuged the 50 ml tube “B” at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4°C. Next, we poured the supernatant, into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C”. Finally, we add 20 ml of grinding buffer to the pellet at the bottom of tube “B” and suspend it in solution. In a previous experiment we determined that “sample of pellet B” contains the enriched chloroplasts because it had the highest chloroplast to debree ratio. As a result, the chloroplasts from “sample of pellet B” are what we used in our samples for our chloroplast activity assay. We started the chloroplast activity assay by numbering 13 test tubes “blank” and “1-12”. We added 8 mL of water, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts to the “blank tube”. In tubes 1-12 we added 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts. Next, we mixed each tube and added their contents to individual cuvettes. Following this, we used the blank tube to blank the spectrophotometer. We then recorded the absorbance of each sample. These absorbance values served as our baseline measurements (0 minutes). We then place samples 1-3 in ice water (0°C), samples 4-6 in room temperature water (23°C), samples 7-9 in 40°C water, and samples 10-12 in 55°C water. We recorded the absorbance of each sample every ten minutes for a duration or thirty minutes. We then calculated the percent change for every absorbance measurement using the formula % change = ((absorbance at time zero - absorbance at time N) / absorbance at time 0) x 100. Following this, we plotted the change in absorbance against time for each temperature group. Finally, we used a one way ANOVA test to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in chloroplast activity between any of the temperature groups.


Results:
Our one way ANOVA test gave us a p value of .398 with a degrees of freedom value of 35. As a result, we were not able to reject the null hypothesis. Based off of the one way ANOVA test we can not conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in chloroplast activity between the various temperature groups. Despite this, we did observe a trend in chloroplast activity between the different temperature groups. Samples 10-12, which were exposed to 55°C water, showed almost no chloroplast activity throughout the assay. The average percent change for this group after 30 minutes was -7.5%, indicating very little activity. A similar trend was observed in the group exposed to 40°C water. Very little chloroplast activity was observed for the group throughout the assay, and the average percent change after 30 minutes was 4.62%. The samples exposed to ice water showed a higher level of chloroplast activity throughout the experiment. The group finished with an average percent change of 50.42%. The samples exposed to room temperature water finished with an average percent change of 283.74%, which was much greater than that of the other groups. Samples 4, 5, and 6 had percent changes of 797.56%, 50.65%, and 3.01%, which shows that there was a large amount of variation in results for the group that was placed in room temperature water. In addition we observed a trend in sample color change throughout the assay. The groups exposed to 40°C and 55°C water remained dark blue the entire time. The group exposed to 0°C water showed some color change, as it turned a changed to a light blue color. The group exposed to room temperature water showed a large amount of color change, for the samples became colorless. While we can not conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in chloroplast activity for the different temperature groups, we clearly observed a trend of increased chloroplast activity at room temperature in comparison to at other temperatures. There was the second most activity at 0°C. 40°C and 55°C showed far less chloroplast activity than the other groups.


Discussion:
Based on the results of our one way ANOVA test, we can not conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the chloroplast activity levels in Spinacia oleracea at varying temperatures. Despite our results not being statistically significant, we did observe a trend that different temperatures do in fact affect chloroplast activity in spinach leaves differently. Once again, we observed far more color change and a much larger average percent change in chloroplast activity at room temperature than at other temperatures. This is because different temperatures have different effects on chloroplasts. According to a similar study conducted on barley chloroplasts, temperatures that are either too high or too low for the crop cause the inhibition of biogenesis [Smille: 1978]. In addition, temperatures that are not optimal for the crop resulted in chloroplasts with abnormal properties and structure. These changes in structure included the formation of abnormally large grana and disoriented lamellar systems [Smille: 1978]. The results from this study make it apparent that abnormal temperatures can denature chloroplasts and render them inactive. We observed a very small amount of chloroplast activity at 40°C and 55°C because the high temperatures caused the chloroplast to cook. The heat denatured the chloroplasts and rendered them unable to properly produce ATP. We observed a slightly lower level of chloroplast activity at 55°C than we did at 40°C, because the increased temperature should have cooked a higher percentage of the chloroplasts. Moreover, it makes sense that the chloroplast activity at 0°C was greater than at 40°C and 55°C, but still less than at room temperature. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, spinach is best suited to grow at a temperature range of roughly 45-75°F [Sinkel: 2014], or roughly 8-24°C. We observed the trend of the highest chloroplast activity at room temperature followed by 0°C, because the chloroplasts that are found in spinach leaves are best suited to produce ATP at moderate to cold temperatures. We also observed the most color change in the samples exposed to room temperature water, which indicates that more of the DCIP was reduced in the samples at room temperature than in the other samples. DCIP serves as an alternative electron acceptor that is reduced when it accepts electrons from photosystem II. When DCIP is reduced it changes from a dark blue color to colorless. Since the room temperature samples were essentially colorless, we can conclude that there was a higher degree of chloroplast activity at room temperature than in other samples. We observed a light blue color in the 0°C samples, which indicates that the second most chloroplast activity happened in these samples. The 40°C and 55°C samples remained dark blue, which indicates that a very low percentage of the DCIP was reduced. The trend we observed is further supported by a study conducted by Siddhartha Dutta, which examined the role of temperature stress on chloroplast activity in peas. According to the study, heat and chill stressed plants exhibited decreased gene expression of certain components of the TOC, TIC, and stromal Hsp93 complexes, which led to impaired binding, reduced protein import, and downregulation of photosynthesis in chloroplasts [Dutta: 2009]. Moreover, temperature stressed chloroplasts exhibited change in their structure, which in turn affected their activity level. The next logical step for this experiment would be to increase the sample size. It is possible that we did not obtain statistically significant results due to our sample size. We only had three sample in each of the four temperature groups, which resulted in a high degree of variation within each group. Increasing the sample size would greatly reduce the variation that was present within each temperature group and give us more accurate results. Another logical step to take with this experiment would be to test how different external factors impact spinach chloroplast activity. These factors could include the color or intensity of light that the chloroplasts receive. An additional logical step that could be taken with this experiment would be to test how different temperatures impact chloroplast activity in plants other than spinach. It is important to understand the results from this experiment because external factors such as temperature can have a large impact on crop yield. Every crop has optimal conditions for it to grow, so understanding how external factors impact the chloroplast activity of these plants could help agriculture workers produce a higher yield of crop and ultimately collect a greater income. In addition, it could help the agriculture industry grow in size and find more success.
