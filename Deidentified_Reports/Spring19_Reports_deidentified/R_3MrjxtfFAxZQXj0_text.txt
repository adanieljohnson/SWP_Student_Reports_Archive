Title: Presence of an Object Does Not Increase Aggression in Betta splendens 

Abstract:
All species have unique intraspecific behaviors, critical for sexual selection and reproduction. In male Betta splendens, there is a pattern of aggression as the male-male encounter increases in duration, beginning with pelvic tail flickering and tail beating and then escalating to displaying a “red mane” with the branchiostegal membrane. These behaviors are attempts to scare the other male betta away before pursuing direct physical contact, usually motivated by a territory invasion or mate selection. It was hypothesized that the presence of an object near one male betta would create a “territory”, and to protect his “territory”, that male betta would become more aggressive. In this experiment, the effect of territoriality on aggression was tested by observing behavior of 4 different male betta fish in response to another male betta with and without a rock. Specifically, the behaviors observed were tail beats, red mane, and all facing movements, representing different levels of aggression. The data collected did not show a significant difference between with and without a rock for any of the three behaviors. This suggests that either territoriality does not impact aggressiveness of betta behavior or that the rock was not an appropriate stimulus to invoke territorial response.

Introduction:
Intraspecific behaviors are studied frequently by ethologists in an attempt to discover evolutionary significance for behaviors among individuals of a species, especially those that relate to dominance, survival, sexual selection, and mating. This type of behavior can also include agonistic (or aggressive) behaviors. Most species use aggression as their last line of defense and are therefore equipped with a variety of tactics to frighten other individuals. This is due to the high energy costs of exhibiting aggressive behavior - if a scaring technique can evoke the same response from an attacker as an aggressive display, an animal is more likely to attempt behaviors with lower energy requirements before escalating to the use of an aggressive display that could potentially waste energy for the individual. On the other hand, it may be beneficial for organisms to escalate directly to aggression to ensure that their opponent interprets the signal correctly and/or that they are prepared to fight quickly in response to their opponent.
Betta splendens (commonly known as the betta fish) is known for its exceptionally unique intraspecific behaviors, including aggression. Most typically, interactions between two male betta fish can escalate to a point where one male will kill the other one. During these interactions, before the point of direct confrontation, the betta fish display behaviors in increasing aggression from two different groups of behaviors, broadside and facing movements, using four different fins, opercula, and branchiostegal membrane [Johnson: 2018]. With direct confrontation and physical contact, betta fish can initiate more aggressive behaviors, including raising the dorsal fin and nipping each other. Studies have shown that the intensity of a male betta’s attack increases as the distance between the two fish decreases, meaning that in close quarters, male bettas are more provoked to attack [Bronstein: 1983]. This makes it likely that the betta fish will exhibit aggressive behaviors in the small controlled environments. Research has also demonstrated that betta fish with longer contact with a provoking stimulus (another betta fish or a mirror image) will display more aggressive behaviors for a longer period, because as time increases, the two bettas have committed to a fight instead of simply evaluating each other and determining their next move [Bronstein: 1983]. This also suggests that the five-minute time frame selected for testing should allow the male bettas to move past evaluation and into full display of aggression.
Betta fish are also known to establish and aggressively defend territories against other male bettas because it is critical to their reproductive success to ensure that their territories are safe [Jaroensutasinee: 2003]. Male bettas are responsible for guarding their bubble nests that hold the newly fertilized eggs and warding off any animal, betta fish or not, that poses a threat to the eggs. By using a rock to simulate a territory to guard, betta fish behavior is expected to mimic its territorial behavior with regards to a bubble nest. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the male betta fish in the side of the tank that receives the rock will exhibit aggressive behaviors more frequently in the presence of the rock than without the rock.


Materials and Methods:
A total of eight male Betta splendens were tested in pairs twice, with and without a rock present in one half of a tank divided by a glass and plastic panel. One male betta was placed in either end of the tank with both panels in place. The plastic panel was removed but the glass panel was left in place, allowing the fish to see each other and exhibit aggressive behavior while preventing physical contact between the two betta fish. One betta fish was observed for five minutes; the number of tail beats exhibited, the duration that a red mane was exhibited, and the duration of facing movements at the glass (with mouth to the glass) were all recorded. The plastic panel was replaced, and the same two betta fish rested and recovered for five minutes. After the rest period, the fish that was observed previously received a rock and could acclimate to the rock for two minutes. After acclimation, the plastic panel was removed again, and the same fish was observed for another five minutes, keeping notes of the same three behaviors. This process was repeated three additional times, each time with a new pair of betta fish. For the last two pairs of fish, the first trial included the rock and the second trials had the rock removed. This change in trial order allowed for randomization to reduce the effects of fatigue, a confounding variable that could have been present during all second trials. The differences in the three aggressive behaviors with and without the presence of the rock were analyzed using a paired t-test; the differences were determined significant if the p-value was less than 0.05.

Results:
There was no distinguishable pattern in the duration of facing movements at the glass panel and in the number of tail beats for each observed betta fish between with and without a rock (Fig.1 and Fig.3). However, in three of the four observed betta fish, the duration of red mane did decrease in the presence of a rock (Fig.2). The mean number of tail beats for the betta fish without the rock was 23.5 ± 18.947 beats, while that of the betta fish in the presence of the rock was 16.5 ± 23.951 beats (Fig.1). The mean duration that the betta fish without a rock displayed a red mane was 92.75 ± 85.822 seconds, while that of the betta fish in the presence of the rock was 64.625 ± 62.891 seconds (Fig.2). The mean duration that the betta fish not in the presence of the rock exhibited facing movements at the glass panel was 109 ± 72.622 seconds, while that of the betta fish in the presence of the rock was 80.5 ± 67.53 seconds (Fig.3). The difference in the number of tail beats was determined to be insignificant (p-value = 0.565, df = 3, t-stat = 0.6439). In addition, the difference in the duration of red mane (p-value = 0.1716, df = 3, t-stat = 1.7889) and the difference in the duration of facing movements (p-value = 0.4484, df = 3, t-stat = 0.8699) were both also determined to be insignificant.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that aggression would increase in the presence of an object to encourage territoriality was not supported by the data collected. Despite the insignificance of the difference between the mean duration of red mane present with and without the rock, the general trend in data collected for the duration of a red mane display suggests that in the presence of an object like a rock, aggression decreases. This trend may have occurred because the betta fish being observed had a hiding place accessible, and therefore in the presence of the male, it did not feel that it needed to expend energy to scare the other male away. Two out of four of the observed betta fish swam into the rock during the trail, ending the confrontation between the two males. Other studies have concluded that the presence of objects (like plants) can decrease aggression due to the interruption of visual contact [Bronstein: 1983]. This could be extrapolated to explain why aggressive behaviors were less frequent in the presence of a rock, because the rock could have prevented and/or delayed the initial contact between the two betta fish. In three out of four trials, the fish with the rock did not initiate behaviors as quickly as it did without the rock, but further testing would be required to prove that the rock was the reason for the delay in interaction.
In addition, it is probable that the rock was not an appropriate object to stimulate territoriality in betta fish. Other research on male betta fish aggression in relation to the audience effect and its reproductive importance shows that some human-designated bubble nests do not allow the betta fish to become attached in the same way that they would do a bubble nest that the male bettas themselves constructed [Bronstein: 1980]. This would mean that the betta fish were not acting out of aggression in the presence of the rock to protect it, because it held no value to them. 
It is also possible that the random selection of pairs of betta fish did not account for the placement of two submissive males together. The last pair of betta fish tested did not exhibit any signs of aggression, and studies have shown that the betta fish stimulate each other to show aggression [Bronstein: 1983]. Without a dominant or more aggressive male betta fish, like in our fourth pair of betta fish, there would have been minimal confrontation initiated, as the bettas are able to assess each other. If neither fish sees a threat in the other, the confrontation would not escalate to another stage of increased aggression or physical contact [Bronstein: 1983]. However, when the data collected from the fourth pair was disregarded, the difference in behavior between the betta with and without the rock was still insignificant.
On the other hand, through slight observation, it appeared that the fish not receiving the rock became more aggressive when the other fish had a rock. This observation is supported by studies on the interplay of nest-building and the presence of an audience and its impact on betta fish aggression. These studies found that when only one male out of a pair had a bubble nest, the pair’s interaction was more aggressive than if both males had a bubble nest [Dzieweczynski: 2005]. Other related experiments showed that male betta fish aggression was highest against male intruders to their territory and increases as their offspring aged [Jaroensutasinee: 2003]. 
Further study could be conducted to determine if the presence of shelter decreases the length of the interaction or increases the time before initial contact, as these two measurements were impossible because of the use of the glass panel between the two betta fish. The impact of a shelter near the surface of the water could also be studied, since a shelter of this nature would allow for access to oxygen while hiding. Conclusions made based on studying Betta splendens could be used to help explain territory defense and the determination of dominance in other species where male-male combat is crucial for reproduction and where parental care ensures offspring survival.
