Title: Effects of Lidocaine on Sciatic Nerve

Abstract:
The motor neuron, the sciatic nerve of the lower leg communicates with the gastrocnemius, or calf muscle through neuromuscular junctions as every other motor neuron connects with its respective muscle fiber in the body. Stimulation of this nerve would cause a contraction of the gastrocnemius due to an action potential stimulating voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels which causes a cascading effect that eventually ends in muscle contraction. In this experiment we used frog legs that we dissected in order to make direct contact with the sciatic nerve. We then stimulated the nerve using an electrically stimulating apparatus before and after we bathed the nerve in lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, solution. There was a significant difference in the voltage of the action potential between the groups not treated with lidocaine and those that had been treated showing a p-value of .04286.NOT COUNTED.

Introduction:
At neuromuscular junctions, a motor neuron makes numerous connections with a muscle fiber. Once an action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, or ACh is released into the motor end plate and attaches to sodium (Na+) voltage-gated channels, allowing an influx of sodium to flow into the muscle cells. [Johnson:2018] This then leads to the action potential firing into the T-tubules in the muscle fiber, which contains a DHP receptor. Upon the action potential reaching the DHP receptor, a ryanodine receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum is triggered which allows an influx of calcium (Ca2+) which, in turn allows the muscle to contract by allowing the muscle filaments actin and myosin to bind. [Johnson:2018] This may prompt one to wonder what would happen if one of these mechanisms for muscle contraction was inhibited. If the DHP or ryanodine receptor was inhibited the animal could suffer from malignant hypothermia caused by dysfunctional Ca2+ homeostasis. [Andronache, et al.: 2009] For another example of how a neuromuscular junction can be altered, I will explain the junction that was used in this experiment, the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius (calf muscle). If the sciatic nerve was treated with lidocaine, which is a Na+ channel blocker, it is possible that the action potential would not reach the motor end plate, nor the axon terminal, if used in a high enough concentration, therefore inhibiting contraction. In fact, lidocaine reduces the amplitude of recovery during long depolarizations. [Gawali, et al.: 2015] Therefore, we hypothesize that the usage of lidocaine on the sciatic nerve will lessen the strength of the muscle contraction when stimulated. For this experiment, using frog legs—which are sensible due to their size and ability to manipulate (pull back skin in order to expose nerve and muscle)—we will measure the stimulation of the muscle (dependent variable) by using a shocking apparatus that will send different electrical voltages through the leg and we will compare these measurements with and without lidocaine (independent variable). 

Materials and Methods:
We used three frog legs to run our experiment, each one served as its own individual trial. Before running any tests, we had to dissect the leg so as to properly expose the nerve and muscle. We kept the frog legs wet by squirting Ringer’s (.6g in 100mL) solution on them every couple of minutes in order to ensure they would be as receptive to the action potential as possible during the control run. We used the same voltage for each trial and recorded the results for both the pre-lidocaine runs and the post-lidocaine runs. For the post-lidocaine trials, we injected the nerve with about two to three drops of a 25mM solution of lidocaine using a syringe before attaching the stimulating apparatus and sending volts through the nerve. Since each leg was its own run, a statistical paired t-test was used to better evaluate a difference in a before and after experiment. 

Results:
The mean of the pre-lidocaine group, .866 mV was significantly greater than the mean of the post-lidocaine group, .485 mV (t-stat=4.673, df=2, p-value=0.04286). The p-value of .04286 when using an alpha value of &lt;.05 justifies that there was a statistically significantly difference between the two groups. (Figure 1.)

Discussion:
A statistically significant difference was observed in the voltage before and after the sciatic nerve of a frog leg was treated with lidocaine; therefore, it can be resolved that the lidocaine did in fact inhibit some of the sodium channels, reducing the severity of the muscle contraction. This in turn means that the alternative hypothesis was accepted, and the null hypothesis was rejected. Although the p-value was under .05, it was very close to that alpha value. This could bring to question what would happen if different blockers such as those that could be used to inhibit the actions of the DHP receptor, the ryanodine receptor, or Ca2+ channels altogether. For example, if a ryanodine receptor, which is the primary mechanism for Ca2+ release into the sarcoplasmic reticulum was inhibited would it have a greater effect than if a Na+ channel blocker was used. It is known that inhibition of Ca2+ channels also causes for a lesser muscle contraction, but still it brings to question if it would be more effective as a local anesthetic than a Na+ blocker.
