Title: Effects of 20E IGR Blocker on the Development of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to measure the effects of the 20E IGR Blocker on the Development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Nine caterpillars were placed into different containers and fed different concentrations of a 20E IGR blocker. These caterpillarsâ€™ weights were recorded. The caterpillars that displayed the most significant growth were those with the full concentration of the 20 E IGR blocker.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar is a type of caterpillar that undergoes regular insect development. The caterpillar begins as an egg and develops into a larva, when it grows its characteristic horn. Next, the caterpillar becomes a pupa and molts after which it becomes an adult moth. These caterpillars were fit for out study because it was easy to see when they went through different stages of development by their physical characteristics. In this experiment, these caterpillars were fed different concentrations of the 20E IGR blocker, a blocker which inhibits full development in caterpillars by blocking the growth regulator. Their weights were recorded every day for seven days in order to monitor their development. Different concentrations of the 20E IGR blocker resulted in different levels and rates of development. A higher concentration of the 20E IGR blocker will result in a lower weight gain throughout the 7 days of measurement.

Materials and Methods:
1.	Separate 9 Manduca sexta caterpillars into 3 groups.
2.	Measure 10g of food for each caterpillar.
3.	For caterpillars 1-3, add nothing to the food samples. For caterpillars 4-6, add a diluted solution of the 20E IGR blocker, 5mL with 5mL of water, to the food sample. For caterpillars 7-9, add a full concentration of the 20E IGR blocker, 10mL, to the food sample.
4.	Place the caterpillars each in their own plastic containers with their respective food. Be sure to mash up the food, then smash it back together for ideal eating conditions. Punch a hole in each of the containers for ventilation.  
5.	Every day for 7 days, measure and record the weight of the caterpillars. 


Results:
All of the Manduca sexta caterpillars grew, but varied at the degrees in which they grew. The control caterpillars had the highest resulting growth and the caterpillars that were fed the full solution had the lowest resulting growth. From our data, we used the ANOVA statistical test to make sure that our data was significant with the P-value being 0.00000246. 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis because the caterpillars that were fed the diluted concentration of the 20E IGR blocker had a more significant weight gain that those that were not fed any of the 20E IGR blocker. The caterpillars that were fed a diluted amount of the 20E IGR blocker had a weight gain that was in between the control group and the group that was fed the full solution. The caterpillars with the full concentration of the 20E IGR blocker grew more than the other groups because the blocker blocked the growth regulator hormone in the caterpillars, so growth was not regulated and development was not restricted.
