Title: Effects of IGRs on JH levels and pupation in Manduca sexta larvae

Abstract:
Globally, farmers work to plant, grow, and harvest crops to produce food and an income. Pest insects, however, have their own agenda. These pests, such as the Manduca sexta found throughout America, begin as larvae that eat away at crops in order to grow several times their size before undergoing metamorphosis. The most popular solution to pests such as these is employing the use of pesticides, which have been proven to subsequently pose numerous negative effects to the environment. One alternative to pesticides may be the use of IGRs to change insects’ hormone levels and prevent them from reaching adulthood and reproducing. The belief was that Manduca larvae treated with IGRs would fail to pupate due to high levels of JH. Despite believing that a correlation existed between weight and ability to pupate, our data showed no significent difference in the average weight change between the two groups. This could suggest that either weight is not associated with levels of JH or that not enough IGR was added to the experimental group’s diet. Though research has shown that IGRs impact pest insects’ ability to pupate by altering their JH levels, our study revealed that weight change is an independent variable and pest larvae exposed to IGRs may still consume an equivalent diet of crops.

Introduction:
In the experimental study, the knowledge that hormones play a role in the developmental stages of insect’s life cycle is investigated. Hormones, in both insects and humans, are chemical signals in the body that communicate with cells to initiate responses. Insects finish growing before undergoing metamorphosis, which is associated with molting their exoskeletons. This process that causes a change in weight and appearance is arranged by two hormones, ecdysone and JH [Riddiford: 2012]. The focus of this experiment is on the latter of the two hormones involved. The experimental investigation is strictly concerned with the life cycle of the Manduca sexta species of moth, specifically in the pupation period. The objective of the study is to understand the effects of insect growth regulators, IGRs, which was Precor in this procedure, on the Manduca’s JH production. This will be analyzed by observing changes in weight throughout the two weeks between the larvae’s 5th instar phase and pupation. The data recorded for weights of an experimental group, which had a diet supplemented with IGRs, and of a controll group, which was on a regular diet, ultimately established a comparable basis for the further analysis of subsequent experimental effects regarding JH. The study is based on biological evidence that suggests larvae rely on a precise change in JH levels, called a commitment pulse, to properly enter the pupa stage. During the 5th instar stage, there is a faint "commitment pulse" of ecdysteroids in the lack of juvenile hormone prevalence, thus altering tissues for pupal development such as in epidermal cells that secrete the cuticular exoskeleton, which results in larval-specific genes becoming inactivated [Weeks: 1990]. If Precor IGR is introduced into the diet of the experimental group, then their commitment pulse will be overactive due to an increase level of JH production, which will be observed through a difference in weight change patterns, and they will not pupate as a result.

Materials and Method:
The study began with 8 Manduca sexta caterpillar larvae in their 5th instar stage. These larvae, which were assumed to all be healthy, were split into 2 groups of 4 larvae each. One of these groups was experimental with each of the 4 larvae receiving a regular diet supplemented by 3 drops of Precor IGR. The other group was the controll with each of the 4 larvae receiving a regular diet and 3 drops of water instead of the IGR. Each caterpillar was placed in its own incubation chamber in either the controll container or experimental container with their respective diet and were weighed daily for 2 weeks. Pictures were taken daily as well in order to compare color and other physical changes such as pupation. Their food was maintained in a moist state to ensure normal consumption and was constantly replenished in the form of a 10 g ball. When the larvae were not being weighed, they were kept in their containers inside of a refrigerator set to the recommended temperature of their natural climate. 

Results:
The mean daily change in average weight of larvae in the controll group was 0.648 g and the mean daily change in average weight of larvae in the experimental group was 0.658 g (Fig.1). The standard deviation for weight in the controll larvae was 0.437 and the standard deviation for weight in experimental larvae was 0.207 (Fig.1). We used a two-tailed t_test to interpret the data we collected. The mean weight of the controll group was statistically not significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.04889, d.f. = 6, P = 0.9626). When observing the caterpillars on the final day, there was only slight visible difference. The caterpillars in the controll group seemed to have been further along in the process of pupating than those in the experimental group and caterpillars in the controll group were visibly changing color (Fig. 2). As a result of this experiment, both the controll and experimental larvae had roughly the same average weight (Fig.1). Overall, the controll and the experimental groups had the almost the exact same daily pattern of growth over the period of two weeks.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that IGRs would increase levels of JH and alter the growth rate of Manduca sexta larvae, thus inhibiting pupation, was not supported. We observed no significent difference at the .05 level, which suggests that the use of IGRs as an alternative to harmful pesticides is not successful. It is possible that the IGR had no effect on the JH levels of the larvae, therefore failing to inhibit their ability to transition from larvae to pupae. Additionally, past investigations have found that a drop in JH levels occurs when a specific weight is reached and that is when metamorphosis begins [Davidowitz: 2003]. This insight may potentially suggest that the reason that the weights were nearly the same is because the larvae had just reached critical weight when we ended the experiment, however JH levels may still have been higher in the experimental group despite their weight, which could have prevented their transition to pupae. According to our statistical analysis rather than our physical observations, we can accept the null hypothesis and reject the alternate hypothesis. Ecdysone in the absence of JH leads to loss in the urge to eat [Riddiford: 2012]. Therefore, if the experiment continued for another week, the controll group would be expected to pupate fully, whereas the experimental group might just eat more. Despite biological knowledge, based on previous studies, that IGRs effect JH levels and pupation capacity in insects, the results indicate that these effects are not associated with average daily change in their weight or their appetite for crops.
