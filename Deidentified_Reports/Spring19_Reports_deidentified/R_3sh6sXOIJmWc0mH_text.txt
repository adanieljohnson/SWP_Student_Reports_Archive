Title: The effects of Nitrogen on the Root to Shoot ratio of Fagopryum esculentum

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an important topic in conservation biology. With changing climates it is important to understand how plants will alter their allocation patterns in response to environmental variables. Here we look at the effect of nitrogen on the growth patterns of the root and shoot tissues of Fagopyrum esculentum. The expectation was that the root to shoot length and weight ratios would be much greater in plants grown in a nitrogen rich environment compared to plants grown in more standard soil. Our data showed a significent difference in both the length root to shoot ratio, and the  weight root to shoot ratio. This significance, in conjunction with our observation of more roots per plant grown in nitrogen rich environments, suggests that in response to a more nutrient rich soil, F. esculentum grows more roots in an attempt to harvest more nutrients from the nutrient rich soil. This adaptation shows a beneficial change in resource allocation that allows F. esculentum to best thrive in a changing environment. 

Introduction:
In nature, resources are limited. Water, healthy soil, and even sunlight are fixed quantities for plants. In order to maximize the amount of resources a plant receives, it will allocate energy and metabolic resources among their different parts [Johnson: 2016]. For example, a plant will have a larger root system if there is more water nearby or the soil is richer. The larger roots are needed because this where the plant is getting the majority of its resources. Nitrogen is the biggest influencer of how a plant allocates its resources [Johnson: 2016]. It has been observed to affect the way a plant allocates its resources, especially in its root system [Agren: 2003]. The way a plant responds to its nitrogen availability by changing its root to shoot ratio (R:S ratio). The R:S ratio is defined as “the ratio of the amount of plant tissues that have supportive functions to the amount of those that have growth functions” [Encyclopedia: 2019]. It is calculated by dividing the length of the root by the length of the shoot [Johnson: 2016]. This experiment was designed to observe the relationship between the amount of nitrogen available to the plant, and the R:S ratio. The hypothesis we were testing was to see if the presence of nitrogen in the soil of the plant would increase the R:S ratio for weight and length of the plants by making the plant allocate more of its resources to its roots and less to the stem.

Materials and Method:
Using F. esculentum, we planted seeds into four separate trays containing regular soil. Two of the trays acted as a controll group, and the other two were our experimental group. Each of the two trays for the controll group were watered with 100 Ml of distilled water. The water was measured out in a beaker. This process was repeated everyday for two weeks. For the experimental groups, we repeated the process but the distilled water was substituted for a nitrogen rich solution, and measured out to 100 Ml with a beaker. At the end of two weeks, we uprooted the buckwheat from the soil, washed off the dirt, and picked five samples from each of the four trays. We then took the 10 experimental plants and 10 controll plants and separated the root from the remainder of the plant using scissors. The weight of the roots and the shoots were measured using a scale and recorded. We then measured out the roots in centimeters and repeated the process for the shoots, stopping the measurement where the shoot parted to form leaves. Using the data, we calculated the R:S ratio for each plant and found the mean R:S ratio for the weight and length of the experimental and controllled groups. We then calculated the standard deviation of each mean. A one-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine differences in the mean root:shoot ratios, lengths and weights of the buckwheat grown with the distilled water compared to the buckwheat grown with the nitrogen rich solution.


Results:
The mean R:S ratio for the weight of the controll group was .04 grams, and the mean R:S ratio for the weight of the experimental group was .49 grams (Fig. 1). The standard deviation of the R:S ratio for the controll group’s weight was .048 grams and the standard deviation of the R:S ratio for the weight of the experimental group was .306 grams (Fig. 1). The mean R:S ratio for the length of the controll group was .486 centimeters, and the mean R:S ratio for the length of the experimental group was 1.486 centimeters (Fig. 1). The standard deviation of the R:S ratio for the length of the controll group was .160 centimeters, and the standard deviation of the R:S ratio for the length of the experimental group was .492 (Fig. 1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The results showed that the mean of the R:S ratio for the weight of the controll group was significently different from the mean of the R:S ratio for the weight of the experimental group (T-value = 4.587, d.f. = 18, p_value = .000229). The results also showed that the mean of the R:S ratio for the length of the controll group was significently different from the mean of the R:S ratio for the length of the experimental group (T-value = 6.105, d.f. = 18, p_value = .00001). When the plants were observed on the final day, the controll group had noticeably larger stems and leaves than the experimental group. As a result of the experiment, the length and weight of the two groups were significently different.



Discussion:
The data of the experiment showed that there was a p_value below .05 for both the weight and length of the experimental and controll groups. Based on these results,we can conclude there was a significent difference between the controll and experimental groups. Because our results our significent, we can reject the null hypothesis that the presence of nitrogen has no positive effect on the R:S ratio of F. esculentum. The experimental groups had, on average, a larger R:S ratio. These results are consistent with our initial hypothesis that the exposure of nitrogen would cause the R:S ratio to increase via a larger root system. Past investigation into this relationship has also concluded there to be a positive relationship between the R:S ratio and the amount of nitrogen present [Agren: 2003]. This suggests that plants in nitrogen rich environments tend to be smaller as they are putting much of their resources into their roots instead of the stem and leaves.This information is also consistent with the previously established effects of nitrogen on plant resource allocation [Johnson: 2016].
