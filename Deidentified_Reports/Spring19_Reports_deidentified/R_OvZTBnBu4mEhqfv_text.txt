Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the Tobacco hornworm, is a species of moth that is thought to be a pest while in its larval stages. In this lab, we wanted to know how these larvae would be affected by the introduction of an IGR (Insect Growth Regulator) that acts similarly to juvenile hormone (JH). To find this out, we used 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars and divided them into 2 groups, a control and a treatment group. The treatment group was given Marvin’s IGR and the control group was given water. We tested the effects on the growth of the Manduca sexta over a period of 14 days. To determine the scale of said effects of Marvin’s IGR, we weighed and measured the length of the caterpillars each day. Our hypothesis was that the caterpillars treated with growth hormone would be significantly larger than those not treated with it and found that our results did not support this hypothesis. Repeating this experiment with a larger amount of test subjects given a larger amount of hormone might be beneficial in finding out if the results of our experiment were simply error or the truth.

Introduction:
Hormones are chemicals released and produced by the body to stimulate a response in cells and organs. The Manduca sexta, or Tobacco hornworm, is a relatively common insect. In its larval stage it is a caterpillar, but after pupating they turn into moths. Manduca sexta larvae are widely considered pests, so there have been many studies into how altering hormonal balances in the hornworm can affect the molting of the Manduca sexta. The two main hormones that are responsible for growth and molting in the Manduca sexta are juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In our experiment, we will be testing the effect that juvenile hormone has on Manduca sexta larvae weight and length [Wyatt and Davey: 1996]. Juvenile Hormone(JH) has a variety of effects on insect development and reproduction, one of the most prevalent is that it encourages growth in larvae while inhibiting metamorphosis. We will use Marvin’s IGR, an insect growth regulator that is known for having effects similar to those of JH, in an effort to study the effects of juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesized that when introduced to 3 drops of Juvenile Hormone, Manduca sexta caterpillars will have increased weight and length due to prolonged larval stage and continually heightened JH levels. The increased levels of JH will prevent metamorphosis and keep the larvae from advancing to maturity. 

Materials and Methods:
: To test our hypothesis, we got 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars. We divided them into two groups of 4: one to be the control group, and one to be the treatment group. They were placed into two containers, one for treatment and one for control, and each caterpillar had its own space. We made sure to poke holes in the side of all 8 rearing jars. Then we measured out 80 grams of premade caterpillar food as exactly as we could using an electric scale and divided them into balls of food that were 10 grams each. The treatment caterpillars each received food that had 3 drops of Marvin’s IGR in it, and the control group caterpillars each received food with 3 drops of water in it. Then, we measured the length in millimeters and weight in grams of each caterpillar and left them in an incubator. Each day for 14 days, we measured the length and weight of each caterpillar, and replenished their food using the same procedure we did on the first day as needed. We used a two sample t-test to determine whether the difference in weight and length, a test for each, between the control and treatment groups was statistically significant.


Results:
Our results showed that over the course of 2 weeks, the average weight and length for each day of the control group and the treatment group were fairly similar. The weights for both the control and treatment group increased over the course of 2 weeks[Figure 1], with length increasing as well but at more significant rate, with the lengths of both sets of caterpillars more than doubling by the end of the experiment [Figure 2].  When running a two sample t-test for weight in excel, we found that the mean of the treatment group was no significantly different than that of the control group (t-stat = 0.514, df = 26, P = 0.612). For length, we also found that the difference between our results for the treatment group and the control group was not statistically significant (t-stat = 0.024, df = 26, P = 0.981). 

Discussion:
In both length and weight, our results did not support our hypothesis since there was not a statistically significant difference between treated caterpillars and untreated caterpillars in both length and weight. We had expected that the weight and length of the treatment caterpillars would be significantly greater than that of the control caterpillars since Marvin’s IGR was predicted to act the same as Juvenile Hormone, which would keep the Manduca sexta in their larval stage and eating to prepare for metamorphosis [Wyatt and Davey: 1996]. However, the weight, length, and appearance of both our treatment and control caterpillars tended to fluctuate with each day, so throughout the process of the experiment it was difficult to tell what our results would be, since there were no constant differences in trends for the control vs the treatment groups. We suspected that when we first started the experiment, we may have mixed up the control and treatment caterpillars and given them the wrong food, and this could be the reason our results did not turn out as expected. The data is very closely related for the control and treatments groups in weight [Figure 1] and length [Figure 2] with very little distance, if any, between the trend lines of the two different groups on both figures. It would be beneficial to replicate this experiment with a greater number of subjects and increased dose of Martin’s IGR, as this may give us clearer results and allow us to determine a way to control the population of Manduca sexta. Since the larvae are considered pests, this information could be beneficial to many people working in agriculture to rid their crops of the pesky larvae.
