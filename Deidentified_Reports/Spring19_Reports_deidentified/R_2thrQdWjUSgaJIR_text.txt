Title: Effects of Glyphosate on the Photosynthetic Rates in Kale Leaves

Abstract:
RoundUp is one of the most popular brands of Herbicide in the world. It is important to understand what it does to its target and its impact on the environment. The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of the herbicide glyphosate on the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts in kale leaves. In order to do this we isolated the chloroplasts and separated them into distinct groups, based off if they received or did not receive light and glyphosate. We tested the absorbance every 10 minutes for 30 minutes to track the change of activity. The group with the highest activity was the chloroplasts left in light and treated with glyphosate. This goes against our original hypothesis that this group would have decreased activity compared to the chloroplasts in light that were not treated with the herbicide. Further studies could focus on the exact targets of Glyphosate in plants and the process to which it affects photosynthesis.


Introduction:
The focus of this experiment is to determine the effect of the herbicide RoundUp, specifically glyphosate, on photosynthesis in kale leaves.  Glyphosate has been increasingly utilized worldwide in crop production due to the introduction of glyphosate resistant plants [Gomes, et al: 2017] and it is important to study their effects on one of the most important life processes in plants.  Photosynthesis is the number one source of oxygen in the atmosphere that allows plants to synthesize food from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. There are three main parts to photosynthesis two of which are light cycles known as photosystem II and photosystem I. The photosystems convert the energy from light into high energy electrons that travel through the photosystems generating NADPH and creating a proton gradient which ATP synthase uses in order to create ATP  The third cycle, known as the Calvin Cycle, runs in the absence of light and utilizes the NADPH and ATP generated by the photosystems in order to convert carbon dioxide and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate into a molecule that will aid in food synthesis for the plant. In order to calculate the activity of photosystem II we will measure 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), which is an alternative electron acceptor, also known as the Hill reaction mechanism. DCIP is a dark blue color when oxidized and colorless when reduced, and this color reduction allows us to measure the decreasing in light absorption. In past studies, it has been shown that glyphosate decreases photosynthetic rates through inhibiting photochemical efficiency [Mateos, et al: 2009]and therefore it is predicted that the chloroplasts exposed to glyphosate will have a lower average percent change in absorbance, similar to the chloroplasts without light, than the chloroplasts exposed to light.


Materials and Methods:
We placed a mortar and pestle, medium sized beaker, a 50 mL centrifuge tube into crushed ice.  While those were cooling, the central veins from 3 kale leaves were removed and the leaves were rinsed and dried.  Next, we placed the leaves in the mortar and pestle with 10 mL of cold grinding buffer, 400mM sucrose in Tricine budder, pH 8.0, and grinded the leaves until a thick paste formed.  Another 10 mL of grinding buffer was added and once it was slurry we strained the contents through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker.  We transferred the liquid from the beaker into the 50 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2800 rpm and collected the supernatant. Next, we labeled 26 large test tubes and filled them with the following contents…

Once we added the chloroplasts we immediately started to mix the test tubes and transferred the contents to spectrophotometer cuvettes.  We blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nm and measured the initial absorbances of all the samples. After the initial reading, tubes 0-5, and 11-20 were placed under a light and the others were placed in a dark drawer. Every 10 minutes for 30 minutes the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbances off all samples were measured.


Results:
Figure 1 demonstrates that there was no change in the absorbance for the chloroplasts without herbicide that were placed in the dark.  The greatest percent change occurred with the light chloroplasts that were treated with glyphosate. In order to determine the significant differences of the groups we conducted paired t-tests.
Chloroplasts Light vs. Chloroplasts Dark: df-4, t-8.2, p-.001
Chloroplasts Light vs. Chloroplasts Herbicide Light: df-4, t-1.4,p-.225
Chloroplasts Light vs. Chloroplasts Herbicide Dark: df-4, t-.55, p-.61
Chloroplasts Dark vs. Chloroplasts Herbicide Light: df-4, t-5.18, p-.007
Chloroplasts Dark vs. Chloroplasts Herbicide Dark: df-4, t-20.8, p-.00003


Discussion:
According to the p-values above it is clear that the hypothesis was not supported. It was predicted that the chloroplasts left in the dark and the chloroplasts treated with herbicide would be similar in activity levels, however, according to both p-values there is a significant difference between the activities. There was also no significant difference between the activities of the chloroplasts in the light in comparison to the chloroplasts subject to glyphosate. As shown in figure 1 the herbicide chloroplasts in light had higher activity levels than the dark and light normal groups. This outcome could be a result from low levels of glyphosate aiding in photosynthesis through increasing stomata and mesophyll conductance, which increases the efficiency of carbon fixation[Cedergreen: 2009]. For future studies, the experiments should run for longer periods of time and focus on glyphosate inhibition of the EPSPS enzyme which prevents the synthesis of amino acids [Gomes, et al: 2017].  Due to the increase use of glyphosate in the agriculture industry it is also important to study the larger scale effects to the surroundings. Understanding more about how glyphosate interacts with its environment is important in determining the limitations of glyphosate use.
