Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Life Cycle of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Hormone plays an essential role in insectile bodily development and stage transition. Manduca sexta, an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, pupates by going through the molting process, and the level of Juvenile Hormone controls the molting process. We conducted an experiment to testify our hypothesis that if we increase the level of juvenile hormone, the weight of Manduca sexta will remain low. The result of significant p-value demonstrated that the alternative hypothesis was accepted, which implied that JH is related to Manduca sexta’s growth. Future research should include more samples with different JH concentration. By figuring out the effect of Juvenile Hormone on insectile development, we are able to understand insects’ metamorphosis and puberty better and thus reduce the damage of crops caused by pests.

Introduction:
Hormones are special chemical messengers produced in an organism and transported within the body that control most major bodily functions, and some hormones even control the growth of organisms. Manduca sexta is a pest under the Order Lepidoptera that commonly feeds on tomato and tobacco, so it is also known as tobacco hornworm [Haworth: 2017]. It has 8 stages in its entire life cycle from egg to 5 instar larval stages, then become a pupa, and finally an adult [Kingsolver: 2007][Haworth: 2017]. They have three hormones that are indispensable in controlling development and phasic transition for them to pupate: Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). PTTH produced by corpus cardiacum regulates the release of Ecdysterone by prothoracic glands, and different insects have slightly different 20E. Juvenile hormone (JH) was produced in corpus allata, and was found active in the plasma of larvae, pupae, and adults of Manduca sexta [Jesudason: 
1990]. It also differs a little bit in each insect, but most of JHs act in the same way [Kiguchi: 1978].

Molting, also known as shedding, is the process that animals cast off a part of its body. For insects, molting is the process when they secrete a new outer layer and shed the old one, which allows them to change size or morphology. Insectile growth stages are separated by molts, and especially the metamorphosis process between the larval stage to the pupa stage. 20E and JH control the insect’s stages of development by controlling their timing and type of molting. Research done by Venkatesh (1988) demonstrates that there is a peak in the JH level during the last instar stage [Jesudason: 1990]. Therefore, the level of JH is highly related to the growth of insects, and we were experimenting this possible relationship with Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta is a great species in examining the effects of hormones on insectile growth due to its distinguishing features by comparing the markings on the body of larvae and abdomen of the adult [Haworth: 2017]. 

We hypothesized that if we increase the level of juvenile hormone, the weight of Manduca sexta will remain low.


Materials and Methods:
We set two groups of Manduca sextas with 4 caterpillars in each group. All Manduca sextas were cultivated in the same incubator with same moisture, light condition, and temperature. Each of the Manduca sexta received the same 10 grams of food with 8 drops of JH mimic (IGR) being added to the experiment group, and the control group received 8 drops of water instead. Foods were replenished, and feces were cleaned every other day. The weight and condition of each Manduca sexta were recorded every day for 2 weeks. We calculated the total change of the weight of each caterpillar and computed the average change of each group. One-tailed two-sampled t-test was used to compare the mean of weight change of the experiment group and the control group, which showed the growth disparities between two groups. P-value was calculated for the caterpillar’s total weight change.

Results:
The total change of weight of the controlled group ranged from -0.18 grams to 10.83 grams, and 10.11 grams to 15.18 grams for the experimental group (figure 1). The average change in weight of the controlled group is 5.32 grams and 13.135 grams for the experimental group (figure 2). The standard deviation of the total change of weights is 5.51 grams for the control group and 2.70 grams for the experimental group (table 1). The p-value of the total change of weight for the two groups is 0.01, which is significant (table 1). The caterpillar 3 in the control group was not in good condition at the beginning of the experiment, and it was reported as dead on day 9. Therefore, the data collection of caterpillar 3 within the controlled group stopped on day 8. Apart from weighing, we observed that the skin of caterpillar 2 from the control group became transparent, and we were able to see the small impulses traveling through its body.

Discussion:
The significant P-value indicates that the results are not likely to be observed under the null hypothesis, and the alternative hypothesis is more likely to be supported, which is that if we increase the level of juvenile hormone, the weight of Manduca sexta will increase [Tests of Significance: 1998]. We can see that Manduca sexta with JH mimic grows averagely faster compared with those without JH mimic. Previous research done by Hsiao T. and Hsiao C. (1976) with the greater wax moth has observed the decline in JH level during the last larval stage together with the increase in 20E and PTTH (they referred to Molting Hormones in their research paper) level. They suggested that the decline in the JH level allows the release of Molting Hormone to initiate metamorphosis [Hsiao: 1977]. Research done by Weeks and Truman in 1986 reveals that the larval-pupal transformation of Manduca sexta results from an exposure to ecdysteroids in the absence of juvenile hormone (the commitment pulse), followed by a larger exposure to ecdysteroids (the prepupal peak) with a reappearance of juvenile hormone (JH). Therefore, this might explain the reason why we observed small pulses within caterpillar body in the controlled group instead of the experimental group [Weeks: 1986]. However, we are unable to make any causational conclusion between the JH level and the initiation of the molting process from the data we currently got during this experiment. Further research should include more samples with different concentrations of JH mimic and longer experiment time to gather more data on the correlations between insectile growth and JH level. Still, it is fair enough to inform people about the importance of hormones that would bring to organisms. By understanding the effect of Juvenile Hormone on insectile development, we can understand insects’ metamorphosis and puberty better. Thus, we are able to influence the growth of pests in order to reduce the damage pests would bring to food crops.
