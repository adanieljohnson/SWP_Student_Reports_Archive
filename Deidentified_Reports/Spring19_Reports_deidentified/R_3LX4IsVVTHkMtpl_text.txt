Title: The Effect of Insect Growth Regulators On the Weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, a commonly found caterpillar species, have relatively short transitions from caterpillar to moth.  Manduca sexta have multiple hormones that are involved in the process of the life cycle, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone.  In the experiment, a group of caterpillars are treated with insect growth regulator (IGR) to observe the effect of the regulator on development.  It was hypothesized that the IGR treated caterpillars would weigh less because the regulator would slow the life cycle.  3 caterpillars were given food every other day with only water while 3 other caterpillars were given food with a mix of IGR and water.  Every other day, the caterpillars were weighed and given additional food.  After the two weeks of recording masses, it was determined that the IGR treated caterpillars weighed more than the control, with an average weight of 11.973 grams while the control group weighed an average of 9.477 grams.  The P-Value was determined to 0.137, making the results not significant.  Overall, a general trend was the that IGR did not allow for the caterpillars to pupate, as they continued to gain weight throughout the two weeks.  The IGR potentially inhibited the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone levels which would have altered the commitment pulse timing. 


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, was studied over a two-week period to further the knowledge of how environmental factors play a role in affecting the life cycle and development of a larvae to a full-grown moth.  The Manduca sexta is an insect, belonging to the Lepidoptera order and Sphingidae family [Johnson: 2018].  The organism transitions from a caterpillar larva to a pupa and full-grown moth in a relatively short time period depending on the conditions; therefore, the life cycle of the organism is easy to monitor if changes are made to the environment.  Many different hormones are involved in the transition from larva to pupa, such as: Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) [Johnson: 2018].  JH serves to affect the migration and reproduction of insects, but also plays a crucial role in the development of larva [Johnson: 2018].  JH regulates the type of molt that occurs in adult insects while 20E coordinates the timing of molt [Fahrbach: 1997].  Based on the information about insect hormones, we decided to test the affect certain chemical would have on the lifecycle.  One chemical in specific that was used in the experiment was insect growth regulator (IGR), which inhibits the life cycle of insects.  IGR’s are insecticides that prevent reproduction and molting in insects at all stages of the life cycle [Krysan: 1993].  Based on the information about IGR’s, we proposed the question, how will the Manduca sexta caterpillars be affected if they are given IGR supplements in their food?  We then hypothesised that, if IGR was added to caterpillars’ diet, then the caterpillars will weigh less because the high levels of IGR will cause juvenile hormone to be out of the ideal range.  If the juvenile hormone is out range, then there may be abnormal changes with the commitment pulse and transition to a pupa.  The independent variable in the experiment will be the insect growth regulator added to the food while the dependent will be the weight change of the caterpillars.  One group of caterpillars will be given food with no IGR and just water while the other group will be given IGR supplements in the food.  The amount of food given and living conditions will be held constant in order to isolate IGR variable and achieve the most accurate results.  

Materials and Methods:
In order to discover the effect that IGR has on the growth of Manduca sexta, 6 caterpillars were selected and placed in small plastic containers.  3 caterpillars were set to be the control group while the other 3 were the treatment group.  Each individual compartment was given a small airhole.  All 6 caterpillars were weighed using a balance scale to record their initial weight for the experiment.  Then, all 6 caterpillars were given 10 grams of food every other day for 2 weeks.  10 drops of water were added to the control groups food each time it was added.  For the treatment group, 5 drops of water and 5 drops of IGR was added to the food.  Once given food, the caterpillars are stored in a incubator until the next time they were weighed.  For the next 2 weeks, the caterpillars were weighed and fed every 2-3 days, to monitor their progress through the life cycle.  The addition of IGR to the food and the change in weight over two weeks will determine the effect IGR has on juvenile hormone and development.  To record the data, a two sample test was used to compare the control groups average weight change to the treatment groups average weight change.  Furthermore, a t-test strategy was used to determine a P-value for the experiment. 

Results:
For the control group, the average weight change over the two-week period was 9.477 grams (Fig 1).  Conversely, the treatment group had an average weight change of 11.973 grams (Fig 1).  From the data collection, the standard deviation of the control group was calculated to be 0.9993.  The standard deviation for the treatment group was calculated to be 2.100.  Based on the data, the P-Value for the experiment was 0.137.  

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that IGR would make the Manduca sexta caterpillars exhibit less weight change because the IGR would push the juvenile hormone out of the ideal range.  After the experiment was completed, the hypothesis was incorrect as the caterpillars that received IGR in the food actually had a greater overall weight change than the control group.  One potential reason the treatment group had a larger overall weight change is because the insect growth regulator did not allow for JH and 20E to be at the correct level for the commitment pulse [Johnson: 2016].  Therefore, the caterpillars would continue to grow and increase in mass while the control group caterpillars had already started to begin the pupa stage of the life cycle.  Although the main function of IGR is to prevent the molting process, we thought that the IGR would have other effects that would alter the caterpillar’s ability to gain weight and transition to an adult [Krysan: 1993].  Based on the data, a significant difference did not exist; the IGR did not have a significant effect on the growth of the caterpillars.  Throughout the experiment, all of the external conditions were held constant, in order to minimize the error.  However, one area where error could have occurred was the feeding and weighing process.  Our group decided not to feed and weigh the caterpillars every day of the two-week time period.  By not feeding the caterpillars every day, they could potentially not reach their maximum possible weight.  Secondly, if the caterpillars are not weighed each day, it’s possible that we missed the day in which they weighed the most.  If that is the case, then the calculated average weight change could be slightly less than the true value.  Another potential error in the experiment is not having all of the caterpillars start at the exact same weight.  This can cause inaccuracy in the data collection as certain caterpillars could be genetically smaller in weight.  Due to the P-Value, we must accept the null hypothesis that IGR did not have an effect on growth.  In order to come to a firmer conclusion on the effect of IGR, more data must be collected.  There could be multiple different paths for future experiments.  First, the same experiment could be completed over a longer period of time to allow for more development of the caterpillars.  A second experiment could be to add a variety of different amounts of IGR to the food of caterpillars.  In addition to recording the mass, it would also be beneficial to monitor the time it takes for the caterpillars to pupate.  It should also be noted that 1 of the caterpillars in the control group had begun to pupate while the other 2 were beginning to change color.  Interestingly enough, all of the treatment group caterpillars were a consistent turquoise color with no hint of color change.  Using these observations, we must acknowledge that the IGR potentially prevented the caterpillars from reaching the molting process in normal time.  This raises more questions, when do the IGR fed caterpillars reach the molting stage or do, they remain caterpillars until they die?  Overall, there are many other experiments that could allow for further knowledge on the effect of IGR on insect growth.
