Title: Turbid Water Decreases Aggressive Behaviors in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Intraspecific behaviors are vital for an organism’s competition of resources, sexual activity, and territorial defense. The aggressive behaviors can be examined in Betta splendens, primarily through the action of gill flaring, which initiates a dominant display of aggression. There are a variety of conditions that can change the aggressive nature of these fish, the selected condition for our experiment was increased turbidity. We hypothesized that because there would be less visibility in the turbid water, the Bettas would have less gill flaring compared to the clear water.  In our experiment, we observed two male Betta fish in a clear and a turbid water tank. By measuring the amount of time the fish’s gills flared then divided by the total time in the tank, we can calculate a ratio to quantify and compare the varying levels of aggression in both the clear and turbid water. The results concluded that our hypothesis was supported and our paired t-test indicated that there was statistical significance. These results were thought to be due to the lowered visibility in the tank that lead to less aggressive behaviors. Furthermore, it is vital to know these behaviors to understand the significance of this lab in context of environmental change: to prevent the loss of species overtime.

Introduction:
Animal behavior can be used to examine why a certain action has an effect on the organism’s survival and reproduction. In the presence of members of the same species, intraspecific behaviors are the specific actions displayed. These behaviors allow observers to look at the resources that are being competed for and the methods of acquiring that resource that is specific to the species. Territorial animals especially exhibit these behaviors as they all frequently compete for mates, food, and defend their territory [Peeke: 1970]. Specifically, this experiment focuses on the intraspecific behaviors of male Betta splendens, or Siamese fighting fish. These animals exhibit aggressive, or agonistic, behaviors in the presence of other male Bettas. 
These animals are a good example for examination of intraspecific behaviors largely because their frequent territorial nature makes observing the behaviors rather easy. Male-male aggressive behaviors are especially present during reproduction times as the male must construct a bubble nest and defend it from other male Bettas [Forsatkar: 2017]. These animal’s natural habitats include ditches, streams, and rice paddies in Southeast Asia where they have access to food, mates and large territory that can be undisturbed by other males [Johnson: 1973]. The specific behaviors that determine whether or not aggression is displayed largely involve the flaring of the gills, proving to be the dominant initial display of aggression [Johnson: 1973]. This response triggers a Betta to warn off other males as they try and look as large as possible to appear dominant and hostile. This process is costly on energy as they frequently must expend energy to fight off other males. However, by warding off other male competition, these fish have more access to mates and food. From this knowledge, it can be seen that the amount of gill flaring can be directly correlated to the aggression seen, as it is the primary action displayed for territorial aggression. It can be seen that these agonistic actions can vary in different environments.
 A separate study looks into differing water conditions in comparison to a normal water environment. The experimental group had electrical impulses in the water that moved the current rapidly to simulate fast flowing water. The results of this experiment concluded that the Bettas in the rapid moving water were less aggressive in response to another male present. This was thought to be because of this change in water environment that contributed to less of a territorial response [Hurtado-Parrado: 2019]. A change in water environmental conditions makes it more difficult for these fish to prioritize their territorial nature to adapt to this changing water movement. This movement of water also makes it more challenging for these male fish to recognize each other, which would cause an aggressive response [Johnson: 1973]. The recognition of another Betta male is the stimulus that causes the two fish to fight and any disruptions in this initial process has been shown to reduce the likelihood that there will be an observable aggressive behavior. 
Our experiment aims to measure a similar method as we are also changing the water conditions. However, rather than rapid moving water, we are looking at the turbidity of the water and how it would affect the aggression of two Betta males when compared to those placed in clear water. We hypothesize that the males in the turbid environment will have a lower time gill flaring:time in tank ratio in response to other males when compared to those in the clear water. 


Materials and Methods:
Six male Betta splendens were obtained. The males were divided into three groups of two each put into three tanks with dividers to separate them (two fish per tank). Two observers watched one fish while the other two watched the other fish. The first group of fish was observed in clear water first. The barrier was removed and the total time of gill flaring was measured for both fish until they touched one another. Once they touched, the barrier was put back and the timer was stopped. The total time allotted for these fish to be in the same tank was five minutes. After the Bettas were separated, they were given five minutes of rest before eight drops of green food coloring were added to simulate a turbid environment. The barrier was then again removed and the fish were observed and the time of gill flaring was again recorded. This was repeated two more times, the order of clear water to turbid water was randomized by the flipping of a coin, to ensure that the environment was the factor that influenced their behavior, not just the fish themselves. To quantify the aggressive behavior of these fish, the time gill flaring was divided by their specific time in the tank before they touched. This ratio allowed for us to measure their aggressive tendencies across each group, to account for fish that were in the tank longer versus the shorter times. The average time gill flared:time in tank ratio was calculated for both the turbid environment and the clear water. After the data was collected and analyzed a paired t-test was run to determine statistical significance with a critical value of 0.05. 





Results:
After the data was collected it was seen that the Betta males in the clear environment had an average gill flaring:time in the tank ratio of 0.402 +/- 0.168 while the fish in the turbid environment had an average of 0.225 +/- 0.194. A paired t-test was run to determine statistical significance (p=0.017, t=3.51, df=5). Our experiment was determined to be statistically significant when compared to the control group as our p value was less than the critical value of 0.05. 



Discussion:
After analyzing the results, it was shown that our hypothesis was supported. That is, the average time gill flaring:time in tank ratio for the clear water was larger than the turbid water ratio. Our logic behind why this happened was supported through our evidence in the results and can be extended to further areas of study. 
As previously mentioned, these fish typically are found in areas of slight to mid turbidity: rice paddies, ditches, and streams [Johnson: 1973]. After this experiment was concluded, it makes sense as to why Bettas would live in such environments. This is because these fish are able to display less aggressive behaviors when in contact with other males, due to the reduced recognition of each other. When Betta fish in clear environments display their gill flaring, it was directly matched with the other male Betta gill flaring that initiates conflict. In the turbid environment, there was a delayed response of gill flaring because of the murky water. Without a quick initiation of gill flaring, either male Betta does not feel threatened and doesn’t need to display an aggressive behavior [Alton: 2013]. The less visibility in the water, the less recognition of other male Bettas and the less matching of these behaviors. Thus, more energy can be conserved for searching for food or reproducing. By not initiating gill flaring frequently, it also contributes to an advantage for the fish through not taking damage from another male Betta in a quarrel. By living in naturally turbid environments, the Bettas are able to allocate their energy for other necessary components of life and also minimize the risk of losing a fight to another male: both being beneficial to the fish in the short and long term. 
There are further areas of study that could have factored into our results. The next rational step to take would be to look at the implications that the size, age, or color of these Bettas would have on their behavior [Alton:2013]. These were not taken into account when conducting our experiment, however, could have contributed to our results. To better our experiment, the procedure would have been changed to match up the same size, color and age of the fish so that it was even for both of them. By holding more variables constant, it makes for clearer conclusions of our results because we could know that the turbidity of the water was the only factor that would affect aggression in these fish. 
Furthermore, this experiment can be observed in other types of aggressive fish, as seen in a separate study that looked at the aggressive behaviors of Longear Sunfish. In this study, a similar experiment was conducted to ours, as turbidity of the water was a variable that was experimented on [Hadley: 1969]. It was proven that the lowest turbidity water contributed to the highest mortality rate of these sunfish when placed in the same tank with each other []. Drawing from this study, it can be seen that the same principles of aggressive intraspecific behavior can apply to a variety of fish, as the lower turbidity water enables more recognition of threats and more displays of territorial aggression. 
	Finally, this experiment can be applied to the effects of environmental change. As the environment changes, so should the behaviors of these fish. It is important to monitor these intraspecific behaviors to get a better understanding of how they interact in order to maximize their survival and reproductive success. This can also be used to predict how these fish might react in different environments that are likely to change overtime. It can be seen here that the turbid water conditions promoted less aggressive behavior in Bettas that would allow them to conserve energy. However, it would be vital to know and understand the behaviors of a variety of species, to prevent harm on larger communities.
