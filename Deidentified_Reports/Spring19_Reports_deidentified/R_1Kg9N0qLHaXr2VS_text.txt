Title: Nitrogen’s positive effect on length and negative effect on weight when looking at root to shoot ratios in Pisum sativum

Abstract:
In order to maximize the success and survival of plants in a given environment, they must carefully allocate resources necessary for growth, such as H2O, CO2 and other key nutrients. The way in which plants allocate certain resources, especially nitrogen, can ultimately affect their physiology. For this experiment, Pisum sativum was used as the organism of study to understand how their allocation of driving resources necessary for growth (H2O, nitrogen, CO2) creates changes in their root to shoot (R:S) ratio when exposed to a nitrogen rich environment. It was hypothesized that the plants in the nitrogen rich environment will have a lower R:S ratio than those in the control environment exposed to only H2O. To effectively test this theory, two pots of 9 seeds each were watered with 50mL of Miracle-Gro in addition to 50mL of H2O (experimental group), while two other pots of 9 seeds each were watered with 100mL of H2O (control group). The R:S ratios were then measured for weight and length. The data supported the hypothesis for weight, but not length. Further conclusions can be made that the plants growth could have been stunted due to an oversaturation of nitrogen, highlighting the importance of balancing driving resources in maximizing plant growth and therefore crop production.

Introduction:
Plants in a variety of environments must allocate resources in particular ways to enhance their growth and subsequently survive. Plants around the world utilize different modes of allocation and cellular processes to ensure they are receiving enough sunlight, H2O, CO2 and other nutrients depending on the various abiotic and biotic factors they are exposed to. As the human population continues to grow, so does our need for food and more efficient agricultural practices. Our world has reacted to this issue by increasing the usage of fertilizers to assist with plant growth, a major component of which requires nitrogen. Compared to the other elements key to plant growth (H2O, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen), the majority of nitrogen in our environment is locked in the atmosphere, with only a small fraction being readily available for plants to intake [Smil: 1997]. This increase in the usage of nitrogen rich fertilizers has had major environmental implications and affected how plants maintain their growth and survival. Understanding how these environmental changes affect plants can provide beneficial knowledge that will not only ensure plant survival going forward, but will also allow humans to continue to live healthy lives as plants comprise major components of our diets. In order for plants to be successful, they are often forced to modify their typical allocation pattern in order to adapt to the abiotic factors present. When facing resource limitation, plants can react in a multitude of ways, often growing deeper downward or higher upward to maximize nutrient absorption. We observed the R:S ratios for both length and weight of plants by comparing our experimental group, which consisted of Miracle-Gro and H2O, to the control group, which consisted of just H2O. We chose Pisum sativum, commonly referred to as field peas, as our experimental organism because they are relatively inexpensive and are readily able to be planted and grown in short periods of time. These two factors make it so field peas can be easily altered by a variety of stimuli. These plants are also very common in our society and are a staple in many human’s diets as they carry a variety of essential nutrients, emphasizing the importance of understanding how the environment affects them. It was hypothesized that the plants in the nitrogen rich environment will have a lower R:S ratio than those in the H2O only environment.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, 9 plants of Pisum sativum were used to observe the effect of nitrogen concentration on resource allocation, and more specifically the root to shoot ratios for both length and weight. First, 9 seeds were potted in soil by making 9 divots in each of the four separate pots of soil, and one seed was placed in each of the divots. All of the seeds were then covered up with soil. The pots were then divided into two groups, with two of the pots containing 18 seeds total serving as the control group, and the other two pots also containing 18 seeds serving as experimental group.  The pots were then placed in the greenhouse where they remained for two weeks. Each day, the two control groups were watered with 100mL of normal H2O, while the two experimental groups with the simulated nitrogen rich environment, were watered with 50mL of Miracle-Gro and 50mL of normal H2O. After doing this for two weeks, the plants were removed from the greenhouse and all of the plants were picked from the pots and cleaned by moving them through a tub of water. This cleaning process was done carefully to ensure the roots and shoots remained intact. The plants were then cut just above the seed shell where the root system met the shoot system, and each of the 27 plants roots and shoots were weighed and recorded into the data tables. Following the weighing of these plants, the lengths of each of the 27 plants were taken, and again were recorded in the data tables. The length measurements were taken from the incision at the root to shoot intersection to the end of the furthest leaf. After this was completed, the root to shoot ratios for both weight and length were determined by dividing the root weight by the shoot weight, and the root length by the shoot length. Once all of our data was collected, a two-tailed t-test was completed using a significance value of 0.05 for both length and weight, comparing the R:S ratio for length and weight between the control and experimental groups.

Results:
The results from this experiment show that the R:S ratio for length was higher in the experimental group when compared to the control group, with the opposite being true when looking at the R:S ratio for weight. Figure 1 indicates the R:S ratio for the control group compared to the experimental group. Looking at weight, the experimental group had a mean and standard deviation of 1.790  0.877 grams and the control group had a mean and standard deviation of 1.097  0.239 grams. Looking at length, the experimental group had a mean and standard deviation of 0.918  0.304 grams, and the control group had a mean and standard deviation of 0.702  0.092 grams. The p-value for weight was 0.042 and for length was 0.048, which makes our data statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Our two-tailed t-test revealed a t-value of 2.374 for weight and 2.289 for length with 8 degrees of freedom for each.

Discussion:
For this experiment, the data supported our hypothesis for weight, but not for length. The R:S ratio for weight was lower in the experimental group than in the control group, which is what we originally hypothesized. However, the R:S ratio for length was higher in the experimental group compared to the control. There was a significant difference between the control and experimental groups for R:S length which is the exact opposite of our prediction. Nitrogen plays a key role in the growth and development of vital plant tissues such as cell membranes and chlorophyll, which are essential in the process of photosynthesis. As it is also a key component of nucleic acids within plants, it is also necessary in the creation and passing on of genetic code, causing its abundance in soil or lack thereof to have major implications on plant growth [Zhao: 2005]. The primary method for nitrogen intake is through the root systems of plants. This process supports the notion for why the R:S ratio for weight was lower in the experimental group. Due to the abundance of nitrogen in the soil, there is less of a need for the roots to fortify themselves in order to better absorb the nitrogen already abundant in the soil, decreasing their weight and lowering the R:S ratio. This allocation of energy also allows the plant to dedicate more of its resources to the shoot system, further decreasing the R:S ratio. Too much exposure to nitrogen can be detrimental to the overall growth of the plant, as this element displaces other essential nutrients in the soil, causing mineral deficiencies for the plant, hurting its chance of survival [Moffat:1998]. This process is known as nitrogen burn. However, nitrogen deficiency in soil can be just as harmful as over-exposure. Nitrogen deficiency can significantly reduce overall leaf area, the presence of chlorophyll and subsequently the plant’s overall ability to perform photosynthesis [Zhao: 2005]. When analyzing the lengths of plants, the R:S ratio of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group. This difference could be because in the experimental group, the roots extended as far as possible in search for valuable nutrients like nitrogen. Due to this essential resource being scarcer, the plant allocated more resources to its root system to ensure the presence of this necessary nutrient within the soils composition. This experiment demonstrated the need for a balance among the minerals and nutrients that plants need to grow and the possible effects of our continued over usage of nitrogen based-fertilizers. Understanding how this balance works can allow us to better provide for our plants and crops to ensure they yield enough to satisfy our planets hunger going forward.
