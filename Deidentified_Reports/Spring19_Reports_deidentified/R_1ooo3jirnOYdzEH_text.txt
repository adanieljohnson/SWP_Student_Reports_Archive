Title: Effect of IG Growth Hormone on Manduca Sexta Growth Patterns 

Abstract:
The effect of hormones on organisms is an elusive, and important, topic of Biology. Hormones work simultaneously to regulate body functions, and their effects can be life altering. Studying hormones in lab is necessary to understand the way that they function, and how they help support life. It is important to understand how hormones will affect growth and development so that they may be manipulated to produce optimal outcomes in organisms. Here, we look at the effect of the IG regulator hormone on the growth patterns of the Manduca Sexta. The expectation was that the IG hormone would cause a significent change in growth pattern of the weight and length of the Manduca compared to growth without the hormone present. Our data showed that there was not a faster change in length and weight in the Manduca’s that had received the hormone.  This data, coupled with the observation that the Maduca Sexta species is extremely vulnerable to hormone imbalance, suggest that the IG growth hormone does not encourage rapid growth in the Manduca Sexta. This hormone response can be used to help promote Manduca growth in necessary situations, as there is a small difference in the controll and experimental groups, and, if possible, can be applied to growth hormones in other organisms.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the influence of growth hormones on insect development. Hormones chemically influence mammals and insects to stimulate the development of cells and tissues. Hormones also are used as chemical communication signals in the body and help maintain homeostasis and regular body function. Eventually, hormones also move the organism form youth to adulthood. In humans, this is considered puberty, however for insects, the process is called molting. Molting is the process used by insect’s to chemically signal that it is time for metamorphosis. Insect molting and metamorphosis are carried out by juvenile hormone and 20-hydroxyecdyson. [Riddiford et al: 2003] Without the two hormones molting does not occur, and the insect is unable to move into adulthood. The rate of metamorphosis in Manduca is under continuous regulation by circulating ecdysteroids that promote development during the first third of adult life. As the Manduca develops, the ecdysteroids become more crucial in development. [Schwartz and Truman: 1983] All of the aforementioned hormones work in conjunction with one another to bring the Manduca into adulthood and regulate size and morphology. If any of the hormones are missing, the system collapses and the Manduca will not fully develop. These effects of these hormones, while most abundant during molting, may be observed during the entirety of the Manduca’s lifecycle and have lasting effects on the organism. [Jesudason et al: 1990] These hormones can be tracked through the life cycle of the Manduca, as it has a simple cycle to follow. These caterpillars are the optimal model organism because their hormone regulation method have been studied at length. Because of this, their hormone levels are easy to manipulate to get a desired result. Hormone manipulation is a common practice in science that is used in mammals as well as insects, studies are done on humans to discover the effect of hormones as well [Mullur et al: 2014] Since it was recognized with the linden bug, they have been used to study the effect they have on body functions.[Smykal et al: 2014] The Manduca sexta, will be treated with IG growth regulator hormone and its weight and length will be monitored. The hormone does not regulate the stages of development, like the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone, so it is uncertain what exactly the effect of the hormone will be. However, with the knowledge that the Manduca is extremely sensitive to hormone manipulation, it can be inferred that a change will occur in the growth patterns of the Manduca. 

Materials and Method:
Manducas were originally selected, weighed, measured, and then placed into eight individual cells. Each Manduca was given ten grams of treated food in their cells. Every 10 grams of food was treated with four drops of the IG growth regulator-hormone. The cells were placed in a temperature-controllled incubator of 23 Celsius. The controll group was given ten grams of food that was not treated with any kind of hormone. The caterpillars were monitored daily for two weeks. Food was replaced, and cells were cleaned as necessary. After one week, the Manduca’s were weighed and measured to ensure growth. Each Manduca was weighed using a standard balance and measured using a standard ruler. After two weeks, final measurements were taken from each organism. The weight and length were recorded. After measurements were taken, statistical analysis was conducted using the data. A two-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine differences in the average lengths and weights of the caterpillars given the IG hormone compared to the ones that were fed untreated food.

Results:
The mean weight gain for the controll group of Manduca’s was 4.95 grams, while the hormone treated group had an average weight change of 11.08 grams. (Fig. 1) The mean length change for the controll group of Manduca’s was 22.5 mm, while the hormone treated group had an average length change of 45mm (Fig 2). The standard deviation for mass in the controll Manducas was .521 and the standard deviation for mass in the experimental Manduca’s was 3.227 (Fig. 1) The standard deviation for length in the controll Manducas was 4.49 and the standard deviation for length in the experimental Manduca’s was 12.32(Fig. 2) We used a two-sample t_test to interpret our results. The mean of the length controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the length experimental group (t_stat = 0.000317). The mean of the weight controll group was also not statistically significently different than that of the length experimental group (t_stat = 0.000207). When observing the Manduca’s on the last day, changes in weight and length were observed. They appeared to have become much fatter and longer than when the experiment initially started. When observing the controll group, changes in weight and length were also observed, however the changes were less drastic. Overall, the experimental group and the controll group had the same general growth pattern, but the experimental group grew much faster than the controll group.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that there would be a significent growth and length change in the caterpillars who were fed the IG hormone, was not supported. A significent increase in growth was observed, however there was also an increase of growth in the controll groups. This suggests that outside environmental factors contributed to the growth of the Manduca and the hormone did not play a significent role in the development of the caterpillar. It is possible that this was observed because our testing group was made up of larger Manducas then the controll group, therefore may have been more developed when the experiment started. Additionally, past investigations have found that exposure to an unnatural amount of IG protein may affect insects by inhibiting specific processes essential for insect growth and development. Some test subjects died due to abnormal regulation of organ growth and a failure to develop past the larval stage. [Tunaz and Uygun: 2004] Understanding the role that IG regulator growth hormones play will help scientists better understand the essential, yet delicate role that hormones play in the development of insects.
