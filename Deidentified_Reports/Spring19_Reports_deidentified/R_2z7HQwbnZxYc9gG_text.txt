Title: Change in contraction amplitude in frog gastrocnemius muscle after the injection of Lidocaine. 

Abstract:
In this experiment we will be using a local anesthetic, lidocaine, to manipulate muscle contraction in a frog’s gastrocnemius muscle. Through the understanding of the muscle contraction system, we will be using an electrophysiology (EP) recording device to monitor the contraction amplitudes of the muscle before and after the injection of lidocaine at 0.8amps frequency threshold. We hypothesized that the injection of lidocaine would cause a blockage of chemical receptors and therefor decrease the muscle contraction amplitude. The study concluded that lidocaine is a muscle contracting inhibitor as the average contraction amplitude before the injection was 0.142V +/- 0.0391V and averaged 0.0V +/- 0.0V after. The data obtained was statistically significant and the null hypothesis was rejected. 

Introduction:
In this experiment we will be using the neuromuscular system to observe the internal and external reactions of muscle contractions. We will use the isolation of the gastrocnemius muscle, which is connected to the sciatic nerve. In the skeletal system there are thousands of myofibrils which are then bounded together by connective tissue to form skeletal muscles. During excitation-contraction coupling, axon potentials travel through the neuromuscular junction to allow a series of polarizations, depolarizations, and chemical releases which allow the muscles to contract and later, relax. Once the nerve impulse crossed the neuromuscular junction, there is a release of acetylcholine (ACh), which later binds with the muscle fibers and creates an action potential in the cell. The action potentials cause a release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and activates a muscle contraction. 

This experiment will be using myograms, a force transductor, to record the amount of force generated by individual contractions. The myograms are visual representations of the different phases of a single muscle twitch. In a similar study done on human muscle, it was found that local anesthetics such as lidocaine, once injected and allowed to sit for approximately 5 minutes, decreased the muscles activity ability by 62-67 percent [Moller: 1980]. Information surrounding the frog’s ability to contract the gastrocnemius muscle after the injection of lidocaine provides scientists with further information of the effects of localized anesthetics on human muscles; frog and human muscles share many commonalities in structure and make up. We hypothesized that the injection of lidocaine into a frog’s gastrocnemius muscle would cause a blockage of the sodium channel during the excitation-contraction coupling and therefor decrease the contraction amplitude monitored by the electrophysiology device.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment we observed how the neuromuscular system respond to internal and external environments through the injection of different stimuli. We used a frog leg in our experiment, more specifically the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve. 

Each group of students was given three frog legs for their experiments. Once the skin was removed, the frog’s gastrocnemius and sciatic nerve were then isolated from the remaining parts of the leg in order to more easily test an array of neuromuscular properties. The thigh muscles were separated in order to expose the sciatic nerve; beginning with the upper thigh and moving downwards toward the knee. It is best to avoid using metal (forceps, tweezers, ex..) on the nerve and make sure that the exposed portions remain moisturized with frog Ringer’s solution. Once the frog’s muscle was prepared for examination, an electrophysiology (EP) recording device was inserted into the gastrocnemius muscle. The first leg was used to determine the initial stimulus threshold that will generate a muscle contraction in the leg. Next, the gastrocnemius muscle was injected with 2.0 mL of 25.0 mM Lidocaine and allowed to absorb into the muscle for 5 minutes through massaging. After the waiting period, the muscle was re-tested to find the new contraction amplitudes of the muscle contractions at threshold. The process was repeated for subjects A, B, and C. A one-tailed paired t-test was used in the experiment. 


Results:
The frog’s gastrocnemius muscle had a stimulus threshold of 0.8V. Before the injection of lidocaine, leg A demonstrated an average 0.18V contraction amplitude, leg B had an average 0.15V contraction amplitude and leg C had a 0.093V average contraction amplitude. After the injection of Lidocaine, each leg demonstrated an average of 0.0V +/- 0.0 contraction amplitude. Final results concluded that the three legs had an average change of -0.142V +/- 0.039V. As seen in Figure 1. the subjects experienced no contraction at the determined a threshold of 0.8V. The average change in contraction amplitude in the subjects after the injection of Lidocaine was statistically significant (t-value= 5.49, df=4, p-value= 0.0317). 

Discussion:
Through the experiment was were able to observe how the change in internal and/or external stimuli affects neuromuscular control in frogs. The hypothesis stated by our experiment was that the injection of lidocaine would cause a blockage of the sodium channel receptors in the muscle contraction and therefore decrease the contraction amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle. The injected lidocaine caused a blockage of the sodium gated channels which prevented the sodium from entering the cell body and thus prevented the action potentials to move across towards the neuromuscular junction. If the receptor channels are blocked, they cause an inhibiting domino effect for the later release of calcium and the production of a muscle contraction. 

In order for a contraction to be observed in the treated gastrocnemius muscle, the contraction stimulus must be moved from 0.8V to a much higher frequency, in which a muscle contraction will be visible through the electrophysiology recording and human observation. The addition of lidocaine in the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle displayed that there was a decrease of activity (contraction amplitude) in the frog’s ability to create muscle contraction. 

The data observed through the experiment amplifies the idea that local anesthetics are useful inhibitors of muscle contractions. Similar studies conducted on human muscle suggest that the inhibition of the muscle contraction was due to the blocking of the intramuscular nerves [Moller: 1980]. We are able to relate the information found back to humans as frogs and humans share a similar muscle contraction system, yet frogs are much easier and more available than human muscle for experimentation. The understanding of how local anesthetics such as lidocaine relate to a muscle’s ability to contract can be used in further medical research in subjects such as pain relief and muscle function. The data was statistically significant and therefor the null hypothesis was rejected, and the alternate hypothesis was supported.
