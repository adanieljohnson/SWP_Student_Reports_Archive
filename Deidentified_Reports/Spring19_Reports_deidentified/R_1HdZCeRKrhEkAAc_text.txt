Title: The Effect of Body Coloration on Aggressive Red Mane Behavior in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Intraspecific behavior within a single species can be used in social interactions such as aggression, sexual activities, or species recognition.  Betta splendens are organisms which display behaviors with varying degrees of aggressiveness in both broadside and facing movements.  One facing movement which demonstrates the highest level of aggression is red mane behavior.  We predicted that male betta fish would display a longer duration of red mane behavior towards other males of different body coloration compared to males of the same coloring.  In order to test this, we measured the total duration of red mane behavior when same colored fish were exposed to each other and when different colored fish were exposed to each other.  Our data did not support our hypothesis because although the average duration of red mane behavior was greater for different colored fish interactions, our results were not statistically significant.  From this we can conclude that coloration of male betta fish does not impact agonistic behavior, whether two opponents are similarly colored or differently colored.

Introduction:
Intraspecific behavior is behavior in the presence of other members of the same species.  Observation can be used to understand visual communication which regulates social interactions, particularly those associated with aggression, sexual activities, and species recognition [Johnson: 2018].  The model organism for this experiment is Betta splendens (Siamese fighting fish or Betta fish).  Betta splendens are common aquarium fishes that are indigenous to Thailand [Johnson: 2018].  Intraspecific behaviors of betta fish include broadside movements and facing movements.  Broadside movements are those in which the fish’s side is turned towards an opponent [Johnson: 2018].  Facing movements are those in which the fish is facing the opponent head on [Johnson: 2018].  Broadside behaviors in increasing order of aggressiveness are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2018].  Facing movements in increasing order of aggressiveness are erect pectoral fins, spread opercula, and protruded branchiostegal membranes [Johnson: 2018].
	This experiment focuses on the most aggressive facing movement, the protruded branchiostegal membranes which is also known as a “red mane.”  Response to agonistic behaviors can include submissive signals or escalation, showing another agonistic behavior that is higher intensity [Johnson 2018].  We predict that male betta fish will display more aggressive behaviors, measured as a longer duration with red mane displayed, towards other males of different body coloration compared to males of the same coloring.  This has been seen in fish of other species, including in the male cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni.  In a study of aggressive behavior in cichlids, males had significantly more agonistic interactions toward males of the opposite color [Korzan: 2007].  Therefore, we expect the betta males to respond similarly.

Materials and Methods:
We selected two red male betta fish and removed the opaque wall separating the two fish, allowing the two fish to see each other through a clear wall for a duration of five minutes.  During these five minutes, we recorded the total duration of red mane behavior for each fish.  The total duration was recorded by starting a timer each instance the red mane appeared and stopping when it disappeared continuously for the entirety of the five minutes.  After letting the fish rest in their own sections of the tank with the opaque wall preventing the fish from seeing each other for five minutes, we repeated the same procedure with two blue male betta fish.  This resulted in a total of four same colored fish interactions.  
Then, after waiting an additional five minutes of rest, we selected one of the red male fish and one of the blue male fish which we had previously used in the same color trials to interact.  We recorded the total duration of the red mane behavior for both of these fish.  This was repeated with the other red male fish and the other blue male fish.  This resulted in a total of four different colored fish interactions.  We took the average and standard deviation of both the same color and different color fish trials.  We also ran a paired one-tailed T-test to compare red mane behavior between same colored fish and different colored fish.

Results:
The average time with red mane behavior displayed for same colored fish pairings was 85.87 ± 91.9s (Figure 1).  The average time with red mane behavior displayed for different colored fish pairing was 96.71 ± 36.8s (Figure 1).  Our results for the average time spent displaying red mane behavior between fish of the same body coloration and fish of different body colorations were not significant (t-value= 0.18, df= 3, p-value= 0.872).

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis that male betta fish would display red mane behavior for a longer duration towards males of different coloration compared to the same coloration.  Although the average time with red mane displayed was greater for different colored fish pairings, the standard deviation was very large and our results were not statistically significant.  Even though our differences in average red mane duration between the two groups was not statistically significant, the trend of the average time with red mane displayed being greater for different colored fish pairings has also been seen in other studies.  In one study, the researchers were able to conclude that betta fish will respond least when the reinforce coloration is like its own and most when the coloration is unlike its own [Thompson: 1965].  
A reason why our results were not statistically significant could be because we used one red/red pairing and one blue/blue pairing for the same color group to compile our data.  It is possible that there is a difference in the aggressiveness of red betta fish and blue betta fish.  There could be an inherent difference in the aggressive behavior displayed by red betta fish and blue betta fish.  A study found that variance in betta fish attack was not reliably correlated with subjects’ color, but it appears that additional experiments are required to confirm these findings [Bronstein: 1985].  Additionally, a limitation of this experiment is that we only used four betta fish total.  This means that we did not have a large sample to collect data from and to compare, so it is possible that the behavior observed could be due to the individual fish tested and not a trend seen across the species as a whole.
