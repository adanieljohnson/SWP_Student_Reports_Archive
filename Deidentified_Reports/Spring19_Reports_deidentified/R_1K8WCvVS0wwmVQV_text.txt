Title: Synthetic juvenile hormone effects on growth rate of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar is commonly found across the United States, and it relies on juvenile hormone to regulate its growth during the larval stage. Because it is often considered a pest, a better understanding of how juvenile hormone affects growth of these insects could lead to improved methods of protecting crops. To test if juvenile hormone causes a measurable difference in the growth of caterpillars, we exposed one group of caterpillars to synthetic juvenile hormone while exposing the other only to water, and we measured the average growth rate of each group. The caterpillars that were exposed to synthetic juvenile hormone had a statistically significant difference in their growth rate, which was much faster than the growth rate of the caterpillars not exposed to the synthetic juvenile hormone. This significant difference suggests that juvenile hormone plays a direct role in growth rate (of weight) of caterpillars. This understanding is important for creating better ways to biologically combat these pests in an agricultural setting.


Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, formally known as the Manduca sexta, is a caterpillar found throughout southern North America. It has a larval, pupal, and adult stage, and during the larval period of the caterpillar’s life, it is considered a pest [Byron: 2017]. This is because the Manduca sexta is herbivorous and often feeds on plants regularly grown as crops. However, a better understanding of how hormones affect the different stages of the Manduca sexta’s life could better equip farmers and scientists to find alternative ways to protect crops without using high levels of harmful insecticides. 
In order to pupate and metamorphose into a moth, the Manduca sexta’s juvenile hormone levels must drop while 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) hormone levels rise. As the caterpillars begin to store enough of the nutrients necessary for pupation and grow larger, their juvenile hormone levels begin to drop. After the juvenile hormone drop, there is a small bump of 20E known as the commitment pulse. This triggers the preparation for the caterpillar to enter the pupa stage [Browder: 2001]. From this information, it can be gathered that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in a caterpillar would keep the caterpillar’s juvenile hormone levels from dropping, which would keep the commitment pulse from occurring. This is turn would affect the caterpillar’s ability to pupate. These differences between caterpillars exposed to extra juvenile hormone and those that are not would likely lead to measurable physiological differences. Because of this information, we hypothesize that if we expose a group of caterpillars to a synthetic juvenile hormone, then their growth rate will be significantly different from the growth rate of caterpillars not exposed to juvenile hormone. 


Materials and Methods:
To see if synthetic juvenile hormone has an effect on caterpillar growth, we decided to create two groups of caterpillars to compare the difference between the two groups. We started by being randomly assigned eight caterpillars and dividing those caterpillars into two even groups. Each caterpillar was isolated from each of the others so that there was no competition for food. After this, eight balls of 10 grams of GLM caterpillar food were created. To four of the food balls, we added 8 drops of synthetic juvenile hormone. To the other four, we added 8 drops of distilled water to ensure that the two sets of food were the same consistency. The four caterpillars given the synthetic hormone food became the experimental group, and the four caterpillars given the water food became the control group. Next, every day for two weeks, we weighed each of the caterpillars and recorded their weight. When they were not being weighed, all of the caterpillars were kept in an incubator with the same environment and temperature. Whenever one of the caterpillar’s food ran out, we replaced it with the same amount and type of food that they began with. Unfortunately, during this time, one of our caterpillars died. We still calculated his growth rate over the time that he was alive and included it in our final comparison of the two data sets we obtained. At the end of the two weeks, we calculated the average change in weight, or growth rate, of each caterpillar. We then took the four experimental growth rates and four control growth rates and found the average of each. We then used a two-sample t-test at an alpha level of 0.05 to compare the data and determine if there was a significant difference between the growth rate of the experimental caterpillars compared to the growth rate of the control caterpillars. The null hypothesis was that the synthetic juvenile hormone would cause no difference between the two groups, and the alternate hypothesis was that the synthetic juvenile hormone would cause a difference between the two groups.


Results:
The average growth rate of the control group was 0.3702g, and the average growth rate for the experimental group was 0.9400g. There appears to be a large difference between the control and experimental groups’ growth rates due to the large disparity between these two numbers, and this is proven by the two-sample t-test. When the two-sample t-test was used to compare whether or not the difference between the two groups of caterpillars was statistically significant, we found that it was. The t-test yielded a p-value of 0.02022, which is well below our chosen alpha level of 0.05. This low p-value leads us to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate hypothesis by showing that there is a statistically significant difference between the growth rate of caterpillars not exposed to synthetic juvenile growth hormone and those that are. This significant difference is displayed in Figures 1 and 2. 


Discussion:
Since our p-value was significant and we know that the synthetic juvenile hormone did have an effect on the caterpillars’ growth rate, we know that juvenile hormone serves a physiological purpose related to the growth of caterpillars. This conclusion supports our original hypothesis, which was that the growth rate of the caterpillars exposed to synthetic juvenile hormone will be significantly different from the growth rate of caterpillars not exposed to juvenile hormone. This conclusion also supports the current understanding of the function of juvenile hormone in caterpillars, which is that juvenile hormone plays a large role in larval development and growth between instars [Browder: 2001]. The experimental group had a much faster growth rate than the control group, and this is likely because the caterpillars were trying to obtain enough nutrients and grow large enough that their juvenile hormones levels would drop so that they could begin the commitment pulse and pupate. However, no matter how many nutrients the experimental caterpillars took in, their juvenile hormone levels couldn’t drop because they were exposed to excess juvenile hormone [Weeks: 1986]. This would explain the fast growth of the experimental caterpillars. The limitations of this experiment included a relatively short time span to collect data, and the fact that one of our control caterpillars died part of the way through the experiment. In future research, to build off of what was found in this experiment, researchers could expose caterpillars to 20E in a similar process to observe if it would cause caterpillars to reach the commitment pulse and pupa stage faster than a caterpillar not exposed to 20E as well as to see if caterpillars exposed to this hormone have a slower growth rate than those not exposed to it. This experiment has increased the understanding of how hormones affect the growth process of Manduca sexta caterpillars, which is important for creating better ways to biologically combat these pests in an agricultural setting.
