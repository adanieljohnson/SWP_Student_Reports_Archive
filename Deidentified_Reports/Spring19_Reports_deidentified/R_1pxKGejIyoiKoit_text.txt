Title: Increased Levels of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca Sexta Larvae Results in a Lack of Pupation

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, an organism considered to be a pest as an adult, has a hormone that is only present during the egg/embryo and larvae stage. This hormone, or JH, was increased in a treatment group of larvae Manduca sexta to see if adult deformations and thus lack of reproduction to occur to eliminate this pest. By introducing an increased amount of JH, which was used in the form of Precor into the diets of the larvae Manduca, it will stunt their development and growth. However, it was found that an increase of JH resulted in a lack of pupation; the treatment Manduca sexta never pupated and never reached adulthood; they became lethargic and eventually died. The caterpillars were weighed and fed once a day for two weeks, Monday through Friday. The treatment caterpillars became large and lethargic, and one died. The controll group actually reached pupation. The controll group had an average weight of 4.9 grams while the treatment average was 7.63 grams. The controll had a standard deviation of 0.408 while the treatment had 0.986. The p_value was 0.986.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, or more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm is ametabolous, meaning they grow through four life stages, which are the egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. As adults, they are viewed to be pests as they feed on tobacco plants, ruining crops. Throughout these four stages, two hormones are almost always present. These two hormones are ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, or JH. While they have specific effects on their own, they can work together to controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis. Insects need both hormones and if either is eliminated entirely, the insect will die. Ecdysteroids have a tendency to fluctuate throughout the entire lifespan, but JH is only present during the egg and embryo stage and larvae stage, and declines dramatically after the commitment pulse, which is the action that triggers the larvae to pupate and become an adult. The commitment pulse is a physical indicator that the larvae is about to undergo the process of pupation, thus becoming an adult. The pupation stage is where the organism hardens and darkens to form the adult moth. Prior to pupation, the larvae tend to have a wandering behavior, and consume as much food as possible [Byron and Kaufman, 2017]. This organism was chosen as the subject of this experiment as they can be successfully reared on an artificial diet. The biological question that was to be answered was that if an increased amount of Precor, a type of JH, were introduced into the diet of the larval Manduca, what would the effects be? With four drops of Precor added into the diets, the development and lifecycle of the Manduca Sexta would be severely stunted, which would be beneficial considering they are pests in the adult stage. This question is being asked so the adult Manduca sexta can be eliminated, due to their troubleness and behavior as pests. Depending on the results of this experiment, it will be determined if increased levels of JH will result in a stunted development. If this occurs, the organism will be physically stunted, resulting in an altered gene pool and lower reproduction rates. By introducing an increased amount of Precor into the diets of the larvae Manduca, it will stunt their development and growth. 

Materials and Method:
Six total caterpillars, each placed in a separate cell, were given ten grams of the standard Manduca sexta larva food. The caterpillars were incubated and only taken outside the incubator once a day when they were fed. Three of the caterpillars were given just the standard food but with drops of water added in to match the consistency of the experimental group. The other three caterpillars received four drops of Precor mixed into their ten grams of standard food. Monday through Friday the caterpillars were fed and weighed once a day. The only agent used was the four drops of Precor in the three experimental caterpillars food. Commonly available method were used in determining the independent and dependent variables. The independent variable was be the Precor/JH and the dependent variable was the weight in grams of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. A two-sample T test was used to compare the caterpillars fed Precor and the caterpillars who did not receive any Precor in their diets. The average weights were collected for each the experimental and controll groups, and using Excel, a p_value of .986 was determined. 

Results:
Figure 1. Average Weight of Manduca sexta Larvae before Pupation

The controll group, which received no Precor into their standard food, had an average weight of 4.9 grams, which is much lower than the average weight of the treatment group, which did receive Precor. The average weight was 7.63 grams. The standard deviation of the controll was 0.408 and the standard deviation of the treatment group was 0.986, and the p value was 0.986.


Discussion:
 Our hypothesis stated that increased JH levels will result in adult deformations and a lack of growth. However, our hypothesis was proved to be incorrect as the Manduca sexta treatment group just continued to increase in mass until they died. Physically, they did not have an healthy appearance as they were paler than the controll group and were much larger in size. Additionally, they appeared to be swollen and too large; due to the lack of ridges that form prior to the commitment pulse. Near the end of the two week mark, they moved less and less while still consuming the food around them. Within the test group, one died and the other two were quite lethargic and on the brink of death. The increase in Precor simply led to their death rather than resulting in a lack of growth and development of adult deformations, as we predicted in our hypothesis. Data was measured in a bar graph with a controll average of 4.9 grams while the treatment average was 7.63 grams. The controll had a standard deviation of 0.408 while the treatment had 0.986. The p_value was 0.986. In figure 1, the average weight gain before pupation in grams was illustrated. Compared to other groups testing similar hypotheses, the same results were gathered, in that the test group were lethargic, if not dead, and the controll made it to pupation. In order to further test our hypothesis, which was proved wrong, one could eliminate the Precor prior to pupation, and introduce the organisms to it as it matures to see if there are any issues that develop as an adult. For example, one would introduce the Precor into the diet of an adult Manduca sexta to see if there are any developmental deformities as adults. Another experience studying the effect of JH in the Manduca sexta [Kiguchi, 1978] removed the gland that produces and releases JH. The results of this showed that adults suffered significent deformities and a significently earlier pupation in comparison to the average time of pupation.
