Title: Addition of mycorrhizal fungi to R. Raphanistrum increases the root to shoot ratio despite reallocation to the shoots

Abstract:
Resource allocation in plants is a vital function that allows immobile organisms to compete with those around them. By changing how they use and acquire nonessential resources such as sunlight, nitrogen, or phosphorus, plants can adapt to survive in different environments. Soil fungi, such as mycorrhiza, can often form symbiotic relationships with roots and help them gain more nutrients. We performed an experiment to observe this, and see how this relationship changes resource allocation in plants. This is important for understanding the biodiversity and plethora of factors that create it. Fungal relationships with roots are often credited as a major factor in diversity of environments, especially ones with low soil nutrients.We used two groups of R. Raphanistrum plants, one planted with mycorrhiza in the soil and one without. We hypothesized that the fungi would cause the plants to reallocate to their shoots, and thus grow them larger, but this reallocation would be outpaced by the rapid root growth from the fungal symbiosis. Our hypothesis was supported, and while the weights of the two groups had no significent difference, the difference in lengths was significent. A direction for future experiments would be to observe how this relationship affects these plants over longer per

Introduction:
end of abstract: iods of time. It is entirely likely that since the growing period was only two weeks, the plants didn’t have the necessary time to reallocate completely in response to the fungal root complex. This potentially tells us that allocation in response to changes like the fungi take longer.

Resource allocation is an essential function carried out by plants that allows them to alter the ways in which they compete with their neighbors, despite being immobile themselves. Shade trees such as Austrian Oaks can often form large canopies with their leaves, shading out many of the understory plants not able to grow as tall as them. Canopy trees generally have access to abundant sunlight, and the trees below them have far less. As a result, these understory trees, like holly or dogwood, reallocate their resources to favor their shoots, referring to the stems and leaves, over their roots in order to maximize the amount of photosynthesis they can perform under these adverse conditions[Johnson:2018]. This relationship of resource allocation between roots and shoots can be referred to as the “Root:Shoot Ratio” of plants. Plants who grow in soil with poor nutrient levels will likely favor their roots, increasing the R:S ratio, while those who grow in poor lighting will do the opposite. Other biotic factors have large effects on resource allocation, such as the presence of helpful organisms in soil, like the fungi mycorrhiza. This is a type of fungus that has the ability to form a mutualistic relationship with plant roots that increases uptake of soil nutrients like phosphorus. The large complex that forms from this relationship vastly increases the surface area available for absorption and decreases diffusion distance for P ions [Bolan: 1991]. The fungi does this by colonizing the root tissues and uses its incredibly thin mycelium to spread out and access more soil. This, coupled with the ability of many fungi to dissolve nutrient compounds previously insoluble to plants, allows a greatly increased ability to uptake nutrients [Bolan: 1991]. Understanding and observing this symbiosis is important for gaining knowledge on how greatly outside biotic factors can affect the health or biodiversity in certain places. Areas with extremely poor soil, for example, could have the opportunity to host a large diversity of species on account of nutrient-gaining help from fungi. This has an important effect on resource allocation because the presence of mycorrhiza in one area will allow the plants there to allocate less to their roots. This could allow for plants previously unable to compete for sunlight to reallocate their resources to shoots due to the fungus helping their roots, and thus better compete. In order to observe the effects of mycorrhizal fungi in a controllled environment, we performed an experiment with R. Raphanistrum in a greenhouse, with one controll group being given no fungi, and the other being planted alongside it. We believe that the presence of mycorrhizae in the treatment group will increase the root:shoot ratio, because the expanding surface area from the fungi will outpace the likely reallocation to the shoots.



Materials and Method:
To set up the experiment, we first soaked a hand.f.ul of R. raphanistrum seeds in water for half an hour while we prepared the vermiculite. To do so, we used 6 separate containers for vermiculite, three controll and three treatment. We filled each container with vermiculite, and pre-watered it as well as putting miracle-gro in each one. The treatment group got a few pinches of mycorrhizal fungus in the soil as well. We then planted seeds in each of the soil containers, and allowed them to grow for two weeks in the greenhouse, watering them every day. After two weeks was up, we removed 3 individual plants from each container, and weighed them after removing the soil. After that we cut the plants in order to separate the roots from the shoots, and weighed them individually, allowing us to see the root:shoot ratio of weight. Finally, we measured each root and shoot with a ruler, in centimetres, in order to get the root:shoot ratio for length, as well as finding the max length shoot and max length root for each group of 3. We used a one tailed T test in order to test the statistical results of the experiment, with a critical P value of 0.05.


Results:
Our collected data showed an obvious trend favoring a higher root:shoot ratio within the treatment group. It was also evident within the treatment group that the shoots grew as well, they were much taller and had longer leaves than the controll group. As shown in both figures one and two, the treatment group was larger in both weight and length, but length was the only one with a statistical significent difference. The standard deviations were much higher for weight (Fig. 1) than for length (Fig. 2).  It was also shown that there was a significent difference between the lengths but not the weights of the two groups.  (Control Mean Length: 1.0416 ± 0.2529; Weight: 0.2595518375 ± 0.2004175401).  (Treatment Mean Length: 2.306243386 ± 0.4514465798; Weight: 0.4241777292 ± 0.1584662011). (Weight Stats: T=1.12, DF=4, P=0.16) (Length Stats: T=4.23, DF=4, P=0.006) 


Discussion:
Based on the data we acquired it is evident that our hypothesis was supported. Despite the fact that we saw no significent difference in the weights between the groups, the difference in lengths was very significent. This is likely a result of what we initially predicted: the symbiotic complex formed between the fungi and roots vastly elongates the roots of plants in order to maximize surface area and nutrient gain. This results in incredibly long roots whose growth outpaces the increase in overall growth in the plants. The additional growth in roots was enough to produce a large difference in length, but the thinness of the longer roots meant that the weight was not made up in comparison to the shoot growth. The fungi aims to maximize surface area to gain more nutrients like phosphorus, and as such, after colonizing the root tissue it uses its extremely thin mycelium to spread out and create a large surface area [Bolan: 1991]. This helps to maximize surface area because thick roots would waste potential surface area to make up the inside of the roots, so making long and thin roots will provide the plant and fungi with the most additional nutrients. A limitation of this experiment as a whole was the short time period; I don’t believe we had an adequate time to see how the plant would react fully to the presence of fungi in the roots. It may be possible that further reallocation of resources would have occurred if we allowed the plants to grow longer as they adapted to the microbes in the roots. Understanding and utilizing the relationship between these fungi and plants is not only important to agriculture for humans, but also for understanding the ways in which different areas and ecosystems achieve biodiversity. The fungi’s presence can lower the need for resource allocation to roots in response to poor soil, allowing more plants to grow and allocate to their roots in such soil than would be possible without the fungi. Under conditions in which phosphorus is very low mycorrhizal interaction within plant roots can influence the blossoming ecosystem even if soil nutrients are very low [Jefferies: 2003]. This knowledge can help us to not only understand how certain ecosystems function, but also how to cultivate or help ecosystems that are failing. It would be important for the future to test how capable these relationships are when it comes to helping ecosystems as well as finding a lower bound for just how nutrient depleted soil can be to still receive benefits from these microbes.
