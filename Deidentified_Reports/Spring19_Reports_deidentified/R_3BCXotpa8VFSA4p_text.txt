Title: Excess juvenile hormone effects on the growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillar

Abstract:
	Hormones are vital to the coordination of an organism’s body. Studying just how crucial they are, this experiment aimed to determine how adding excess juvenile hormone (JH) to a Manduca sexta caterpillar’s food would alter its growth. The Manduca sexta has a short life span, making this experiment accessible to analyze in a short timeframe. We hypothesized that excess JH would inhibit the growth of the caterpillars. To test this, additional JH was put in the food of four experimental group caterpillars, while distilled water was added to the food of four controll group caterpillars. Their weight was measured each day for fourteen days and compared at the end. The average weight of the experimental group was less than that of the controll group, though their standard deviation was much greater. There were slight observational differences between the two groups as well, as the controll group was less active than the experimental, but began to pupate sooner. The results of the experiment thus showed a trend with the averages, though a one-tailed two-sample t_test showed that the results were not significent to our hypothesis. The information gathered from this experiment helps create a better understanding of the role of hormones in a broader collection of similar organisms.


Introduction:
	Hormones are a crucial component to the growth and development of many organisms. The Manduca sexta caterpillar, of the Order Lepidoptera, completes its growth and development in an average of thirty-nine to fourty-four days. The timing of each developmental stage is based, mostly, on the endocrine function of two hormones: Ecdysterone (20E), which determines the timing of molting during development, and Juvenile Hormone (JH), which determines the type of molt. These hormones work together for growth to be possible, so this raises the question of what would happen if there was not a proper amount of one of them. In normal, developing Manduca sexta larvae, metamorphosis begins when growth stops, as a result of the halting of JH secretion, at a stage known as critical weight [Nijhout: 2006]. This research suggests that if JH secretion or concentration were to be lowered, metamorphosis could potentially not occur, since the critical weight would not be met. Similarly, in a study that compared the effects of excess JH in intact larvae, and rainless and neck-ligated larvae, it was found that before the start of the wandering stage (in the fifth Instar), excess JH caused metamorphic development to be hindered. This confirmed the discoveries of other studies, though the continuation of the experiment proved to accelerate the development of the tobacco hornworm after the start of the wandering stage [Safranek: 1980]. These two studies demonstrate just how important it is for an organism’s hormones to be consistent in amount and time of secretion. The Manduca sexta is helpful to use in experiments like these because it is a simple organism, with the ability of its growth to be clearly identified in a short amount of time. Its short life cycle helps scientists and researchers easily distinguish changes while minimizing cost. In this experiment, we hypothesize that if we expose the Manduca sexta caterpillars to excess juvenile hormone, then the overall growth in weight of the caterpillars will be inhibited. Here, the amount of juvenile hormone acts as the independent variable, while the weight of the caterpillars acts as the dependent variable. 


Materials and Method:
	To test our hypothesis, we separated eight Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups: an experimental group and a controll group. With both groups, each caterpillar had their own clear container habitat, containing approximately 10 grams of food. The controll group’s food was simply taken from the supply, measured, and then mixed with 8 pipet drops of distilled water to dampen it. It was then shaped into a ball and placed its respective habitat. The experimental group’s food had the same procedure, though 8 pipet drops of excess juvenile hormone (JH) were added before the food was mixed instead of distilled water. This allowed the consistency of the experimental group’s food to match that of the controll group. This process was repeated each time new food had to be made in order to produce consistent growth results. The eight caterpillars were weighed before being fed on the first day, and every day after that for two weeks. Throughout this time, the caterpillars were kept in an incubator to keep the environmental conditions consistent, and they were only removed from their habitats for the short time they were being weighed. At the end of the two weeks, the one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to analyze our data, comparing the growth, in weight, of the experimental group to the controll group. With the one-tailed two-sample t_test, significent difference between two groups is determined by the data having a P-value less than 0.05.


Results:
	During the experiment, it became obvious, early on, that the two groups differed in their results. Qualitative observations showed that the controll group of Manduca sexta did not have much physical movement and activity towards the beginning, whereas the experimental group was fairly active. These observations were consistent throughout the experiment, and it was recorded that the caterpillars in the controll group began pupating towards the end of the two weeks, whereas the experimental caterpillars had not. Over the fourteen days, the controll group had a greater weight gain, on average. Two of the experimental caterpillars came close in total weight statistically, though not close enough to increase their average weight significently. Figure 1 helps to analyze the average collected data, creating the conclusion that the mean weight for the controll group was greater than that of the experimental group. Though this is true, the experimental group had a greater calculated standard deviation, as seen by the error bars in the graph. The one-tailed two-sample t_test, however, showed that these conclusions are not significent and the trends seen are not consistent, as the p_value was calculated to be 0.213068.


Discussion:
	The general trend observed in the data was that the weight of the experimental group was lower, suggesting that the addition of JH inhibits growth, as we predicted through our hypothesis. Although, with the evaluation of our data and its resulting two-sample t_test p_value, which was substantially above the cut-off, it was determined that our one-tailed data is not significent. The result of the t_test helped us evaluate that the two means calculated were significently different, considering their individual weights throughout the experiment. The trend we saw between the means based on Figure 1 is most likely due to chance, considering our t_test results. The insignificent data thus cannot answer the question of the effect of different concentrations of Ecdysterone or Juvenile Hormone. An alternate study provided insight as to why our results were insignificent, stating that different doses of JH affect the caterpillars at different stages. PTTH is needed in the insect body to release different hormones, and the brain is physically able to release this hormone during the feeding stage, but growth is still allowed for two more days following this [Kiguchi: 1978]. This provides information that was not previously considered, as if was not known how old each caterpillar was. Without knowing if each Manduca sexta was in the same stage, the data cannot be considered consistent and viable. Another set of conducted research builds onto the information already provided, explaining that sensitivity to JH amounts declines after the adult cuticle is formed, following a stage of DNA synthesis that stops the communication between epidermal cells and JH [Riddiford: 1973]. Using the information provided by the studies mentioned, a future experiment should observe the stage of each caterpillar before administering different levels of hormones, especially considering the short life cycle that the Manduca sexta have. It is important to study and consider the roles of each hormone in any living organism, as they are an organism’s method of regulation and maintaining homeostasis. Studies on organisms like the Manduca sexta can have a strong correlation to more complicated organisms, and even lead to the discovery of the functions of certain hormones in that system.
