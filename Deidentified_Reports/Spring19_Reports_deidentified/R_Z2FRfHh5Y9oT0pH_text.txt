Title: The Effects of Caffeine on the Contraction Strength of the Gastrocnemius in Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
The nervous system-a communication network that allows animals to sense and respond to the outside- is a special trait separating the animal kingdom from other forms of life. The nervous system runs on electrochemical signals known as action potentials, which can trigger muscle contraction. Caffeine interacts with the nervous system as a stimulant, acting as a competitive inhibitor to induce alertness. Northern Leopard Frogs, Rania pipiens, are a common species in Northern America and have large hind legs used for jumping. Our group hypothesized that if we injected the Rania pipiens legs with caffeine, then the muscle will contract more strongly, and our hypothesis was supported by our data. Our findings are important and our results can show that caffeine can be used as a performance enhancement drug.

Introduction:
One special trait that separates the animal kingdom from the others is the use of a nervous system-a communication network that allows animals to sense and respond to the outside world within milliseconds. These nervous systems are comprised of a series of highways throughout the body known as neurons, which conduct electrochemical signals. These signals, known as action potentials, travel down the neuron and trigger the release of Acetylcholine (Ach), which travels across the synaptic gap or neuromuscular junction. Ach then triggers the opening of sodium channels, which depolarizes the cell and releases calcium ions. These ions then bind to troponin, which allows tropomyosin to move and for the muscles to contract [Johnson: 2016]. 
Muscles are composed of actin and myosin; arranged into myofibrils. These myofibrils are housed in a cell wrapped in the sarcolemma. When the motor neuron sends an action potential to the muscle, it contracts [Johnson: 2016]. 
Rania pipiens, also known as the Northern Leopard Frog, is a small green and brown frog found throughout much of the United States and Canada. The frog’s outstanding jumping abilities have been associated with the high amount of force able to be exerted by the frog's hind legs. The frog’s prevalence in the wild and jumping abilities make it an ideal subject to study in regards to the differing effects of chemicals on muscle reactions. 
Caffeine is a stimulant used to wake someone up. If too much is ingested, caffeine causes muscle twitches or spasms [Nehlig: 1992]. It is also known to slightly increase the strength of muscles by acting as a competitive inhibitor to the neurochemical adenosine.
Our group hypothesized that if we injected the Rania pipiens legs with caffeine, then the muscle will contract more strongly. We believe that caffeine increases the sensitivity and muscle reactivity by impacting the motor cortex. 
We will measure muscle strength by using a myogram-the graphical representation of muscular contractions. 

Materials and Method:
First, three Rania pipiens hind legs were obtained and prepared. The legs were prepared by removing all of the skin and isolating the sciatic nerve from the thigh muscles. The gastrocnemus was then separated from the rest of the leg at one end by cutting the Achilles tendon. A string was then tied around the free end of the gastrocnemus and a loop was made with the string. The gastrocnemus was then suspended from a myogram machine at a 90-degree angle from the rest of the leg. The sciatic nerve was then placed over both prongs of the electrode. Each leg was shocked five times at one volt and one amp. The results were recorded. Then 0.1 Ml of  200 mM caffeine was injected into the suspended calf muscle. The leg was then shocked five more times as the same voltage and amplitude. The results were analyzed using a paired T-test. 


Results:
In all of the trials the second test, the caffeine injection, had a stronger contraction than the first test. Most of the muscles also showed progressive fatigue with the exceptions for frog legs one and two during test two. The mean contraction for test one of all the frogs was 0.75 and the second test had a mean contraction of 1.29. Our overall p_value from the paired t_test was 7.98E-10. 

Discussion:
Our result rejected the null hypothesis, therefore supporting our hypothesis. Caffeine does increase the strength of muscle contractions. Our p_value was less than 0.05, therefore our results were significent. 
This information is important because we can apply it to outside areas, such as sports. Knowing that caffeine increases muscle strength mean that it could be used as a sports enhancement drug. A study in 1989 by Fryer and Neering, focused on the minimum amount of caffeine needed for muscle reaction in rats. Their study found that there is a significent difference in caffeine sensitivity between fast and slow twitch muscle fibers. The slow twitch muscle fibers were less sensitive to caffeine than the fast twitch muscle fibers [Fryer: 1989]. Our experiment not only confirms the effects of caffeine on muscles but also looks at caffeine's effects in a broader picture, focusing on the increase in contraction strength for fast and slow twitch muscle fibers at the same time. 
 Further testing can be done with more from legs to minimize the effect of outliers. More specific effects of caffeine on muscle strength, such as endurance could also be tested.
