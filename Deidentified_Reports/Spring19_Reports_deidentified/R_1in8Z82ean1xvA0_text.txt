Title: The effects of injecting acetylcholine raising the voltage potential of the gastrocnemus muscle. 

Abstract:
The gastrocnemus muscle is a skeletal muscle that demonstrates the functions and relationship of how the nervous system and muscular system work together. Acetylcholine (Ach) is a neurotransmitter that is released in the neuromuscular junction which causes the muscle to contract at a certain voltage threshold. This experiment tested to see if an excess amount of acetylcholine would lower the voltage threshold. The controll groups remained under normal conditions and were measured by an electrophysiological recorder in order to find its minimum voltage threshold and then 10 Ml of acetylcholine was injected afterwards and recorded again to see if there was a difference. The results were significent at a p_value of 0.013, so the data shows that an increase in Ach in muscles will increase the voltage threshold. However, the hypothesis states that when acetylcholine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle, the voltage threshold will be lowered because the excess chemical gradient will start an action potential quickly.

Introduction:
In this experiment, we used the legs of Rania pipiens in order to use their thigh muscle, scientifically known as the gastrocnemus muscle, which tested the relationship of the nervous and muscular systems. This was a good organism to experiment on because the thigh muscle presented visual muscle twitches when an electrical stimulus was received, allowing us to see and record voltage threshold. The neuromuscular system have nerves and muscles that work together through electrochemical signaling. They work together because stimuli respond to external and internal factors by sending electrical signals through the nervous system until they reach the muscular system. These electrochemical signals are sent through motor neurons at the neuromuscular junctions. Neurotransmitters called acetylcholine (Ach) are released and complete action potentials by activating sodium and potassium channels, causing the release of calcium ions to contract the muscle. However, when these neurotransmitters are released, the action potential has to reach a minimum voltage potential in order for a muscle to contract. A question arises then is what influences the minimum voltage potential and how can it be lowered? This is important to know because this can alter the voltage threshold of muscle contractions and cause some serious effects such as seizures, performance decrements, or in many cases permanent brain damage [Bhupendra: 2005]. The hypothesis states that if excess acetylcholine is released into the muscles, then the minimum voltage potential will decrease due to the excess chemical gradient that facilitates the action potential.


Materials and Method:
The procedure is done and recorded through the system of iWorx because it acts as an electrophysiological recorder. In this experiment there will be three frog legs that are all kept in room temperature and constantly kept moist with frog Ringer’s solution. Each leg will be set up individually so that the gastrocnemus muscle is raised at a 90-degree angle and that the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve are separated. In order for the procedure to have little error, the sciatic nerve will not come into contact with any metal so that it doesn’t injure the nerve. Each frog leg will be tested for their minimum voltage potential and then they will each be injected with 10 Ml of acetylcholine (Ach) and tested again for the minimum voltage potential to see their differences. When each frog leg is prepared and set up with the gastrocnemus muscle isolated and connected to the force transducer, the frog leg will start at 0.000V and be sent signals at 0.05V increments until each of the minimum voltage thresholds are reached and recorded. The independent variable is the volume of acetylcholine injected into the gastrocnemus muscle and the dependent variable is the minimum voltage potential; this experiment is a one-tailed paired t_test.

Results:
The statistical test used for this experiment was a one-tailed paired t_test because the measurement variable was the voltage threshold and the two categorical variables were the muscles tested with and without excess acetylcholine. The voltages of the experiential and controll groups of frog legs 1 & 2 were very similar, frog leg 3 is an outlier by having a higher voltage for the experimental and controll group (Fig. 1). The lowest voltage threshold with excess acetylcholine was 0.26 V and the lowest without acetylcholine was 0.13 V (Fig. 1). The range of voltage potential in the experimental group was 0.14V and the range of voltage potential in the controll group was 0.08V. The data collected of the controll group compared to the experimental group was statistically significently different (t-value = 8.660254, d.f. = 2, one-tailed p_value = 0.013072).


Discussion:
Based on the experimental results, the hypothesis was not supported because the experimental groups that contained excess acetylcholine (Ach) had a significently larger voltage threshold than predicted compared to the controll group. The p_value shows how the data was significent because it was below 0.05, so the null hypothesis was rejected because the voltage threshold was increased with excess acetylcholine. This does not support previous research because when Ach is infused into the gastrocnemus muscle, the capillary filtration coefficient should have increased which would have increased capillary permeability and therefore increase the blood flow of the neurotransmitters [Kjellmer: 1965]. When these neurotransmitters reach the neuromuscular junctions, the spread of Ach diffusion is lower than the rate of Ach binding to the Ach receptors, showing that when there is excess Ach it should lower the voltage threshold since the cleft will become supersaturated [Matthews-Bellinger: 1978]. The outcome in this experiment could be that since there was excess Ach surrounding the axon terminal of the neuromuscular junction, it had blocked ion channels in order to reset to electrochemical equilibrium for another action potential to occur. In this case, the Ach disrupts the process of chemical and electrical equilibrium for an action potential to occur after the initial threshold was reached. This data found is important to know because Myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease, is due to a shortage of Ach receptors which causes a weakness in skeletal muscles. Theoretically, an excess concentration of Ach should lower the voltage threshold but it is observed that chronic elevations of Ach from organophosphorus poisoning actually results in down-regulations of the Ach receptors [Martyn: 1992]. So according to this research, injecting Ach into the muscle could have cause a degradation of Ach receptors which would have lowered the rate of Ach binding sites and raise the voltage potential for muscle stimuli. This is significent to know because when treating diseases such as Myasthenia gravis, it is important to know how concentrations of Ach and Ach receptors affect muscle regulation and how they can be altered to act normally. Since the data was significent, a hypothesis to test for a future lab could be in testing different concentrations of acetylcholine to inject into the gastrocnemus muscle in order to test which concentration lowers the threshold.

Figure Legends: 
The effect of non-injected and injected (10 Ml) acetylcholine (Ach) on the voltage threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle. The muscles injected with excess Ach had higher voltage thresholds compared to the muscles not injected with the excess neurotransmitter. The lowest voltage threshold with excess acetylcholine was 0.26 V and the lowest without acetylcholine was 0.13 V, a difference of 0.12 V. By having such large differences, the data was significent with a p_value of 0.013. The non-injected muscle acts as the controll group and the injected muscle acts as the experimental group.
