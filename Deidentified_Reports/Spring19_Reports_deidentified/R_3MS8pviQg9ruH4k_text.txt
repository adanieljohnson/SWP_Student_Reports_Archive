Title: An analysis on the contractile strength of a gastrocnemus muscle under the influence of alcohol

Abstract:
Alcohol is known to produce acute lack of coordination and slowness in those who chose to consume it and has been studied at great length in the muscles of rats and frogs as well as humans. The strength of the muscles before and after ethanol is introduce into the system is something that has been studied as a chronic side effect of alcohol use but not an acute one. The acute effects of ethanol are tested on dead and dissected R. pipiens frog legs to determine whether the injection of alcohol into its gastrocnemus muscle causes it to lose its strength. The results of the study show that alcohol does not in fact produce a loss of strength when injected into the muscle. Its effects on nerve conduction were beyond the purview of this study but it is acknowledged that alcohol’s main effect may be on the nervous system. 

Introduction:
Muscles and their performance under the influence of different chemicals is an area of great interest to the scientific community as well as those in  everyday life. When chemicals are introduced into muscle, they can disrupt not only the function of the actin and myosin filaments of the muscle but change how effectively the nervous system is able to communicate an action to the muscle. As such, in order to understand the effects of different chemicals on the muscular system and apply it to the outside world, it is far better to analyze the response of a muscle as it is stimulated from the nerve that enervates it. Because of its relative size and specialization, the gastrocnemus of a Raina pipiens frog can be used [Johnson: 2018]. This muscle is easily separated for analysis and possesses a large tendon, namely the Achilles tendon, to which measurement equipment can be attached without compromising the performance of the muscle. Although ethanol falls under the substances category of depressants, it has actually been shown to decrease the membrane potential at the neuromuscular junction and increase firing rates [knutsson: 1961].  The strength of these contraction has not been studied though, and this is the aim of the experiment. Equally as important as the firing of the muscle is the power with which it contracts. Through the direct stimulation of the sciatic nerve and analysis of the resulting myograms, the hypothesis that the introduction of ethanol into the muscle tissue would reduce the contraction strength of the muscle was tested. 



Materials and Method:
In this experiment, three frog legs were used. Each was properly degloved and placed on the dissection tray. The gastrocnemus muscle in each leg was isolated, and the Achilles tendon cut in such a way so that it was detached for ankle and left at the end of the muscle. The thigh muscles were separated, and the sciatic nerve was isolated with great care so as not to damage it.  A loop of string about 5 cm long was tied around the Achilles tendon and attached at the other end to the measurement equipment. From a previous experiment it had been determined that threshold was at 0.5 amps, and so this was used as the stimulus. The legs were analyzed one at a time, and while one was being analyzed, the other two were maintained moist with frog ringer’s solution about every five minutes. Each leg was stimulated from the sciatic nerve a total of 8 times while pinned to the dissection tray and the amplitude of each myogram was recorded. The leg was then injected with 0.2 Ml of ethanol along the muscle. The 2 Ml were evenly distributed along four points on the muscle, and it was left at rest for 8 minutes so that the ethanol could take effect. At the end of these 8 minutes the fine adjustment knob on the measurement equipment was used so that the tension in the string would be the same as it was before the injection. The leg was again stimulated 8 times at the threshold level and the amplitudes were recorded. The leg was disposed of and the next one hooked up to the apparatus. At the end of the procedure, a paired t_test was used to determine whether the differences between the amplitudes pre and post treatment were statistically significent. 



Results:
All three legs behaved slightly differently. While one seemed to show marked improvement in its contracting strength, another improved only by a little and the third in fact got worse. The results are summarized in figure 1. All three had visible twitching at the impulse and were of approximately the same size. None of the legs reached anywhere near tetany and were in fact very consistent throughout the trial. Furthermore, it was observed that the legs which had more active reactions to their nerves being touched with forceps during the preparation also had on average a higher amplitude compared to the other legs, regardless of the alcohol treatment. After analysis of the data with a paired t_test, it was determined that the mean difference between the muscle’s contractile strength before and after the treatment of the muscle with ethanol was not statistically different (t_stat = 1.00, d.f. = 2, P = 0.42).

Discussion:
These results oppose known effects of chronic alcohol use. Interestingly, while it seems that chronic alcohol use causes muscle weakness [Marquez: 2004], as seen by this study, acute alcohol effects on muscle do not affect its ability to contract with the same amount of force. This then suggests that ethanol’s main effect on the neuromuscular system is in the transfer/reception of a nerve impulse into the muscle at an endplate. Studies have shown that ethanol inhibits many ion pumps [Reuben: 1975]. Because the nerve was not at all injected with ethanol, the possibility that ethanol acts also on the neurons themselves was not studied and should be looked into further with subsequent studies. It should also be noted that this experiment differed in two very important ways from that of live muscle. The first is that these frog legs did not have an active metabolism and were thus unable to metabolize the ethanol that was injected into them. Had the legs been attached to fully functioning frogs, the effects of the study, if any, would have been different than those seen in this experiment. Second and more importantly, the concentration and relative volume compared to the mass of the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle was significently higher than would be encountered by humans in real life. In fact, simulating this amount of ethanol in a human would probably be fatal. The effects of a realistic amount of alcohol in an alive subject should be studied.
