Title: Influence of Increased Juvenile Hormone Quantities on the Growth and Development of Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone known to influence the life cycle some insects, such as Manduca Sexta. The influence of JH is tested by artificially increasing levels of the hormone in Manduca Sexta caterpillars by adding excesses to a food supply. Weight gain correlates to progression in the Manduca Sexta life cycle, so the weights of eight Manduca Sexta are measured over twelve days. The results of the hormone’s effect are compared to a control group and it is determined that JH is effective at stagnating the Manduca Sexta life cycle and development. This is concept is important to understanding the effects and influence of other hormones in varying organisms such as humans.

Introduction:
Just like humans and all other complex life, insects rely on hormones to signal biological change for survival. Hormones can serve various biological functions such as altering heart rate, stimulating sexual development, inducing growth, or signaling for progression of an organism’s life cycle. The hormones that influence insects such as Manduca Sexta are different than those of other organisms, but they serve many of the same purposes. One hormone that is very important to Manduca Sexta is Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH functions with other hormones to determine when Manduca Sexta should progress through their life cycle and pupate. When in a specific ratio to other hormones, JH will prompt Manduca Sexta to enter a commitment pulse in which they can no longer remain in its juvenile state and will be forced to grow as a result. Many case studies have been done to observe JH’s effect on Manduca Sexta when they are in a larval state, and it is often determined that the JH in Manduca Sexta typically follows a pattern that, if disrupted, also disrupts the normal life cycle of the organism [Nijhout: 1982]. The following experiment was devised to compare the weight change of two groups of Manduca Sexta that were treated in nearly identical conditions over time: one group had artificially increased JH levels from outside influence, and one was a control group that was no given addition hormones. It was determined that if Manduca Sexta are exposed to an excess of Juvenile Hormone, then the progression through their expected life cycle will stagnate and they will remain in their juvenile state with little change in weight.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca Sexta in larval stages were selected from a large group. Each caterpillar was assigned to an isolated section of a plastic container and place in an incubator for ease of identification and to reduce room for error from confounding variables. Each day, all caterpillars had waste removed from their plastic container, had their weights recorded, and then was supplied with 10g of the same food supply. The only variable in this experiment was that an experimental group of four of the eight caterpillars regularly had six drops of JH added to their daily 10g food supply. This routine continued for 12 days, and all data on the caterpillar weights was collected in a spreadsheet. The average weights for each control and experimental group were then applied to a two-tailed two-sample t-test to determine if the difference in weight changes was significant from a P value of 0.05.

Results:
The average gain in Manduca Sexta weight over twelve days in each control group was 8.895g, but the experimental groups saw little change over the same time at 3.193g on average. The health of the experimental caterpillars quickly deteriorated and resulted in 3 of the 4 experimental caterpillars dying by the end of the experiment. This issue was not present in the control caterpillars. Upon doing a two-tailed two-sample t-test for the completed data, the t-value, degrees freedom, and P value were determined as (2.660, 6, 0.037). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that artificially increased JH levels in Manduca Sexta caterpillars affects development based on weight change is supported by this experiment because the average weight change of control-group caterpillars over the experiment is significantly larger than that of the experimental group. This claim can be verified by the P value, which was calculated the be below the required 0.05 value at 0.037. The influence of JH limiting life cycle progressing in Manduca Sexta seems entirely possible from these results, as the large difference in weight change between groups implies that the control group was able to grow larger and progress more through the life cycle than the experimental group. However, potential issues were present throughout the experiment. For example, three of the four experimental caterpillars died during the experiment which removed their capacity to gain or lose weight. These experimental caterpillars were previously in healthy condition but may have died from complications due to excessive JH causing developmental issues. This alternate result from JH may have yielded the same results that we expected, but it involved results that were not expected such as caterpillars dying. Other studies and experiments have also determined that excessive presence of JH can actually stimulate growth in Manduca Sexta rather than decreasing growth like this experiment found [Rountree: 1986]. Other studies have also found been subject to similar results of increased morality in different species of caterpillar due to increased JH levels causing improper development [Wellington: 1969]. To increase the accuracy and precision of results with this experiment in the future, it would be ideal to repeat the experiment with many more groups of caterpillars that were carefully raised and monitored earlier in their life as to prevent preexisting health issues from killing caterpillars or disrupting the data. It would also be ideal to prolong the experiment for more than 12 days. Proving the influence of insect hormones such as JH has the potential to increase understanding in human hormones and how to utilize them better in fields such as medicine.

Figure 1: Graph of Average Weight Change in Control and Experimental Groups. The blue bar represents the control groups, and the red represents the experimental groups. The change in control weights is shown to be much greater than experimental groups. The fact that the error bars do not overlap is evidence that the results of the experiment were significant.
