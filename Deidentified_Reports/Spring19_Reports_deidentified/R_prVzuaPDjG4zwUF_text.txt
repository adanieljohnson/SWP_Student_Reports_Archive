Title: Manipulation of commitment pulse by the increase of Juvenile Hormone in the diet of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Pesticides harm the environment; therefore, non-toxic pest controll is becoming increasingly more desirable for businesses. Hormones influence insect development, therefore, in controllling these hormones was can manipulate the life cycle of pests, such as Manduca Sexta, a type of moth. By manipulating hormones such as Juvenile Hormones (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E), we can modify the development of these insects, specifically delaying or inhibiting the commitment pulse so that the larvae never become adult moths. We increased JH levels by adding PreCore, a JH mimic, into the insects’ diet. The two groups, controll and treatment, each contained three caterpillars. The treatment group received PreCore in their food and the controll group received distilled water. The mean mass of the controll group was 6.75g with a standard deviation of 3.29g, whereas the mean mass of the treatment group was 6.17g with a standard deviation of 3.12g. Our p_value was 0.6379. Our data was not statistically significent; therefore, our hypothesis was not supported. Further studies could include experimental groups containing more subjects or the addition of more growth hormone, JH, to potentially cause a greater effect in the developmental cycle such as delaying or not allowing the commitment pulse to occur

Introduction:
In this experiment, the focus is on Manduca Sexta [Johnson: 2016], a type of moth. The M. Sexta have a lifecycle of 39-44 days. In this lab, we are looking specifically at two types of hormones that influence the insect’s development. These hormones are essential for physical changes in the insect including molting, which is the transition into an adult. Molting is when the old outer layer of skin is shed and replaced by a new outer layer of cuticle. Insect molting and metamorphosis are governed by the ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone (JH) with ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) orchestrating the molting process and JH determining the nature of the molt [Riddiford: 2003]. We are analyzing JH and 20E. The combination of these two hormones are vital for life and they work hand-in-hand to controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis in M. Sexta. At different stages in development, the levels of these hormones fluctuate, but it is important to note that both of these hormones are always present, just in different concentrations at any given period during development. One of the most important stages in development is known as the commitment pulse. This is the larval-pupal transformation of M. sexta. which results specifically from exposure to ecdysteroids in the absence of juvenile hormone. This is followed by a larger exposure to ecdysteroid and then a reappearance of juvenile hormone [Weeks: 1986]. The commitment pulse is produced when the insect’s body has determined that it is large enough and has enough nutrients to pupate and transition into an averagely sized moth. In our particular experiment, we are manipulating JH by increasing its level using PreCore. PreCore is an insect growth regulator (IGR) and it mimics JH. We are looking to determine the effects of increased JH in the development of M. Sexta., especially its effects on the commitment pulse. Will the commitment pulse be delayed or occur prematurely due to the manipulation of JH? Will the size of the insect be influenced in any way if a major developmental hormone is manipulated? In order to study the effects of PreCore, we will be adding six drops of PreCore to the diet of the treatment group of the insects. We hypothesize that if we add PreCore to the diet of the insect subsequently increasing JH levels, then the growth of the insect will be affected by causing the insects to reach the commitment pulse later and pupating into larger sized adults. Our independent variable is the PreCore and the dependent variable is the resulting weight of each insect. The significance of this study has to do with the growing desire to be able to controll the population of pests in a non-toxic manner. Pesticides pose harmful threats to the environment, aquatic life, and humans.These insect growth regulators (IGRs) are beneficial because they are non-toxic insecticides that do not adversely harm the environment. These IGRs can be used for agricultural or everyday purposes.  

Materials and Method:
Caterpillars were divided into two groups of three. One group was the treatment and the other group was the controll. Each caterpillar was weighed in grams using a standard lab balance, and the weight was recorded. In order to separate the caterpillars two containers each containing four cells were used. There was a hole punctured in each cell to allow air flow from inside the cell with the outside environment. One caterpillar was placed in each cell, with one cell left to spare in each of the two containers. On day one each caterpillar was fed 10g of food which was placed in the cell with the caterpillar. The food was weighed using a standard lab balance. After the food was placed in the cell, six drops of water were added to the food of the controll group caterpillars using a pipette. Then six drops of Precor, a JH mimic, was added to the food of the treatment group. The caterpillars were stored in a refrigerator at 25 degrees Celsius. We monitored the weight and overall growth of the caterpillars for a 14-day period with the weight of each caterpillar taken every two days. The food was also changed to a fresh 10g with the addition of water or Precor depending on the group. In order to present our data summarized instead of raw, we calculated the mean percent change in weight of the controll and treatment groups. The statistical method used was a 2-sample t_test, which means that we compared data from two different groups, the controll group and the treatment group.

Results:
After the 14- day experimental period, we averaged the weight of the caterpillars in each group. The mean of the mass in grams of the controll group of caterpillars was 6.75g, with a standard deviation of 3.29g. The mean of the mass in grams of the treatment group of caterpillars was 6.17g. with a standard deviation 3.12g. The mean percent change for the controll group was 791% (Fig. 1) with a standard deviation of 273% (Fig. 1). The mean percent change for the treatment group was 834% (Fig. 1) with a standard deviation of 303% (Fig. 1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results and found that P = 0.6379 and a t-value of 0.474. When observing the physical characteristics of the caterpillars on the last day, the difference in their size was not inherently visible.

Discussion:
Based on the data collected, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistical difference between the controll group and the treatment group. Our hypothesis stated that, if we add PreCore to the diet of the caterpillar, which is, in turn, increasing the levels of JH, then the caterpillar’s growth will be affecting by delaying the commitment pulse and causing the caterpillar to turn into a larger adult. However, this hypothesis could not be supposed based on the mean weight of the controll group and the treatment group. The commitment to pupal differentiation required ecdysteroids in the absence of JH [Weeks: 1986], however, in our treatment group JH was not absent due to the addition of PreCore, therefore, this statement cannot be fully true. It is possible that the increased level of JH in the caterpillar’s diet was not a significent enough amount to delay the commitment pulse and cause the caterpillars to mature into larger adults. The p_value was high, which supports the conclusion that the data is not statistically significent, and no conclusive statement can be drawn from the increased JH levels in the caterpillar’s diet. In another experiment where 20E was manipulated instead of JH, they found that when they tested larvae at different ages they molted prematurely when fed an analogue of ecdysteroid [Ismail: 2000]. A flaw in this experiment could be the number of caterpillars that we had. The experimental groups were so small in number that even if there was one outlier all the data would be skewed. If we were to retest this exact hypothesis under all the same conditions an improvement would be to make the experimental groups larger so that it would be clearer if there was an effect on the caterpillar’s development when JH levels are increased. The hope of this experiment was to be able to find a way to manipulate the development of pests, such as M. Sexta, using non-toxic method such as IGR, however, we have determined that our data is inconclusive. This means that we cannot definitively say that increasing the levels of JH in M. Sexta will prevent them from pupating into moths.
