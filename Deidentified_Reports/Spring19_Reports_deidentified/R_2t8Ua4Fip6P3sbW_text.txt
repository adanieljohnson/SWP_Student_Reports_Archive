Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta Development 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillar’s growth cycle and development are dependent upon both Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). 20E triggers the timing that the larvae will molt; whereas, JH determines the type of molt. So, this lab tested the effects of excess JH on the development of Manduca sexta on a controllled and experimented group. JH was added to the diets of the experimental group. It was hypothesized that by increasing the amount of JH given to the caterpillars there will be a decrease in average final weight. Thusly, the hypothesis was rejected based upon the outcome of the experiment and data analysis determining that there were no significent differences in weight. So, the experimental groups final average weight did not decrease in comparison to the controlls final average weight.

Introduction:
The purpose of this insect hormone experiment is to test and determined the result of JH (Juvenile Hormone) via JH analogue (precor 1: 1250); similar to an insect growth regulator (IGR), on two groups of four larvae Manduca sexta caterpillars that are 11-12 days old. Over their life period, the caterpillars will go through various molting periods triggered by their hormone Ecdysterone (20E). Then in its life cycle, JH will trigger the type of molt in development once the 20E triggers a molt. In other research, it was determined that “JH plays a key role in the development of insects from embryo to adult” [Sanburg: 1975]. So, if JH is high it will prevent it from a “normal” molt, and it will enter another instar rather than a pupa. However, in the presence of high JH, it can also cause the caterpillars abnormalities that reduce their insect survival rate via low egg hatch rate and especially by inhibiting and limiting maturation [Lab Manual: 2018]. Ergo, by increasing the amount of JH given to the caterpillars there will be a decrease in their average final weight.

Materials and Method:
The eight Manduca sexta caterpillars approximately 12 days old and 1.5 – 2.5 grams in weight were divided into two groups of four. Then they were placed into two four-cell containers with air holes and kept in a controllled environment (incubator 28˚C with constant light). Two diets were derived for the two groups. Diet one was a controll diet where Four caterpillars receive 10g of Manduca sexta food plus 60 microliters of water each. Then diet two was given to an experimental group of four caterpillars that received 10g of Manduca sexta food plus 60 microliters of JH analogue (precor 1: 1250) each (refilling daily due to low food and dehydration). The weights and observations were recorded daily over the course of the experiment (11 days). Once all the data was collected an average growth was calculated and a two-sample t_test was conducted to analyze the data and outcome.

Results:
The average mean weight growth of the controll group was 0.7465 grams per day, while the experimental group was found to be 0.7425 grams per day (Fig 1). So, to properly analyze the results a two-sample t test was ran which concluded that due to the p_value being 0.475 which is greater than 0.05 the results are not statistically significent. This depicted that the results from the average of the final weight of the controll group was not statistically different from the experimental group.

The beginning of the first week the observations depicted that the controll and experimental groups were growing at a steady rate with the controll group growing at a faster rate. Both of the groups were also a greenish blue color and produced a substantial amount of fecal matter daily. However, towards the end of week one and start of week two the controll group became more sluggish and lethargic while also seeming to turn orangish brown in color and recoiled into themselves but slowed in their weight gain. On the other side the experimental group was gaining weight at a consistently slow rate. They also required more replenishment of their food and clean up in their container dependent upon the amount consumed as they grew. The experimental also began to get a slight orangish color change towards the last day of the experiment  


Discussion:
Analysis of the results and observation offered insight into trends seen throughout the experiment. The hypothesis stated that by increasing the amount of JH given to the caterpillars there will be a decrease in average final weight. However, this alternative hypothesis was rejected, and the null hypothesis was then accepted. This was rejected because the data analysis was determined to be not statistically significent at 0.05. Although, the lab noticed that there was a slight inhibition in the growth weight and molting process due to the JH; however, the number of caterpillars going into a molting phase was higher in the controll and not present in the experimental group at all. So, the JH seemed to slightly inhibit the commitment pulse in the experimental group resulting in no molting to occurring. “Thus, the intermolt change in the lamellar assembly process appears to result from hormone-induced changes in cuticular protein synthesis” [Wolfgang: 1986] So, in essence there was some differences between the controll and experimental groups; however, the differences were deemed not statistically significent enough thus rejecting the alternative hypothesis and affirming the null hypothesis. This occurred most likely because there was not sufficient JH added to the food source for the Manduca sexta larvae. The JH can affect the larvae ability to pupate. Ergo, if the lab had administered more JH droplets to the larvae food than the hypothesis would have been more successful because there would have been a greater difference created.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The figure represents the average growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars over the period of 11 days with the controll group (blue bar) and experimental group (orange bar). Each bar is the mean daily growth weight of four caterpillars from each controll and experiment group. This was derived from the average growth each day of the controll and experimental group and then each group added up and each divided by the 11 day period. The error bars represent the ±1 standard deviation of the data*************************************************************************
