Title: The Effect of a Calcium Channel Blocker on Frog Muscle Contractions

Abstract:
Rania pipiens are commonly utilized when experimenting with muscle contraction, since the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve are easy to isolate. In this experiment, we will be isolating the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg, and evaluating the power of the muscle’s contractions. The first trial will be just the muscle, and the second trial will include a calcium channel blocker injected into the muscle, to understand how calcium affects the intensity of muscle contraction.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the basic properties of neuromuscular controll. The complex nerve communications within muscles send movement throughout the entire body. Skeletal muscles are activated by the motor neurons in the spinal cord. The motor neurons receive stimuli from outside sources with thus trigger an action potential which travel down the axon of a neuron. This action potential releases a chemical called acetylcholine, which depolarizes the cell [Science News: 1975], and allows for calcium channels to open and calcium to flow into the sarcoplasmic reticulum; then into the sarcomere. Once in the sarcomere, the calcium binds to troponin on the tropomyosin filaments, which exposes the actin binding sites for the myosin heads. The myosin heads bind, and a power stroke causes the muscle to contract. ATP breaks down and removes the calcium, which puts the muscle into a relaxation phase [Needham: 1950], as the sarcomere resets for another contraction. It is possible to change the contractile force, by stimulating different numbers of motor neurons with varying powers of electrical currents. A calcium channel blocker will be injected into the muscle in order to evaluate the effect it has on contractile force. Groups of drugs such as these have been known to inhibit muscle contraction [Fanta C. H: 1983]. It is expected that if the calcium channels are blocked, the contraction of the muscle will be much weaker, since the calcium will not be able to bind to the troponin, and myosin will then not bind to the actin. 

Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, two frog legs were given, and the legs were degloved, to expose the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve. The gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve were isolated, and the gastrocnemus was cut from its insertion point. Once cut, a string was tied to the end of the gastrocnemus and then tied into a loop and suspended from a stand, putting the muscle at a 90 degree angle, while the leg of the frog remained on the ground. Probes that were connected to a machine that delivers electrical currents, were stuck into the muscle. The muscle received 500 mV of power three times. The results were recorded each time, then the mean between the three were found. This was repeated for three different from legs. Then, a solution that blocks the calcium channels in the muscle was injected. After 5 minutes, the electricity machine was turned on, and the muscle received 500 mV of power three times again. The reactions were recorded all three times, for each leg. The mean was calculated for each leg. 

Results:
After performing the various trials, we concluded that our data was significent. The force of contraction for the muscles that received the calcium channel blocker was much lower than the muscles that did not receive anything. The mean for the muscles before receiving the calcium blocker was 513, whereas the mean for the muscles with the calcium blocker was 58. It is evident that these numbers are drastically different, and concludes that the calcium blocker did exactly we thought it would. The standard deviation for the muscle with no blocker was 27.0, and the standard error was 5.2. For the muscle that had the blocker injected, the standard deviation was 32.4, and the standard error was 5.7. Due to these results and a significent p_value, our hypothesis was supported. We did a paired t_test with our data, since the results were expected to go in one direction, and only two things were being compared. Our p_value was 0.008095, which is well below 0.05, thus making it significent. These results are plausible, because the calcium channel blockers did indeed block the contractions of the muscle, and the calcium was unable to bind in the sarcomere. 


Discussion:
We noticed that our p_value was well below 0.05, which makes it a statistically significent number. The calcium channel blocker inhibited the calcium channel blocker from binding to the troponin [Fanta C.H.: 1983], thus the contraction was unable to occur. This was exhibited in our experiment, and the muscle contraction was much less powerful than without the blocker. These results ultimately supported our hypothesis, and prevented the muscle from contracting.
