Title: The Effect of an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) in the Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta are a type of moth species and are the main focus of this experiment due to their distinct, and observable, physical changed between the larvae and pupa stage.  An Insect Growth Hormone (IGR), Precor, is used to manipulate these changes.  It was expected that caterpillars would increase in both weight and length when given their food with an additional five drops of Precor.  Our data did not show any statistical difference in weight and length when the Precor was added to the caterpillar food.  This demonstrated that IGR had no impact on weight and length, which may be due to it having a greater effect on the internal progression of larvae stage to pupa stage rather than physical changes.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta caterpillars, also known as tobacco hornworms, are a species of moth and go through five larval instar stages of development before the process of pupation begins. Before reaching their fifth larval instar, Manduca sexta have an increase in Juvenile Hormone [Nijhout: 1975]. Juvenile Hormone (JH) is one of the essential hormones in Manduca sexta; it regulates the type of molting during development and when it is altered, either increased or decreased, it causes a significant change in the organism.  This effect is either be a delayed larvae stage or an accelerated pupation rate.  Before reaching pupation, Manduca sexta caterpillars will often show an increase in weight, about 5 grams [Riddiford: 2003].  In this experiment, Manduca sexta caterpillars are used to evaluate their change in weight and length when given the Insect Growth Regulator, Precor.  IGR is an alternative to Juvenile Hormone (JH).  Therefore, it is implied that if the Manduca sexta caterpillar receive 5 drops of the IGR, Precor, then their weight and length will increase more than caterpillars without it.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were randomly selected and separated into two groups of four.  The groups were put into two separate four-cell containers; each cell contained one caterpillar and its food.  The caterpillars in Group 1 (control) were given 10 grams of caterpillar food mixed with distilled water.  In Group 2, each caterpillar was given 10 grams of caterpillar food mixed with 5 drops of the juvenile hormone (JH), Precor.  For two weeks, the weight (g) and length (mm) of the caterpillars were recorded daily with a ruler and gram scale.  In addition to the measurements, the food was refilled in the same manner and any feces in the cells was cleaned out.  When we were not refilling their food or cleaning out their cells, both groups of caterpillars were placed into a 25°C incubator.  A one-tailed t-test was used to analyze the data in both the control and experimental group.  A P-value for both the weight and length was recorded; the P-value for weight was 0. 4894 and the P-value for the length was 0. 4849.

Results:
In the control group, the mean weight was 6.59g and the mean weight for the experimental group was 6.63g.  The mean length for the control group was 6.69mm and the mean length for the experimental group was 6.67mm.  The mean of the weight in the control group was not statistically significantly different than the mean weight of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.0269, df = 26, P = 0.4894) [Fig. 1].  The mean length of the control group was also not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.0381, df = 26, P = 0.4849) [Fig. 2].  On day 9, one of the caterpillars in the experimental group died.  In the final ten days, the caterpillars began to lose weight [Fig. 1]. 

Discussion:
The majority of hormones in Manduca sexta are meant to assist in certain stages of development, such as growth.  Our hypothesis stated that when given a couple of drops of an IGR, the caterpillars would increase in both weight and length.  During the span of two weeks, we observed that there was no significant difference in the change in weight and length, meaning our hypothesis was not supported.  We observed that both the control and the treatment group were increasing in weight and length at about the same rate, implying that the IGR has little to no effect on their physical development; however, we did note that the caterpillars in the control group pupated before those in the treatment group, suggesting that it may have more of an effect on the larvae and pupa stage development.  It is often noted that most species exposed to an IGR will respond to it by having either a delayed or accelerated stage development [Staal: 1975].  On the final day, three of the four caterpillars in the control group pupated, while the other turned a darker color.  Caterpillars 5, 6, and 8 were a pale blue color, compared to their counterparts (caterpillars 1, 2, 3, and 4) that were green, and turgid.  This shows that the IGR had no external or physical effect on the treatment group in comparison to the control group.  There may have been sources of error when measuring the caterpillars’ length; it was noted when the caterpillars were more relaxed, they would extend their bodies further, but this would not always happen.
