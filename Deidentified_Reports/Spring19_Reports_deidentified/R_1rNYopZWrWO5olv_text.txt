Title: The Addition of Ecdysterone Blocker In Manduca Sexta Diet and Its Effects on Growth and Development

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta, known as the tobacco hornworm, is a moth that inhabits most of the Americas. Throughout its larval stage and into pupation, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdeysterone (20E) affect growth and development 20E controls the timing of development and it spikes before every developmental stage, such as in between the fourth to fifth larval stages. This experiment will give 20E blocker to Manduca Sexta larvae and follow its effects. With this blocker in the food, it is expected that the experimental group will continue to function without ever reach their commitment pulse and developing into the pupal stage. 8 Manduca Sexta larva weighing 1.25-6 grams each were selected to be a part of the trial, All in the larval stages and pre-commitment pulse. 4 of the larvae were put in the experimental group, where 10 drops of 20E inhibitor was added per 10 g of food and the control group was given regular food mixed with a little water to prevent the food from drying and better resemble the food of the experimental group. Throughout the experiment, the experimental group’s weight varied very little, especially compared to the control group. The 20E blocker worked, as it made a difference in the weight and development of the larvae, but the difference was not statistically significant. T

Introduction:
The spike seen in the weight of the control group in Figure 1.  is most likely associated with the commitment pulse, as they immediately lost weight following the spike, which is consistent with the fact that Manduca Sexta lose weight right before pupation. Ultimately, while the hypothesis is supported, the null hypothesis could not be rejected through statistics.

Manduca Sexta, known as the tobacco hornworm, is a moth that inhabits most of the Americas. It is known as a pest in tobacco country, as it can destroy the crop during its larval stage. It is commonly used in biological laboratories as an experimental organism due to its accessible nervous system. Manduca Sexta also has a short lifespan and can easily be raised on a simple wheat-germ diet. Throughout its larval stage and into pupation, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdeysterone (20E) affect growth and development. 20E controls the timing of development and it spikes before every developmental stage, such as in between the fourth to fifth larval stages and before the pupal stage, known as the commitment pulse. A study aimed at stopping Manduca Sexta destruction of tobacco plants used hormone inhibitors to prevent larva growth [Johnson 1989]. The experiment applied inhibitors with the idea that growth would be stopped and therefore plant destruction as well. This experiment will apply the same idea (hormone inhibition) to halt the development of Manduca Sexta larva by adding 20E inhibitors to their diet. With this blocker in the food, it is expected that the experimental group will continue to function without ever reach their commitment pulse and developing into the pupal stage. 

Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca Sexta larva weighing 1.25-6 grams each were selected to be a part of the trial. All larvae were in the larval stages and pre-commitment pulse. 4 of the larvae were put in the experimental group, where 10 drops of 20E inhibitor was added per 10 g of food. The control group was given regular food mixed with a little water to prevent the food from drying and better resemble the food of the experimental group. Both groups were fed on an as-need basis. The larvae were kept in plastic containers with holes for air and put in an incubator that maintained a temperature of 28 degrees Celsius. Cages were also cleaned as needed. The larvae were weighed every day for 12 days and observations were taken daily as well. A T-Test was used to determine statistical significance of data collected on the difference in weight of the two groups and a p-value determined to see if the null hypothesis could be rejected. Weight is being used as an indication of development, as throughout the larval stages and into the pupal stage, weight is gained and then lost. Therefore, if there is a significant difference in weight gained or lost, there is most likely a difference in the development of the larvae [due to the independent variable (20E Blocker)]. 

Results:
The standard deviation of Figure 1. was 1.96. Both of the groups start with an average weight similar to each other, but the weight increase and then decrease is much more drastic in the control group, indicating that the independent variable is most likely responsible for some change in the development. Figure 2. further shows there was a difference in weight gained, a sign of difference in development, between the two groups. Figure 2. had a t-value of 1.72, a two-tailed p-value of 0.137 and a one-tailed p-value of 0.0685. The degrees of freedom in Figure 2. was 6. Ultimately, because the p-values were over 0.05, the statistics cannot reject the null hypothesis. The statistics support the alternative hypothesis, but it cannot be verified due to the chance the statistics are not from two completely different data sets. 

Observations were also taken over the trial and this qualitative data can be used to analyze the hypothesis as well. Throughout the experiment, the experimental group’s weight varied very little, especially compared to the control group. It was also noted that throughout the whole experiment, the control group was more active than the experimental group. Around day 3, the control group began to change color, turning lighter. Then, around day 6 the control group began to turn brown before beginning to pupate on day 8. While the control group experienced much change in coloration, it was noted that the experimental group maintained it green color


Discussion:
The 20E blocker worked, as it made a difference in the weight and development of the larvae. The control group made it to the pupation stage, while the experimental group did not, maintaining a similar weight and color throughout the trial. Statistics indicate a difference between the two groups in the average weight gained and average weight over the whole trial, but are not different enough from each other to reject the null hypothesis. However, more important than the weight statistics is the fact that the experimental group never reached its commitment pulse and pupal stage, suggesting the correctness of the alternate hypothesis, that the experimental group will not reach its commitment pulse. The large spike seen in the weight of the control group in Figure 1. is most likely associated with the commitment pulse, as they immediately lost weight following the spike, which is consistent with the fact that Manduca Sexta lose weight right before pupation. This is further backed by our observations that caterpillars pupated shortly after the loss in weight. The success of the hormone inhibitor can lead into further study of inhibition in Manduca Sexta. Another hormone associated with development in Manduca Sexta is Juvenile Hormone (JH). A study has looked at the effects of this hormone in Drosophila melanogaster and indicates that the absence and increase of JH affects development. This supports this trial’s hypothesis, as it has been suggested that varying levels of a hormone related to growth and development affects how an organism develops. Further, there is the possibility of further study with this hormone in Manduca Sexta, as experimental framework has already been laid out, just for a different species. [Riddiford: 2003].

Figure 1. Weights of caterpillars in Control and Experimental groups averaged over trial period. The control group and experimental groups both gained and then loss weight, but the control group experienced a much more dramatic change throughout the 12 days, indicating a difference in development between the two groups.

Figure 2. Average Percent Weight Change of Each Group. The experimental group’s (in blue) average maximum weight was about 160% greater than their starting weights. The control group experienced a greater increase, as their maximum weights averaged to be about 265% greater than the starting weights. The error bars show that there is a difference in the data.
