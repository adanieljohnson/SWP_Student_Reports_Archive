Title: Effects of increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the photosynthetic activity of Brassica oleracea var. viridis chloroplasts

Abstract:
CO2 is an essential reactant in the process of photosynthesis. As the CO2 levels in the atmosphere rise at an alarming rate, it is essential that the effects of elevated CO2 concentration on plants is examined. In this experiment, we look at the rate of photosynthetic processes in the chloroplasts of Brassica oleracea var. viridis in response to the addition of carbonated water. We hypothesized that the additional CO2 from carbonated water would increase activity of Photosystem II in the chloroplasts due to the added demand for ATP in carbon fixation reactions in the presence of more reactant. Absorbance values were recorded throughout a 30-minute DCIP decolorization assay among four groups, in which the controll group did not receive carbonated water, while the three experimental groups received varying amounts of the treatment. After applying statistical analysis, our data did not demonstrate a significent difference between the percent change in absorbance between the groups, despite visual trends observed in the raw data and the graphs.

Introduction:
Plants require photosynthesis to produce glucose molecules from carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Environmental conditions, such as the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, influence production of glucose in the process of photosynthesis [Erwin: 2017]. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is currently the highest it has been over the past 26 million years and is expected to double within this century [Long: 2004]. With the rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it is important to investigate the effects of excess carbon dioxide on photosynthesis in plants. In the Calvin cycle, ATP generated from the light-dependent reactions, are used in carbon fixation reactions joining CO2 to 5-carbon ribulose to synthesize glucose. Higher levels of CO2 have been demonstrated to stimulate photosynthetic activity due to the CO2 fertilization effect [Kirschbaum: 2011].  It is expected that supplementary amounts of CO2 may increase the rate of carbon fixation reactions and consume higher levels of ATP, which will accelerate activity in the light-dependent reactions in efforts to produce sufficient ATP. The topic of interest of this experiment is the effects of elevated levels of CO2 in plant photosynthesis. The kale plant, or Brassica oleracea var. viridis, is the model organism in this experiment because it is a leafy green vegetable that has become increasingly popular among U.S. consumers. Kale consumption among all populations was reported to have a gain of +1 annual eatings per capita from 2009 to 2014 [Produce for Better Health Foundation: 2015]. In the U.S., the total number of farms harvesting the kale plant more than doubled from 954 in 2007 to 2,500 in 2012 [USDA: 2014]. With the number of kale consumers and kale producing farms increasing in the U.S., it is crucial to understand how the rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere will influence the photosynthetic processes of kale plants. We hypothesized that if carbonated water is applied to the chloroplasts of the Brassica oleracea var. viridis, the rate of photosynthesis will increase.

Materials and Method:
2 ground leaves of Brassica oleracea var. viridis were used to test our hypothesis. The experiment requires the enrichment of chloroplast through differential centrifugation [Johnson: 2019a]. All steps of the protocol were completed with the exception of checking the samples for relative chloroplast density. The 20 Ml of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8 and the final enriched chloroplast were stored on ice to be maintained. Photosystem II activity in the chloroplast was measured through the Hill reaction using a DCIP decolorization assay [Johnson: 2019b]. One controll group and three experimental groups were compared, with experimental groups receiving 5 µL, 6 µL, or 7 µL of carbonated water. Key reagents required for the assay were 24 Ml of 130 mM 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) and 26 Ml of 100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5. Initial absorbance value was taken for all samples at time zero. All samples were placed under a grow light for 10 minutes before absorbance values were taken at 10-minute, 20-minute, and 30-minute time points. Percent change between absorbances at each time point and time zero was calculated. An ANOVA test and Tukey-Kramer test were used to determine differences in percent change between the controll group and the experimental groups.

Results:
There was no significent difference (P = 0.413) in the average percent change of absorbance between the four groups (Fig. 1). When observing the raw data for absorbance values, we noticed a trend of decreasing absorbance throughout the 30-minute period for the experimental groups treated with carbonated water, while the absorbance values for the controll group remained stable during the 30-minute period. The final average percent change after 30 minutes for the controll group was observed to be less than the experimental groups (Fig. 2).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis stated that the presence of excess carbon dioxide would increase photosynthetic activity. In our results, the absorbance values between each experimental group demonstrated a decrease after every 10-minute interval, demonstrating higher photosynthetic activity among the groups that received excess carbon dioxide. However, based on the statistical tests applied to our data, we did not calculate a significent difference between the percent change in absorbance of the controll and experimental groups. Our raw data and the trends in our graphs demonstrate a practical significance that is worth further investigation. As leafy green vegetable options such as kale become more popular due to the reported nutritional benefits, it is necessary to understand role of increased CO2 in the growth of such plants due to potential benefits in maximizing photosynthesis processes [Erwin: 2017]. However, it has also been demonstrated that elevated CO2 concentrations can cause nutrient decline in crops due to nutrient allocation during photosynthesis [McGrath: 2013]. Such nutrients include key minerals that are at the base of human nutrition, indicating the urgency of the current high levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration [Loladze: 2014].  If we were to repeat the experiment, we propose increasing the number of biological replicants and increasing the length of time in conducting the DCIP decolorization assays to allow reactions to run towards completion. We also propose measuring Photosystem I activity and Calvin Cycle activity in response to the addition of CO2. These adjustments may yield statistical results that reflect the trends that are currently visible and offer insight into the role of CO2 on specific photosynthetic processes.
