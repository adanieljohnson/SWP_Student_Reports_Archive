Title: The Effects of Acetylcholinesterase on the Onset of Tetany in Muscles 

Abstract:
In this experiment, my group and I will examine the effects of 100 mm of 2% Sevin, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg.  We hypothesize that if we inject 100 mm of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (2% Sevin) into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg, the muscle will reach tetany sooner and at a lower frequency than normal.  We were able to observe this by separating the sciatic nerve from the leg and using an iWorx electrophysiological recorder and data analysis software to record electromyograms, we monitored the muscle contractions along with when the muscles reached tetany.  We will explain how our results led us to the conclusion that our hypothesis is correct.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle is made up of thousands of myofibers, which are small bunches of muscle fibers.  These fibers are activated by motor neurons which use action potentials to spread the charge throughout the muscle fibers.  These impulses are usually further spread by a release of acetylcholine which binds to its receptors and opens sodium channels that then generate the action potential.  In order for the muscle to relax when stimulated, acetylcholinerase  moves into the channels and dissolves the acetylcholine left, allowing the muscle to release when it is overstimulated.  Acetylcholinerase is a very important enzyme to the contraction of muscles.  It essentially “hydrolyses and inactivates acetylcholine, thereby regulating thereby regulating the concentration of the transmitter at the synapse” [Soreq and Seidman, 2001]. Without out, humans in particular are subject to diseases like Alzheimer's and multiple system atrophy with too much acetylcholine in their system[Soreq and Seidman].  In the frog legs that we worked with, we concentrated on the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle.  We want to know what would happen if we injected 2% Sevin, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor into the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg.  Based off of what we know about acetylcholine and acetylesterase, we hypothesize that if we inject 100 mm of 2% Sevin into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg, the muscle will reach tetany sooner and at a lower frequency than normal.

Materials and Methods:
The materials consisted of  3 fresh frog legs, dissection devices, a syringe, 2% Sevin, frog Ringer solution, string, suspension device,  and iWorx electrophysiological recorder and data analysis software.  To conduct the experiment, first we isolated the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve from the frog leg, we then suspended with string, the gastrocnemius muscle so that the muscle is perpendicular with the rest of the leg.  We then placed the stimulating probe of the software on the sciatic nerve so that the electric frequency is directed to the nerve itself.  We started with the control and administered shocks with a voltage of 2 at the frequencies 10, 15, and 20 unless we reached tetany earlier.  After we repeated this process between all three legs, we injected the gastrocnemius muscles with 100 mm 2% Sevin and repeated the process until the muscles reached tetany.  After we concluded the experiment, we ran a paired t-test.



Results:
Every treatment  frog leg reached tetany at a lower than the control frog legs.  After running a paired t-test on 2df, the t-value was 751 and the d-value was 1.77*10^-6.  Based upon these results, my group has concluded that the data supports our hypothesis.

Discussion:
Since our p-value is lower than 0.05, our data is significant and our hypothesis is correct.  The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor prevents the enzyme from doing its job and catalysing the acetylcholine in the synapse of the nervous system of the frog.  In doing so, the muscle is unable to regulate the acetylcholine so that when nothing is stopping the transmitter, the muscle continues to contract.  The muscle becomes out of control causing it to go into tetany faster than a frog muscle that has effective acetylcholinerase.  The next logical step for this study could be to examine how fast the muscles would reach tetany when the voltage is altered along with the frequency.  This type of information could be beneficial to the larger body of science, it can alter how we look at medicine and help treat many diseases that deal with muscle problems at the molecular level.
