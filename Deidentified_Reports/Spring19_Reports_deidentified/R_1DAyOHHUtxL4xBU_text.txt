Title: Man-made shelter has no effect on red mane display duration in Betta splendens 

Abstract:
This study takes a quantitative, ethological approach to observation of male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, in aggressive interactions with other males in order to understand how man-made structures affect behavior. Established resident males were observed in confrontations with intruder males in empty tanks and with man-made shelter. Because male betta fish are territorial, it was hypothesized that the man-made shelter would be recognized as a nesting location, causing more aggressive behavior in resident males. The behavior known as a “red mane” display was observed, with duration of this behavior over an observational period recorded. There was no significant difference between the duration of red mane displays for each resident male with or without shelter. Lack of nesting recognition in man-made shelters could alter the future behavioral evolution of domesticated bettas. 

Introduction:
Behavior of male Betta splendens has been studied extensively in order to understand how behavior affects and is affected by evolution. The observations of betta fish and other species help scientists understand how behaviors developed across and among species. The cost and benefits of these behaviors are of particular salience in understanding these concepts. Most research on this species is focused on the agonistic behavior that is unique to betta males. In aggressive confrontations, male Betta splendens participate in what may be described as ritualized displays of agonistic behavior. These behaviors are performed to prevent escalation of conflict to a damaging fight, as male bettas use visual cues from their opponents to decide to stay or leave the interaction [Castro-2006]. However, these agonistic movements are costly themselves. A common agonistic display is the betta’s “red mane” [Johnson-2018]. Along with dorsal fin spread, red maning causes a significant increase in metabolic rate and oxygen consumption [Castro-2006]. In order to understand why betta males exhibit this behavior, scientists must examine the costs and benefits of participation in agonistic behavior. 
One reason bettas might commit to such measures is protection of territory. The prior-residency effect on Betta splendens deals with male bettas which have established memories and become familiar with visual and/or tactile cues in their environments [Bronstein-1984]. One study on the prior-residency effect on Betta splendens supports that male bettas which spent more time in their territory prior to confrontation with another male have an agonistic advantage over intruder males [Bronstein-1984]. Other factors that affect aggression in male bettas with commitment to territories/nest-sites include persistence of opponent and proportional distance between the fish [Bronstein-1981]. In our study, the agonistic displays of male bettas were recorded relevant to presence or lack of a provided shelter. We predicted that male bettas provided with a shelter would be influenced by the prior-residency effect, and would display more aggressive behavior towards intruder males. 

Materials and Methods:
Four pairs of male Betta splendens (eight total) were collected and each was placed in a separate tank with opaque partitions between them to limit visibility of other males. Two males were then selected and transported to the testing tank, which included two connected tank areas separated by an opaque partition as well as a clear partition. Neither male was given a shelter. The males experienced a five minute rest before the first observational period. One betta was identified as the resident male. The observational period began with the removal of the opaque partition. The clear partition remained to prevent physical confrontation. During this five minute observation period, group members individually recorded their observations of the amount of time which the resident male displayed its red mane (spread operculum and expanded branchiostegal membrane). At the end of the five minute period, the total amount of red maning time which each member measured was recorded. The mean of these values was recorded as the observed red mane time. After another five minute rest period, a small shelter was placed in the center of the resident male’s tank. Another five minute period followed before the opaque partition was removed for observation of agonistic behaviors. Average red mane time was measured and recorded for the resident male. At the end of the observation period, the two fish in the observation tank were removed. 
Two more males were placed in the observation tank, and the procedure for was repeated for both the no shelter and shelter parameters. This procedure was reversed for the last two pairs of males, meaning that the resident male was observed with the shelter first, and then without the shelter for the next observation period. In order to minimize the variance which factors like persistence of opponent and proportional distance between the fish could have produced, the same shelter was placed in the same place in each trial and a clear glass partition remained between two males in every trail. The clear glass partition also prevented physical confrontation, and allowed for observation for the full five minutes. Average times of red mane for shelter and no shelter parameters were calculated by averaging the observed red mane times for each male given shelter or no shelter. These average red mane times were examined using a paired, two-tailed T-test (p&lt;.05). 


Results:
Average time of red mane display were calculated and compared using a paired T-test (T=1.77, Df=3, P=0.17). Red mane display times were generally higher among resident male bettas with no shelter. During confrontation with shelter, resident male 2 swam into shelter and remained facing intruder male from within the cave-like entrance. This was the only male to swim into the shelter during confrontation. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by the data collected. It does not appear that male bettas provided with man-made shelter exhibit significantly higher levels of agonistic behavior compared to males without shelter. While research from the University of Michigan found that the prior-residency affect caused fish exposed to longer duration in a home tank exhibit a higher magnitude of agonistic behaviors, we found that the content of the home tank had no significant effect on the magnitude of agonistic behaviors in the betta males [Bronstein-1984]. The University of Michigan study also suggests that more naturally aggressive males are more likely to establish themselves in their home tanks by building nests, displaying aggressively, and approach comparatively more females than their less aggressive counterparts. This supports that the base aggressiveness of the fish has more impact on our experiment than the shelter. It also suggests that our use of man-made shelter might have affected our results, as betta fish naturally build their own nests instead of relying entirely on man-made structures. It is possible that the resident bettas did not recognize the shelter provided as a nest site, so they were not driven to exhibit more agonistic behavior, thereby consuming less oxygen and maintaining a lower metabolic rate [Castro-2006]. Therefore, territorial instinct had little effect on resident males. The behavior of the resident male 2 could give credence to the prior-residency effect in our study, as its move to rest in the shelter could be attributed to intruder male presence, which drives nest fixation on resident males [Bronstein-1981]. However, it is unclear if resident male 2 recognized the shelter as a nesting site, and the lack of other males following this behavior suggests that the shelter was not recognized. Without this recognition, the males would not be driven to increase agonistic behavior. Non-recognition of man-made shelters as nesting sites could also affect how the behavior of domesticated fighting fish evolves. The data trends show that resident males in the presence of the man-made shelter displayed red mane for a shorter duration, which could be caused by a more limited space for movement or a lesser drive to act aggressively as the betta recognized a place to hide. Further studies over a longer period of time which would allow nest building in resident males would provide more reliable results, and could indicate whether nesting betta males actually exhibit more aggressive behavior than their non-nesting intruder counterparts.
