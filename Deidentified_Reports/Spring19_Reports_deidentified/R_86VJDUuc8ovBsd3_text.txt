Title: Effects of Various Wavelengths on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts 

Abstract:
Plants grow and develop in association with photosynthesis. Light is absorbed through the stomata, which can be regulated by different colors of light. Enriched chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea leaves were reduced through differential centrifuging, then exposed to natural light (with and without chloroplast), green light, red light, and no light. To measure photosynthetic activity, the chlorophyll of Spinacia oleracea was subjected to various wavelengths. Absorbances were recorded every ten minutes during a 30-minute time period. Samples with no chloroplasts exposed to natural light were used as a negative controll while samples with no light were used as a positive controll. It was hypothesized that when Spinacia oleracea is placed under these various wavelengths, green light will induce the most photosynthetic activity, followed by red light, then natural light. Natural light with chloroplast was found to have the highest levels of photosynthetic activity, followed by green light, then red light. Statistical significance is shown across all samples in comparison to the positive controll, no light; however, there is hesitation to make a definitive conclusion as the experiment was primitive and there was difficultly to controll/isolate the various light environments. 

Introduction:
Sunlight is an environmental factor that influences the behavior and physiology of many organisms. Photosynthetic organisms such as plants depend on light energy to evolve, grow, and develop. Photosynthesis allows plants to convert light energy into chemical energy stored as carbohydrates. This process occurs in distinct phases through the Calvin Cycle and Krebs’ Cycle which carries and releases high energy electrons to produce energy [Zong: 2018]. Through the simultaneous interaction between glycolysis and cellular respiration, ATP energy is generated for the plant’s survival.
Plants can receive light energy through stomata, pores formed by guard cells, which allows diffusion of carbon dioxide and exit of oxygen. The structure of the stomata allows the plant to respond to various environmental conductions such as photosensors [Galvão:2015]. These photosensors, or photochromes, optimize light absorbance and have evolved to respond to changes in light direction, duration, and wavelength. Plants have evolved many different classes of photoreceptors: red/far-red phytochrome (phy) and blue light receptors such as cryptochrome (cry) [Suetsugu: 2012]. These receptors are found in all green plants.
Light responses from the photosensors are dependent on photosynthesis-independent and photosynthesis-dependent components. The photosynthesis-dependent component is blue light specific and induces rapid stomatal opening [Wang: 2011]. When plants are subjected to wavelengths of blue light, “cry” receptors known as phototropins, will activate a signal transduction cascade that optimizes the harvesting of energy from photosynthesis and production of ATP. The photosynthesis-independent component, or red-light response, primarily inhibits photosynthetic electron transport. Hence, stomatal opening is not optimized, and limited light energy is able to be absorbed from photosynthesis. It is important to note that the highest levels of blue light are recorded during the afternoon, whereas red light is found in the evening and early morning [Galvão:2015]. Green light, and its effect on stomatal opening, has limited research; however, green light is abundant in the daylight spectrum. Still, plants prefer to utilize blue and red light for stomatal opening.
Spinacia oleracea is the ideal plant to study the effect of various wavelengths from light energy on photosynthesis due to their abundance and common organic base. Photosynthetic reduction will be analyzed through the chloroplast absorbance levels after being subjected to light over an interval time period. Dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), which acts as an alternate electron acceptor, was substituted to visually quantify the photosynthetic activity [Liu: 1991]. With its addition, samples will change color when reduction during photosynthesis occurs. This color change aids in the measurement of absorption to determine activity. It was hypothesized that when Spinacia oleracea is placed under various wavelengths, green light will induce the most photosynthetic activity. Although blue and red light are preferable to plants for stomatal opening, green light is absorbed in abundance (specifically in the leaves of plants) to produce coloration. Thus, it is rational to assume a plant will utilize the light energy readily available.


Materials and Method:
Chloroplasts from four Spinacia oleracea leaves were extracted by differential centrifugation. Leaves were deveined and reduced into a liquid using 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer to generate a solution of enriched chloroplasts. The solution was centrifuged for 3 minutes at 200 x G and the supernatant was re-centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 X G. Supernatant was removed in order to suspend the final pellet with grinding buffer. 
A chloroplast assay was set up for five experimental groups, each triplicates. The assay was prepared using 2 Ml of μM DCIP, 6 Ml of deionized water, 2 Ml of a reaction buffer containing 100 mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5, and 100 μl of enriched chloroplasts (in the required samples). Two lamps with a green bulb and red bulb were set up.
The absorbance of each trial was measured at 600 nm in a spectrophotometer to determine photosynthetic activity then each triplicate was placed in their respective light environment. Over a 30-minute experimental period, absorbances were read every 10 minutes. A percent change in photosynthetic activity was calculated using the absorbance data and data was analyzed using a standard two sample paired t_test.


Results:
The results obtained had various levels of significance. The largest percent change in average photosynthetic activity, reduction of electrons, occurred with the chloroplasts exposed to natural light (84.98%). After natural light, percent change in photosynthetic activity was highest in green light (82.62%), followed by red light (79.86%), no light (39.03%), then natural light without chloroplasts present (17.65%). Still, there was large variance within each triplicate which is evident by large standard deviations. 
Using no light as a controll, a standard two sample paired t_test was conducted to determine the data’s significance. Natural light (with chloroplasts) had a t_stat value of 4.13 and a significent p_value of 0.0004. Green light, the second highest in percent change in photosynthetic activity, had a t_stat value of 6.58 and a significent p_value of 3.17E-6. Finally, red light had a t_stat value of 4.05 and a significent p_value of 0.0005. 


Discussion:
The data generated from this experiment partially supports the initial hypothesis. Originally, it was predicted that green light would have the highest photosynthetic activity, but it was the second to highest after natural light with chloroplasts. Regardless, our initial hypothesis was faulty as green light is known to reflect photons emitted from the sun giving plants their color. The data does suggest that green light is absorbed, however this is highly unrealistic because (if plants only absorb green light), the rate of photosynthesis decreases, and the plant dies [Wang: 2011]. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that the green light samples were inadvertently exposed to a small amount of natural light. The chloroplasts placed under natural light likely had the most photosynthetic activity since, regardless of the effects of various wavelengths on photosynthetic activity, the samples had all wavelengths of light available for use. Red light, which has a longer wavelength than green light induces stomal opening and, in turn, increases photosynthetic activity. The data does not support this fact; however, one outlier in the red data (evident by a large standard deviation) skews the results. Without this outlier, red would display the highest percent change in absorbance. Furthermore, this experiment dealt with chloroplasts not stomata which may explain why the photosynthesis activity of red light was lower in respect to the other samples. Although significent values were obtained, technical error is presumed to have occurred due to various variables such has a non-natural, non-isolated light environments and limited experimental trials. 
Study in this scientific field remains prevalent. Understanding behavior and development of plants in association to chloroplasts can aid in finding the optimal light environments for plants to grow even when the conditions for stomatal opening are not ideal. This will increase the efficiency of worldwide agriculture agencies. Understanding the proper wavelengths that induce the most photosynthetic activity can help predict which light environments are required for a specific plant organism.
