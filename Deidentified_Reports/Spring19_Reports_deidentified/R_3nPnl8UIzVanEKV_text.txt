Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta Development

Abstract:
Hormones play an essential regulatory role in the growth and development of biological organisms.  It is important to analyze the effects that hormone levels can have on certain organisms to understand patterns of growth.  Both JH and ecdysterone are two hormones that play an essential role in the growth and development of the Manduca sexta.  The objective of this experiment is to analyze the effect that excess juvenile hormone (JH) has on Manduca sexta larvae.  If Manduca sexta larvae are exposed to increased levels of JH, then their weight will be inhibited.  The data showed that the average mean weight of the control group was larger than the average mean weight of the experimental group, however, this data is not statistically relevant because the p-value from the two-sample t-test is less than 0.5.  Therefore, the hypothesis of this experiment cannot be supported.  

Introduction:
This experiment analyzes the effect of JH on Manduca sexta development over 14 days.  Hormones play an essential role in the growth and development of all biological organisms.  A hormone is a chemical signal that is produced in one area of an organism and then transported via bloodstream to act on target cells in another area of the organism [Sadava: 2014].  Two hormones that work together and assume an essential role in the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta are JH and ecdysterone (20E).  The Manduca sexta is also known as the tobacco hornworm and is often used in laboratory research because they are large organisms and there has been a multitude of research conducted on their physiology and endocrine systems [Reinecke: 1980].  The life cycle of the Manduca sexta consists of several stages: eggs, 1st instar larva, 2nd instar larva, 3rd instar larva, 4th instar larva, 5th instar larva, pupa, and adult moth [Johnson: 2016].  The Manduca sexta will experience molting when transitioning from a pupa into an adult moth, which involves the shedding of the epidermis in response to hormonal signals.  JH influences the type of molting that the Manduca sexta will experience and 20E will influence the timing of the molt.  This experiment serves to test the effect that JH has on the growth and development of developing Manduca sexta.  If Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to excess JH, then this increase in JH hormone will inhibit the weight of the caterpillars.    



Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta larvae were obtained for this experiment; four were randomly designated to the control group and four were randomly designated to the experimental group.  Two plastic containers with four compartments were obtained and two holes were poked in each compartment to promote airflow.  One larva was placed in each compartment of each container and received a label.  To create the food for each larva in the control group, ten grams of food was thoroughly combined with eight drops of water and formed into a ball.  This process was repeated for each of the control group caterpillars.  To create the food for each of the larva in the experimental group, ten grams of food was mixed thoroughly with eight drops of JH mimic and formed into a ball.  The food was placed into the appropriate containers.  Each caterpillar was weighed prior to the start of the experiment, and then placed into an incubator.  Every day for 14 days, the caterpillars were weighed and monitored.  Feces was cleaned out of the compartments if it was necessary, and food was added if there was none left in the container.  After 14 days, the mean weight of each group was calculated, standard deviation was determined, and a two-sample t-test was conducted as a statistical analysis for the experiment.  

Results:
The mean weight for the control group after 14 days is 6.2528 g (Table 1) and the mean weight for the experimental group is 4.8507 g (Table 1).  The standard deviation for the control group is 0.4952 (Figure 1) and the standard deviation of the experimental group is 3.248 (Figure 1).  A two-sample t-test was used to statistically analyze the data.  The one-tailed p-value was used because the results are directional.  The one-tailed p-value for this experiment is 0.2131, which is less than 0.5 (Figure 1).  This means that the results of this experiment are not statistically significant.  During the first seven days, the control group larvae were not moving much while the experimental larvae 2 and 4 were very active.  The larvae in the control and in the experimental group were both bright blue in color.  During week 2, three of the Manduca sexta control group members started to turn a brown color and stopped moving.  In contrast, only one of the experimental group members was turning dark brown.  Overall, both groups had Manduca sexta that were bright blue and others that were brown.  

Discussion:
The hypothesis that Manduca sexta larvae that are exposed to excess levels of JH will experience inhibited weight growth cannot be supported by the results of this experiment.  Although the average mean weight of the control group was larger than the average mean weight of the experimental group, the outcome of the two-sample t-test indicates that the results are not statistically relevant.  The p-value of this statistical test also indicates that it cannot be determined if the results are not due to chance.  There were likely sources of error that contributed to the outcome of the statistical test.  The weights of the Manduca sexta in the experimental group were not very consistent with the other organisms in their group.  Other experiments that have been conducted in the past suggest that juvenile hormone delayed or inhibited the start of metamorphosis [Safranek: 1980].  Another experiment determined that the presence of JH in the final larval instar of the Manduca sexta prevented the secretion of prothoracicotropic hormone, which prevents development [Nijhout: 1974].  Although the average mean weight of the experimental group was lower than the experimental group in our experiment, the hypothesis cannot be supported because of the outcome of the statistical test.
