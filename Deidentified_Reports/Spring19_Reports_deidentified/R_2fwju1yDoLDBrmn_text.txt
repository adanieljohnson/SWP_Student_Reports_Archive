Title: Warmer Changes in the Environment Cause an Increase in the Root to Shoot Ratio of Rye

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to change environmental conditions for Rye plants, or Secale cereale, and observe how the plant decides to allocate their energy. Selective pressures have led plant species to make certain trade-offs and allocate their resources in response to these variations in the environment. The root-to-shoot ratio (R: S) is frequently used a measure of allocation. A group with a controllled temperature and a group with a higher temperature where grown in a span of two weeks, R: S was recorded, and results were compared. The plants in the incubator presented a much higher average R: S compared to the greenhouse plants when using weight, which was statistically significent (two-sample t_test: 3.928, p_value: 0.017). When using length, the greenhouse plants had a greater R: S but the results were not statistically significent (two-sample t_test: 0.285, p_value: 0.790). We concluded that plants will tend to allocate more biomass to the roots when the temperature is higher to optimize the uptake of the most restrictive factor, water. In future experiments, we would make sure to equalize the exposure of light to both groups and it would be interesting to explore the combined effects of temperature and light exposure to R: S.

Introduction:
All organisms must adapt to biotic factors (stimuli that originates from other organisms), and abiotic factors (stimuli form non-living sources) such as wind, temperature, etc. Plants must obtain essential resources, like sunlight, nitrogen, or water, that are limited. Plants must act upon all the stimuli to enhance its functions to survive and flourish when possible [Rogers: 1996].  Selective pressures have led plant species to make certain trade-offs and allocate their resources in response to these variations in the environment. Plants vary in how they allocate energy and metabolic resources due to varying plasticity and varying environments. A frequently used measure of allocation is the root-to-shoot ratio (R: S). These ratios are measured due to their different jobs. Roots take up water and essential elements from the ground while the shoots, composed of the stem and leaves, conduct photosynthesis and produce carbon compounds. The purpose of this lab is to change environmental conditions for Rye plants, or Secale cereale, and observe how the plant decides to allocate their energy. How will an environmental change in temperature affect R: S? An increase in temperature would decrease the availability of water in the soil as it is forced to evaporate, leading to an increase in root length. My group hypothesized that if a plant is exposed to an increase in temperature, then the R: S will increase.


Materials and Method:
Eight individual rye plants were planted per container and ten total containers were used. Five of the containers were part of the controll group and were placed at room temperature in a greenhouse. The other five containers were assigned to the treatment group and were placed in an environment with a higher temperature inside of an incubator. All plants were left in their respective environments for two weeks to grow with a constant and equal supply of water. After two weeks, three pants were harvested from each container, leading to fifteen individual samples per group. The weight of the whole plant was measured and then was cut at the root-to-shoot junction. The individual weight of the roots, and the weight of the shoots was recorded and then a R: S was calculated in grams. The length of all roots and shoots was recorded individually and then the R: S was calculated for their length in millimeters. It is important to keep track of what room belongs to which shoot to calculate an accurate R: S. The average R:S was calculated for weight and length as well as their standard deviation and the information was graphed. A two-sample t_test was also calculated to analyze the significance of the data.

Results:
Shown by Figure 1, there is an observable difference between the R: S ratio in the rye plants when looking at weight. The plants in the incubator presented a much higher average R: S of 2.54 while the greenhouse plants had an average of 0.57 R: S. The difference between R: S using weight was statistically significent (two-sample t_test: 3.928, p_value: 0.017). Figure 2, on the other hand, shows a minimal difference between the R: S in the greenhouse plants and incubated plants when using length. The greenhouse plants had an average R: S of 1.56 while the incubated plants had an average R: S 1.48 when using length. Although the greenhouse plants had a higher R: S, the data was not statistically significent (two-sample t_test: 0.285, p_value: 0.790).


Discussion:
As seen in Figure 1, when comparing the R: S of the incubated plants and the greenhouse plants using their weights, the R: S increased to a much greater extent in the incubated plants. This means that the higher temperature of the incubated plants led to a higher R: S ratio in weight, supporting our hypothesis. These results were also statistically significent. The higher weight of the roots in higher temperatures could have been due to the decreased availability of water in the warmer environment. Additionally, a separate study supports our findings as well as they found that if plants have a limiting factor that is below the ground, then those plants will tend to allocate more biomass to the roots to optimize the uptake of the most restrictive factor. [Poorter: 2011]. When comparing R: S of incubated plants and greenhouse plants using length, the results did not support our data. As seen in Figure 2, the group of plants in the greenhouse displayed a higher R: S. Although this data was not statistically significent, the data regarding length contradicts the data collected regarding weight. The length could’ve easily been affected by the extraction process of the roots. The roots are very delicate and could have been easily torn during the extraction process. Another greater mistake we could have made is exposed them to different amounts of light. Since a group of plants was left in an incubator and the other group was left in the greenhouse, the plants in the incubator were exposed to much less light than those that stayed in the greenhouse. According to a separate study, if light is a limited resource then plants will strive to overtop the plants in their surroundings [Aerts: 1999]. Plants that are grown with a lower availability of light have shown an increase in allocation towards the shoots [Poorter 2011]. In future experiments, we would make sure to equalize the exposure of light to both groups and it would be interesting to explore the combined effects of temperature and light exposure to R: S.
