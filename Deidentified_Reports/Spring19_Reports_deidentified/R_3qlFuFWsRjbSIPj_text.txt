Title: Betta fish displaying more aggressive behaviors when dyed water

Abstract:
Betta Splendens, was our subject to study over this experiment. This type of fish present aggressive behaviors (more common in males) towards protecting territory, to get mates, or fight for limited resources (food.) Our experiment consisted on dividing 4 fish into two groups of two facing each other in the same tank, observed interactions and aggressive behaviors the fish displayed between them within five minutes before and then, after dying the water. By using a Paired t-test we were able to differentiate both groups and its change of behavior towards dyed water and how they balance the costs and benefits of display such movements in order to save energy. 

Introduction:
The [Male Betta Splendens] is well known as an aggressive fish with unique spawning and parental care behavior. The level of aggression displayed by [Betta Fish] is a product of its internal state and the state of the surrounding environment (Forsatkar 2016). In order to get mates, or competition for resources like food or territory. When there is a fight between two Betta fish and one of the them needs to get oxygen onto the surface, the fight will stop and the two fish will respect each other during the pause. They also balance the costs and benefits that can get within a fight, so they will control whether display aggressive behaviors or not to. Siamese fighting fish use gill flaring as an acute response in order to defend their territory; this response may be replaced by fin spreading as a chronic response, probably to reduce the energetic costs during the contest (Forsatkar 2016.) They act differently when two males; or a male and a female are put together in the same aquarium or even just by seeing each other with a barrier in between.  

The male Siamese fighting fish has been long recognized for its territoriality and the aggressive displays it performs when confronting intruder conspecifics (Simpson 1968). 

This fish is a highly aggressive species; both males and females display some degree of aggression against [other Betta fish] (Karino and Someya 2007). Studies examining social interactions of Siamese fighting fish (e.g., McGregor et al. 2001), suggest that [protruding the branchiostegal membrane, thus creating the red “mane” effect, and eracting dorsal and anal fin,] are the most common aggressive displays in male–male and male–female interactions. The duration of [the red “mane”] is an indicator of fighting capacity and correlates with fighting abilities in this species (Evans 1985; Alton et al. 2013). Low-level aggression typically involves fin (Forsatkar 2016.) In addition to this behaviors, they also perform other behaviors such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing, in an increase order, following by spreading gill covers and eracting the already mentioned pectoral fins and producing the red “mane” (branchiostegal membranes) located underneath the opercula. 

In this experiment we choose as a dependent variable the color of the water, and dye it red. We believe changing the water color will make the two confronted fish display more agonistic behaviors and in a higher frequency than fish in normal conditions. We want to collect data and see if water dye affects Betta fish frequency showing aggressive behaviors towards them. 

So, we hypothesized, whether Bettas are exposed to a colorful dye, they will display an increase amount of aggressiveness in comparison to the ones with no color dye. 

Materials and Methods:
Observe four Betta fish and face two and two with no dye in the water and see how many displays they show between each other. Then let them rest for five minutes. After that, 6 drops of dye will be added in the water and face the fish (1vs. 2) (3 vs. 4) and observe again for five minutes, how many aggressive movements they display. Furthermore, make sure to record the same amount of time for the two samples and collect data of the facing and broadside movements they display. The data will be analyzed before and after dye with paired t-test. 

Results:
Figure 1. Betta Splenders displayed more aggressive behaviors with dye than with not dye. Each bar represents the average number of aggressiveness which all four fish have showed to no dye (2 fish) and with dye (2 fish). 

The Paired t-test results for the study (df=3; T-value=0.798; P-value=0.483) 

Discussion:
The results were statisically signgificant, but somehow, our hypohesis is supported. 

As you may observe in the graph below, there is a slight difference between the two groups. He dyed group present more type of aggressions and with a higher frequency. The mean of aggressive behaviors towards dyed water were higher (27) than the mean of no-dyed water (17.5). Pigments of bettas give rise to red, blue, green, and yellow body surface colors and also to scale iridescence. Pigments are compounds of the general structures such as melanins, carotenoids, xanthines and pterins whereas iridescent compounds on the scales and body surfaces are guanines and purines. These pigments are also common in other animals. However, fish have special pigment cells (chromatophores) which respond to neural signals for quick outward expression by deepening of colour intensity and changing of shades (Monvises 2009.) Furthermore, between the two groups the fish presented different colors in their skin. On the first group the fish were yellow and red so we believe the color of the water made them interact more with each other. In spite, the second group of fish were both blue, so the color of the water didn’t matter to them and so the standard deviation was high too.  

Finally we concluded that it’s not just the color of the water but the color of the fish alter the fish to fish interactions and amount of aggressivenes.
