Title: Resource allocation and Observing Phenotypic Plasticity of Radishes Grown in Vermiculite and Mycorrhiza

Abstract:
Overall, the experiment shows that the fungus was not able to significantly change the lengths of the radish’s roots while also not significantly changing the weight of the plants. The idea that the fungus does help with the length aspect of the radish would make sense due to the increase of resources allocated to the roots so the plant can maximize its resources. However, the results show that there was only a significant difference in the lengths of the control radishes. The hypothesis was not supported significance in the lengths portrays the radish’s phenotypic plasticity. 

Introduction:
 Plasticity is an important trait for plants to have because different conditions can arise, which can cause a plant to need to exhibit phenotypic plasticity in ways of altering the growing pattern of its leaves, roots, or stem/shoot. There are many different conditions that plants can be subjected to and in the proposed experiment, the plants will be subjected to a controlled environment as well as an experimental environment. The plants in the experiment are Radishes (Raphanus Sativus) which will be subjected to Mycorrhiza fungi called Rhizophagus Irregularis. The fungus forms a symbiotic relationship with the plant’s roots so the plant can easily intake inorganic phosphate. This relationship is very important because when growing plants, the goal is to maximize the plant’s growth, so proving that the fungus helps increase the growth and prosperity of the plant is essential to a healthy plant. In one study, the fungus was found to significantly increase the yields of crops compared to the controlled group. The experiment the results where that Rhizophagus Irregularis is currently a way of increasing cassava yields (cassava is a crop found in South American countries), and that there is a very strong potential for the use of the fungi to be economically profitable and that there more room for involvement of the fungi’s symbiotic relationship in the future [Ceballos: 2013]. My hypothesis is that the radishes that are growing in Rhizophagus will significantly have a more complex root system and thus a high root to shoot ratio, whereas the control group growing in regular vermiculite will not have any significant differences with their root and shoots and thus having a low root to shoot ratio.

Materials and Methods:
To start this experiment take the seeds that have been soaked in water and plant them in the vermiculite with miracle grow in it, all of which needs to be separated into 4 different containers. After the control group is planted then prepare the experimental group but with the added fungi, all of which needs to be separated into 4 different containers. Take all of the plants into the greenhouse to be watered for a week. Next, the plants will be harvested while also being very careful when harvesting the plants and not pulling them out quickly which would damage the roots. Then take the control plants and break apart the vermiculite which will allow the separation of the roots. Following that, gently wash the plants in the container of water and gently dry the plants with a paper towel. After the harvest is done the measuring will take place. First, weight the whole plants together and then record the data. Next, separate the roots of the plant from the shoots by cutting each plant at the root-shoot junction, while also making sure others are cutting their plants at the same point for consistency. Then weigh the shoots and record that data and calculate/ record the root mass (this is the total mass subtracted by the shoot mass). Finally, measure the maximum shoot length and root length to the nearest millimeter and then record the mean value for each of the group's plants. All of the steps for the control plants will be repeated for the experimental group. Make sure to share all the data with classmates in order to get a complete set of data. All of the data will be put into a table and calculate the standard deviation.

Results:
To portray the results of the experiment the statistical test chosen to compare the data was a two-tailed t-test which tests the null hypothesis that means values of measurement variable are the same in two groups. In order for there to be a significant difference observed in the group’s P values must be above 0.5 or p≥0.5. In the two figures (figures 1 and 2) below the data collected is displayed in graphs detailing the differences in means with the standard deviation applied.
Data for root to shoot ratio for weight: (control: 0.542  ±0.195, fungi: 0.424, ±0.158). [Figure 1]
Data for root to shoot ratio for length: (control: 2.510  ±0.343, fungi: 2.306, ±0.451). [Figure 2]
The mean of the root to shoot ratio for the weight control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.82, df = 4, P = 0.46).
The mean of the root to shoot ratio for the length control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.62, df = 4, P = 0.57).


Discussion:
The hypothesis proposed for the lab was shown to be not significantly supported by the statics of the two-tailed t-test of the root to shoot ratio of length; in addition, it was not supported with the root to shoot ratio for the weight. This is due to the P values for the t-tests showing that there is a significant difference in the results for the length ratios, p≥0.5, but the significance is in favor of the control, and not the fungi. There was not a significant difference in the P value for the weight ratio t-test because of p ≤0.5. The radishes’ ability to form a symbiotic relationship with the fungi do not seem to be present and can be seen in the results, which are understandable because of the radishes not having a higher weight or length ratios. This could be due to the availability of the Rhizophagus Irregularis’ dependence on the symbiotic status and phosphate availability. In a study with the propose fungi, the plants were shown to have an increase in the plant's growth with the availability of phosphorus, but when not enough phosphorus was present the plants were not able to form the relationship with the fungi, so the relationship was not very beneficial [Fiorilli: 2013]. In this case, the studies are similar in that the radishes in the fungi did not show any significant differences in length or weight, whereas the control group did show a significant difference in the length ratios. These results are possibly due to the limitation and other factors throughout the experimental process. One limitation was that when cultivating the control group, the miracle grow was not placed on the four different control groups, which could have caused a different outcome in the results. Not having the miracle grow definitely was a factor that would have made the control group grow more. Another factor could be the phosphorous availability in the greenhouse where the plants were stored. This would make sense when compared to the two studies compared with this experiment. If there had been perfect conditions like in the experiment done by Ceballos, the most obvious outcome would be that there was a significant difference supporting the hypothesis. On the other hand, with the limitations and other factors, this experiment supports the results of the other study done by Fiorilli. The importance of the result is significant because the data represent what radish growth looks like with the fungi added, but the results are not the expected outcome of the fungi making the radishes grow more. Observing the results, one might see that it is important to carefully view how the fungus’ relationship with different plants vary in the conditions the plants are in. In the future, the study could be improved by adding different types of plants to see the varying results in the different plants. Also making sure that there is the necessary amount of phosphorus for the symbiotic relationship with the fungi and plants.
