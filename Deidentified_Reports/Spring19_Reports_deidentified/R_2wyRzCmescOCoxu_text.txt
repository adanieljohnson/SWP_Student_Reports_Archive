Title: The Introduction of Tubocurarine into the Gastrocnemius of Frogs Without Significant Effects on Neuromuscular Function

Abstract:
Skeletal muscle movement in invertebrates is dictated by the motor neurons that innervate the muscle cells within them; forming a “motor unit.” The release of calcium ions, which initiates contraction of these muscles, is also dependent on the release of neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). In this experiment, the group introduced the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (nACh), tubocurarine, directly into the gastrocnemius of the Rana Pipiens, with the intent of inhibiting the release of ACh from motor neurons. The group’s hypothesis was that the frog leg’s muscle contraction would decrease in response to electrical stimulus after being injected with tubocurarine due to insufficient amounts of ACh being released as a result of tubocurarine inhibition of ACh release. The group measured the contraction amplitudes of the frog legs before and after the tubocurarine injection and compared the data using a paired t-test. While there were patterns of decreasing contraction amplitudes in some of the frogs, the data was deemed insignificant. According to previous biological experiments and findings, nicotinic substances like tubocurarine exert negative effects on muscular contraction and in some ways inhibit motor function suggesting that nicotinic substances should be avoided.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles of vertebrates consist of thousands multinuclear myofiber clusters. Myofibers and the motor neurons that innervate them are called “motor units,” working together to coordinate the contraction of skeletal muscles. In the event of an action potential, nerve impulses will travel down the axon of a motor neuron and arrive at the neuromuscular junction, where the motor neuron innervates the myofiber. This causes the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. After acetylcholine is released, it binds to protein receptors on the muscle fibers, opening up sodium channels that, in turn, generate an action potential in the muscle fiber, causing the release of calcium ions that stimulate the contractile mechanisms of muscle fibers. 
To investigate the role of ACh in muscle contractions and analyze the effects of its inhibition, the group introduced the chemical compound, tubocurarine, to the gastrocnemius of the Rana Pipiens. This organism was selected because the mechanisms involved in its muscle contraction are very similar to that of many mammals and amphibians. The primary mechanisms involved in muscle contractions in frog legs are the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius. The sciatic nerve is a large nerve that stems from the spinal cord and innervates the muscles of the hind leg. Branches of the sciatic nerve contain motor and sensory neurons involved in the controlled contractions of leg muscles. This goal of this experiment was to study the effects of the inhibition of ACh receptors on muscle contraction. This was carried out by inhibiting ACh receptors within the gastrocnemius and sciatic nerve using tubocurarine. Tubocurarine acts as an antagonist for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChr), blocking the receptor site of acetylcholine, particularly in cases of repetitive stimulation, as shown in a previous study where contraction amplitude in frog legs rapidly decreased in response to a repeated stimulus after being injected with tubocurarine [Magleby: 1981]. The effect of ACh release being inhibited is that ACh will be prevented from binding to protein channels on the muscle fibers, preventing the opening of sodium channels and the proceeding action potential of the muscle fiber. 
This experiment studies the functionality of muscle contraction in a system where the release of ACh was inhibited. The electrical impulses and motor actions generated by the muscle tissue in frog legs provide an accurate representation of the relationship between ACh availability and concentration and muscle contraction amplitude [Johnson: 2016]. In a similar study where tubocurarine was injected into the phrenic nerve of rats, the results showed that the muscles required increased stimulation to achieve a resulting contraction [Hinman: 2002]. The group’s hypothesis was that if tubocurarine was injected into frog legs, the legs would require a greater stimulus to generate a muscle contraction. Since the function of acetylcholine is inhibited by the tubocurarine compound, it would require a greater stimulus to overcome the inhibition and release acetylcholine.


Materials and Methods:
The group selected and skinned three frog legs for the experiment, exposing the gastrocnemius and the sciatic nerve. The gastrocnemius and the sciatic nerve were isolated from the rest of the tissue. Once exposed, the gastrocnemius muscle was detached from the tibialis anterior at the Achilles tendon using scissors. The leg was then hung from an apparatus by a string and tension was applied. 
A force transducer was inserted into the gastrocnemius and used to detect the contraction of three electrical currents of 0.75 volts distributed into the gastrocnemius by a probe. The muscle activity was measured in contraction amplitude (measured in volts), which was the difference between the peak and the baseline depicted in the iWorx software. After recording the initial contraction amplitudes of the frog legs, two milliliters of tubocurarine were injected into the gastrocnemius. The group members massaged the gastrocnemius to ensure that the tubocurarine had adequately spread throughout the muscle. The group measured and recorded the contraction amplitudes after the tubocurarine injection. 
Pre-injection measurements were used as control data and compared with the contraction amplitudes of the frog legs after they were injected with tubocurarine, which was treated as experimental data. The group used a paired t-test to compare the averages of the contraction amplitude before and after the tubocurarine injections, since all the data collected came from the same group. The one-tailed version of the paired t-test was used, as the group’s alternate hypothesis considered directionality of the experimental results.


Results:
The group completed all six measurements of contraction amplitude and averaged the resulting data points by group. A trend of decreased contraction amplitude in the frog legs after being injected with tubocurarine was observed in the second and third trials. These two frog legs decreased in contraction amplitude by an average of -0.592V, with a standard deviation of 0.247V. The first trial that did not follow this trend likely negatively influenced the t-value and could have been a factor in its calculated insignificance, however, outlier tests did not prove this trial to be worthy of being excluded from the data. While the contraction amplitude did follow a trend of decreasing in value, the amount by which the amplitude differed before and after the injection was not consistent. For example, frog leg number 2 decreased by approximately 0.5V after the injection while the contraction amplitude of the third frog was suppressed completely. The mean of the control group’s contraction amplitude (pre-tubocurarine injection) was 0.642V, with a standard deviation of 0.379V. The mean of the experimental group’s contraction amplitude (post-tubocurarine injection) was 0.455V, with a standard deviation 0.421V.  The average difference in contraction amplitude between pre-injection and post injection for all three legs was -0.187, with a standard deviation of 0.245V. The resulting paired t-value for this experiment was 0.4242 with a P-value of 0.713, which is insignificant. 

Discussion:
While the group’s biological hypothesis was supported by two out of the three frog legs, the calculated p-value for the t-test in this experiment was deemed insignificant. However, the decrease in contraction amplitude in the second and third frog legs were consistent with the group’s hypothesis. The difference in amplitude pre/post-injection in the first leg directly contradicted the group’s hypothesis; the contraction amplitude of the frog leg after being injected with tubocurarine increased by almost a factor of four. The increase in contraction amplitude could be attributable to some of the tubocurarine injection having spilled out of the frog leg during the injection, or the tubocurarine not being given enough time to properly diffuse and exert its effects on the whole muscle, allowing for the release of ACh in amounts that were sufficient for contraction. The data gathered from the first frog leg did not deviate enough from the rest of the gathered data to be treated as an outlier, however, more trials might have provided enough data for it to be treated as such.
	It is important to understand the relationship between neurotransmitters like ACh that allow for motor function in vertebrates, as well as agents that can inhibit them. This knowledge and understanding allows people to be aware of potential consequences that can result from contact with these substances that can be found in both prescription and recreational drugs. 
Other biological experiments have shown significant evidence that nicotinic antagonists such as tubocurarine have the potential to inhibit motor function [Thesleff: 1955], and therefore should be avoided to reduce the risk of acute and chronic defects.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Contraction amplitude, measured in volts, of each frog leg before and after the injection of tubocurarine into the gastrocnemius. The contraction amplitudes of the frog legs before the tubocurarine injection (represented by blue bars) averaged 0.642V +/- 0.379V. The contraction amplitudes of the frog legs after the injection (represented by red bars) averaged 0.455V +/- 0.421V. Tubocurarine is known to have decreasing effects in contraction amplitude, as observed in frog legs numbers two and three. Frog leg number one experienced an increase in contraction amplitude after being injected with tubocurarine. The contraction of the second frog leg appeared to be completely inhibited resulting in a contraction amplitude of zero volts.*************************************************************************
