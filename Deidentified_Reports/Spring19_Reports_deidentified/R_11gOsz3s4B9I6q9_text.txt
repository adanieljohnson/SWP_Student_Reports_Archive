Title: The Effect of Lidocaine After Injection into Gastrocnemius Muscle of Northern Leopard Frog 

Abstract:
Understanding the fundamentals behind neuromuscular controll is important for medical reason in regard to suppressing muscle contraction or stimulating it for rehabilitation purposes. This experiment focused specifically on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Northern Leopard Frog. We stimulated the muscle by electrical shocks and manipulated that contraction by introducing Lidocaine to the muscle of interest. We hypothesize that administering Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, into the gastrocnemus will decrease or block muscle contraction entirely. We tested on three frog legs, each leg was first tested without Lidocaine that served as the controll and then retested after the injection of Lidocaine as the treatment. The mean of the controll for leg 1, leg 2, and leg 3, was 0.029, 0.107 and 0.064. Whereas the mean of the treatment legs was approximately 0. There was a clear trend of minimal muscle contraction after injected with Lidocaine. Our p_value was 0.104 which implies that our data was not statistically significent, therefore our hypothesis could not be supported. Looking forward, decreasing the shock threshold would increase muscle contraction and therefore potentially yield statistically significent results. 

Introduction:
The focus of this experiment is on Raina Pipens, Northern Leopard Frog [Johnson: 2016]. In this lab, we are focusing on analyzing neuromuscular controll using electrical shock currents administered at different voltages based on the threshold of each frog leg. The neuromuscular system is incredibly important when it comes to movement which is required to live. Nerves and muscles work together to create movement by sensing stimuli whether it be internal or external [Johnson: 2016]. Nerves are connected to muscle and are controllled by the brain. Muscular contractions occur when various chemicals, such as acetylcholine, are released in the synaptic cleft. Our skeletal muscles consist of myofibers, which are fused aggregates of cells. The myofibers are bound together by connective tissue which makes up skeletal muscle. Within the skeletal muscle, there are motor neurons which are the bases of movement. The axons of the motor neurons are the part that extend into a muscle and then further extend at neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2016]. Our experiment will be carried out by testing this neuromuscular controll, specifically for our experiment by isolating the gastrocnemus muscle. We will record and analyze our findings using a myogram, which displays the muscle tension over a given period of time. The goal here is to manipulate the muscle contraction by manipulating the pathways that controll muscle contractions. For our experiment, we will be manipulating the gastrocnemus muscle by injecting it with Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker. In an experiment observing the effects of Lidocaine and Procainamide on the mongrel dog heart, when these drugs were first injected there was an initial decrease of myocardial contractile force [Austen: 1965]. Moreover, in an experiment on humans, subjects were injected with cocaine or Lidocaine so compare the results of the two and it was found that heartbeat decrease 3 beats per minute when injected with Lidocaine [Fischman: 1983] This suggests that Lidocaine could have played a role in the decreased heart contraction in both experiments. We hypothesize that if we inject the frog leg at the gastrocnemus muscle with Lidocaine there will be a decrease in muscle contraction, subsequently inhibiting the maximal force that the leg can exert. Our independent variable is the Lidocaine and our dependent variable is the force of the muscle contractions measured on the myogram. The significance of this study has to do with how we can manipulate muscle contraction to either inhibit it or see greater muscle contraction. For our particular, the experiment provided data to prove or disprove to efficacy of Lidocaine in blocking nerve signals. 

Materials and Method:
We ran tests on three different frog legs and each frog leg was part of the controll and experimental group. We first ran a test on the frog leg without the injection of Lidocaine and then we ran a test on the same leg but this time with the injection of Lidocaine. In order to analyze the muscle when treated with Lidocaine, the first goal was to isolate the gastrocnemus muscle from the rest of the leg. The gastrocnemus was the part of the frog leg that we were observing. To perform the dissection, we placed the frog legs in a dissecting pan to contain everything. Each of the legs was first skinned to expose to muscles and nerves. We then separated the gastrocnemus muscle from the bone and other connective tissue with forceps and a pair of scissors. The gastrocnemus muscle had to be detached from the Achilles tendon by cutting joint where they connect. Once the gastrocnemus was exposed, the leg was tied up so that the muscle contraction could be measured on the computer. The muscle was a tied relatively tight at a 90-degree angle with the rest of the leg remaining in the dissecting pan. Before testing began, each leg was pinned down into the dissecting pan so there was no movement. To record the muscle contractions, we inserted two electrodes needles into the gastrocnemus muscle in order to administer a shock. To begin we first found the threshold for each leg, since the threshold is different in each muscle. The threshold was measured in mV. We then shocked the leg at that voltage four times and evaluated the contraction using the myogram on the computer. After the controll testing was complete, the gastrocnemus muscle was then injected with 0.1Ml of Lidocaine using a syringe. We waited three minutes before starting the contractions again so that the effects of Lidocaine could set in. After 3-5 minutes had passed, we again shocked the leg four times at the same threshold and recorded the contraction force after each shock. We repeated this exact procedure for the other two legs, starting with finding the threshold for each leg and using that voltage for each shock administered to that leg. In order to present our data in a summarized fashion instead of raw, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the four controll and treatment shocks for each of the three legs. The summarized data allows us to observe trends and better understand the significance of the data. The statistical method used was a paired t_test, which means that we used the same subject for both the controll and treatment. We compared the data for each frog leg against itself, therefore the difference was measured using that one subject. 

Results:
We took the mean and standard deviation of the four controll the treatments shocks for each of the three legs. Leg 1 was shocked at 0.5 mV with a controll mean contraction of 0.029 (Fig.1), the standard deviation was 0.001. Leg 1 treatment mean was 0.002 (Fig 1.), the standard deviation was 0.0006. Leg 2 was shocked at 0.4mV with a controll mean contraction of 0.107 (Fig 1.), the standard deviation was 0.027 (Fig 1.) Leg 2 treatment mean was 0. Lastly, leg 3 was shocked at 0.6mV with a controll mean contraction of 0.064 (Fig 1.), the standard deviation was 0.002 (Fig 1.) Leg 3 treatment mean was 0. We used a paired t_test to analyze our results and found that p =0.104 and a t-value of 2.85. From controll to treatment each muscle shows a clear decrease or no contraction in the muscle after treated with Lidocaine. Therefore, there was a clear trend in the data.

Discussion:
Based on the data that was collected, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistical difference between the data from the controll shocks and the treatment shocks. In our hypothesis, we stated that if we injected Lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg then the muscle contractions would significently decrease or even cease to occur due to the blockage of the sodium channels. But the hypothesis was not supported based on the calculated p_value. There was however a very apparent pattern between the mean of the controll shocks versus the mean of the treatment shocks. After the Lidocaine was administered, the second and third leg had a muscle contraction reading of 0, meaning that there was absolutely no muscle contraction. There was a clear decrease of muscle contraction from the controll shocks to the treatment shocks reading 0. These findings are consistent with the results of the experiment on dog hearts found that when Lidocaine was administered centrally it was discovered to have the effect of a myocardial depressant at all dosage levels [Austen: 1965]. Additionally, when Lidocaine and ethanol, another sodium channel blocker, were injected into a muscle of a human it was found that both Lidocaine and ethanol had the ability to reduce effectiveness of muscle spindle afferent [Kaji: 1995]. These discoveries go to support the findings of decreased muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle after injected with Lidocaine. However, based on the p_value calculated, this proves that our data was not statistically significent. A plausible idea of why the p_value came out so high is because the numbers recorded from the controll versus the treatment did not have a large enough difference. The reason this could have been an issue is because since the difference between the controll and treatment data was so small the data would appear to be insignificent with a resulting high p_value. If this experiment were to be redone and modified the use of a lower starting threshold voltage would elicit a greater response and therefore a greater difference between controll and treatment.
