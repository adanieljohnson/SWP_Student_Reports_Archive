Title: Impact of Juvenile Hormone on the development of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar 

Abstract:
The manipulation of the levels of Juvenile Hormone is Manduca Sexta caterpillars was used to understand how this hormone impacts the growth and development of the insect. Two groups of four caterpillars were monitored under uniform conditions except for a difference in diet. The experimental group received an addition of Juvenile Hormone in its daily diet. After the experiment, the mean weight gain of the controll group was greater than the average weight gain of the controll group. Using a two- sample t- test, the results were significently different and the presence of higher levels of JH decreases the growth and development of Manduca Sexta caterpillars.


Introduction:
Hormones dictate numerous biological processes. The manipulation of hormones can lead to a difference in an organism’s natural growth and development, behaviors, and physiology. Juvenile hormone is a regulator of growth and change during the early phase of an insect’s life cycle. There was an experiment conducted which studied the impacts of synthetic Juvenile Hormone in cabbage aphids. The study determined there was a greater mortality rate among first instar aphids treated with the synthetic hormone. Others demonstrated abnormalities and underdevelopment (White). In lab, Manduca Sexta caterpillars were used to determine the effects of added Juvenile Hormone through different diets with or without the presence of added hormone. These caterpillars have a life cycle of approximately forty-five days under constant temperature and constant indoor conditions.  In the experiment, two groups Manduca Sexta were studied under identical conditions except one group had six drops of Juvenile Hormone added to their food in order to understand the impact of the hormone one group.
If the Manduca Sexta is provided with an excess (6 drops added to food) of Juvenile Hormone, the progression of the lifestyle will stagnate and the caterpillars will remain at a smaller weight.


Materials and Method:
There were two uniform environments for two groups of young Manduca Sexta caterpillars to live throughout the duration of the experiment. Each group had four caterpillars. Both groups received the same quantity of food, had the same volume of living space, lived in the same incubator of the same temperature. The uniform conditions of the two groups ensured there wasn’t another variablei mpacting the outcome of the experiment. The difference in the two groups was that Group One did not receive any Juvenile Hormone in their food, just water, and Group Two received six drops of JH. At the start of the experiment, each caterpillar was weighed and the initial weight was recorded. For two weeks, each day, the caterpillars were weighed, their environments were cleaned, and the food was replaced and Group Two received six drops in their food. The two tail two sample t_test was used to compare the change in weight between the two groups at the end of the experiment.


Results:
The mean weight gain of the controll group was 8.895 grams and 3.193 for the experimental group over the course of two weeks (Figure 2). The standard deviation of the controll group was about 3.95 and for the experimental group it was 2.62. We used a two value t_test to determine the relationship between the data values. According to the comparison of the obtained p value and comparing it to .05, the results of the controll and experimental groups were statistically significent. Our results also had a degree of freedom of one and a t value of 2.66. At the end of the experiment, one controll caterpillar had died at the beginning of the first week but three out of the four experimental caterpillars had died throughout the second week of treatment.


Discussion:
The hypothesis created at the experiment was supported through an analysis of the results. Further, the mean of the weight gain in the controll group was over five grams higher than the average weight gain of the controll group. In addition, the p_value indicates the data to be statically significent so it can be concluded based off this experiment that an excess of Juvenile Hormone does in fact decrease growth and development of the Manduca Sexta. Due to the smaller amount of weight gain of the controll group, it can be deduced that Juvenile Hormone impacts the growth and development of the Manduca Sexta. It prevents pupation, extends the initial stages of the life cycle and limits growth (Zhou and Riddiford). Similarly, in an experiment to understand the relationship of Juvenile Hormone and pupation, results demonstrated that JH treated animals prevented normal transcription that occurs at the pupal- adult transformation and causes another pupal cycle.Based on the results of this experiment, after multiple trials to increase validity of the conclusions drawn, experiments can be conducted in order to give manipulate Juvenile Hormones in other pests to reduce their development or change the way to develop to benefit the human population. In addition, perhaps JH can improve different insects that are deficient in certain phenomes or genomes by promoting development.
