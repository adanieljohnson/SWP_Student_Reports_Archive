Title: The effect of a juvenile hormone mimic on the growth and development of Manduca Sexta larva

Abstract:
The Juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta is vital for their pupation into adulthood. Manduca are known to produce different amounts of the hormone depending on what larval stage they are in, influencing their growth and the timing of pupation. This experiment seeks to understand how excessive amounts of juvenile hormone affects the growth of Manduca caterpillars. Sixteen Manduca Caterpillars were split into two groups, one group of eight being fed food mixed with a solution of Juvenile Hormone mimic derived from Ageratum Houstiniaum and one group being fed food mixed with only water. The group who were fed food containing the Juvenile hormone mimic on average weighed slightly more than the control group, but were not significantly heavier. Unlike the control group, none of the caterpillars from the group fed the hormone mimic had begun to pupate. The takeaway from this is that in late pupal stages, the Juvenile hormone promotes growth but prevents the larva from pupating.

Introduction:
Hormones play a vital role in all organism’s development from a juvenile to an adult. For insects, which often go through extremely transformative larval stages, hormone disruptions in youth can have massive consequences for their maturity into adulthood. Manduca sexta is a species of caterpillar that is no outlier to this statement. The Juvenile hormone found in Manduca is known to be vital in determining the timing of pupation into adulthood [Nijhout: 1974], and the timing of its presence in the larva seem to have an effect on the larva’s growth and ability to progress through its larval stages [Fain: 1975]. This experiment will seek to understand how the introduction of blue floss flower (Ageratum Houstiniaum), a known JH hormone mimicker, into the caterpillar’s diet will affects their growth as caterpillars and their pupation into adult form. Our hypothesis is that the caterpillars that eat food containing floss flower will have significantly different weight than the caterpillars that are not fed food containing floss flower.


Materials and Methods:
Sixteen Manduca caterpillars of various weights and lengths were selected, all being about one to two weeks old. Four trays with separations into four separate quadrants were used to rear the caterpillars, each caterpillar was given its own quadrant with its own food supply. Eight caterpillars were given food mixed with six drops of 1:1250 solution of a juvenile hormone mimic derived from Ageratum houstoniaum, these caterpillars made up the experimental group. The other eight were given food mixed with six drops of pure water, these eight made up the control group. The caterpillars were then held in an incubation chamber for fourteen days, having their quadrants cleaned and food stores replenished every few days. The caterpillar’s weights were measured prior to and after the fourteen-day incubation. Two-tailed T-tests were used to analyze the differences between the control group and the experimental group in weight. An alpha value of .05 or less was considered significant.


Results:
There was not a significant difference between the control and the treatment groups in weight (t = 1.8, df = 14, p = 0.093). The treatment group which received juvenile hormone in its food was slightly heavier however, as seen in Figure 1. This small difference may be due to the fact that the caterpillars in this group never began pupating and continued to grow while caterpillars in the control group had begun to pupate and therefore had stopped growing.


Discussion:
	The results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis. There was not a significant difference in weight between the experimental and the control groups, with the caterpillars that were fed food containing the juvenile hormone mimic being on average only slightly heavier of the two groups. Though there was no significant difference in weight, there seemed to be a difference between the two groups as the caterpillars in the control group had begun pupating into adults, but the caterpillars who were fed juvenile hormone mimic had not begun to pupate. This evidence suggests that Juvenile hormone has the main effect of stimulating growth in Manduca sexta, while simultaneously hindering the caterpillars from pupating. These findings seem to coincide with the findings of other research, which also suggested that the hormone has a hand in determining when caterpillars decide to pupate [Nijhout: 1974]. It would be interesting to expand the research on this topic to possibly cover how different timings of introduction of Juvenile hormone into the diet of Manduca would affect the caterpillars. For example, a future experiment could compare the effects of introducing the hormone mimic into the diet in the first instar stage against introducing it at later stages. This would allow researchers to determine when introduction of the hormone mimic has the most effect in a negative manor for the caterpillars, allowing tobacco farmers to know when is the best time to treat their crops with pesticide to protect against damage caused by Manduca larva.
