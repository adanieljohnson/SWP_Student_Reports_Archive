Title: The Effects of Tank Space on Aggression between Male Betta Fish (Betta Splendens)

Abstract:
In this lab we studied environmental conditions and stimuli by examining the effects that tank size, or swimming space, has on the levels of aggressiveness displayed by male betta fish (Betta splendens) when placed in the same tank together. Our experiment tested this by placing pairs of male betta fish together in both small and large tanks, tracking each observed instance of aggression, and converting these instances to an aggression score based upon a point-based ranking of the severity of various behaviors. This supported the original hypothesis that the increased swimming space available to the bettas in large tanks results in lower levels of aggression due to their ability to more easily maintain distance from one another.

Introduction:
Animal behavior is informed in large part by both the state of conditions and the presence of stimuli within the animal’s environment. In this experiment we sought to study the differences in levels of aggressive behaviors between male betta fish in differing environments. We chose tank size, or swimming space, as the independent variable in our study, observing differences in the fish and their interactions with one another when placed in tanks of varying sizes. Based upon earlier observations of betta fish behavior, wherein the fish became more aggressive as they came closer in proximity to one another, we expected to find that the bettas’ rates of aggression would decrease with an increase in tank size.

Materials and Methods:
Materials needed:
•	Six male betta fish
•	One 2.5 gallon tank
•	One 10 gallon tank
Steps:
1.	Create three pairs of betta fish and label their tanks.
2.	Fill one 2.5 gallon tank and one 10 gallon tank approximately 1/3 of the way with water.
3.	Place the first pair of betta fish in the 2.5 gallon tank for 5 minutes. Record every instance of displayed aggression, being sure to note the duration of each.
4.	Repeat step 3 for the second pair, then the third pair.
5.	Place the same first pair of betta fish in the 10 gallon tank for 5 minutes. Record every instance of displayed aggression, being sure to note the duration of each.
6.	Repeat step 5 for the second pair, then the third pair.
7.	Record all data in excel


Results:
In order to quantify the displays of aggression and calculate the aggression score for each fish we used a system of three levels of aggression. The first level included the behaviors of pelvic fin flickering and erected pectoral fins. Level 1 behaviors were counted as 1 point per each second that behavior was displayed. Level 2 behaviors included tail beating and spread gill covers. Level 2 behaviors were counted as 2 points per each second that behavior was displayed. Level 3 behaviors included tail flashing and red mane. Level 3 behaviors were counted as 3 points per each second that behavior was displayed. The sum of a betta’s total points for the 5 minutes constitutes his aggression score.
As can be seen in Figure 1, the aggression scores for the small tank ranged from 8.9 to 46.1, while the aggression scores for the large tank ranged from 0.5 to 3.7. The scores relative to one another were not consistent across different tank sizes, with the orange betta having a disproportionately high score relative to the other bettas in the small tank, but only having the second highest score in the large tank.


Discussion:
The original hypothesis, which stated a larger tank size would result in a lower level of aggression among male betta fish was supported by our results. For every single fish, the level of aggression was drastically lower in the large tank than it was in the small. We observed that the bettas tended to occupy opposite ends of the large tank, but tended to remain in close proximity to one another in the small tank. Additionally, the signs of aggression that were shown in the large tank were more likely to be level 1 displays than were those shown in the small tank.
This seems to indicate that these bettas were rather averse to fighting, generally staying away from one another when it was an option, and only choosing to confront one another when they were in too close of proximity.
A modification of this experiment might include a larger variety of tank sizes or shapes in order to further test the relationship between aggression and swimming space, and to test whether or not the shape of the tank, or the way in which swimming space is allocated, has an effect on the aggression levels of the betta fish.
