Title: The Effects of AZA Guard on Manduca sexta Development from Larval to Pupal Stages

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, commonly named the tobacco hornworm, is in its larval stage considered an agricultural pest.  However, mature adults of its species do not feed on crops of tobacco, tomato, or potatoes, unlike their larval counterparts. Thus, numerous experiments have been conducted to investigate the effects of hormonal manipulation on Manduca sexta maturation stages. Hormones regulate integral development stages through the maturation process from larvae to adulthood in living organisms. In the Manduca sexta, both Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysone are necessary during this period of development from larvae to fully-mature organisms. In this experiment, the effects of Ecdysone were indirectly determined by the use of Ecdysone inhibitor AZA guard on four specimens of Manduca sexta in the larval stage, to see if Ecdysone could be used as an effective form of pest control in preventing growth and development of the specimens. This experiment was carried out over the course of eight days, with one treatment feeding group with AZA guard mixed into the food and one control treatment feeding group with distilled water mixed into the food to form conditions supportive of viable data.  This was done under the hypothesis that the administration of AZA guard would prevent the treatment group

Introduction:
Manduca sexta are known for being pests, as a result of their destructive feeding behaviors, in early stages of development. Much endocrine research has been conducted on these “voracious feeders” to prevent them from maturing and causing “significant economic damage to tobacco crops and occasionally tomato and potato crops”[Byron: 2017] In this experiment researchers attempted to prevent larvae from maturing to adulthood. The Manduca sexta undergoes 8 stages of development spurred by hormonal interactions. Two of these hormones include Ecdysone (E20) and Juvenile hormone. E20 functions to regulate timing of molting, while Juvenile Hormone serves to regulate the type of molting. Juvenile hormone, secreted by the Corpus Allata, presents its highest levels at the 4th larva stage and then decreases until a peak that lasts from the 5th larval stage to pupal eclosion. Ecdysone’s highest levels, however, are presented right before the larval eclosion. Ecdysone spikes to signal molting, and maintains high levels in the time span from pupa to adult. In this experiment, the researchers employed the use of AZA guard, which is an E20 inhibitor. This was done to investigate the effect of the hormone E20 inhibitor on the development, specifically the weight of the caterpillars. Since Ecdysone is integral in the transition between a larva and adult organism, we hypothesized that due to the use of E20 inhibitor AZA guard, the experimental group of caterpillars would not molt and would be significantly smaller (weigh less) than their control group counterparts.

Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were selected and divided into one control group and one treatment group. 2 plastic containers, divided into 4 sections each, were prepared. Holes (2 in each section) were poked in the containers. 40g of solid food was weighed, then 100 µl of distilled water were mixed into the food. 10 grams of the wet food mixture were placed in each partition of the control container, coagulated in a corner to prevent drying out. This process was repeated with 40 grams more of food, with the exception of substituting 1:1250 AZA Guard for distilled water. This second batch of food was divided into 10 gram servings and placed in the 4 partitions of the Experimental container. The Manduca sexta caterpillars’ individual masses were recorded. Every day for 1 week, the two types of food were prepared and distributed in kind to the Manduca sexta, after the containers had been cleaned of residual food and waste. During this process, the caterpillars’ masses were recorded. The containers holding the caterpillars were placed in an incubator during the week that was held at a constant 28 degrees Celsius, with access to consistent light for 24 hours per day.  The mass of each caterpillar was recorded each day, and an average weight per day calculated for both the control and treatment groups. These mean weights are displayed in Table 1. The final mass means of both the control and treatment groups (see Table 1) were then statistically analyzed using a 2-Sample T-Test, with an α-value of 0.05. 

Results:
In the treatment group containers, on the eighth and final day of collecting data, the amount of food consumed was far less than that of food consumed in the control containers. The Manduca sexta treated with E20 appeared noticeably more sluggish and listless than their control counterparts. Although the initial mean mass of the treatment group was larger than that of the control group, over the course of the 8 days of the experiment the control group’s daily average masses surpassed those of the treatment group, as is represented in Figure 1. The average final mass of the control group was 11.245 g, while the average final mass of the treatment group was 4.775, as is displayed in Figure 1. The 2-Sample T-Test of the two final mean masses yielded a P-value of 0.007463. The P-Value was less than the α -value of 0.05, and thus was deemed statistically significant. Thus, the difference in the final weights of the control group and treatment group was significant.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the administration of Ecdysone inhibitor AZA guard would decrease the Manduca sextas’ growth and development, and consequential weight, was supported by the finding that the difference between the final average masses of the treatment and control groups was statistically significant. This serves to support the concept that Ecdysone plays an integral role in Manduca sexta maturation, grow and development, because the treatment group did not mature and grow as large as the control group. Without the exposure to Ecdysone, the Manduca sexta ate less, grew less, and developed less. This also supports the notion that Ecdysone inhibitor would be a decent pesticide; while it did not kill the Manduca sexta, the specimens consumed far less food than their control counterparts, which could drastically reduce crops lost to Manduca sexta larva in agriculture. While the results gathered from eight days of observations and recorded data were statistically significant, the investigation could be furthered through conducting more of the same and similar research for extended periods of time. The longer the time span the Manduca sextas would be exposed to the hormones, or lack thereof, the more conclusive data could be collected, and more convincing conclusions drawn. Another avenue of investigation could include manipulating endocrine levels of Juvenile Hormone, which in its own regard can be considered an Ecdysone inhibitor at specific intervals in the Manduca sexta maturation process. “Its presence during postembryonic development prevents the ecdysteroids from causing a switch in differentiative program from larval to pupal or from pupal to adult”[Riddiford, Lynn M: 2006]. Increased Juvenile Hormone’s affects on Manduca sexta could be tested and the data compared to the results collected from directly administering an Ecdysone inhibitor. This would further extend and develop the investigation into endocrinal manipulation of the Manduca sexta development process.
