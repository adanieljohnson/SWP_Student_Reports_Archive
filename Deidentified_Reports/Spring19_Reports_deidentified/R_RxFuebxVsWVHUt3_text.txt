Title: Resource allocation of nitrogen in Raphanus sativus and its effect on phenotypic plasticity

Abstract:
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for the photosynthetic and respiratory functions in plants. However, when nitrogen or other resources are limited by environmental conditions, a plant must allocate its resources to the organ where its resources can be utilized most efficiently. In this study, we investigated how varied soil nitrogen levels affected the resource allocation and resulting phenotypic plasticity in Raphanus sativus or radish plants. We had one controll group (contained no added nitrate in the soil) and two experimental groups (one low nitrate group with 2 grams of nitrate and one high nitrate group with 7 grams of nitrate). After 14 days, individual replicates were separated and masses of the whole replicate, its roots, and its shoots were measured. The root to shoot average ratio was calculated and an ANOVA and Turkey- Kramer tests were conducted. These tests revealed that there was a significent difference in the root to shoot ratio of the no nitrate group vs the low and high nitrate groups. These results suggest the radish plants allocated their resources toward the shoots (leaves and stem) because the roots did not need additional resources to absorb nitrogen that was already available.

Introduction:
Plants require several essential resources in order to survive, grow, and reproduce. These resources include solar energy, carbon dioxide, and nutrients from the soil including nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and sulfur. However, based on a plant’s environment, these resources are limited. As a result of competition and a limitation of resources, plant species have developed a unique system to allocate their resources to each organ [Johnson: 2018].

In allocating their resources, plants are forced to make certain trade-offs when they spend more resources in one stage of their life cycle more than others. These trade-offs cause a deviation from the plant’s predetermined genotype. This deviation causes phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of a plant to alter their expressed phenotype, regardless of their genetic code. The change in the phenotype allows the plant to operate most efficiently and adapt to an environment [Johnson: 2018].

Nitrogen is one of these resources essential to the growth and reproduction of plants. It is one of the key building blocks of enzymes, genetic structures, and cellular systems. Nitrogen also is an important element in photosynthetic and respiratory processes [Zhang: 2017]. Due to the importance of nitrogen in plant growth processes, allocation of nitrogen can be assessed by measuring the biomass of the plant’s roots and shoots (includes the stem and leaves) [Johnson: 2018].  

Due to the significent role of nitrogen in a plant’s survival and growth, we predicted that there would be a significent difference between the root to shoot ratio of plants grown with no added nitrate and the plants grown under low and high nitrate conditions. Our independent variable was the amount of nitrate added to the soil and our dependent variable was the mass difference of root to shoot ratio between the three treatment groups.  The results acquired from this study will be useful in determining the impact of nitrogen on plant growth and yields. 

Materials and Method:
We planted a total of 6 plots beginning by filling each plot halfway with vermiculite. The vermiculite​ was generously wetted. We then added the nitrate pellets in three amounts. Two plots served as the controll group and received 0 grams of nitrate pellets. Two additional plots each received 2 grams of nitrate pellets and functioned as the low nitrate experimental group. Finally, two plots were each given 7 grams of nitrate pellets in each plot and functioned as the high nitrate experimental group. The nitrogen pellets were covered with additional vermiculite. The presoaked radish seeds were pushed into the top layer of soil, each plot containing a generous and equal amount of seeds. Each plot was initially given 50 Ml of Miracle- Grow and 200 Ml of water. Plants were grown for 14 days in a greenhouse. Each plot was given 200 Ml of water each day and kept under equal conditions with equivalent amounts of sunlight, water, and CO2 levels. 

After 14 days, the plants were removed from the greenhouse to be evaluated. To obtain individual replicates, the entire plot was placed in a tub of water to loosen the vermiculite. Individual replicates were carefully removed in order to ensure that no roots or shoots were broken off. Individual replicates were chosen at random. For each of the three conditions, 18 replicates were chosen, 9 from each plot (N=54 replicate samples total). Each replicate was dried thoroughly and weighed as a whole. Then, each replicate was carefully cut at the root-shoot junction and the roots and shoots were weighed separately. 

The root to shoot ratio of the controll group (0 grams of nitrate added) and the 2 experimental groups (2 grams of nitrate and 7 grams of nitrate added) were analyzed and compared through an ANOVA and Turkey- Kramer test.

Results:
From the averaged data (Figure 1), it is clear that there is a difference between average root to shoot mass of the no nitrate group and the high and low nitrate groups. The no nitrate group had an average root to shoot ratio mass of 0.12 ± 0.04 grams. The low nitrate group had a root to shoot ratio mass of 0.08 ± 0.01 grams and the high nitrate group had a ratio of 0.08 ± 0.02 grams. Directionally, Figure 1 shows the root to shoot ratio is much higher in the no nitrate groups when compared to the low and high nitrate groups. 

Our one- way ANOVA test showed there was a significent difference (P=0.02) between the average root to shoot ratio of the no nitrate group and the root to shoot ratio of the low and high nitrate groups. The Turkey- Kramer test (the minimum significent difference test) showed that there was a significent difference between the no nitrate and low nitrate groups. It also showed there was a significent difference between the no nitrate and the high nitrate groups. However, the Turkey- Kramer test found no significent difference between the low nitrate and high nitrate groups.

Discussion:
Our results confirmed our hypothesis and showed that there was a significent difference between the root to shoot ratio of plants grown with no added nitrate and the plants grown under low and high nitrate conditions. A shown by our data, the root to shoot mass ratio in the no nitrate group was much higher than the two experimental groups. This indicates that the roots had a greater biomass relative to the shoot biomass in the controll group. Because there was no nitrate in the soil, a greater share of the plant’s resources was directed towards the roots to absorb all available resources. These results agree with earlier studies conducted on sorghum that show that nitrogen deficiencies significently reduced leaf area and photosynthetic rate and increased root length [Zhao: 2004]. This study also found that nitrogen deficiencies most significently affected the biomass of the plant’s shoots rather than the plant’s roots [Zhao: 2004]. This is reflected in our results when the mass of shoots showed much more variance between treatment groups than the mass of roots. 

On the other hand, plants in the experimental groups (low nitrate and high nitrate) had significently lower root to shoot mass ratios than the controll. The experimental groups had a ready, available supply of nitrate. Acquisition of nitrate from the soil was relatively undemanding and did not require large amounts of the plant’s energy, therefore it was unnecessary to designate resources to the roots of the plant. It is important to remember that plants allocate resources to the organ that will most aid in their survival and reproduction [Johnson: 2018].  Therefore, the plant allocates resources towards its shoots (stems and leaves) to expend energy on growth and reproduction rather than the collection of nutrients from the soil [Johnson: 2018]. This is consistent with other studies conducted on China’s nitrogen rich forests and grasslands in which allocation was measured in a more direct manner through the extraction of nutrient levels from each plant organ [Zhang: 2017]. This study found that leaves received the highest allocation of the plant’s resources because of their important role in photosynthesis and respiration [Zhang: 2017]. Roots required significently less energy in their roles of absorbing the already plentiful nutrients, therefore, their nutrient levels were significently lower than the leaves [Zhang: 2017]. Although this study was conducted in grassland and forest environments, nitrogen rich conditions were mimicked, and similar results were found. 

To further support and reinforce the validity of the results of this study, the original procedure can be modified to achieve additional valuable and applicable results. For example, a greater number of replicates from each plot could be collected in order to gather a larger pool of data and stabilize for outliers. Additionally, the measure of resource allocation could include the direct measure of nutrients in each plant organ. The procedure of this study could also be modified to test the impact of an excess of other nutrients in the soil such as phosphorous, potassium, and sulfur. 

From this study, we can conclude that a plant possesses a considerable response to the biotic and abiotic factors in its environment. This basic assumption has many practical applications.  Farmers can use this information to achieve higher plant yields given specific nutrient levels. Growers could also achieve a desired plant phenotype through precise controll of the plant’s environment and nutrient levels. Additionally, farming industries would be able to determine the precise amount of nitrogen needed for plant growth. This would allow farmers to maximize nitrogen and other resources, prevent waste of resources, and avoid pollution of the surrounding environment from excessive chemical use.
