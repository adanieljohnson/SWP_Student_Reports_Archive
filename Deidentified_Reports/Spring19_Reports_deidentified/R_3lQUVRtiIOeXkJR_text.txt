Title: Increases in Levels of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta Larvae Lead to Growth and Developmental Effects which Prevent Larvae from Pupation 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, a type of insect which progresses from larvae to adult via metamorphosis during pupation, employs two hormones of interest during this metamorphosis: ecdysone (E20) and juvenile hormone (JH), the latter of which and its effects on pupation are the primary focus of this experiment. In this experiment, JH levels in a group of juvenile Manduca sexta were experimentally increased in order to determine its effects on the growth and development of the larvae. PreCore 1:1250 solution was added to the diet of the treatment group of larvae, and it was determined that the hypothesis, that increased levels of JH would prolong the fifth instar stage of larval development to the extent that the larvae would fail to pupate, was supported. While three out of four of the control group larvae had begun the pupation process by the termination of this experiment, none of the four treatment larvae showed any sign of pupation at the end of the 12-day experimental period. It was found that the treatment larvae increased in length more than the control larvae (0.9088, 24, 0.3725); additionally, the treatment larvae increased in weight more than the control larvae (1.000, 24, 0.3270).

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, a type of insect which progresses from larvae to adult via metamorphosis during pupation, employs two hormones of interest during this metamorphosis: ecdysone (E20) and juvenile hormone (JH), the latter of which and its effects on pupation are the primary focus of this experiment. In this experiment, JH levels in a group of juvenile Manduca sexta were experimentally increased in order to determine its effects on the growth and development of the larvae. PreCore 1:1250 solution was added to the diet of the treatment group of larvae, and it was determined that the hypothesis, that increased levels of JH would prolong the fifth instar stage of larval development to the extent that the larvae would fail to pupate, was supported. While three out of four of the control group larvae had begun the pupation process by the termination of this experiment, none of the four treatment larvae showed any sign of pupation at the end of the 12-day experimental period. It was found that the treatment larvae increased in length more than the control larvae (0.9088, 24, 0.3725); additionally, the treatment larvae increased in weight more than the control larvae (1.000, 24, 0.3270). Thus, it was determined that the heightened levels of JH in the treatment group larvae caused a lack of commitment pulse which not only caused the larvae to molt into a “sixth instar,” in other words, grow larger, but also prevented the treatment larvae from molting into the pupal stage. 


The Manduca sexta is a species of insect which follows a homometabolous growth cycle. This growth mechanism consists of four life stages: an egg stage followed by a larval stage with five growth instars,  a pupation, and finally, the emergence of the adult organism, as shown in the figure below (Johnson: 8). This particular species produces two hormones of interest which greatly impact the growth and development of the larvae: ecdysone (E20) and juvenile hormone (JH). E20 is a type of steroid hormone produced by the prothoracic glands of the larvae, and it mediates the timing of the molt in larvae (Johnson: 11). JH is produced in the corpus allata, a pair of glands located on the abdomen of the larvae, and it is responsible for controlling the type of molt the larvae participates in; in other words, JH determines whether a larvae molts into another instar, or larval stage, or if it molts into a pupa (Johnson: 11). This quality of JH is what this experiment aims to explore. 
	While each hormone is secreted independently of each other, E20 and JH work together in the maturation of larvae to adult. The concentrations of E20 and JH relative to each other determine when a larva moves from the fifth larval instar to the pupal stage. During this critical period, the concentrations of JH and E20 are very low and close together, with a sudden decline in JH followed by a very small spike in JH levels known as the commitment pulse (Sanburg: 873). The presence of the commitment pulse causes the larva to pupate, thus beginning its metamorphosis into an adult (Nijhout: 214). The object of this experiment is to manipulate the levels of JH in juvenile Manduca sexta in order to more fully understand the role of JH on development, specifically the pupal transition from larva to adult. This experimental design will involve administration of additional JH to a treatment group of Manduca sexta larvae to increase their levels of JH relative to an untreated control group. It is hypothesized that increasing the levels of JH in Manduca sexta larvae will prolong the larval stage to the extent that the larvae will ultimately fail to pupate.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, eight Manduca sexta larvae were arbitrarily divided into two groups of four larvae each; one group was designated as the control and the other was designated as the group to receive treatment. The control group was fed ten grams of appropriate diet prepared according to the package instructions, and the treatment group was fed ten grams of appropriate diet with six added drops of PreCore 1:1250 solution, which was the source of JH used in this experiment. Each larva was weighed and measured each day, and each measurement was recorded. All larvae were kept in identical conditions of a 12 hour light, 12 hour dark schedule at a constant temperature. The statistical test used to determine the extent of correlation between increased levels of JH and effects on the growth of the larvae was a two-tailed T-test. 

Results:
In general, the treatment group gained more weight and increased in length more than the control group, which is shown in the table of average values below.
By the 12th day, two of the four control group larvae were fully pupated, and one was partially pupated. In comparison, by the 12th day, none of the four treatment group larvae had begun to pupate. Treatment group larva T7 began to look much paler than the other treatment group larvae on the seventh day, and continued to be more white than blue throughout the course of the experiment.
	Overall, a noticeable data trend was that the daily growth, both in length and weight, of the control group increased until about the seventh or eighth day, then began to decrease again, while in general the daily growth of the treatment group increased throughout the course of the experiment. These observations are quantified in the following figures.The statistical test chosen for this experiment was a two-sample t-test in order to compare data between the control group and the treatment group. This test supported the general trends described above, such as the increased weight gain by the treatment group as compared to the control group (1.000, 24, 0.3270). Additionally, the observation that the treatment group increased in length more than the control group was supported by statistical values (0.9088, 24, 0.3725).


Discussion:
Prior to beginning the experiment, it was hypothesized that increasing the levels of JH in Manduca sexta larvae would disrupt the life cycle of the larvae such that the larvae would fail to pupate. While three out of four of the control group larvae had at least begun the pupation process, which was evident by the presence of a dark brown, hard cuticle, none of the four treatment group larvae showed any signs of pupation by the conclusion of the experiment. Thus, it can be said that the hypothesis was supported in that regard, but attention will now be turned to attempting to determine why this was the case. 
	As stated previously, the treatment group of larvae received added JH through their diet, which increased the levels of circulating JH in the organisms relative to the control group, which received no added JH. In the control group, since JH levels were not manipulated, it can be assumed that the typical hormonal levels for a juvenile Manduca sexta were present, as shown in the figure below.
As shown by the figure, point B indicates the commitment pulse, which is characterized by low levels of JH and E20 relative to prior hormone levels. Thus, since three out of four of the control group larvae had begun pupation by the termination of the experiment, it can be assumed that the commitment pulse occurred in the control group larvae in order to induce pupation. Therefore, it follows that the low levels of JH required for the commitment pulse to occur were precluded by the increased levels of JH in the treatment group larvae. Heightened levels of JH throughout the experiment prevented the commitment pulse from occurring, which in turn prevented the larvae from pupating normally. Indeed, this can also be used to explain another general phenomenon observed and previously recorded but not explained: the treatment group larvae were generally larger in length and weight than the control group. Since the treatment group continued to experience high levels of JH throughout the course of the experiment and thus never experienced a commitment pulse, the larvae continued to grow and thus molted into a “sixth instar” instead of molting into a pupa. 
	Additional literature exists supporting these results, most notably another experiment concluding that increasing levels of JH in fifth instar Manduca sexta larvae was successful in extending the larval period and thus preventing the start of the pupation stage (Nijout: 498). Such findings add weight to the results of the present experiment, especially in light of the fact that the original hypothesis, that increased JH levels were somehow related to delayed or failed pupation in larvae, was not only supported but able to be explained in this case. In understanding the role of JH in the commitment pulse and its purpose in transitioning the larvae from juvenile to adult, it can be understood that the manipulation of JH levels will indeed affect the pupation of the Manduca sexta larvae; in this case, increased JH did in fact prolong the larval phase such that the larvae failed to pupate. 
	Although this experiment concludes with promising results, there are still other factors and further directions of study that attract interest, most namely, how will manipulated levels of not only JH but also E20 affect a larva’s maturation from juvenile to adult? Perhaps the next step in the exploration of the role of E20 and JH on the life cycle of the Manduca sexta is to critically examine not only the nature of each hormone and its impact on the organism but also how these hormones work together to facilitate normal growth and development of larvae. This intriguing issue is one that could potentially be explored in the future, perhaps with manipulation of JH and E20 levels in conjunction with each other. In any case, it can be said that the results of the present experiment certainly open the door to further studies into the effects of E20 and JH on the maturation and life cycle of the Manduca sexta larvae.
