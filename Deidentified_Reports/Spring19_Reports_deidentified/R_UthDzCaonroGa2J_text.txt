Title: The Insignificent Effect of Shelter on Betta splendins' Aggressive Behavior

Abstract:
Aggressive behavior is displayed when animals hunt or defend themselves from other animals of different species. Intraspecific behavior is the social interaction and species recognition of one species with the same species. Aggression is a common animal behavior to study because it takes a variety of forms. Territory behavior is an indicator of aggression between their own species or different species. Betta splendins are great animals to study intraspecific behavior due to their colorful array. In this lab, we quantified aggressive behavior to examine the effects of territory on Betta splendins, due to the notably displayed territorial behavior by Betta. We used eight different Betta fish, four being exposed to the rock before the other fish was revealed to them and four being exposed to the rock after. We used a one-tailed paired t_test to examine the results. It was found that there was no significent difference between aggressive behavior with or without shelter on the Betta splendins. The shelter did not have an effect on the aggressive behavior because it has been previously shown that Betta could have not accommodated to the rock long enough or the rock did not have an effect on the Betta.

Introduction:
Intraspecific behavior is a behavior in animal population, where members of the same species display social interaction, specifically aggression, sexual activity, and species recognition. Intraspecific behaviors have been previously studied due to the fact that it defines the stimuli’s which is initiated and maintained during a particular animal behavior [Johnson: 1973]. Intraspecific behavior protects the species from being attacked by their own species but on the other hand, uses a lot of the fish’s energy to display and maintain these behaviors. When displaying aggressive behavior, the fish chooses to expunge its own energy to protect himself from predators.  Betta splendins, otherwise known as Siamese fighting fish, are used to study intraspecific behavior due to their colorful array in the proximity of their own species. Betta can respond to other’s agnostic behavior by ignoring it, matching it or fleeing it.  Betta splendins are good species to study animal behavior because they display two main observable types of movements when aggressive; broadside and facing movement. Betta splendins have been shown to be very territorial animals and thus, use a lot of their own energy to display aggressive behavior to protect their territory from being attacked by their own/other species.  Territorial behavior is a crucial indicator of social grouping in many fish [Myberg: 1974]. Territory can be defined as food, shelter or a sexual partner and a male will show aggressive behavior when approached by an intruder. Betta fish will show either facing or broadside movement to show aggression to the fish intruder and protect its territory. A previous study showed that territorial males of a species of fish possessed social dominance over territory and defense of the intruder was present at the time [Myberg: 1974]. Another study examined the effects of territories with the formation of social groups [Goldstein: 1975]. This study found that physical distance was kept in between the Betta fish by showing brief facing movements. This proves that territorial aggressive behavior was not present, which was found surprising. This is because Bettas are very territorial animals and have been previously found to use their energy to protect their territory. Based on these studies, territory, a rock, was presented to one Betta splendins to examine the effect of aggressive behavior on the fish with the territory.  Since the territory will be approached by an intruder, it is hypothesized that the Betta splendins will show aggressive behavior to protect their shelter rather than risking themselves being attacked and not showing aggressive behavior. 

Materials and Method:
Betta splendins display two main observable types of movements when aggressive; broadside and facing movement. Broadside movements are displayed when the fish turns to its side to the opponent. Some behaviors associated with this movement is pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements are displayed when the fish is directly facing the other fish. Some behaviors associated with facing movement is pectoral fins erect, spreading of the gills and finally the most aggressive creating a red mane. Two Betta splendins were placed in two tanks with a glass and plastic partition in between the two Betta fish. They were rested for ten minutes and after the ten minutes, a rock was placed into one side of the tank with one Betta splendins. The Betta fish was allocated two minutes to accommodate to the rock and after the two minutes, the plastic partition was removed exposing the two Bettas to each other. For five minutes, the aggressive behavior of the Bettas with the rock was observed. The timing of red man and facing behavior was recorded as well as the frequency of tail beating. After the five minutes was done, the two Betta was rested for 10 minutes and the plastic partition was put back into the tank and the rock was removed. After the 10 minutes, the plastic partition was removed again and the aggressive behavior of the two Betta was recorded for five minutes. After the five minutes, the Betta fish were removed from the tanks. Two different Betta were brought into the tank and repeated the same trial as the above stated.  After the following trial was finished, two different Betta splendins were brought into the tank and they were allocated ten minutes for rest. After the ten minutes finished, the plastic partition was removed and the Bettas were exposed to each other and the same aggressive behavior was recorded for five minutes. The plastic partition was put between the two Bettas after five minutes and they were allowed to rest for ten minutes. The rock was introduced after ten minutes and the betta fish was allotted two minutes to adjust to the rock. For the next five minutes, aggressive behavior was recorded and observed. After the five minutes was done, the plastic partition was put back and the Betta fish were swapped out for new Betta fish. The trail was repeated for the new Betta fish. The mean values for the behaviors were found, and the standard deviation was determined from those values. A one-tailed paired t_test was conducted comparing the four different trails comparing the three different aggressive behaviors and 0.05 was used as the critical value. 

Results:
The time of the facing behavior before the shelter showed an average of 80.5±72.6223 seconds. The average of the after shelter facing behavior time was 109±65.52607 seconds. The average of the time, in seconds, of the red mane before the shelter was 64.625±56.1122. The average of time, in seconds, of the red mane after the shelter was 92.5±73.4342. The average of the frequency of tail beats before the shelter was 16.5±18.9473. tail beats The average of the frequency of tail beats before the shelter was 23.5±23.9513 tails beats. The results from the following experiment showed that the three different aggressive behavior of the four different trails on Betta splendins had no significent difference. The paired t_test of time of facing behavior concluded that there is no significent difference of behavior change with or without shelter on time of facing behavior (t-value:0.8699, d.f.:4, p:0.4484) (Figure 1). The paired t_test concluded that there is no significent difference of behavior change with or without shelter on time of red mane (t-value: 1.769, d.f.:4, p:0.1749) (Figure 1). The paired t_test concluded that there is no significent difference of behavior change with or without shelter on frequency on tail beating (t-value:0.6439, d.f.:4, p:0. 5654) (Figure 2).

Discussion:
Due to the non-statistically significent results, the hypothesis was not supported and the presence of the rock/shelter did not have an effect on facing behavior, red mane, and tail beats on the Betta splendins. In other words, the Betta splendins did not waste their own energy in producing aggressive behavior to protect their territory. A previous study found that out of sixteen fish with territory one fish did not fight, seven fish fought once, six fought twice, one fish fought three times, and one fish fought six-time [Goldstein: 1975]. Based on this previous study, half of the fish interacted in one fight showing there was not a lot of aggressive behavior shown between the two Betta fish. Furthermore, this study showed that the fish fought twice more than they displayed aggressive behavior [Goldstein: 1975]. This study proves that fish do not show a significent difference in territorial behavior due to the fact that half of the fish did not display aggressive behavior. This study helps justify that not all fish interact in intraspecific behaviors. This also means the Betta did not waste much energy on showing aggressive behavior but rather interact in a direct fight to reduce energy loss. Another study showed that it is not the presence or the absence of a nest but the interaction is based on a context-dependent fashion [Dzieweczynski: 2005]. These changes could be specific to different in the individual suggestion it is sensitive to the certain organism. These following studies could explain the non-statistically results of the different aggressive behaviors because the Betta fish could not have noticed the rock and/or the Betta fish does not show any aggressive behavior based on the individual aggression. Also, the Betta could have shown more aggressive behavior, specifically fighting, if the glass partition was not in between them. The Betta fish could have been more aggressive if they were given a chance to have physical contact with each other. The cost of being aggressive uses a lot of energy and if the fish could not interact in physical contact, the fish did not want to waste all the energy knowing it does not have to protect itself as much. The next steps for the study could involve removing the glass partition so the Betta fish could fight and not only display aggressive behavior but carry out their aggressive behavior. This could lead to more significent results because the Betta would have to use energy and decide if the cost outweighs the benefits and this could thus lead to better analyzed and observed results. Another step for the study is to have a larger rock in the tank and expose the rock for a longer time. This could help the fish accommodate to the rock and therefore have a more territorial behavior for the rock. An error is a study is the timing of the behavior due to unable to correctly see the behavior being started or finishing. Another error in the study could be that the Betta fish being tired the second round and therefore producing a skewed result because their aggressive behavior was less the second round. Overall, the understanding and observation of animal behavior are important because it allows scientists to better understand the stimulus and reactions of animals during the interaction of their own species.
