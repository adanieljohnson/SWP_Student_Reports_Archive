Title: Effect of IG Growth Hormone on Manduca Sexta Growth Patterns

Abstract:
The effect of hormones on organisms is an elusive, and important, topic of Biology. Hormones work simultaneously to regulate body functions, and their effects can be life altering. Studying hormones in lab is necessary to understand the way that they function, and how they help support life. It is important to understand how hormones will affect growth and development so that they may be manipulated to produce optimal outcomes in organisms. Here, we look at the effect of the IG regulator hormone on the growth patterns of the Manduca Sexta. The expectation was that the IG hormone would cause a significent change in growth pattern of the weight and length of the Manduca compared to growth without the hormone present. Our data showed that there was not a faster change in length and weight in the Manduca’s that had received the hormone.  This data, coupled with the observation that the Maduca Sexta species is extremely vulnerable to hormone imbalance, suggest that the IG growth hormone does not encourage rapid growth in the Manduca Sexta. This hormone response can be used to help promote Manduca growth in necessary situations, as there is a small difference in the controll and experimental groups, and, if possible, can be applied to growth hormones in other organisms.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the influence of growth hormones on insect development. Hormones chemically influence mammals and insects to stimulate the development of cells and tissues. They also function as chemical communication signals throughout the body, help maintain homeostasis, and help maintain regular body function. Hormones also move an organism form youth to adulthood. In the case of insects, hormones also signal when it is time to being molting. Molting is the process used to chemically signal that it is time to begin metamorphosis. Insect molting and metamorphosis are carried out by juvenile hormone and 20-hydroxyecdyson [Riddiford et al: 2003].Without the two hormones molting does not occur, and the insect is unable to move into adulthood. The rate of metamorphosis in Manduca is under continuous regulation by circulating ecdysteroids that promote development during the first third stage of adult life. As the Manduca develops, the ecdysteroids become more crucial in development [Schwartz and Truman: 1983]. All of the aforementioned hormones work in conjunction with one another to bring the Manduca into adulthood and regulate size and morphology. The effects of these hormones, while obvious during molting, may be observed during the entirety of the Manduca’s lifecycle and have lasting effects on the organism [Jesudason et al: 1990]. These caterpillars are the optimal model organism because their hormone regulation method have been studied at length and their life cycle can be easily followed. Because of this, their hormone levels are easy to manipulate to get a desired result. This experiment was specifically designed to test the effect of the IG hormone on development  because discovering the functionality of the IG hormone was the primary objective of the experiment. Since the IG hormone was discovered in the linden bug, it has been used to study the effect that it has on body functions [Smykal et al: 2014]. The Manduca sexta, will be treated with IG growth regulator hormone and its weight and length will be monitored. It is hypothesized that the addition of growth hormone will cause a significent change in the growth patterns of the Manduca Sexta. The hormone does not regulate the stages of development, like the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone, so it is uncertain what exactly the effect of the hormone will be. However, with the knowledge that the Manduca is extremely sensitive to hormone manipulation, it can be inferred that some change will occur in the growth patterns. 

Materials and Method:
Manducas were originally selected, weighed, measured, and then placed into eight individual cells. Each Manduca was given ten grams of treated food in their cells. Every 10 grams of food was treated with four drops of the IG growth regulator-hormone. The cells were placed in a temperature-controllled incubator of 23 Celsius. The controll group was given ten grams of food that was not treated with any kind of hormone. The caterpillars were monitored daily for two weeks. Food was replaced, and cells were cleaned as necessary. After one week, the Manduca’s were weighed and measured to ensure growth. Each Manduca was weighed using a standard balance and measured using a standard ruler. After two weeks, final measurements were taken from each organism. The weight and length were recorded. After final measurements were taken and compared to the initial height and weight of the Manducas, statistical analysis was conducted using the data. A two-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine differences in the average lengths and weights of the caterpillars given the IG hormone compared to the ones that were fed untreated food.


Results:
The mean weight gain for the controll group of Manduca’s was 4.95 grams, while the hormone treated group had an average weight change of 11.08 grams. (Fig. 1) The mean length change for the controll group of Manduca’s was 22.5 mm, while the hormone treated group had an average length change of 45mm (Fig 2). The standard deviation for mass in the controll Manducas was .521 and the standard deviation for mass in the experimental Manduca’s was 3.227 (Fig. 1) The standard deviation for length in the controll Manducas was 4.49 and the standard deviation for length in the experimental Manduca’s was 12.32(Fig. 2) We used a two-sample t_test to interpret our results. The data for the change in length of the Manduca is as follows, (p-stat = 0.000317, t_stat = 4.73952, d.f. = 14). The data for the change in weight of the Manduca is as follows, (p-stat = 0.000207, t_stat = 4.967407, d.f. = 14).  When observing the controll group, changes in weight (avg. 4.95 g) and length (avg 22.5 mm) were also observed, however the changes were less exaggerated (Figs. 1 and 2). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that there would be a significent change in weight and length of the caterpillars who were fed the IG hormone, was supported. The two-tailed t test had a value lower than .05 for both the change in length and change in weight between the hormone treated and controll groups. These low values suggest that there is a significent statistical difference in the change of both weight and height between the Manduca’s that received the IG hormone compared to the Manducas that did not receive anything in their food. A significent increase in growth was observed in both the controll and hormone test groups, however the Manduca’s grew much faster with the hormone present. This suggests that outside environmental factors did not contribute to the growth of the Manduca and the hormone alone, played a significent role in the development of the caterpillar and the IG hormone played a significent role in the growth and development of the Manduca Sexta. Additionally, a past study found that, in human cells, IG growth hormones increased uptake of thymidine which is used to synchronize and regulate growth. The effect of the  IG hormones caused human cells to grow at a faster rate than usual. [Kimata and Yoshida: 1994] The findings from the previous experiment are consistent with the findings from the experiment conducted in lab using the Manduca Sexta. This further proves that IG hormones play a crucial role in the growth and development of cells. Understanding the role that IG regulator growth hormones play will help scientists better understand the essential, yet delicate role that hormones play in the development of insects.
