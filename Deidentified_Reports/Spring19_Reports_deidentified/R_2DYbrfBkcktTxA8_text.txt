Title: Root:Shoot Ratio for Avena sativa Illustrates Resource Allocation

Abstract:
Resource allocation for plants is a method used to combat the problem of limited resources: being water, sunlight, or nutrients. These limitations often vary from location to location, as different environments bring different challenges for various plants. This can be examined in our experiment as we examined the root:shoot ratios of Avena sativa. Originally, we hypothesized that the plants in a higher temperature environment would have a larger ratio. To test this, we measured both the weight and lengths of three plants from a high temperature environment and three from a room temperature environment. From here, we can compare the two root:shoot ratios to see how the two environments made the oat plants allocate their resources differently. The results concluded that the plants in room temperature conditions had a larger ratio for both weight and length. Furthermore, a two-sampled t-test was run for both sets of data to compare our experimental to our control, and was deemed statistically significant. Because our hypothesis was not supported, various conclusions can be made to assess what could have went wrong and how this pertains to large-scale crop harvesting.


Introduction:
In every ecological community, plants and animals must interact with one another to mutually benefit each other. This in turn, allows for a more efficient, resourceful community as a whole. There are a variety of factors that can impact this. These factors can either come from other living organisms known as biotic factors, or they can come from non-living organisms, known as abiotic factors. At the center of every ecological community is the plants that provide the foundation for other organisms to grow and develop. The type of plant, the interactions between plants and animals, and the lack of certain plants directly shape the community. However, there are resource limitations that affect plant communities. These limitations prevent plants from having unlimited amounts of sunlight, nutrients, or water. Each limitation varies from location to location, as there are different limitations for different climates, environments, and for every community. To combat this problem of scarcity of resources, plants must allocate their resources that best promotes their survival. Meaning, plants have to adapt to the environment around them by trading off less valuable resources for those that will benefit them more. This experiment will specifically look at how these differences attribute to varying development of Avena sativa roots and shoots. 
	There have been separate studies conducted on crop development. One of these shows the effects of cattle grazing and machine grazing to increase water irrigation to various crop plants: one of these being oats. Furthermore, this study examines important factors that attribute to better crop yield and how exactly these plants develop in a crop-livestock system. It concludes that the better product rate comes from systems that are grazed more often than not [Bonetti: 2019]. These oat plants that are provided an abundance of water and attention seem to have the best growth rate. This is worthy of mention in hopes to explain the best possible source of care that oat plants must have to have the best growth rate success. Along with that, it helps provide background as to the type of resources needed for these plants to flourish.
A root:shoot ratio can be used to examine where plants are allocating their resources in a given environment. Typically, plants with large root:shoot ratios tend to live in environments that are arid, or have water as a scarcity. These plants have to maximize their root length and surface area to obtain enough water and nutrients from the soil, because it is often rare. Plants with a smaller root:shoot ratio tend to live in environments where lack of water is not a problem, but sunlight is. Examples of these environments are either large forestry or a rain forest. The same concept can be applied here, as these plants must compete for sunlight because the canopy is often dense and large. Their shoots would presumably be larger than their roots in this case, lowering their root:shoot ratio. In our experiment, we observed how oat plant’s root:shoot ratios would differ in two different environments. One in room temperature, and one in an incubator at a “hot” temperature. The same concepts previously mentioned can be applied to our experiment, as we simulated what would happen to oat plants root:shoot ratio when put into a hotter environment. From here, we hypothesized that the plants in the hot temperature incubator would have a larger root:shoot ratio, than those in the room temperature environment. 


Materials and Methods:
Six pots were obtained and filled to the top with vermiculite and pre-watered with approximately 500 mL of water and 50 mL of Miracle Gro. Approximately 90 oat seeds were soaked in water for 30 minutes prior to planting them. After the seeds were fully soaked in water, they were planted in each of the pots, around 15 seeds per pot. The pots were then divided up into two groups of three. The first group of three was labeled as control and was put into the greenhouse at room temperature. The second group was labeled as experimental and put into the incubator to simulate a hot temperature environment. These pots were both watered once a day with 500 ml of water for two weeks. After two weeks, data for each plant was collected. This was done by dumping out the experimental group first into a bucket of water to separate each of the plants from one another. This was repeated with the control group in room temperature afterwards. We collected three plants from both the experimental and the control. The total mass of the individual plant was first measured (in grams) on a scale. Then, the plant was cut above the oat to separate the shoots from the roots. Each root and shoot was weighed (in grams) and then measured for length (in cm). After data collection, the work area for data collection was cleaned up and wiped down. From here, a root:shoot ratio was calculated along with a standard deviation for each group. Lastly, a two-sampled t-test was run to determine statistical significance for each group. 


Results:
The results of this lab concluded that the largest root:shoot ratios for both the weight and length were the oat plants in room temperature. This can be seen in Figures 1 and 2. The mean weight root:shoot ratio for room temperature was 0.459 +/- 0.0321 and the high temperature was 0.208 +/- 0.0598. For the mean length root:shoot ratio for room temperature oats was 0.948 +/- 0.119 and the high temperature mean was 0.336 +/-  0.146.  Along with that, a two-sampled t-test was run to determine statistical significance which gave the values for the weight group (t=6.41, df=4, p=0.003) and the values for the length group (t=5.63, df=4, p=0.0048). Both of these indicate significant difference from the control to the experimental.


Discussion:
After analyzing the results, it became evident that our original hypothesis was not supported. This is due to our results showing that the oat plants under hot temperatures had a smaller root:shoot ratio than those in a room temperature environment. However, our statistical analysis serves to show that this was not due to chance, we had statistical significance for both the weight and length root:shoot ratios. Meaning that there may have been a confounding variable that altered the results of this experiment. 
A possible explanation of this could be the concept of phototropism. That is, a plant’s ability to sense light and move towards the direction of it [Duchemin: 2018]. The plants in the hot temperature environment were underneath a heat lamp with a powerful bulb. This could have caused the phototropism phenomenon to occur, increasing their shoot length and weight which would then contribute to a smaller root:shoot ratio than initially anticipated. 
A separate study that examined this property of phototropism on rice plants showed stem elongation for various light conditions. Red, far-red, and blue light were all three conditions made. The results concluded that blue light contributed to the most negative phototropic effect [Lin: 2018]. Because the heat lamp in the incubator was most similar to the red light, it can be concluded that phototropism is a possible explanation for why our hypothesis was not supported. Other possible sources of error could be that the temperature was just too high and the climate too arid for the oat plants to survive. Rather than extending their roots downward for allocation of water, they were incapable of even developing anything. This tells us a great deal about a suitable environment for these to grow in. Oats, being a valuable crop for much of our food, may not grow as well in more arid climates. This experiment can be extended to large scale farming, and could be helpful for those that are trying to profit on cultivating large amounts of this crop. All in all, regardless of the plant studied, this experiment can serve to illustrate the importance of resource allocation in plants. Beyond that, it shows how adjusting factors, such as the temperature, can greatly impact the root:shoot ratios of the plant and in our case maybe even the plant’s ability to grow and develop in general.
