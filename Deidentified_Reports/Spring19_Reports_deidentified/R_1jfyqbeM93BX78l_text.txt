Title: Effect of Mycorrhizae Fungi on the Lengthening of Roots and the Resultant Root:Shoot Ratio of the Raphanus raphanistrum 

Abstract:
Plants allocate resources to specific parts of the plant in order to balance internal conditions depending on the external conditions in which they endure. Whether or not a plant chooses to allocate its resources to its roots or its shoots is dependent on the physical needs of the plant. This experiment was aimed at discovering the effects of Mycorrhizae fungi on the growth of roots and the resultant allocation of resources for the Raphanus raphanistrum (common radish) plant. Two test groups were created, one group of plants were provided with additional Mycorrhizae fungi, another was not. It was hypothesized that if the roots of Raphanus raphanistrum plants are exposed to an abundance of Mycorrhizae fungi, then the root to shoot length and weight ratio will be greater than those not treated with additional Mycorrhizae fungi. These plants were allowed to grow for 2 weeks and at the end of these 2 weeks data was recorded on the average R:S ratios of the weight and length for both the experimental and the control group. It was discovered that the R:S ratios for the weight and the length were greater for the plants exposed to Mycorrhizae fungi. The R:S ratios for weight was proven to be insignificant and the R:S ratios for the length were found to be significant. Since both the root

Introduction:
The ability of plants to grow in climates that are fluid and that often change in the availability of resources is due to their ability to allocate available resources to areas that are lacking in abundance. For example, plants are known to allocate energy towards growing either longer roots or longer shoots depending on the needs of the plant. [BIO 113 Lab Manual: 2018] If the plant is suffering from a lack of sunlight, it might allocate its resources to the growth of its shoots. Oppositely, if the plant was living in soil that was too soft to stay anchored in it might allocate its resources to growing longer roots. [Bazzaz & Grace: 1997] The organisms that live in the soil that plants grow in can play a huge role in the growth of roots and shoots. The organism that is the focus of this experiment is the Mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi have been known to have symbiotic relationships to plants by helping their roots to grow longer and faster than if the fungi were not present. [Gosling: 2006] In this experiment, we will be testing to see if adding additional Mycorrhizae fungi to the soil in which Raphanus raphanistrum (wild radish) are planted in will affect the allocation of materials to either the roots or the shoots of the plant. If the roots of Raphanus raphanistrum plants are exposed to an abundance of Mycorrhizae fungi, then the root to shoot length and weight ratio will be greater than those not treated with additional Mycorrhizae fungi.

Materials and Methods:
The first part of the experiment involved the group acquiring a handful of Raphanus raphanistrum seeds and allowing them to soak in water for 10 minutes. While the seeds were soaking, 6 pots of vermiculite were prepared – 3 pots for vermiculite containing additional Mycorrhizae fungi and 3 pots for vermiculite not containing any additional Mycorrhizae fungi. This effectively formed the experimental and control groups for this experiment. Mycorrhizae fungi were added to the 3 experimental pots in small pinches in the hole where the seeds were planted. The seeds were then covered back up with vermiculite, provided with fertilizer, and left to grow for two weeks. It was made sure that each plant was watered every day during this period. After two weeks, the plants were carefully removed from the vermiculite, making sure to not rip any of the roots. 3 random individual plants were chosen to be measured. The 3 plants for each pot were measured for total mass and individual mass of the roots and the shoots. The longest root and the longest shoot from each pot sample were used to find the root and shoot length. To weigh and measure the roots and shoots, the two were separated by cutting where the shoot changed colors from green to white. The shoots were measured for length from the tip of the stretched-out leaves to where the color changed from green to white. The roots were measured for length from where the shoot changed from green to white to the end of the root. The data was recorded and used to calculate the R:S ratios for weight and length of the experimental group compared to the control group using a two-tailed two-sample t-test. The length and weight R:S ratios for each pot in the experimental and control group were then averaged and a p-value was used to compare to the critical value of .05 to see if the results were significant. 

Results:


From Fig. 1 it can be concluded that the average R:S ratio for weight was not significantly different between the FUNGI (.424 ± .158) and NO FUNGI (.26 ± .2) groups due to the p-value (p = .16, DoF = 4, t = 1.12) being greater than .05. From Fig. 2 it can be concluded that the average R:S ratio for length was significantly different between the FUNGI (2.3 ± .451) and NO FUNGI (1.04 ± .253) groups due to the p-value (p = .13, DoF = 4, t = 4.23) being less than .05. 


Discussion:
The group’s hypothesis was found to be supported for the most part. On average, the R:S ratios for both weight and length were greater for the plants that were exposed to additional Mycorrhizae fungi than plants that were not exposed to additional Mycorrhizae fungi. The data for R:S ratio for length was found to be significant (p = .013) while the data for R:S ratio for the weight was found to be insignificant (p = .163) The R:S ratios were different but only the R:S ratio for the length was found to be significant. This could be caused by the plants’ inability to begin the allocation of resources to other parts of the plant in such a short amount of time. The allocation of resources takes time, if the plant were given a longer period to begin the allocation of resources from the roots to the shoots before measurements were taken, then the results might have been found to be significant. Mycorrhizae fungi have been proven in the past to provide many added benefits to plants whose roots encounter it in the soil in which the plant grows. When roots encounter mycorrhizae bacteria, they are known to grow at a faster rate due to the fungi infecting and expanding the roots of the plant. [Gosling: 2006] This would explain why on average the roots exposed to mycorrhizae fungi were longer than roots not exposed to the fungi. 
The main reason for this experiment was to discover what can determine where a plant allocates its energy. In the presence of mycorrhizae fungi, both root length and mass, as well as the shoot length and mass, increased. The growth effects that mycorrhizae fungi have on the roots of plants is more than likely the reason behind the differences in R:S ratios for length and mass from the control group. It is possible for a plant to invest too much in either the roots or the shoots, so much so that the plant is unable to support the parts that the resources are not being allocated to. For example, since the roots were getting so much added help from the mycorrhizae bacteria, it is possible that the shoots were simply not able to keep up with the energy demand of the roots. [Madsen: 1990] It is possible that the Mycorrhizae fungi had such an effect on the growth of the root that it counteracted the effect of resource allocation within the plant. Another study focusing on this point is needed to discover the effects of Mycorrhizae fungi on resource allocation in plants. 
Possible sources of error for this experiment could include accidentally tearing the roots when pulling them out of the dirt. This experiment is important for understanding the importance of certain fungi found in the soil in the growth and development of roots and the plant as a whole. In the future, similar experiments could be done to find the best fungi to aid in plant growth and the allocation of energy to certain parts of the plant. Mycorrhizae fungi, or any other fungi that are beneficial to plants, could then be used by farmers to aid in the growth and production of better crops.
