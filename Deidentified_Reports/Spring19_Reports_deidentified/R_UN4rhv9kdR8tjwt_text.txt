Title: The effects of the presence of food on the aggression of Betta splendins males

Abstract:
This study focuses on intraspecies agnostic behavior. This behavior was observed in the fish species Betta splendins. This experiment studied the effects of the presence of food on the aggression levels of the fish species Betta splendins, also commonly known as Siamese fighting fish. It was hypothesized that the presence of food would lead to increased levels of intraspecies agnostic behavior in the Betta splendins males. A statistically significent difference was found in the means of the sums of aggressive behavior values between the presence of food and the absence of food to show the differences in levels of aggressive behavior in the two different conditions. The mean for the presence of food was higher than the mean for the absence of food, in which a higher mean value indicates higher levels of aggression. This supports our hypothesis that adding the presence of food to increase competition among the male Betta splendins fish would increase their levels of aggression among each other.

Introduction:
In general, Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are known to show very aggressive intraspecies behavior, hence their common name. For this species of fish, aggressive intraspecies behavior is exhibited in competition for females, as we found in a previous experiment. However, for this experiment, we wanted to see if competition for food affected levels of aggressiveness within these fish as well. This experiment specifically looks at the effects of introducing dry food into the environment, but other studies have shown that live diets are preferred for feeding this type of fish [Thongprajukaew: 2019]. Competition for food is known to be a common cause of aggressive behavior, both interspecies and intraspecies, throughout the whole animal kingdom. Our hypothesis is that if food is presented to two starved Betta males, then the males should exhibit more intraspecific agnostic behavior in competition for the food.

Materials and Method:
Six Betta splendins males were used in this experiment. Prior to the experiment, these six males were starved of food for 3 days. To measure the agnostic behaviors of these fish, we used a 1-6 ranking system, and each of the behaviors they exhibited had a value between 1 and 6. The rankings of each of the behaviors can be found in Table 1. Initially, two males were placed together in the same tank for five minutes and their behavior was observed and recorded. Next, the two fish were separated for a five minute rest period. Next, the fish were then placed together again and the fish food TetraPro was introduced into the environment. Under these circumstances, their behavior was observed and recorded for five minutes, then they were separated again. Two fish tanks were used to help isolate the variable of the presence of food. This entire process is then repeated two more times with two entirely different sets of Betta males. A two-tailed paired t_test was used to analyze the results.

Results:
The mean sum of aggressive behavior in male Betta splendins in the absence of food was 8.667 +/- 5.465 (Fig. 1). The mean sum of aggressive behavior in male Betta splendins in the presence of food was 22.500 +/- 7.120 (Fig. 1). The difference these two means was found to be statistically significent (t_stat = 9.00, d.f. = 5, p_value = 0.0003). The behavior of these male Betta splendins was clearly more aggressive in the presence of food.

Discussion:
The mean aggressive behavior value was higher in the presence of food than in the absence of food, and our two-tailed t_test showed the results to be statistically significent. So, the results support our initial hypothesis that the presence of food would lead to increased aggressive intraspecies behavior from the fish. Using our ranking system of aggressive behaviors, we were able to determine that the fish were more aggressive in the presence of food. This is due to the competition for a limited amount of food within one environment. Typically, studies have found in the past that maximum growth and reproductive performance can be achieved by feeding Betta splendins twice a day [James: 2004]. This information shows that the amount of time the fish were deprived of food for should be enough to have a relevant effect on their behavior. However, in this experiment the fish were starved for three days prior, so this is probably an unusually long amount of time for these fish to go unfed. This increased the levels of competition for food among the fish since that had not eaten in a long time, which was our intention in not feeding them for several days. Betta splendins are already known to be a very aggressive species of fish, and adding the competition for food increased their levels of agnostic behavior.
