Title: The Effects of Color on Male Betta Aggression Behaviors 

Abstract:
The purpose of this report is to determine if color exposure effects male Betta splendins aggression behaviors towards one another. We hypothesized that if male Bettas were exposed to color before and during male versus male interaction, they would red mane for longer durations of time. Nine trials were run in which three male Betta fish were exposed to one another, two at a time. Six trials used colored film (blue and red) to wrap the tank, and three trials used a controll film (clear). We measured the length of time in which they would red mane towards one another to assess changes in aggression behaviors. The male Bettas in the clear film trial served as our controll group, while the Bettas in the colored film were the experimental group. The graphed averages of the two groups showed no apparent trend. Using a paired two-tailed t_test, we calculated the results had no statistical significance between the duration of red manning for male Bettas being exposed to color and not (t= 0.184, d.f.=16, p= 0.856). The study and results help give us a deeper understand of the Betta species, and the nature of their aggressive behaviors. 

Introduction:
Ethology gives us an insight on not only how animal behavior has evolved, but also what sorts of behaviors have contributed to the fitness of a species. Behaviors vary per animal, as many have distinct qualities and actions that play a vital role in their communication to their own and other species. Betta splendins are one of the many species that have a range of observable traits, especially seen with their aggressive behaviors. Bettas are capable of both intraspecific (with members of their own species) and interspecific (with members of another species) behavior, in which they show a number of aggressive displays to warn off their opponent. Some of these observable displays include expanding gills, broadside movements, tail flashing, and red manning. Red manning is classified as one of the more aggressive and threatening displays, as a Betta will face its opponent head-on and open its gill covers in a hostile motion [Bruce: 2003]. Furthermore, Bettas are easily bred and readily available, making them the perfect specimen for our experimental observation [Braddock: 1955]. 
In this lab, we aimed to test if there was any effect of color on Betta splendins aggressive behaviors. Since Bettas have the ability to see color beyond black and white, we wanted to incorporate the use of a colored stimuli into their interaction and resting periods to see if they would adapt or change their behaviors according to an outside factor. Using only male Betta splendins, as they tend to behave more aggressively towards one another, we monitored their aggressive behaviors within interaction while being exposed to blue, red, and clear coloring [Elcoro: 2008]. In order to accurately observe their aggressive behavior, we planned to capture the duration of red manning during their interaction, since it is one of their most extreme aggression behaviors. We hypothesized that if the male Betta splendins were exposed to color during their resting breaks and interactions with one another, then they would display more aggressive behaviors than if exposed to no color. 


Materials and Method:
Only male Betta splendins were used in our lab, all of which were of similar size and varied only slightly in overall color. The three males were placed into three separate compartments of the same tank, that were divided by both a solid and opaque partition. First, we wrapped the tank in blue film, covering all surfaces of the glass. We let the male Bettas rest for five minutes within their own compartments. Then, by two at a time, we exposed the male Bettas to one another by removing the solid partition that separated two compartments. We allowed the fish to interact with one another for five minutes, and measured the length of time an individual would red mane at its opponent. After time was up, we would place the solid partition back down to allow the fish a five-minute break period. This process was repeated until all three fish had interacted with one another, and used a small fish net to switch the male in the middle compartment. Next, we repeated the process using red film, which covered all surfaces of the glass tank. We replicated the same process, giving the fish a five-minute rest and interaction time while being exposed to the red color. All three males were exposed to one another two at a time, and we again measured the duration in which the individuals would red mane. Lastly, we used a clear film to cover the glass tank as our controll, in order to make sure the fish were reacting to color and not a wrapping on their tank.  The same process was repeated between the three males in order to get controll group data. Five-minute breaks and interaction were replicated in the exact same order and form, and we collected red mane duration for the individuals. We then calculated the average red manning duration for the individual Bettas under color exposure and the controll. Once graphs were made with this data, we used a two-tailed p_value test to calculate p_values of our data and determine significance or insignificance within our results. 

Results:
	The average duration of red manning for male Bettas exposed to color was 13.164± 3.9707 seconds and the average duration of red manning for male Bettas exposed to no color was 14.084±11.68. Graphing the data showed no general trends between the trials of color and no color (Graph 1). Using these results, we used a two-sample t test to calculate a p value. The two-tailed t_test showed there was no statistical significance between the duration of red manning of the experimental and controll groups (t= 0.184, d.f.=16, p= 0.856).

Discussion:
There was no significance in the duration of red manning of male Betta fish exposed to color during rest and interaction period and those exposed to no color. Overall, these results do not support our hypothesis that male Betta splendins would exhibit more aggressive behavior when exposed to color during their rest period and interaction between one another. As found in Dr. Clotfelter’s lab results, Betta splendins do prefer color as a sexual response to one another. Red, oranges, and yellow were found favorable by mates, and the color of the fish plays a large role in the way Betta males adapt and communicate with on another [Clotfelter: 2007]. Yet, the color of the tank seemingly had no effect on how male Bettas interacted with each other. 
One area in which there was room for error was the injuring or overworking of the male Betta fish throughout the experiment. At one point, one the male Betta fish was seemingly exhausted or disoriented, as it did not interact with the other fish in the same manner. In a future experiment, it is important to enforce longer resting periods, especially after manually removing them from their compartment. In a lab setting, Betta fish are great species in which to study behavior, as their aggressive displays are easily observable. Our study’s results showed there was no change in aggressive behaviors when male Bettas were exposed to color or not exposed to color.

Graph One: The Difference in Average Red Manning Durations Between Control and Experimental Groups. When evaluating this graph, there are no apparent trends between the two groups of data, as there are no extreme differences between the two. The average red manning duration for the controll group was 14.084±11.68, and the average red manning duration for the experimental groups was 13.164± 3.9707. *************************************************************************
