Title: Effects of the Reduction of Ecdysterone in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
	Insect growth regulators are oftentimes used to mimic natural hormones in developing insects. If there is an abnormal amount of hormones that are necessary for insect growth, the insect may not make it adulthood. In Manduca sexta, ecdysterone (20E) hormone levels were manipulated with the presence of an insect growth regulator. This was done by incorporating the IGR into the diet of half of the Tobacco Hornworm experimental units. When measuring the growth of the eight caterpillars used, a considerable difference was seen between the weights and lengths of the controll and experimental groups. This led to the conclusion that 20E is an essential component to Manduca sexta development and reduction of the hormone results in decreased growth trends. 


Introduction:
	The Manduca sexta moth, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm among other names, follows a lifecycle of about 39-48 days [Berkley; 2019]. During this time, Manduca sexta goes through many stages of molting, as this is necessary for the organism to move from one phase of its lifecycle to the next. Molting consists of Manduca sexta shedding its outer layer, or cuticle, and replacing it with a new one [Berkley; 2019]. There are two hormones that are an essential part of the molting process: Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). Juvenile Hormone controlls the type of molting that occurs throughout the development of Manduca sexta [Nijhout; 1976]. Ecdysterone is responsible for determining the timing of the molting process [Gilbert; 1979]. JH and 20E work together to allow the insect to properly grow and develop. Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) can be used to mimic or interfere with these natural growth hormones. Knowing this information leaves the question of how IGRs can affect the growth and development of the Tobacco Hornworm. We hypothesize that if 20E hormone levels in Manduca sexta are reduced with the presence of an IGR, then the larvae consuming a diet consisting of the IGR will not develop to the same length and weight of the controll group. 


Materials and Method:
	Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars of similar sizes were individually placed into separate containers. 10 grams of caterpillar food were measured out for each caterpillar. Four of the eight caterpillars were fed 10 grams of caterpillar food that was mixed with five drops of di water (controll group). The remaining four caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food that was mixed with five drops of the Azaguard IGR (experimental group). The caterpillars were incubated at 25º celsius and weight in grams and length in millimeters of each caterpillar were measured every day for 15 days. Diets were replenished as they ran out. After the 15 days a two-sample t_test was run to determine whether to accept or reject the alternative hypothesis. The one-tailed value was used because the hypothesis shows directionality. 


Results:
Throughout the entire data collection period, we saw a few general trends. We saw that the weights of the controll and experimental groups were extremely similar until the fifth day, where the weight of the controll group shot up and continued to increase until about the twelfth day, when the weight slowly began to decrease. This is shown in Figure 1 by the average weights of the “Reg Weight” group on each day that data was taken. Also shown in Figure 1 is the leveling out of the average weights of experimental group, shown by the “IGR Weight” group on the graph. Overall, the weights of the controll group caterpillars were significently greater than the weights of the experimental group caterpillars for the majority of the 15 days that data were collected. The same general trend was seen for the lengths of the caterpillars in the controll group versus the lengths in the experimental group. The two groups of caterpillars hovered around the same lengths until around Day 5, when the average lengths of the controll group surpassed the average lengths of the experimental group for the remaining data collection period, as shown in Figure 2. However, the difference in the lengths of each group are not as large as the difference in weights. 
Using the data acquired from measuring the weights of the caterpillars, the two-sample t_test yielded a one-tailed p_value of 1.48 x 10⁻⁵, meaning our results are statistically significent at a 95% confidence level. Similarly, the results from the two-sample t_test for length were statistically significent, as our data yielded a one-tailed p_value of 6.45 x 10⁻⁵. From this, we can say with 95% confidence that diet did have an effect on the length and weight of our caterpillars and the differences were not due to chance.


Discussion:
	The results to our experiment support our hypothesis. The experimental data shown in Figures 1 and 2 describe the crucial role that 20E hormone plays in Manduca sexta. Because ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting in Manduca sexta, when this hormone is reduced, the organism cannot properly follow its typical lifecycle and coordinate its molting periods. Therefore, it is not able to grow and develop to the extent that it is expected to. This is why we saw the greater patterns of growth in the caterpillars that were fed a normal diet without the presence of the inhibiting IGR. The controll group had normal levels of 20E to keep them on the normal growth sequence. However, the weights and lengths of the experimental group were significently lower due to the lack of ecdysterone. If we had completely inhibited the presence of 20E, the caterpillars in the experimental group would have died. A similar study was done that looked into using IGRs as a method of controllling pests through inhibiting the synthesis of chitin with an IGR [Tunaz; 2003]. Chitin is a tough, fibrous substance that is present in the exoskeleton of many insects [Merzendorfer; 2003]. It is necessary to growth and development of specific insects, and without it, an insect will not properly develop and will die. Looking at information from our experiment, along with the information from the Tunaz experiment, it is likely that using IGRs could be the next step in controllling pests. This could be done by reducing hormones in unwanted insects that are necessary to the development of the insect. For example, if one wanted to exterminate Manduca sexta, they could use the IGR Azaguard to cut out the 20E hormone and therefore kill the organism. If our study were to be taken a step further, a possibility would be to look into the changes that would be a result of increasing 20E levels rather than diminishing them. It would be interesting to see if this increase in the hormone would have the reverse effect on the caterpillars, causing growth levels to increase.
