Title: The effect of nitrogen on the growth Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the process by which species distribute their limited resources. Organisms adapt to the abiotic and biotic factors in their experiment. Plants interact with the neighboring organisms in their environment. Competition controlls the length of root growth and shoot growth. More competition in the environment will require the plant to extend its roots in order to reach the more scarce resources. One group was kept as a controll group fed with only water and Miracle-grow in vermiculite. The experimental group was grown in a nitrogen enriched environment. The nitrogen enriched environment would decrease competition and the roots would not grow as long as they would in the controll group. We hypothesize the group fed with nitrogen will have a lower root to shoot ratio than the controll group. We planted radish seeds in six pots of vermiculite. The experimental group was fed with nitrogen, water and Miracle-grow. The controll group was fed with only water and Miracle-grow. The plants were watered daily with 50 milliliters of water for 14 days. The root to shoot ratio for the controll was greater than that for the experimental by approximately 0.4 millimeters. The p_value was 0.077, rejecting our hypothesis. 


Introduction:
In each given ecological community, all organisms present must be able to interact with each other and adapt. Biotic factors are environmental stimuli that originate from other organisms. Along with biotic factors, all organisms must adapt to the abiotic factors in their environment as well. Plant interactions revolve around these biotic and abiotic factors and their ability to obtain essential resources. The power of resource limitation is a force in selection that involves two important concepts: trade-offs and resource allocation. Resource allocation is the pattern in which species distribute and use their limited resources. Individual allocation patterns allow them to adapt to different abiotic conditions in their environment whether they are interacting with other species or not. Plants will respond to shifting resources differently and reallocate their resources. Radishes, Raphanus raphanistrum, is a leafy plant that germinate quickly and grow rapidly. This will be beneficial because of the short amount of time our experiment takes place in.  This lab will measure the differences in one environment versus the other; a nitrogen rich environment versus a controllled growing environment. In the nitrogen rich environment, the plants will not have to maximize their root growth for maximum shoot growth. In an this enriched environment, there will be little competition for nutrients, allowing the roots not to fully grow while the shoots will still prosper [Panwar: 2000]. We hypothesize the group fed with nitrogen will have a lower root to shoot ratio than the controll group.



Materials and Method:
We gathered six pots and split them into two groups; experimental and controll. Both groups were watered and given miracle grow. The experimental group was covered with a scoop of nitrogen in each pot before plantation. Each pot was watered daily for 14 days. At the end of the 14 day experimental period, the plants were weighed as a group. Then the roots and the shoots were measured in millimeters and a ratio was calculated. A two-sample one-tailed t_test will be run and compared to a 0.5 alpha value. 


Results:
The controll group had a greater root to shoot ratio in length than the nitrogen group. The average root to shoot ratio for the controll group was approximately 0.4 millimeters greater than the nitrogen enriched group as seen in Figure 1. A paired t_test was run with the raw data from the experiment and the t-value recorded was 1.76 with degrees of freedom of 4. The p_value was 0.077.


Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis. The root to shoot ratio for p_value was not significent. Nitrogen is a biofertilizer application that would allow the shoots of the plants to grow more than the roots because the radishes do not have to stretch their roots for nutrients and compete with neighboring organisms. The results showed the nitrogen did have a lower root to shoot ratio by length but not enough to make the results significent. We believe this may be because of slight nitrogen poisoning. The amount of nitrogen added to each pot was observational and not exact. There is a maximum amount of nitrogen added to each seed that is recommended. It is recommended to give plants more nitrogen in the vegetative state rather than the flowering state. Avoiding Miracle-grow and enriched soil allows the grower to controll the amount of nitrogen the flowering plant gets throughout the process. We believe too much nitrogen and nutrients were given the plant throughout the process through Miracle-grow and vermiculite soil and decreased flowering rates.The shoots did not grow as tall as they should have in order to support the hypothesis. In another study on yield of radish seeds when treated with nitrogen and other biofertilizers showed increasing levels of nitrogen greatly increased the seed yield and the quality of the radishes. However, they found a maximum amount of nitrogen should be applied for proper results, due to nitrogen poisoning. Also, when the nitrogen levels were integrated with a biofertilizer, the results showed maximum growth and quality [Panwar: 2000]. Our hypothesis was rejected and may have been supported if we closely measured the amounts of nutrients given to the radishes and ran more trials. In further experiments, combining nitrogen as the only nutrient with one other experimental nutrient could have more notable results on the root to shoot ratio.
