Title: The Effect of Insect Growth Regulators on Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
We did a study to understand the effects of the insect growth regulator (IGR), pyriproxyfen, on Manduca sexta larvae in the 5th instar larvae stage of their lifecycle. Pyriproxyfen is an IGR that prevents larvae from advancing into the pupa stage. We expected that our treatment group of caterpillars would not advance into the pupa stage over a 7 day period while our control group would pupate. We also expected that our treatment group would grow at a slower rate than our control group. 8 caterpillars were weighed and measured and placed into one of 4 chambers in a plastic container with food that was either mixed with water or the IGR. After 7 days, they were weighed and measured again. None of our caterpillars had pupate and the treatment group had grown at a faster rate than our control group. Therefore, our hypothesis ws not supported and our data was inconsistent with other studies on the same IGR.


Introduction:
We are studying how hormones play a role in insect growth and development. We did an experiment where we looked at the effects of insect growth regulating hormones on Manduca sexta larvae, also known as Tobacco Hornworms, the specific IGR that we used was pyriproxyfen. By studying how IG regulators affect our caterpillars, we may gain an overall understanding of how hormones play a role in Tobacco Hornworm development. We know that from life cycle of a Tobacco Hornworm, that takes about 2-3 weeks for the insect to go from egg to fully grown adult. We also know that this development is regulated by hormones. From the 5th insta stage (the fifth period that the caterpillars go through in their larvae stage) it takes about 5 days for the caterpillar to pupate and we know that larvae generally weigh 1-11g in this period. [Johnson: 2016] Our caterpillars, at the beginning of our experiment, weigh, on average, 6g, so we know they are most likely in the 5th insta stage and, under regular conditions, should most likely pupate within a week. However, we will treat half of our sample with an insect growth hormone regulator (IG regulator). IG regulators usually interfere with metamorphosis or reproduction [Tunaz: 2004], in other words, IG regulators prevent metamorphosis and effective reproduction. We this knowledge, we expect that the IG regulator will prevent our treated caterpillars from pupating and possible slow their growth.


Materials and Methods:
We prepared 2, 4 chamber plastic containers by poking two holes in each chamber. We then mixed 8, 10g clumps of food with 8 drops of either water or IG regulator using transfer pipets (2 controls and 2 treatments in each container) and labeled the chambers. We weighed and measured each caterpillar and recorded which chamber it was put into. We checked on them every day for 6 days, changing the food as needed. On the 7th day, we weighed and measured all of the living caterpillars. With this data, we calculated the change in weight and length for each caterpillar, calculated and graphed the average change in weight and length for both the control and treatment groups, and calculated the standard error for each group. We then ran a 2-sample T-test and calculates a p-value to determine if the differences in weight and length between the control group and the treatment group were statistically significant. 


Results:
In general, we found that our treatment group of caterpillars increased in weight significantly more than our control group did with a p-value of 0.046514. Also, in Figure 1, you can see that the treatment group increased, on average, almost twice as fast as the control group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in change in length between the two groups, p-value of 0.569714. As you can see in Figure 2, the error bars are overlapping and the columns are of a similar height. We also observed that none of our caterpillars had begun to pupate.


Discussion:
The results of our experiment partially supported our hypothesis in that none of our larvae pupate after a week; however, our control groups also did not pupate after a week so it may not be reasonable to assume that our IGR prevented the larvae from pupating. We also expected our treatment groups to grow at a slower rate than our control groups, but the opposite happened. In addition to being inconsistent with our hypothesis, our results were inconsistent with other studies on the same IGR. In 2007, a study was done to see the effects of pyriproxyfen on silkworm larvae. The researchers found that pyriproxyfen interrupted the hormone balance, prolonged the larvae stage, and caused significant biochemical changes [Etebari: 2007]. The key part in this study that relates to our experiment is that pyriproxyfen is expected to prolong the larvae stage; however, none of our caterpillars began to molt into the pupa stage. Therefore, our results are inconclusive. 
If our results are an accurate representation of the effects of  pyriproxyfen on Manduca sexta larvae, then this experiment may suggest that Manduca sexta larvae respond differently to pyriproxyfen that other larvae,like the silkworm larvae for example. However, something that may have gone wrong in our experiment is that our treatment group of caterpillars had previously been treated with growth inhibiting hormones, and so they were not randomly selected but rather had defects (they were discolored and slightly smaller; two of which died during the experiment). I think that this experiment should be redone with larvae that were not previously treated with other growth hormones, but instead have them all be starting from the same point. Also I think the experiment should not be done in a set time range but rather continue until some of the caterpillars have pupate, and record the time of pupation. I do not think that our study helped advance any knowledge about how Manduca sexta larvae respond to IGRs because our results were not conclusive and were inconsistent with other studies.
