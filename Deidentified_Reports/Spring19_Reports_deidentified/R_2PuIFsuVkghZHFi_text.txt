Title: The Negative Effect of AzaGuard on the length of Manduca sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, known as tobacco hornworms, require juvenile growth hormone and ecdysterone to molt and begin metamorphosis into subsequent stages of its life cycle. AzaGuard contains azadirachtin, which inhibits ecdysterone, a hormone crucial to tobacco hornworm growth and molting timing. If a Manduca sexta caterpillar is fed AzaGuard, then the length of the tobacco hornworm will be inhibited.   Four caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food mixed with 6 drops of distilled water, while the treatment group of caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food mixed with 6 drops of AzaGuard. The results were not statistically significent for the length of tobacco hornworms (t_stat= 0.6514, d.f.= 6, p_value= 0.2695). AzaGuard did not impact the growth of the tobacco hornworms, although there was a slight difference. Tobacco hornworms that were fed AzaGuard grew less than those fed with distilled water, but not enough to not be caused by chance. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, more commonly known as tobacco hornworms, go through a holometabolous life cycle, which means it goes through the stages of egg, larvae, pupa, and adult [Johnson: 2018]. The appearance of the larvae and the adults are dissimilar because the body reorganizes during the pupal metamorphosis stage [Johnson: 2018]. The average Manduca sexta takes thirty-nine to forty-eight day to get from an egg to a reproductive adult, depending on the temperature and environment [Johnson; 2018]. While the caterpillars are pupating their movement is reduced, and molting is used as the epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer, called a cuticle [Johnson: 2018]. During metamorphosis, the Manduca sexta starts to molt in order to change morphology and size. To begin metamorphosis the caterpillar has to receive neuron- and hormone-based signals telling it to do so [Johnson: 2018]. The primary hormones used in that signaling are juvenile hormone and ecdysterone [Johnson: 2018]. Juvenile hormone controlls the type of molting, whereas ecdysterone controlls the timing of hormones, both of which are for a caterpillar to survive, and the caterpillar also has to reach a certain size [Johnson: 2018]. Without those hormones the caterpillar will experience delayed growth and ultimately will die [Johnson: 2018]. The effect of the hormones is determined by the concentration ratio, developmental stage, and absolute concentration of the hormone [Johnson:2018]. AzaGuard is an insect growth regulator, which contains 3% azadirachtin and targets molting in pupal and larval stages, preventing it from occurring [BioSafe: 2017]. Insect growth regulators controll growth by causing abnormalities that reduce the ability for insects to survive [Tunaz: 2004]. The hypothesis is if Manduca sexta caterpillars are fed food mixed with AzaGuard in order to block ecdysterone, then the length of the caterpillars will be stunted. 

Materials and Method:
Eight tobacco hornworm caterpillars that had yet to reach the commitment pulse were used in the experiment. Four of those caterpillars were given 10 grams of controll food mixed with 6 drops of distilled water.  The other four were given 10 grams of controll food mixed with 6 drops of azadirachtin from the brand AzaGuard. The caterpillars were placed in separate cells with their clump of food and holes for oxygen. They were measured for 13 days in centimeters, and their cells and food supply were maintained. A two-sample one-tailed p-test was used to analyze the resulting data. 

Results:
The mean difference in length for tobacco hornworm caterpillars fed with 6 drops of distilled water was 1.1 +/- 0.4830 (figure 1). The mean difference in length for tobacco hornworm caterpillars fed with 6 drops of Azadirachtin was 0.775 +/- 0.8732 (figure 1). The average change in length was not statistically significent (t_stat= 0.6514, d.f.= 6, p_value= 0.2695). Both groups of Manduca sexta caterpillars experienced growth, although the controll group of 6 drops of distilled water grew more on average than the caterpillars in the experimental group. Caterpillars in the controll group grew at a more consistent rate then the treatment caterpillars. All of the caterpillars in the controll group pupated by the thirteenth day, while two of the caterpillars in the experimental group had yet to turn brown and pupate. One caterpillar in the experimental group was leaking black unidentified goo.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that Manduca sexta fed 6 drops of azadirachtin would seize to grow was rejected. The results were not statistically significent, although the mean difference of the caterpillars given distilled water was higher than that of the caterpillars given azadirachtin. Azadirachtin acts as an insect growth regulator, so by introducing it into the caterpillar’s food we intended to prevent them from growing and pupating. This was prevalent in the fact that, while not statistically significent, the azadirachtin-treated caterpillars had an average growth difference that was 0.3 less than that of the controll caterpillars. AzaGuard did not prevent growth in a way that cannot be explained by chance, but the caterpillars who had AzaGuard in their food did grow less in length on average compared to the caterpillars who did not consume AzaGuard. 
Halfway through our experiment the Manduca sexta stopped consuming food and ceased to produce waste. One way that azadirachtin works is it provides a feed deterrence to the caterpillars, so they eventually stop eating and proceed to die [Morgan: 2009]. Death is not caused immediately after an insect has digested azadirachtin but is caused by the insect not eating any food [Morgan: 2009]. However, another explanation for the lack of food digested is that Manduca sexta stop feeding and slow down growth before they enter the wandering stage, due to the “secretion of ecdysteroids” [Nijhout: 2006]. The blockage of ecdysterone is what the azadirachtin was supposed to do. In support of that statement, the caterpillar growth did not increase as much towards the end of the experiment as they had at the beginning of the experiment, and some had entered pupation on the final day.
A source of error in the experiment was the fact that some of the caterpillars would stretch out and were very active while others were docile and did not elongate their bodies to try and move. Only 3% of AzaGuard is azadirachtin, so the small dosage could be the cause of not having a statistically significent outcome [BioSafe: 2017]. In a new experiment the dosage of the AzaGuard mixed into the food could be increased, so instead of 6 drops for every 10 grams of food there could be 10 drops of AzaGuard for every 10 grams. Alternatively, an experiment could be done with a solution containing a higher concentration of azadirachtin. 
This experiment is pertinent to understanding how effective existing pesticides are and how some insect growth regulators affect the insects being targeted. The results of our data indicate AzaGuard does not have a significent difference on tobacco hornworm growth in comparison to using no AzaGuard, implying the pesticide AzaGuard does not inhibit the growth of tobacco hornworms and maybe another pesticide would have more positive results.
