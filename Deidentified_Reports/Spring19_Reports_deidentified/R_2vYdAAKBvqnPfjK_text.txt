Title: The aggressive behavior of Betta splendens in warm and cool water temperature

Abstract:
Betta splendens male fish are aggressive fish that will show certain behaviors when in the presence of other males in order to win mates, food, or territory. A different environment than the fish are used to will affect the fish’s normal behaviors, especially because the Betta splendens is an ectothermic fish, so the temperature of the water directly influences body temperature. Fish generally are more active in warmer water than cooler water. We studied the aggressive behavior of the betta fish in warm water and cool water to see if the temperature of the water had any effect on the fish’s behavior. We predicted that the fish would be less aggressive in cool temperatures. We quantified the Betta’s aggressiveness in warm (19 degrees Celsius) and cool (15 degrees Celsius) water by timing how long each fish displayed a red mane or an erect pectoral fin. We found that the fish were significantly more aggressive in the warm water tank versus the cool water tank. These results show us that the temperature of the water does affect the fish’s behavior, so the fish would behave differently in a different environment than it is used to. 

Introduction:
Betta splendens fish show intraspecific behaviors such as aggressiveness in order to win mates, get food, or claim their territory [Johnson: 2018]. A betta fish will perform broadside and facing movements in order to show their aggressiveness. Broadside movements occur when the fish turns its side towards its opponent; these movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements occur when the fish is facing its opponent; these include erect pectoral fins spread gill covers and creating a red mane [Johnson: 2018]. We will be studying the facing movements of the Betta showing an erect pectoral fin, where the fish’s pectoral fin opens and closes, and showing their red mane [Johnson: 2018]. We will be comparing these behaviors at warmer and cooler temperatures. A study found the ideal temperature for betta fish to be 24 degrees Celsius [Kuhn: 1970]. One study found that a higher temperature (31.5 degrees Celsius) will increase behavior in goldfish, another ectothermic animal [Nowicki: 2012]. The Betta fish is an ectotherm, so the environment will change the internal temperature of the fish, and as a result this will change biochemical reactions and processes in the fish. [Zuo: 2011]. We predict that the betta will be less aggressive in the cooler water because it will decrease the betta’s blood flow, and the fish will not expend as much energy fighting as it normally would. 

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, we had six male Betta splendens fish in groups of 2 and put each pair into separate parts of a tank with water at 19 degrees Celsius. We let the two Bettas look at each other through the glass panes in both the warm water (19 degrees Celsius) and cool water (15 degrees Celsius) with a 5-minute rest period in between. During this period, we timed how long each Betta had erect pectoral fins and an exposed red mane. After the 5-minute period, the fish rested for 5 minutes while we set up a tank with cooler water (approximately 15 degrees Celsius). We put the two fish into the tank with the cool water. In order to quantify these aggressive behaviors, we used the equation aggressiveness score= amount of time the fish displayed the behavior (seconds)x behavior (1= erect pectoral fin, 2= exposed red mane). If the fish showed neither of these behaviors, they would receive a score of 0. In order to determine the statistical significance of the scores, we used a paired t-test. 

Results:
We observed that the Betta splendens fish were not very active once they were transferred to the cool water. Five out of the six fish displayed aggressive behavior in the warm water, whereas only three out of the six fish displayed aggressive behavior in the cold water. The fish in the cooler water seemed like they were too uncomfortable to fight or show any aggressive behavior. The Betta fish was, on average, more aggressive in warmer water, where the average aggressiveness score was 290.67 +/- 152.7. The average aggressiveness score in cold water was 106.83 +/- 145.99 The difference in aggressiveness was significant in warmer water than in cooler water (Figure 1; t-stat: 3.6699, df= 5, p=0.014). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by the data, where we predicted that the fish in warmer water would be more aggressive than the fish in cool water. The cool water could have slowed down the fish’s metabolism and made it less likely to expend energy attacking and would rather expend the energy trying to stay warm because the cool water lowered the fish’s internal temperature [Zuo: 2011]. Our results are similar to those found in a previous study with a different species, but a similar temperature regulation system, where behavior increased with an increased temperature [Nowicki: 2012]. We did a pilot study the week before our experiment in order to determine the general level of activity in the Betta fish, and we saw a general decrease in aggressive activity between the two weeks.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. There was a significant difference between the Betta fish’s aggressiveness in warm water versus cool water (t-stat: 3.6699, df= 5, p=0.014). The fish was significantly more aggressive when it was in warm water because it maintained a warm body temperature, whereas in the cold water the fish would have a lower body temperature and not expend energy being aggressive.*************************************************************************
