Title: How Sodium Channel Blocker Affects Muscle Contraction in a Frog Leg 

Abstract:
The nervous system and the muscular system are important for movement.  Both of these systems interact via ion channels and receptors to cause muscle contraction.  In this experiment, we examine what happens when we interfere with one of these interactions.  We will manipulate sodium channels using a 25 millimolar sodium channel blocker called lidocaine.  Sodium channels play an essential role in action potential propagation through an axon, so when they are inhibited it is likely that action potentials will not travel with the same frequency that they would with uninhibited sodium channels.  We hypothesized that if sodium channel blocker is injected into the muscle of a frog cell, no action potential will be generated and the muscle will not contract.  The results show that frog legs with sodium channel blocker experience a higher threshold value than frog legs without sodium channel blocker, but the results are not statistically significant due to the outcome of the paired t-test.  This lab will demonstrate how the nervous system and muscular system interact.  

Introduction:
The nervous system plays a role in muscle contraction.  The nervous system consists of neurons that transmit electrical signals to other cells.  Due to the numerous voltage-dependent ion channels, action potentials can travel with varying shapes, frequencies, and patterns [Bean: 2007].  When a neuron stimulates a muscle cells, the muscle cell will contract and an action potential propagates down the axon and reaches the axon terminal.  When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, calcium enters the axon terminal and vesicles containing acetylcholine fuse with the synaptic membrane.  The acetylcholine binds with acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and the influx of sodium starts another action potential.  The action potential travels down t tubules and the conformational change of a protein receptor causes calcium to flow out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which causes muscle contraction.  This process indicates that sodium plays an essential role in the generation of action potentials, and in muscular function.  One particular study found that certain sodium channel blockers have reduced or blocked action potentials from propagating, and result in a slow recovery from the blockage. [Hondeghem: 1984].  Another study found that many antiepileptic drugs are used to prevent the propagation of action potentials by blocking sodium channels [Ragsdale: 1998].  The purpose of using sodium channel blockers is to stop uncontrollable muscle contraction.  This experiment serves to investigate the effects that sodium channel blocker will have on muscle contraction when frog legs are stimulated with various amplitudes.  We hypothesized that if we inject sodium channel blocker into the sciatic nerve of the frog leg, then no action potential will be generated, resulting in no contraction of the muscle.    

Materials and Methods:
The sciatic nerve of three frog legs were isolated by pulling back the skin and separating the inner thigh muscles, and the legs were coated with Ringer’s solution.  A light load was applied to the frog leg and the probes were placed underneath the sciatic nerve.  The LabScribe software was used to record muscle contraction in this experiment.  An initial amplitude of 0.0 V was applied to the nerve, and the amplitude increased by 0.1 V increments until the sensor indicated that the frog leg experienced muscle contraction and reached threshold.  The frog leg was stimulated once again with 0.1 additional volts.  0.1 mL of sodium channel blocker (25 millimolar lidocaine) was injected directly into the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg and after 5 minutes passed the same experiment was conducted.  Initially, 0.0 V was applied to the sciatic nerve, and the amplitude was increased by 0.1 V increments until the software indicated that the frog leg experienced muscle contraction and reached threshold.  The nerve was stimulated once again with an amplitude of 0.1 V greater than the threshold.  The same process was repeated for the other two frog legs, and each frog leg served as its own experimental and control group.  The experimental trial involved the sodium channel blocker and the control trial was the frog leg without sodium channel blocker.  The mean threshold value for each of the experimental and control trials were calculated, and standard deviation was calculated as well.  A paired-t test was used to statistically evaluate the data.  

Results:
The results of this experiment show a slight trend.  Each of the control trials exhibited threshold values of 0.2 V.  The experimental trial for the first frog showed a 0.2 V threshold, the experimental trial for the second frog showed a 0.3 V threshold, and the experimental trial for the third frog showed a 0.8 V threshold.  The experimental threshold values were either equal to or greater than the control threshold values.  Similarly, the mean control threshold value was 0.2 V and the mean experimental threshold value was 0.43 V which is greater.  The standard deviation for the control group was 3.4 x 10-17 V, and the standard deviation for the experimental group is a larger value, 0.321 V (Figure 1).  Although this data shows a trend, it is not statistically significant because the p-value calculated with a paired t-test is 0.336.  0.336 is greater than 0.05, so the results are not statistically significant.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if we inject sodium channel blocker into the sciatic nerve of the frog leg, then no action potential will be generated, resulting in no contraction of the muscle, cannot be supported by the outcome of this experiment.  The p-value is greater than 0.05, meaning that the results of this experiment are not statistically significant and might be due to chance.  The data shows that the experimental frog legs did experience muscle contraction and experienced a higher threshold value.  Each frog leg used in this experiment was obtained from different frogs and therefore has a unique genetic makeup.  The different muscles and sciatic nerves could have responded in various ways to the applied voltage.  The genetic muscular and nervous system differences might have contributed to the statistically insignificant results.  The primary source of error in this experiment is likely due to the differences in genetic makeup.  Another source of error is the injection of the sodium channel blocker.  It is possible that the sodium channel blocker stayed in one area of the muscle and did not distribute evenly, therefore not affecting all sodium channels.  To improve upon this source of error, in future experiments the sodium channel blocker could be manually massaged into the muscle for a period of time.  In order to improve this experiment, it is possible that a larger number of frogs could be utilized.  A larger number of frog legs will provide a wider range of data, and the results are more likely to reflect the responses and behavior of that species.  In addition, the amount of sodium channel blocker could be increased to produce a stronger effect on sodium channels on the axons of the nerves.  
	The modulated receptor hypothesis states that lidocaine has a low affinity for rested sodium channels and a high affinity for open and inactivated channels [Davis: 1986].  One particular experiment analyzed lidocaine block of sodium channels of rabbit Purkinje fibers, and found that the modulated receptor hypothesis was supported through their experiment [Bean: 1983].  Theoretically, evidence of this hypothesis should have been observed in our experiment because sodium channels play an essential role in the nervous system, muscular system, and action potential propagation.  Overall, the nervous system and the muscular system interact to ensure that organisms move and function properly.
