Title: Effects of light color on agonistic behavior in Betta splendens 

Abstract:
The lab was performed to determine if the color of light perceived by Betta splendens had any effect on agonistic behavior when faced with another male. The lab was performed using three different color of film: Blue, Clear, and Red. This data was then analyzed using an ANOVA to determine the significance. It was found that color of light had no significant effect on the behavior of betta splendens. There was however a question of if saturation or brightness of color played a role in the experiment. In Carvalho’s experiment, it was found that the intensity of light affected the aggressive behavior of Nile Tilapia [Carvalho:2013]. 

Introduction:
In humans, it has been determined that the color of light can induce certain behaviors in humans like how some fast-food establishments use the colors red and yellow to entice customers to eat at their establishment. Different colors have also been proven to affect the mood of the person [Lin:2004]. Fish like Betta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish, can see all of the wavelengths of light within the visible spectrum and even some of the ultra violet wavelengths. In an experiment by Thompson and their team, they found that the fish tend to be more aggressive toward fish models that had different colors than themselves. This had shown that these fish do in fact see visible light [Thompson:1965]. This aggressive behavior is known as agonistic behavior and the most aggressive is when the fish shows its “red mane.” This red mane is produced by the fish expanding the membranes under its gills [Johnson:2016].  The purpose of this experiment is to determine if the betta fish are affected by different colors of light behaviorally. This will be determined by exposing male betta fish to a certain color of light and observe their agonistic behavior as they interact with another male betta fish. Our hypothesis is that the color of light will cause the time and frequency of agonistic behavior to vary among the fish tested.

Materials and Methods:
Each male betta fish was exposed to different color light/film during a 15-minute rest period. The fish were separated using an opaque divider. After the rest period, the first interaction group was then exposed to each other through a transparent divider. Then, another 15-minute rest period was completed with the next interaction group. The time and number of red manes were recorded during the five minutes of interaction. The bettas were split into three interaction groups: 1. Purple and red betta vs. Red and yellow betta. 2. Red and yellow betta vs. Teal betta. 3. Purple and red betta vs. Teal betta. The experiment was run three times for each film color for a total of one film color per group interaction. The colors of film used were red, blue, and clear for control. An ANOVA and a Tukey-Kramer test was then used to determine the significance of the results.

Results:
The results of the ANOVA are as follows for the effect of light color on agonistic behavior duration: Blue – p-value = 0.101, degree of freedom = 40, Clear – p-value = 0.576, degree of freedom = 55 and Red p-value = 0.0006, degree of freedom = 25. As seen in Figure 1. the mean duration of the red mane behavior for the bettas exposed to the different color films are as follows: Blue – 23.2412.93, Clear – 1210.42, and Red – 107. Figure 2 displays the mean values for the number of red mane displays and are as follows: Blue – 7.171.47, Clear – 9.52.17, and Red – 4.835.34. The results of the ANOVA for the effect of light color on the number of times the red mane was displayed are as follows:  Blue – p-value = 0.268, degree of freedom = 5, Clear – p-value = 0.084, degree of freedom = 5, and Red - p-value = 0.986, degree of freedom = 5.

Discussion:
Determined by the ANOVA, the length of time that the bettas exhibited the agonistic behavior of the red mane was not significantly affected by the blue and clear films prior to interaction. Red did have a significant effect on the time of red manes. This led us to believe that our hypothesis was rejected and also that the null hypothesis was rejected for the red film but supported for the blue and clear films. Furthermore, the number of times that the bettas displayed red mane was not significantly affected by all the colors of light. This result led us to believe that the reason that the red film affected the time of display of red mane may not be due to the film color. This significant effect on the bettas by the red light could be due to the darkness of the film which made it hard for the betta to see the other fish. Also, we noticed that when testing the fish with the red film that when one was looking at the other with a white background, it was still able to see the fish and thus began its agonistic behavior. This experiment gives us insight into how light could possibly affect the behavior of species other than humans. For future study, it would be interesting to see how the fish would interact when the saturation of the film color is changed instead of the color of film. This would help us understand whether or not this played a role in our experiment. Similarly, Carvalho and their team used a different species of fish and tested how the intensity of light effect the aggressive behavior of Nile tilapia [Carvalho:2013]. They found that in increased intensity of light the aggressive behavior also increased. This could explain why the brightness of the light would play a role in our experiment.
