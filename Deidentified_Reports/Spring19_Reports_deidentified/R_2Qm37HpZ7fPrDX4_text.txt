Title: The Effects of Population Density on Resource Allocation in Field Peas (Pisum Sativum)

Abstract:
In this lab we examined the effect that varying population density has on resource allocation within individual field pea plants (Pisum Sativum), specifically looking at the size of the roots and shoots relative to one another. The concept of phenotypic plasticity – that plants allocate resources in response to environmental conditions – informed our hypothesis, which suggested that root:shoot ratios would be higher among individual plants growing in low density populations because those populations receive more water per individual and subsequently necessitate that each individual grow however best allows it to capitalize off available resources. The results did demonstrate a general trend of declining root:shoot ratios as populations became denser, but not to a statistically significent degree. While these results may indicate the presence of a general trend of increased resource allocation to the roots of plants in low density environments, more tests would need to be done in order to better understand the exact scope and scale of this trend.

Introduction:
The ability of plants to “change how they allocate resources based on environmental conditions” is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson; 2018]. In this experiment we sought to study differences in energy allocation among field pea plants grown in varying conditions. We chose population density as our independent variable, creating environments of low density, medium density, and high density. It was hypothesized that the plants growing in the lowest density population would allocate more resources to their roots due to the fact that each individual plant would need to be able to absorb their share of the total population’s water supply, which would be higher than the share of plants growing in the high density population.

Materials and Method:
Materials needed:
•	Field peas
•	Nutrigrow
•	Soil
•	6 potting containers
Steps:
1.	Label the potting containers – two as “A,” two as “B,” and two as “C.”
2.	Fill each potting container with soil.
3.	In the two “A” containers plant 5 peas each by placing them one inch below the surface and covering them with soil.
4.	In the two “B” containers plant 10 peas each.
5.	In the two “C” containers plant 20 peas each.
6.	Add 100 Ml of water and 100 Ml of nutrigrow to each container.
7.	Place in an evenly-lit spot and add 100 Ml to each container every day for 2 weeks.
8.	Gather all plants after 2 weeks. For each pair of containers, use a bucket of water to gently remove the plants from the soil and from one another, being careful not to damage the stems or roots.
9.	Select 8 individual plants from each population set to be measured. Record in Excel both the lengths and widths of each root and each shoot.


Results:
As can be seen in Figure 1, while all three populations maintained a nearly perfectly consistent root:shoot ratio with regards to weight, there is also a slight decline, correspondent with an increase in population density, in the average length-based root:shoot ratio. The p_value for the weight data was 0.984, and the p_value for the length data was 0.073.

Discussion:
The original hypothesis, which stated that plants in lower density populations will allocate more resources to their roots, and thus have higher root:shoot ratios, was not clearly supported by the results. While a miniscule decline in weight-based root:shoot ratios, correspondent with an increase in population density, can be observed, and while the length-based root:shoot ratios showed a similar, even more noticeable decline, neither decline qualifies as statistically significent. This test did not clearly confirm our hypothesis, nor did it reject it. The results gathered were not statistically significent, but they did show a small, but fairly consistent decline in root:shoot ratios, as predicted in the hypothesis. The plants in the high density population had lower root:shoot ratios for both weight and length, indicating that plants in this population allocated more resources toward the stems than did the plants in the lower density populations.
	In order to confirm or reject the hypothesis this test would have to be repeated and statistically significent results would have to be obtained. One factor that might have played into the lack of significent variance between the three populations was that the differences between population sizes were not drastic enough to indicate clear difference. Making the sizes of the sample populations more drastically different from one another might serve to accentuate the differences that such conditions would have on a population in a statistically significent way.
