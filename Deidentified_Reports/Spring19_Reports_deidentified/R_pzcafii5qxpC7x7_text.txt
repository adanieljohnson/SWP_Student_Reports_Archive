Title: Precor IGR and Its Impact on Manduca sexta Caterpillars When Excessively Manipulated Over 2 weeks Course

Abstract:
Over the course of this experiment, the main purpose is to analyze the effect of IGRs on the growth development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The experiment conducted involves observing the effects of IGR; which a manufactured solution produced in order to mimic specific hormones such as JH, on Manduca sexta Caterpillars over the course of two weeks. Based on the hypothesis stated, one can infer that if an excess amount of Precor IGR is given to the Manduca sexta Caterpillar, there will be a reduced chance of survival for the insect due to changes in growth development which can be observed based on weight in grams, and length in millimeters. Based on the method, Eight Manduca sexta Caterpillars were divided into two experimental groups, four placed in the treatment group, and four being placed a control group. The treatment group was a treatment of 6 drops of Precor IGR per Caterpillar for each Manduca sexta. As for the Control group, 6 drops were given per Caterpillar meal for each Manduca sexta. Over the two weeks, Observation data revealed that IGR may have had a great impact on Manduca sexta growth but did not significantly affect the survival rate of Caterpillars the way it was anticipated. Our results were not observed to be statistically significant.

Introduction:
The main purpose of this experiment reflects upon the impact hormones have on insect growth.  Hormones generally regulate growth development by either being secreted or released into the organism. The two main focus hormones in this experiment are Juvenile Hormones and Ecdysterone (20E). IGRs are mimics of Juvenile hormone, which regulates the molts that are the intermissions before each of the five stages in the Manduca sexta Developmental process. As for Ecdysterone hormone, they are regulators for the timing of molting for the Manduca sexta [Uygun: 2004]. Observed effects of IGR hormones will be analyzed to determine to what extend do insect growth regulators have on the development growth of the caterpillar.  Growth regulator are essential in the developmental process for any organism. An organism can develop expeditiously without if lacking necessary hormone regulators that essentially allows the organism to develop naturally to the adult stage. The purpose of IGR hormones is to slow the developmental process of the Manduca Sexta, enable it from surpassing the larva stage into the adult stage. The main hypothesis for this experiment conveys that if an excess amount of Precor IGR is given to the Manduca sexta Caterpillar, there will be a reduced chance of survival for the insect due to changes in growth development which can be observed based on weight in grams, and length in millimeters. Overall, there is a prediction that the Manduca sexta are more likely to excessively grow in size yet remain in their larva stage rather develop into adults, which will lead to risk chance of survival.

Materials and Methods:
Initially, we began by collecting and labeling 8 insect holder and divided them into two groups for the treatment and placebo groups. Then, eight Caterpillars were measured based on classified = group (ex: Placebo Group 1), for weight in grams, and length in millimeters. We then began weighing out 10 grams of regular caterpillar food which will be placed into each insect container for Manduca sexta nutrition. Once the meal was placed into the container, the drops were added using a pipe. Six drops of Precor IGR were added to the food for each treatment group Caterpillar, and Six drops of water were added to the food for each placebo group Caterpillar. Once the drops were added, and the Manduca sexta Caterpillars were placed in their specified container. All eight insect containers were placed into a 25° C room temperature incubator Over the course of two weeks, we had to make sure that an individual from our group was recording the weight, and length of the Manduca sexta Caterpillars, and any observed physical changes in the Caterpillar such as motion, color, and texture. It was also important to have refilled the Caterpillar food when it was all eaten to ensure that the Caterpillars had been ingesting either Precor IGR or the basic nutrition for the placebo. When the results were recorded and calculated, we made sure all the weights and lengths for each experimental group for all fourteen days were averaged.  From there a two-sample t-test for both weight and length was conducted in order to analyze the two-tailed p-value for both weight and length and determine if the results are significant or not significant.

Results:
Based on the results calculated and graphed, the maximum average observed Length for the two-week averages of the control Manduca sexta Caterpillars was 79.55 mm with a standard deviation of  ± 1.142 which is roughly 13 values lower than the average length for the treatment group which was 66.5 mm with a standard deviation of ± 2.121. As for the average observed weight for the two-week averages of the Manduca sexta Caterpillars was 9.83 g with a standard deviation of  ± 7.283, which was roughly 2 values lower than the average weight for the treatment group which was 7.913 g with a standard deviation of  ± 0.120. All 12-day average for both the lengths and weights are indicated in the figures below, where figure 1 indicates average weights of Manduca sexta over 12-day course. Figure 2 represents the average weights of Manduca sexta over 12-day course. The observed mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group for the Manduca sexta length in millimeters (t-stat = 1.3459, df = 22, P= 0.1920). As for the weight, the observed mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group for the Manduca sexta weight in grams (t-stat = 1.265, df = 22, P= 0.2189).

Discussion:
Inferring back to the results, the statistical two sample t-test resulted in a value  for the Average lengths of both experimental groups for the Manduca sexta which was not statistically significant, so we reject the alternative hypothesis that if  an excess amount of Precor IGR is given to the Manduca sexta Caterpillar, there will be a reduced chance of survival for the insect due to changes in growth development which can be observed based on weight in grams, and length in millimeters. As for the statistical test two-tailed test for the for the Average weights of both experimental groups for the Manduca Sexta, the result was not statistically significant. We reject the alternative hypothesis again stating that if an excess amount of Precor IGR is given to the Manduca sexta Caterpillar, there will be a reduced chance of survival for the insects due to changes in growth development which can be observed based on weight in grams, and length in millimeters. Based on the observed results, our results support our observation which was not as anticipated. Although the assumption was made that the Caterpillars would only risk survival chance if had excess IGR, the control group Caterpillars also were deceased. The final four Caterpillars remaining were two from the control group, and two from the treatment group. Although our data did not support our hypothesis, other studies have revealed a correlation between excess IGR regulation and Insect well-being. An article on critical weight in correlation with development of insect body size revealed how hormones have effects that minimizes the growth of the insect during larva development [Davidowitz: 2003]. Although there is no accurate explanation to why our control group Caterpillars died, there may be a potential study to carry out on how the environment these Manduca sexta Caterpillars were put in could have an effect on their development overall. Overall, the Precor IGR was utilized as the hormone mimicker in this experiment to observe to what extent can an IGR impact the development of a Manduca sexta caterpillar. Precor is not classified as a solution that terminates insects, but rather inhibits the development of the insect from reaching the adult phase. In future experiments, Precor could be experimented as a hormone mimicker for other insects to compare developmental trends between different classified species. The experiment overall revealed relevant impacts mimicking hormones can have on Manduca sexta Caterpillars.
