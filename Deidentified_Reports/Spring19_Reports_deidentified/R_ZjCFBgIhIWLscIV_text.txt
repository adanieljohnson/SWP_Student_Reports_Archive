Title: The Effect of Martin’s IGR on the Development and Change in Mass of Manduca sexta Over Time. 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta’s development stems from two hormones within the insect: Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). The balance of these hormones is crucial to the caterpillar’s ability to molt, pupate and eventually develop into adult stage. If one hormones loses equilibrium, the Manduca sexta will fail to develop through the natural maturing stages. In this lab, we used Martin’s IGR, or methoprene, a JH hormone analog, to test the growth rate over time and the impact it would have on the development of the Manduca sexta. We added six drops of methoprene to the experimental group of caterpillars’ 10g of given food. The controll Manduca sexta group received the same food and amount, however, they received six drops of water to mimic the liquid volume intake of the addition hormone in the experimental group. The hypothesis our group created for this lab detailed how we believed Martin’s IGR would impact the growth of the caterpillars. We hypothesized that the hormone addition would prevent them from pupating and, rather, they would continue to grow as caterpillars until death. However, there was very little significent data or observable difference between the controll group and experimental group. Therefore, we failed to reject the null hypothesis and the alternative was accepted.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta have an absorbent amount of hormones that regulate their main bodily functions and controll their ability to develop. Specifically used for growth and developmental changes within the caterpillars are three main hormones: Prothoracicotropic hormones, Ecdysteroids, juvenile hormones. In this experiment, we will be focusing on only the juvenile hormone, but more specifically its analog, methoprene. In order for a Manduca Sexta to properly develop into the fifth instar stage and molt, there must be a low amount of juvenile hormone and then a sharp increase in its ecdysteroids. One way to disturb the natural process of development is through the introduction of an insect growth regulator. In this experiment we will be using Martin’s IGR to serve as our insect growth regulator. IGR’s are can cause abnormalities that do not allow insects to complete a full life cycle due to the fact that they interrupt biological systems. Another example the change in amount of juvenile hormone affecting the growth rate of Manduca sexta is in an experiment where opposing scientists negated the release of juvenile hormone into the Manduca sexta. The experiment found that the starvation of larvae before they reached a determined critical weight, was believed to prevent the cessation of juvenile hormone and prolonged instar stages [Browder: 2001]. The purpose of this lab experiment is to see how the starvation of growing Manduca sexta would affect their biological systems and metamorphosis.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta were selected at the 2ndto 3rd instar of development and split into two groups of four. The first group was labeled controll and the other experimental. Next, each group was placed into separate plastic containers which included four separate living sections for each caterpillar. Each caterpillar in the controll container was given ten grams of the provided Manduca sexta food with six drops of water mixed in. Each caterpillar in the experimental container was also given ten grams of food but with six drops of Martin’s IGR mixed in. The droplets of water and IGR are considered to be the independent variable. Both groups were observed daily and fed and cleaned as needed. After each observation period the Manduca sexta were placed in a regulatory incubator with a natural 12 hour light/ 12 hour dark light cycle. The dependent variable was determined to be the weight and developmental process of the caterpillars over the period of two weeks. They were observed every day at approximately 6:00 pm. The data collected will be observed through a two-sample t_test.

Results:
Over a two-week period, we observed the change in mass of the Manduca sexta in both the experimental and controll groups. We were able to recognize many trends between the two groups. We noticed that both groups held a steady mass increase each day. Between Day 12 and 13, six of the eight caterpillars began to lose mass and change in color. The average mass of the controll group caterpillars after one week was 9.135g and the average for the experimental group was 10.51g. Per Figure 2, the average change in mass after two weeks for the controll group was 11.96g, whereas the average change in mass for the experimental group was 12.66g. Table 1 shows each caterpillar’s total growth in weight from Day 1 to Day 14. At final examination, the caterpillars in the controll group maintained their original turquoise color while the caterpillars in the experimental group had begun darkening and turning a brownish color. Caterpillar 3 from the experimental group experienced the largest change in weight but had almost completely turned brown on the 14th day of examination. In contrast, caterpillar 2 in the experimental group experienced the least amount of change in mass.

Discussion:
Throughout the entire experiment, there was no significent data that showed the experimental group was growing at an expedited rate versus the controll group. Our hypothesis stated that Martin’s IGR would cause the Manduca sexta to grow at a steady yet advancing rate and that the caterpillars would fail to mature from larva into their adult stage. After analysis of the data collected, it is viable to state that our hypothesis was supported by data from Figure 2 and Table 1. As stated in the hypothesis, the treatment group maintained a steady growing pattern and failed to mature from larva to adult stage.   The treatment of the growth hormone preempted death instead of the natural evolution into adult stage. In untreated caterpillars, the juvenile hormone used to treat the experimental group is naturally released during only the larval stage. Because the caterpillars were constantly receiving doses of the juvenile hormone, their systems continued to replicate the actions of larvae stages and prevented the caterpillars from pupating. The continuous ingestion of juvenile hormone explains why the caterpillars from the experimental began darkening before the controll group and instead of pupating began dying. The experimental group caterpillars would die before they were able to mature into the adult stage. In our findings, we noted that by day 6 caterpillars 1,2, & 4 from the experimental group had reached commitment pulse; Caterpillars 2 & 3 from the controll group had also reached commitment pulse by day 6. Based on the results of the two sample T-test, giving the caterpillars the growth hormone did not provide results that were statistically different from the controll group. We failed to reject the null hypothesis and the alternative was accepted instead.
