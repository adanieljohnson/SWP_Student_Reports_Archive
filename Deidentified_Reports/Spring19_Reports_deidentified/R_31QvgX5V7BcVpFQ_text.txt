Title: Increased Amounts of Ecdysterone (E20) Inhibit Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators are common pesticides that affect young insects by preventing them from developing through the molting stage of their life cycle. These pesticides imitate the functions of developmental hormones such as Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone. It is important to understand how insect growth regulators are an effective pesticide so that we can safely utilize its function without harming crops, wildlife, and the human population. Due to the fact that ecdysterone is one of the main hormones affecting development within arthropods, we decided to conduct an experiment observing how an insect growth hormone that mimics ecdysterone affects the development of the Manduca sexta. In order to test this, we treated Manduca sexta with an insect growth regulator known as Azaguard. Prior to this experiment, we hypothesized that if increased levels of insect growth regulators, that inhibited ecdysterone production, were introduced to the Manduca sexta, the average mass and length of the insects would be lower than that of the control group. After conducting this experiment, the results supported this hypothesis through statistical evidence, with significant p values, that showed the average mass and length of the treated group was much lower than that of the control group. 


Introduction:
Hormones are used within organisms to control many major functions. They are chemical messengers secreted by endocrine glands into the bloodstream that bind to receptors on or within the cell to affect their function. Hormones control how the organism will function in response to external or internal factors that have been sensed by the brain. Within insects, such as the Manduca sexta, hormones have the ability to affect how the body is arranged. Insect growth regulators are effective pesticides through their ability to mimic these hormones by increasing or decreasing the amount of developmental hormones within an insect. Common pesticides in the agricultural industry focus on affecting an insect’s nervous system through the use of neurotoxins. This can negatively affect beneficial organisms and the human population. Graf states that even though IGRs are not as effective as conventional insecticides, further research in this topic can lead to a safer and potentially even more effective way of controlling pest populations [Graf: 1993]. This potential of IGRs’ effectiveness brings up the question of how IGRs’ are able to inhibit growth and end up leading to premature death. Ecdysterone, which is secreted in the prothoracic glands, regulates at what point biological changes such as molting occur. If an IGR is able to disrupt these hormone levels, this would be an effective way to control pest populations. Because of this, we decided to test how these insect growth regulators affect development in the Manduca sexta through a disruption of the ecdysterone levels. We hypothesized that if increased levels of insect growth regulators, that inhibited ecdysterone, were introduced to the Manduca sexta, the average mass and length of the insects would be lower than that of the control group.


Materials and Methods:
We were able to test the effects of ecdysterone on the development of the Manduca sexta by separating 8 random caterpillars into two groups. The treatment group of four caterpillars were placed into their own separate containers and fed 10 grams of food containing 5 drops of a diluted insect growth regulator known as Azaguard, 3% Azadirachtin, which inhibits the hormone ecdysterone or 20E from being produced. The control group of the other 4 caterpillars were also placed in their own separate containers and were fed food containing 5 drops of water to eliminate external factors from the experiment. Every five days, the food was replaced and the containers were cleaned for each caterpillar. Boths groups were randomly placed in an incubator with even light and temperature. The caterpillars’ masses and lengths were measured in grams and millimeters each day for two weeks with a scale and ruler. At the end of the experiment, the masses and lengths of the caterpillars were averaged per group and per each day. Also, a 2-sample t-test was calculated to ensure that our results were significant. 


Results:
The mean mass of the control group was significantly different that of the experimental group (t-stat = 4.97, df = 28, P = 1.48E-5). Also, the mean length of the control group was significantly different than that of the experimental (t-stat = 4.43, df = 28, P = 6.43E-5).  In figures 1 and 2, between day four and day five, there was a significant deviation between both the mass and length measurements due to a sharp increase of the control groups development. In figure one there was an increasing trend correlated to the control group while the treated group mass remained fairly level. In figure 2 there was an increasing trend in the control group until day 9. Also the treatment group showed minimal fluctuation throughout the two week period.  Around day 8 to day 9 on both mass and length values of the control group began to level and slightly decrease. 


Discussion:
The average masses and lengths of the control group as the experiment was conducted became significantly higher than the average measurements of the treated group. Based off of our results, we can conclude that the insect growth hormone, Azaguard, does reduce growth within the Manduca sexta by inhibiting the production of ecdysterone, which initiates pupation. This is proved through statistical data that had a p value below .05. The trends in our data support our alternative hypothesis that this insect growth regulator inhibits development within the Manduca sexta. The ecdysterone levels within a Manduca sexta that has not been treated first begin to increase after Juvenile Hormone levels begin to decrease near the end of the 4th larval instar period. This rise initiates larval eclosion. During the 5th larval instar the JH levels continue to drop and there is a small yet prominent rise in ecdysterone know as the commitment pulse. This pulse is necessary for the insect to determine when there is enough nutrients and development for it to undergo pupation and form into a moth. Nijhout states that this hormone is secreted periodically to pinpoint when pupation should occur [Nijhout: 2013]. The pulse initiates a series of events such as the insect stopping to feed, know as the wandering stage, transcribe genes, produce a new cuticle, and grow dorsal bars. If the levels of ecdysterone in a Manduca sexta are extremely low or nonexistent, the caterpillar will not receive a hormonal signal initiating pupation and not be able to undergo the events prior to receiving a commitment pulse. The insect growth regulator, Azaguard, effectively does this by inhibiting the hormone ecdysterone. Due to the fact that the treatment group was given this additional insect growth regulator, this information supports the data recovered from this experiment. A. J. Mordue conducted a similar experiment which treated various insects with Azadirachtin derived from the neem tree. The active compound, Azadirachtin, inhibited the insects growth by leading to molting defects, blocking cell division, and even reducing fertility. Azadirachtin indirectly disrupts endocrine processes through the disruption of ecdysterone levels thus leading to various negative effects on growth. Mordue states that it disrupts protein synthesis and hormone secretion [Mordue: 2000]. This experiment further supports our own experiment, due to the fact that the lack of the presence of ecdysterone, caused by azadirachtin, decreases development and reproduction in similar insects. The next logical step for this study would be to increase the sample size of the experiment so that external factors have less of an influence on average development of the caterpillars. Also, multiple other groups could be added with differing concentrations of hormones which could further show how increased levels of the hormone affect a Manduca sexta. In further studies the caterpillars access to food should be emphasized due to the fact that in this study food was not always fresh and abundant. This could eliminate many external factors that could affect the rate of which the caterpillars were growing. This experiment is significant due to the fact that insect growth regulators could be a safe and effective alternative to traditional pesticides that use neurotoxins. Insect growth regulators mimic or inhibit natural hormones with the Manduca sexta that influence development. It is important to determine what regulators would be most effective at effecting insect growth rates.
