Title: The Effects of the JH Analog (Precor) on the Weight of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of the JH Analog (Precor) on the weight of Manduca Sexta. When a caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis, JH levels drop, particularly in its 5th larval instar stage. As a result, my lab partners and I hypothesized that the presence of a JH analog will decrease the weight of the caterpillar because JH levels would be too high for the caterpillar to mature regularly. To test our hypothesis, three caterpillars were given food with a JH Analog, but three other caterpillars were given plain food without Precor. After a Two-Sample T-Test was used, we observed that there was no significent difference between the Control Group and the Experimental Group because our P value was greater than 0.05. Therefore, we concluded that there was no effect of the JH Analog on the weight of the caterpillars. 



Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers. M sexta has many common names including sphinx moth, hawk moth, tobacco hornworm, and the Carolina sphinx. In addition, M sexta has a Holometabolous life cycle, meaning that it undergoes four major life stages (Egg/embryo, Larvae, Pupa, and Adult). Within these four major life stages are detailed substages that describe the organism in greater detail; the complete life cycle of Manduca sexta is as follows: Egg, 1st instar Larva Stage, 2nd Instar Larva Stage, 3rd Instar Larva Stage, 4th Instar Larva Stage, 5th Instar Larva Stage, Pupa, and Adult Moth. It is important to note that passage from one life stage to the next requires molting, in which an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer or cuticle and the old cuticle is shed. Molting allows the insect to change in size and/or morphology. As the caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis, or the radical transition from the worm-like larval stage to the pupa stage, Manduca sexta reorganizes its internal and external structures. The life cycle of these organisms can only go forward, and once the animal has undergone a developmental change, it will not go back to the earlier developmental stage [Johnson AD: 2018.] 
In this experiment, we observed the effects of a JH Analog (Precor) on the weight of Manduca Sexta. Insects need JH in order to survive, and if JH is eliminated, the animal will die.  JH levels remain fairly high up to the fourth larval instar, but near the end of this period, JH levels drop slightly. During the 5th larval instar, JH drops very low, resulting in a commitment pulse. This indicates that the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate and form a normal size moth, and it is the first time in the caterpillar’s life so far that it has been exposed to very low JH levels. Thus, lower JH levels allow for the caterpillars to mature into an adult through the process of metamorphosis. Conversely, high levels of JH will prevent Manduca Sexta from transitioning from its 5th larval stage to an adult, resulting in the death of the organism. We hypothesized that the presence of a JH analog will decrease the weight of the caterpillars for the reasons outlined above [Johnson AD: 2018].  
As cited by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, insect growth regulators (IGRs) are “…presently envisaged for possible pest controll agents, chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs), and juvenile hormone analogs (JHAs)… [but] CSIs may adversely affect nontarget organisms including beneficial insect species and crustaceans with chitin as a component of their exoskeleton…” Therefore, understanding the effects of JH levels on Manduca Sexta will allow scientists to create an IGR specific for targeted insects that does not incidentally affect other organisms [Miyamoto: 1993].  


Materials and Method:
Three caterpillars were given 10 grams of Great Lakes Manduca food, and three other caterpillars were given a food weight of 10 grams plus 7 drops (rougly 70 µl) of JH analog. The organisms were placed in an incubator at a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, and the mass of the Manduca sexta were measured each day for a week. It is important to note that each caterpillar was placed in one section of a container with 2 holes in each section. A Two-Tail-T-Test was the statistical model used to interpret the data for this experiment, comparing the average weight of the controll (caterpillars who received plain Great Lakes Manduca food) with the experimental group (caterpillars who received Great Lakes Manduca food and 70 µl of JH Analog). 

Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the average change in weight of the Control Group is 7.38 grams. However, the average weight of the Experimental group is slightly less, with a value of 5.93 grams. After conducting a Two-Sample T-Test, we found that the One-Tailed P-Value was 0.280114, which is greater than 0.05; therefore, our experimental results were not significently different from our controll group and the relationship between JH Analog and weight cannot be observed.

Discussion:
The weights of each caterpillar was recorded over a range of 7 days. After conducting a Two-Sample T-Test, it was determined that there was no significent difference between the weights of the caterpillars in the Experimental Group and the Control Group. Therefore, there was no effect on mass by the JH analogue Precor, and we rejected our hypothesis that the addition of a JH Analog (Precor) would decrease the weight of caterpillars. My lab partners and I did not add enough JH analog to observe a difference in the mass of the Manduca Sexta, and if we were to repeat this experiment, then we would have added more than 70 microliters of JH analog to the Experimental Group to observe a difference. In a similar experiment testing the effect of juvenoids on the in vivo juvenile hormone levels in Manduca Sexta, a range of 100 µl to 500 µl were administered to the caterpillars. Thus, 70 µl was not a sufficient amount of JH analogue to observe a difference, and if we were to repeat our experiment, we should have added at least 100 µl to the Experimental group’s food [Baker: 1986].
