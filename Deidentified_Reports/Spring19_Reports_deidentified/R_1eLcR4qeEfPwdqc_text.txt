Title: How Root:Shoot ratio may change based on phosphorus in soil

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of phosphate on root:shoot ratio based on length in field peas, Pisum sativum. Having phosphate in the vermiculite decreased the root length and so therefore the root:shoot ratio was smaller. Phosphorus is essential for plant growth and fecundity. We hypothesized that if we allowed phosphate to be readily available in vermiculite, the field pea root length would be shorter and therefore the ratio would be smaller than that of the plants in the plain vermiculite. To test this, we compared the shoot and root length of field pea plants grown over the course of two weeks in a green house, watered daily. The root:shoot ratio was smaller in the phosphorus plants and the results were statistically significant. Our hypothesis was supported due to the ratio being lower because the phosphate plants did not have to explore as far for nutrients. 

Introduction:
In ecological communities, resident plants are forced to interact and adapt to their environment. Many plant interactions revolve around obtaining resources like sunlight, nitrogen, and water. However, there is a limit to the available resources in an environment. In response to limited resources, species have evolved to allocate their resources in a particular pattern. They can modify this pattern to allow them to adapt to environmental factors, such as modifying their root length. An example of resource allocation can be seen in a study of differences between the wild type of apple plants and the domesticated apple. Because the domesticated apple had been altered to increase a harvestable yield, the plant had to “trade-off” investment in defense and became highly susceptible to pests [Whitehead and Poveda: 2019]. In our experiment, the root:shoot ratio differences based on length of Pisum sativum (field pea) species growing in phosphorus rich and normal vermiculite will be measured. The effect of phosphorus is of interest because Phosphorus is essential for plant growth and fecundity. It is an integral component of genetic, metabolic, structural and regulatory molecules, in many of which it cannot be substituted by any other elements [White and Hammond: 2008]. We hypothesize that the root:shoot ratio will be smaller in the phosphorus rich vermiculite plants because they won’t have to search as far for nutrients. 

Materials and Methods:
Six planters were obtained and filled with vermiculite and then soaked through in water. Phosphorus bone meal was sprinkled and mixed in to three of the planters. Twelve holes were punched into each containers and pea seeds were placed in each. The containers were labeled as either control or experimental and then placed in the green house. The plants were watered every day for two weeks. Once the two-week period was up, plants were taken in for calculation. Each container was dumped out and soaked in water and 3 plants, including roots, were obtained from each container, making sure they were kept with their labeled group for a total of 18 plants. The longest rooted plant was taken from each group, six plants in total. The roots were cut off at the point that the green shoot turned white. The root and shoot length were measured using a centimeter ruler. Measurements were recorded and then the averages of each group were taken. Root to shoot ratio was calculated by dividing average root length by average shoot length. Data was graphed and analyzed. A two sample one-tailed t-test was run to find significance. 

Results:
Ratios were measured by diving the length of roots by the length of the shoots. The ratio for control was 0.8665 +/- 0.263696 and the ratio for phosphorus was 0.5121 +/- 0.08351. The p-value was 0.04.  The graph shows a larger ratio for the control group (figure 1). The two- sample one-tailed t-test had a t= 2.22, df= 4 and p= 0.04. 

Discussion:
Our data supported the hypothesis because root:shoot ratio was smaller in the phosphorus group. The root:shoot ratio was significant because at an alpha value of 0.05, the p-value was 0.04. We would expect these results because the roots would be shorter in the phosphorus group because those plants would not have to search as far and hard for nutrients because it is readily available. Since the relative immobility of phosphorus makes its acquisition dependent on soil exploration in time and space [Barber: 1995]. This would allow us to believe that because the phosphorus is readily available in the phosphorus rich vermiculite, the roots would not have to explore as far for nutrients. The control group ratio would be larger because it would have to go deeper to find nutrients in the vermiculite. We could further test this hypothesis with other known nutrients essential to plant growth, such as nitrogen, to see if the trends in root length would be the same.

Figure 1. Root: Shoot Ratio Based on Length 
Ratios were found by measuring the length of shoots and roots of plants divided where the shoot turned to white. Averages were taken of the two lengths and then root length was divided by shoot length.
