Title: Sodium channel blocker effect on the contraction threshold of a frog gastrocnemius

Abstract:
Neuromuscular functioning is the connection between the nervous and muscular systems. In studying this connection, this lab aimed to look at the relationship between the use of a sodium channel blocker and the threshold voltage at which a muscle contracts. A frog leg was used to demonstrate the effects in this experiment, as the gastrocnemius muscle is easy to separate from the other leg muscles. We hypothesized that with the injection of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, into the gastrocnemius muscle, there would be a delayed contraction of the muscle, meaning more energy would be needed in order for contraction to occur. Three frog legs were used, each as their own control and experimental group, and the threshold voltages for an initial contraction were recorded in each leg before and after the injection of lidocaine. The experiment showed a trend with the average threshold values, but the evaluation through a one-tailed paired t-test revealed that the data was not significant. The information gathered during this experiment and others similar provide a greater understanding of the molecular changes that allow for neuromuscular functioning to occur. 

Introduction:
The muscular system cannot work without its connection to the nervous system, as the nervous system generates an action potential that serves as a stimulus for muscular movement. The neuromuscular functioning has a level of specificity to where it can target individual areas of the body for movement, unlike the endocrine system that distributes hormones into the blood for transport. As an action potential is generated through the nervous system, it continues along the Nodes of Ranvier of a neuron’s axon in order for the excitation to travel to the muscle. This stimulates contractions, a process assisted by insulating myelin sheath on the axon [Tasaki: 1952]. Contractions that form as a result of the action potential can be recorded on myograms to evaluate the amplitude and force of a contraction. The force that is generated is dependent on the energy created through changing concentrations of sodium and potassium, which determine if threshold potentials are reached. Sodium channels allow charge carries to move across a membrane, depolarizing the cells, and promoting the driving of an action potential beyond its threshold value [Starmer: 2003]. Contractions are relatively easy to see in a frog leg, as the separation of the gastrocnemius muscle from the rest of the leg is a simple process. This muscle is also very important to the organism with its providing of significant strength, since frogs move using jumping movements generated by the legs. In this experiment, we hypothesize that if we inject sodium channel blocker into the muscle of a frog leg, then a lower action potential will be generated, resulting in a delayed contraction of the muscle.

Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, we utilized three frog legs, each as their own control and experimental group. Each leg was skinned, and the inner thigh muscles were separated to reveal the sciatic nerve, of which the probe was laid under to provide stimulation. The gastrocnemius muscle was then detached from the leg and suspended by a string from the force transducer, which was connected to the LabScribe program to show the myograms for each contraction. For the control group, a stimulus had been applied to the first frog leg, starting at 0.0 V and increasing by 0.1 V intervals until a threshold voltage for contraction was reached. This threshold voltage was then recorded for the leg, as well as the amplitude of the contraction. A final stimulation was presented at 0.1 V above the threshold, and the amplitude of that contraction was recorded as well for reference. 0.1 mL of sodium channel blocker, specifically 25 millimolar lidocaine, was then injected through a syringe into the gastrocnemius muscle, and we waited 3-5 mins before the next stimulating in order to allow time for the channel blocker to being working. The same procedure of the LabScribe program was used again, and the threshold value and consequent amplitude of the contraction were recorded. The process for the control and subsequent experimental trails were then repeated for the next two frog legs, and the threshold values were averaged. A one-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze the data, with a significant difference between two groups being determined by a P-value that was less than 0.05.


Results:
Throughout the experiment, there were obvious differences in threshold values between each frog leg of the control group, which is accounted for by the fact that all organisms and their respective processes are different. Qualitative observations showed that the twitches, or contractions, were absent at very low voltages, but were obvious at the threshold value. The contraction of the muscle at a stimulation 0.1 V above the threshold was visibly stronger, and this was also reflected by the amplitude of the contraction seen on the myogram. When the sodium channel blocker was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of the experimental group, the threshold value for a contraction increased on average. Figure 1 helps to analyze this data, showing that the mean for the experimental group was higher than that of the control group, although the standard deviation for the experimental group was much greater. This is depicted by the error bars in the graph. The one-tailed paired t-test, however, showed that these conclusions are not significant, as the p-value was calculated to be 0.335589.

Discussion:
The general trend seen in the data was that the input voltage at which threshold was reached was higher for the experimental group than the control group, as we predicted in our hypothesis. The evaluation of our one-tailed paired t-test value, though, led to the conclusion that our results were not significant, suggesting that the trend we saw in the data is most likely due to chance. This insignificant data thus cannot answer the question of the effect of sodium channel blocker on the contraction of a muscle. In an experiment that studied the effects of lidocaine on the contraction of the heart, it was noted that many other elements changed the duration and amplitude of the contraction, such as the concentration of the drug, the transmembrane potential, and the pH. It was also discovered that the lidocaine used dissociated from the sodium channels rather quickly [Echt: 1989]. These factors were not originally considered in this experiment, as we did not have the necessary equipment to measure and record external influences. Without taking this information into account for our own experiment, the data cannot be considered consistent between each frog leg. Another study found that the spread of a contraction can be prevented through the decreasing of extracellular sodium concentration, as it blocks the depolarization in tissues [Constantin: 1970]. Using this information, a future experiment should maintain the same hypothesis, but to increase the chance of obtaining significant data, the frog sample size could increase. Data collection could be made more accurate by measuring the output amplitudes after the action potential reaches threshold, or the amount of sodium channel blocker could be changed for a greater observational difference between the control and experimental group. It is important to study the neuromuscular system, as it is an organism’s process for one of its most recognizable functions: movement. Studies concerning the neuromuscular system help create a greater understanding of the molecular changes behind this normal action.
