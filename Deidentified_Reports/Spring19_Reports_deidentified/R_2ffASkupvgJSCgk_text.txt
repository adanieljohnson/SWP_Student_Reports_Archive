Title: Effects of Calcium Channel Activator on Frequency of Full Tetany in Rana pipiens Legs

Abstract:
In order for a muscle to contract, a strict process must be followed in order for an optimal result to occur. Full tetany is reached at different times depending on how optimal the conditions are for a contraction to take place. In Rana pipiens sample legs, this process was manipulated to see if tension could be increased and fatigue could be decreased. This was done by injecting the legs with the calcium channel activator 1MM A23187. When measuring the frequency at which full tetany was reached, there was not a significant difference between the frequency that the control groups reached full tetany and the frequency that the experimental groups reached full tetany. Because our results were not statistically significant and our hypothesis was not supported, we could not conclude that the increased concentration of calcium resulted in an increase in tension and a decrease in fatigue when frequency increased compared to the controlled group.

Introduction:
Similar to hormone systems, nerve and muscle systems respond to external and internal stimuli. However, these reactions in nervous and muscular systems occur within milliseconds, which is much quicker than in hormone systems, which can take up to days to respond [Johnson: 2016]. Skeletal muscles are made up of myofibers and motor neurons, which have axons that extend out into neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2016]. It is here that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released, which mitigates a series of reactions that eventually results in calcium being released to cause the muscles to contract [Johnson: 2016]. Muscle contractions can be voluntary, such as lifting a pencil, or involuntary, such as pumping blood through the heart. In a laboratory setting, one can control muscle movements through applying electrical impulses to the nerves and the muscles themselves. Knowing this, we are wondering how different levels of calcium would affect the activity and stimulation of muscles. We hypothesize that if a Rana pipiens sample leg is injected with a calcium channel activator, the increased concentration of calcium will result in an increase in tension and a decrease in fatigue when frequency increases compared to the controlled group.

Materials and Methods:
We were given three Rana pipiens sample frog legs for our experiment. The skin on the first leg was pulled down from the top of the frog leg to the foot using forceps. The sciatic nerve in the leg was found and connected to the stimulator. The stimulator control panel was then opened on LabScribe and an amplitude of 1.0V was typed into the Mark box. The Record button was hit to stimulate the nerve. The frequency (in Hz) began at 6.0 and was increased in 2.0 increments until full tetany was reached. This was our control group and observations were recorded at every 2.0 increment. The leg was then injected with .1 milliliters of the calcium channel activator 1MM A23187. Again beginning at a frequency of 6.0 Hz, the frequency was increased in increments of 2.0 Hz until full tetany was reached, and observations were recorded at every increment for this experimental group. This entire process was repeated for the remaining two frog legs. After full tetany was achieved in all three legs for both the control and experimental groups, a paired t-test was run to determine whether to accept or reject the alternative hypothesis.

Results:
Throughout the entire data collection period, there was one general trend that we observed. We saw in all three legs that the control group reached full tetany more quickly than the experimental group. In the first and third leg, full tetany was reached at 2.0 Hz lower in the control groups than the experimental groups. In the second leg, full tetany was reached at 4.0 Hz lower than the control group. This is shown in Figure 1 by the comparison between the frequency at which the “Control” and “Experimental” groups reach full tetany. The control group is represented by a shorter bar in Legs 1, 2, and 3. 
Using a paired t-test, the frequencies at which the experimental groups reached full tetany was not statistically significantly different from the frequencies at which the control groups reached full tetany at a 95% confidence level (t-stat = 4, df = 2, P = .057). Because our P-value was greater than .05, we have to reject our hypothesis at the 95% confidence level.

Discussion:
The results to our experiment reject our hypothesis that if a Rana pipiens sample leg is injected with a calcium channel activator, the increased concentration of calcium will result in an increase in tension and a decrease in fatigue when frequency increases compared to the controlled group. The calcium activator channel actually resulted in a higher frequency being required to reach full tetany. This is most likely due to an overload of calcium in the muscle ruining optimal conditions for contraction. Although calcium is necessary for the process of muscle contraction to be carried out, an excess amount can actually have negative effects on the stimulation procedure and cause the muscle to take longer to reach full tetany. In some cases, this abundance of calcium can even result in fatigue of the muscle. In a similar study, a woman suffering from involuntary muscle spasms was given an injection of calcium to subdue the contractions [Day: 1990]. Due to this infusion of calcium, the patient’s normocalcemic tetany was eradicated completely [Day: 1990]. Looking at information from our experiment, along with the information from the Day study, it is possible that overloads of calcium in the muscle could be the next step in subduing muscle spasticity. If excess calcium increases the frequency at which the muscle reaches full tetany, and in some cases causes the muscle to hit fatigue, this will prevent the muscle from contracting and as a result, diminish involuntary muscle spasms. If our study were to be taken a step further, a possibility would be to look into the changes that would be a result of injecting the Rana pipiens muscle with a sodium channel activator rather than a calcium channel activator.
