Title: Effects of Rhizobium meliloti on the resource allocation of alfalfa plants

Abstract:
Resource allocation in plants is the pattern in which species distribute limited resources. Resource allocation can be studied by observing the root: shoot ratio of plants. This experiment studies the effects of Rhizobium meliloti, a nitrogen fixing bacterium, on the resource allocation of alfalfa plants. We hypothesized that plants infected with Rhizobium meliloti would have a higher root: shoot ratio than plants without the Rhizobium. The data showed a significant difference between the control and experimental groups; however, our hypothesis was not supported as the control groups had a higher mean root: shoot ratio than the experimental groups. This suggests that plants infected with Rhizobium meliloti fix enough nitrogen from the soil for the plant to allocate resources to the stem and leaves.

Introduction:
Resource allocation is the pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources [Johnson: 2018]. While it is genetically fixed in species, allocation can be slightly modified to adapt to certain conditions [Johnson: 2018]. In the case of the plants being studied, the limited resources are often sunlight and water. Because leaves are responsible for using sunlight in the production of sugars, and the roots are used in the absorption of water, plants often allocate resources to these parts [Johnson: 2018]. This allocation can be studied through the root: shoot ratio which is the biomass of the roots divided by the combined biomass of the stems and leaves [Johnson: 2018]. Rhizobium is a bacterium that causes plants to grow root nodules which the bacteria can inhabit [Long: 1989]. The bacteria then fix nitrogen into ammonia which helps the plant grow. The plant then allocates sugars from photosynthesis to the nodes in order to feed the bacteria [Long: 1989]. From this information, we hypothesized that the alfalfa infected with Rhizobium meliloti would allocate more resources to the roots and have a high root to shoot ratio.

Materials and Methods:
For the control group, we soaked the alfalfa seed in 50mL of Miracle Grow and then placed them into two pots filled 2/3 with soil. We then covered the seeds in soil and watered them with 200mL of water. For the Experimental group we soaked the alfalfa seeds in 50mL of Miracle Grow and then placed them into two pots filled 2/3 with soil. We then covered the seeds with Rhizobium meliloti and covered that with soil. We then watered the plants with 200mL of water. For the next two weeks we watered each pot of plants with 200mL of water every other day. At the end of the two weeks we pulled the plants out of the pots (making sure to keep track of the control groups and the experimental groups). We separated out three groups of alfalfa plants with 5 individuals per group. For each group we separated the roots from the shoots and measured the maximum length for both. After we recorded the measurements, we calculated the root: shoot ratio for the lengths of each group. We found the standard deviations and then used a two-tailed, two sample t-test to determine the relevance of the data.

Results:
The mean root: shoot length ratio for the control was 4.662cm with a standard deviation of 1.141cm (fig. 1). For the experimental group there was a mean root: shoot length ratio of 2.075cm and a standard deviation of 0.616cm (fig. 1). Using a two-sample two tailed t-test we found that there was a significant difference between the control and experimental mean root: shoot lengths (t-stat = 9.99, df = 30, P = 6.61E-11).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the experimental groups soaked in Rhizobium meliloti would have a higher root: shoot ratio than the control groups was not supported by the statistical data. Instead, the plants grown without Rhizobium had a much higher root to shoot ratio than plants with Rhizobium. This suggests that in the experimental groups, the alfalfa plants allocated more resources to the stem and leaves than the roots. This suggests that the Rhizobium nodes in the roots are able to provide enough limited resources (in this case Nitrogen) for the roots so the plant can allocate more resources to the leaves and stems (Long: 1989).
