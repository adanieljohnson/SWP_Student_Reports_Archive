Title: IGR exposure does not effect mass in tobacco hornworms manduca sexta

Abstract:
Tobacco Hornworms, Manduca sexta, have a holometabolous life cycle, which allows them to transition from worms to flying adult moths through the process of pupation. During the final instar, pupation is caused by the commitment pulse. In this experiment we looked at how the disruption of the commitment pulse, through elevated levels of Juvenile Hormone (JH) affected the mass of M. sexta larvae. The expectation was that the disruption of the commitment pulse would adversely affect the M. sexta larvae and result in mass loss. Our resulting data showed no statistical significance in mass for controll versus treatment. Our controll worms all reached pupation, however, as our treatment worms did not, suggesting that JH may have an effect on pupation. This research could possibly have an important effect for farmers treating against M. sexta. If IGR does significently cause mass loss, or problems with pupation, IGR could be used as a safer pesticide to combat against M. sexta and possible other insects with a holometabolous life cycle. 

Introduction:
Tobacco Hornworms (M. sexta) are a type of insect which undergoes a holometabolous life cycle, a lifecycle with four stages, including pupation [Johnson: 2019]. The pupation allows for juvenile M. sexta worms to convert into flying moth adults. This distinction between adults and juveniles is an important evolutionary advantage because they do not have to compete over the same food sources. This pupation occurs after a regulated fluctuation in hormones including Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterones [Johnson: 2019]. Though both are necessary for the survival of the insect, JH was focused on for this because plays a more important role in the type of molt during development [Johnson: 2019]. 
During the fifth larval instar of M. sexta, there is an important time, called the commitment pulse, when JH levels, after previously being nearly undetectable, peak slightly, and then drop again [Kiguchi: 1978]. The commitment pulse is a signal that indicates the caterpillar’s readiness for pupation, one of the signals being a drop in JH. This experiment examines the role of JH levels in the M. sexta by using Insect Growth Regulator (IGR), an artificial elevator of JH. Our hypothesis is if JH levels are elevated during the commitment pulse, M. sexta larvae will weigh less because the hormones levels are irregularly high. This could be important for the development of future pesticides as juvenile M. sexta are pests. If IGR can significently reduce M. sexta larvae mass, or food intake, which on farms would be crop plants, it plausible that M. sexta adults, if they survive pupation, will be unable to produce as many offspring because the adults aren’t healthy.


Materials and Method:
Six similarly massed M. sexta larvae were separated into two groups of three. Each group was housed in a small plastic container which had four individual compartments: one individual was held in each compartment and the fourth compartment was left empty. Two air holes were poked in each compartment and 10g of an artificial diet with five drops of water was added to each compartment for the controll group. For the treatment group the same procedure was undertaken, but the treatment group also received five drops of Insect Growth Regulator (IGR). Both groups were housed inside an incubator with a twelve-hour light, dark cycle at approximately twenty degrees Celsius. Every other day, each M. sexta was massed on a digital scale, their enclosures were cleaned, and their food was replaced with the exact food procedure as listed above for each respective group.
The experiment ran for fourteen days. Once the final masses of the M. sexta were taken, each of the six M. sexta larvae had their largest recorded mass during the experiment subtracted from their smallest recorded mass. This calculation equaled: mass gained during the experiment for each M. sexta. The average mass gained was then calculated for each of the two groups. The two group’s standard deviations were calculated, and a two tailed t_test was run to determine if the average mass gained was significently different between the two groups. 


Results:
The average mass gained for the controll group was 11.97g while the average mass gained for the treatment group was 9.48g (Fig 1.). The standard deviation for the controll was .999g and for the treatment it was 2.10g (Fig. 1). A two-sample t_test was used to analyze our data. From the average mass gained for the controll and treatment groups, the differences between the two were not statistically significent (t_stat=1.86 d.f.=4 P=.137). At the beginning of the experiment, the controll M. sexta had a larger mass then the treatment M. sexta, but by the end of the experiment the treatment group had larger masses. All M. sexta larvae in the controll group did reach pupal eclosion by at least day 12 of the experiment, while none of the larvae in our treatment group reached pupal eclosion by day 14.

Discussion:
From the results of this experiment, it seems that we reject our hypothesis, that elevated levels of JH hormone would decrease growth (mass) of M. sexta lavae. This was not supported, because the resulting statistical tests were not significent. There was not a significent largest mass difference between the two groups. It is probable that the increase of JH from the IGR caused an increase in foraging behavior of the treatment group because they never hit the commitment pulse, due to the unnaturally high levels of JH. The commitment pulse indicates when the M. sexta larvae are ready to pupate, and their foraging behavior begins to slow down as pupation begins. It is logical then, that the absence of the commitment pulse would cause the continuation of foraging behavior even after the M. sexta larvae reached satisfactory masses for pupation. This is because there was no biological mechanism, the commitment pulse, to stop them from feeding. Because of the short duration of the experiment, we do not know the amount of time the treatment group would have stayed as larvae, but they certainly were in the larval stage longer than the controll group, which had all begun pupation on day twelve of the experiment. From other studies it seems that the if the treatment had pupated they would have been defective or died during it [Schluter: 1985] From this experiment it is apparent that treating food crops with IGR hormone to combat M. sexta would not be effective, and if done, may increase losses of crops.
A future step in the study of IGR’s effect on M. sexta larvae, would be to see if increasing the sample size for both the treatment and controll group and making multiple treatment groups with different levels of exposure to IGR, would still show that IGR has no significent effect on mass gain or loss. It would also be interesting to compare the time of pupations between an IGR group and a controll group to see how significent of an effect the IGR has on the M. sexta larvae pupations. It is quite possible due to our circumstantial evidence that M. sexta could be entirely unable to pupate if exposed to high enough levels of IGR. This inability to pupate due to the IGR could kill M. sexta, allowing farms to still successfully eradicate the pests through IGR, though significent damage to crops may occur doing so.
