Title: Synthetic Juvenile Hormone Precore’s effect on Manduca Sexta’s Life Cycle

Abstract:
Hormones is a complex study in biology because there are many hormones that can cause more than one response in bodily regulation and development. Different organisms have different hormones that stimulate development from juvenile to adulthood, and these hormone levels can be fluctuated based on diet. Specifically, Manduca sexta hornworms have two hormones that regulate and promote development into the pupal stage called Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Juvenile Hormone is present more so before the 5th larval stage and is the main hormone that promotes metamorphosis in the hornworm by decreasing the levels when it is prepared for. Thus, metamorphosis can be stimulated by controlling exposure to the Juvenile Hormone; moreover, by exposing the hornworms to an excessive amount of Juvenile Hormone, it can be hypothesized that adding excessive amount of Juvenile Hormone could cause abnormalities and decrease in weight and length. To test this hypothesis, we observed a control group fed only water and Manducta sexta diet and a treatment group fed Manducta sexta diet with 8 drops of Precore IGR solution, and we measured their weight and length over the course of 14 days. Although there may be a significance between amount of juvenile hormone present and the weight and length increase

Introduction:
This experiment studies the influence of hormones on insects development. Hormones are essential to development in life because they trigger responses and the beginning of stages for transitions in the life cycles. For example, in humans hormones trigger changes between juvenile to adult development for reproduction and survival through puberty. Similarly, for insects like the Manduca sexta the transition between juvenile to adulthood is molting for the pupal stage. During this stage there is decreased movement and the old cuticle is shed as a new outer cuticle is secreted by the insect’s epidermal skin cells. This molting allows for the insect to go through metamorphosis where the insect reorganizes its structure, internal and external [Johnson AD: 2016]. Specifically, hormones are necessary for this process, but the amount of this juvenile hormone is what is being studied. Studies have shown that having low levels of Juvenile hormones will stimulate normal pupation, but also that juvenile hormones declines at the end of the 5th instar stage or feeding stage which stimulates the molting stage [Kiguchi, Riddiford:1974]. The cycles of the Manduca sexta can be lengthened or shortened based on the insect’s diet and temperature. Juvenile hormone is higher in the early stages of the insect’s life up until the commitment pulse; the commitment pulse is the stage that determines if the insect is ready for metamorphosis based on weight. Moreover, IGRs affect regulatory processes leading to abnormalities that reduce insect survival. IGRs mimic Juvenile hormone function, and Juvenile hormones regulate metamorphosis, development, growth, and molting. In this experiment, we use Precore as a mimic of Juvenile Hormone. It is hypothesized that if the insect is exposed to 8 drops of the Juvenile Hormone IGR (Precore), then the insects will lose weight and decrease in length, heaving a less change of survival. 

Materials and Methods:
We weighed in grams and measured the length in centimeters of 8 Manduca sexta and separated them into 2 groups: 4 hornworms for the control group and 4 hornworms for the treatment group. We placed them in 2 separated quarterly-divided plastic containers. We used a plastic hole maker to make 2 small holes for each quarter of the containers. We measured out 10 grams of the food for each Manduca sexta hornworm. For the control group, each 10 grams of food had 10 drops of water mixed into it. For the treatment group, each 10 grams of food had 8 drops of Precore mixed into it with no water. Then, we kept the Manduca sexta in an incubator at 25 degrees Celsius, and repeated measuring in centimeters and weighing in grams  the hornworms everyday,  remaking and replacing the food everyday once a day, and clearning out the feces. Finally, we gathered the data and used a 2-sample t-test for the p-value to determine if our data for the averages of weight and length for 14 days is significant and useful for our hypothesis.

Results:
Overall, both the treatment and the control increased in weight and length over the course of the 14 days. After the 12th day, both the control and the treatment groups began to lose weight; meanwhile, the length for the treatment group stagnated and the control group length increased after the 12th day. It seemed that after day 12 the caterpillars started to eat less and reduced their motion, signaling preparation for pupation and molting. Our data for weight appears to correlate with this observation(figure 1); however, the length seems to deviation for the control group and does not make much of a statement (figure 2). During this time period between day 10-14, it was observed that some of the hornworms became to change in appearance such as black spots began to appear and eventually became darker, and the hornworms began to shrink and curl. We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results, and according to this equation our data is insignificant for weight (t-stat= 0.846, df=26, P= 0.40522) and  for length (t-stat=1.172 df= 26, P= 0.251871. Both p-values are greatly above 0.05, meaning there is a high chance of error. There standard deviation for the control group for weight great varied, ranging as high as 3.81, and the treatment group had a high standard deviation that ranged as high as 2.265. One the other hand, for both the treatment and control groups the standard deviation had lower and more constant standard deviations. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the Manduca sexta will begin to lose weight and decrease in length was not supported. The data proved no significant because the two-sample t-test calculated a greater value of 0.05 level, meaning that 8 drops of Precore IGR Juvenile Hormone does not have a significant effect on the life cycle of the Manduca sexta. It is possible that the IGR Juvenile Hormone would be effective in other doses. According to previous experiments, the use of a mimic of Juvenile Hormone called EGS (epoxygeranyl sesamole) produced an effect on pupation by reducing the sizes of the hornworms including the wings, the proboscis, a darker black color molting, abnormalities or missing body parts, and the different pigmentation of the adult eye [Kiguchi, Riddiford:1974]. This could suggest that our hornworms would still exhibit abnormalities after pupation, and thus there may be an effect of the IGR mimic Juvenile Hormone Precore. By understanding the hormones effect on the development of the Manduca sexta will improve our understanding of how hormones regulate and organism’s life cycles. Possible sources of error would be the inconsistent calculation or missed days of calculations, incorrect amount of Precore given such as 10 or 6 drops instead of 8, and inconsistent method of measuring length.
