Title: Agonistic Behavior in Betta splendins: Cold Water Decreases Activity

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to examine the effect of cold water on agnostic behavior in Betta splendins. This experiment tests if a decrease in the temperature of water will result in shorter time displays of red manes in Betta fish as a result of decrease in metabolic function. Betta fish were placed in the same aquarium in room temperature water and cold water and agnostic behavior was quantitatively measured by timing the display of the fishâ€™s red mane. The study found that the display time was less for fish in cold water compared to room temperature water. The experiment used a paired t_test to determine that the data was significent. The data supported the hypothesis that cold water decreased agnostic behavior of Betta splendins.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the behavior of Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, by observing their responses to another species member in cold water. Betta fish are model organisms because of their colorful displays in the presence of other species members [Johnson: 2018]. Intraspecific behaviors of bettas include broadside movements, like pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing, and facing movements, like erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and protruding red manes [Johnson: 2018]. These are known as agnostic, or aggressive, behaviors and this experiment specifically evaluates how long the fish display their red manes for which are protrusions of branchiostegal membranes [Johnson: 2018]. This agnostic behavior provides information about the behavior of Betta fish when placed under the stress of cold water. Temperature has been seen to negatively influence the metabolism of organisms, which is the process in which energy and materials are transformed in an organism and exchanged with its environment [Gillooly: 2001]. Temperature has this effect because it decreases the rates of biochemical reactions that take place within an organism that are needed for metabolic processes to occur [Gillooly: 2001]. It is predicted that cold water will decrease the metabolic rate of the Betta fish which will in turn decrease their display of agnostic behavior in order to conserve energy. If male Betta splendins are placed in room temperature water and cold water, then the fish in cold water will display their red manes for shorter periods of time.

Materials and Method:
Male fish #1 and #2 were placed into an aquarium filled with room temperature water and separated by a solid barrier. The fish were allowed to rest for five minutes. The barrier was removed and the time each fish displayed their red mane was recorded over a time span of five minutes. After the five minutes the barrier was replaced. The same process was repeated with male fish #3 and #4. Ice was placed in a separate aquarium to obtain a temperature of 14 degrees Celsius. Fish #1 and #2 were moved into the cold temperature aquarium and separated by a solid barrier. The fish were allowed to rest and adjust to the cold temperature for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes, the barrier was removed and the time each fish displayed their red mane was recorded over a time span of five minutes. After the five minutes the barrier was replaced. This process was repeated with fish #3 and #4.

Results:
The results showed that the fish in cold water displayed their red mane for shorter periods of time in comparison to fish in room temperature water. Figure 1 shows that the average time of red mane display per five minutes (seconds) was 56 +/- 50 seconds under cold water conditions and 205 +/- 40 seconds under room temperature conditions. The mean of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 5.20, d.f. = 3, p = 0.0138).

Discussion:
The data supported that hypothesis which stated that Betta fish in cold water would display their red manes for shorter periods of time. The display times were less in the treatments fish compared to the controll fish as seen in Figure 1. Previous studies have observed that fish have a specific range of temperatures in which they function best. A study conducted with Carassius auratus, or gold.f.ish, found that the fish had the greatest intake of feed between 23 and 27 degrees Celsius that allowed for the most growth [Imanpoor: 2011]. The study found that at an increase in temperature resulted in a decrease of feed intake within the fish population which demonstrates that fish function best at certain temperatures [Imanpoor: 2011]. This temperature dependence can be explained by the influence of temperature on metabolic processes. It has been observed that as the body temperature of fish decrease, changes in the chemistry of their cells reduce metabolic activity [Johnston: 1987]. There are millions of cells within an organism that work together to influence metabolism and one study specifically examined the influence of temperature on digestive enzymes. The use of nutrients of aquatic animals depends on digestive enzymes and the study evaluated two of these enzymes, amylase and lipase, in Betta splendins [Thongprajukaew: 2010]. It was found that the enzymes function best at different temperatures. For example, the neutral analyse isoform showed optimal temperature characteristics at 40 degrees Celsius [Thongprajukaew: 2010]. This study reinforces the explanation that temperature influences the metabolic processes of fish which can in turn influence behavior. The difference in the display times of agnostic behavior in the fish, measured through the presence of red manes, is therefore likely due to the inhibitory influence of the cold water on the metabolic functions of the fish.
