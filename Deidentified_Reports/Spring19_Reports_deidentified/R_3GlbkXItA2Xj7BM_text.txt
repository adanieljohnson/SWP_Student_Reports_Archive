Title: The effect of food on Betta splendens red mane aggressive behaviors

Abstract:
It is important to understand how organisms interact with one another, and the behaviors they display. Betta splendens, or the Siamese fighting fish produce broadside and facing behaviors ranging from less aggressive to very aggressive in the presence of their own species. The red mane behavior is the most aggressive behavior this fighting fish will produce. In this experiment, the effect of food on the red mane aggressive behavior was observed. It was hypothesized that the fish will produce the red mane for less time in the presence of food because they will be distracted by the food. The fish were split into 2 groups, with a pair of fish in each group. Each pair was tested first as the control with no food, then as the experimental fish with food. The results found that the fish with food produced the red mane on average for less time than the fish with food. The data showed no significant difference for average time with the red mane before and after they were exposed to food. This is important to study to understand how this species interact and possible distractors for this aggressive behavior.


Introduction:
The study of animal behavior is important to understand how organisms interact with other organisms and their environment. Scientists who study behavior try to find the purpose of these behaviors and how they are shaped by evolution. In this experiment Betta splendens, or the Siamese fighting fish are observed. They are known for their aggressive behaviors. Their intraspecific behaviors are studied, which is their behaviors in the presence of their own species [Johnson: 2018]. They have two types of behaviors: broadside movements and facing movements [Johnson: 2018]. The broadside movements are when the fish turns its side to their opponent, and the facing movements are when the fish faces its opponent [Johnson: 2018]. In both of these categories there are behaviors ranging from less threatening to very aggressive. For the broadside movements, the behaviors are pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail flashing, and the facing movements are erect pectoral fins, spreading the opercula, and creating the red mane, in increasing order of aggressiveness [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we want to test the effect of food on the aggressive behaviors of the Siamese fighting fish. Previous experiments have tested for food preference or preference for aggressive behavior displays. This experiment concluded that Siamese fighting fish showed preference for food over displaying aggressive behaviors to a mirror image [Hogan: 1974]. It is hypothesized that in the presence of food, Betta splendens will exhibit less aggressive behavior and show the red mane for less times than those fish without food, because the food will act as a distractor.


Materials and Methods:
Four Betta splendens were obtained and split into 2 groups, with a pair of fish in each group. Each pair of fish were used as the control fish, the fish without food, then they were used as the experimental fish, the fish with food. For one pair of control fish, the barrier was removed for 3 minutes, so only the clear barrier was in place. The number of times the fish displayed the most aggressive facing movement, the red mane, was counted and recorded. For each of these times the mane was displayed, the amount of time in seconds was recorded. After 3 minutes the barrier was put back into place, and the fish were given 5 minutes rest. The amount of seconds the red mane was displayed was summed. After 5 minutes of rest, the same pair of fish were used as the experimental fish, and the barrier was removed so the fish could see each other. Each minute for the 3 minutes, 1 pinch of food was added to see if the fish were distracted by the food. The same procedure was used where the number of times the fish displayed the red mane was counted and recorded and the amount of time in seconds was recorded for each red mane. This entire experiment was repeated for the second pair of Betta splendens. Then, a two-sample paired two tailed t test was performed. An alpha value of 0.05 was used to test significance.


Results:
When observing the fish there was a difference in aggressive behavior for the control fish without food, and experimental fish with food. In the presence of food, the fish showed less aggressive behaviors and seemed preoccupied with the food for a good portion of the time. Without food, the fish displayed their aggressive behavior red mane for most of the time. The average time with the red mane displayed for the control fish was 88.25 +/- 94.60 and 26.25 +/- 38.69 (Figure 1). The results were not significant for the average time with red mane before and after food (t value = 1.778, degrees of freedom = 3, p value = 0.17345).


Discussion:
The hypothesis that the presence of food would decrease aggressive behavior was rejected. The average time with the most aggressive behavior, the red mane, was longer for the fish before they were exposed to food than after they were exposed to food, which was expected. However, the results were not significant. In this experiment only 2 pairs of fish were used and produced extremely large standard deviations for the average times. Possible explanations for the not significant results could be that the fish we used cared more about fighting than the distraction of food. In a previous experiment Betta splendens were given a choice between eating and aggressive behavior displays to their mirrored image. In the first experiment, all the fish chose the food over displays of aggressive behavior [Hogan:1974]. In the second experiment, the fish were transferred into a different environment and showed a preference for displaying the aggressive behavior to the mirror image over the food [Hogan: 1974]. This could explain the difference because some of the fish we used were transferred to a new compartment right before the barrier was removed. These fish could have been more interested in displaying the aggressive behaviors in a new environment because they were less comfortable in the environment and would not be as distracted with food. In future experiments, we could control for this. However, overall the average time spend with the red mane did decrease after the food was present, so possibly with more trials significant results could have been produced. It is important to study possible distractors of these Siamese fighting fish and how they affect their behavior.
