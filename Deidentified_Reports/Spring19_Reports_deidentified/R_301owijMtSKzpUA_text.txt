Title: The optimal temperature range for PS II activity in Spinacia oleracea found to be 12-25°C 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis occurs in two phases: the light dependent and light independent reactions.  The light dependent reactions rely upon an electron transport chain that reduces the electron receptor.  We aimed to determine at which temperature range is the rate of photosynthesis the highest since photosynthetic proteins have an optimal temperature range.  We measured the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea by measuring the decrease in the absorption at 600nm at 0, 12, 25, 35, and 60°C which translates to an increase in Photosystem II reduction and photosynthesis rate since DCIP, the electron receptor that PS II uses in the Hill reaction, goes from blue to colorless when reduced.  A one-way ANOVA test produced a p-value of 0.024 with an alpha value of 0.05 which indicates a significant difference in the rates of photosynthesis at the different temperature values.  The Tukey-Kramer test, along with the rates of declining absorbance observed, determined that the optimal temperature range for photosynthesis in spinach was 12-25°C.       

Introduction:
In photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water, and CO2 to generate 6-carbon glucose molecules that are used to create energy for the organism.  Photosynthesis is divided into two main parts: the light dependent reactions and the light independent reactions.  In this lab, we will be focusing on measuring the rate of photosynthesis through measuring the light dependent reactions.  In the light dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed as photons by electrons.  These high energy electrons are passed through a series of electron carriers, creating high energy electron carriers and generating a proton gradient that powers ATP synthase.  Photosystem II (PS II) is one of the complexes that contains electrons which are excited by light in the electron transport chain, and reduction of PS II can be measured to measure the rate of photosynthesis.  In plants, PS II passes electrons to plastoquinone which reduces PS II, but in order to measure this reduction, the electron receptor must be changed from plastoquinone to a substance that is more easily measured.  In this lab, plastoquinone was substituted for 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) which changes from blue to clear when it is reduced.  This makes it possible to measure the amount of reduction of PS II, as a decrease in light absorbance at a wavelength of 600nm will correspond to reduction of PS II.  A greater increase in reduction of PS II will indicate a greater rate of photosynthesis.  
	In this lab, we aimed to determine the ideal temperature range for spinach leaves, Spinacia oleracea, to perform photosynthesis. Spinach was used because it is readily available, and there is a lot of information pertaining to the impact temperature has its rate of photosynthesis.  Proteins have an ideal temperature range at which they work, and the proteins that help plants perform photosynthesis are affected by changes in temperature.  At too high of temperatures, many proteins are denatured and do not work correctly.  At low temperatures, the proteins may become hardened and are unable to work properly.  The USDA Agricultural Marketing Resource Center states that spinach is a “cool season” plant [“Spinach”: 2018], and a 1990 study by Boese and Huner found that “spinach grown at low temperature is not stressed” [Boese and Huner: 1990].  Additionally, a 1998 study by Yamane, et. al found that in spinach leaves “photoinactivation of PSII was very rapid at high temperatures” [Yamane, et. al: 1998].  For these reasons, we predict that the ideal temperature range for spinach leaves to grow is slightly lower than room temperature.  Due to the fact that cool season vegetables grow best in soil temperatures between 50-70°F and after the final frost of the season The Pennsylvania State University: 2017] and spinach is a cool season vegetable, we predict that spinach leaves that are placed in the 12°C environment, which is 53.6°F, will have the highest rates of decreased absorbance and thus, PS II activity and photosynthesis.  In the 0°C temperature environment, we predict that the spinach leaves will be too hardened as “acclimated plants undergo photoinhibition at 4°C” and that “photoinhibition eventually gives rise to PS 2 reaction centers which are no longer functional” [Briantais, et. al: 1992].  Finally, we predict that at higher temperatures of 35° and 60° C, PS II activity will decrease as high temperatures denature proteins and “heat-treatment has been employed as a useful and selective procedure to block electron transport on the water side of PS II” [Enami, et. al: 1994].  Overall, using a Hill reaction with DCIP as the electron acceptor will result in the greatest decrease in absorbance at 600nm, highest rate of PS II activity, and highest rate of photosynthesis at 12°C when compared to 0°, 25°, 35°, and 60° C.        


Materials and Methods:
We will be using a Hill reaction with DCIP as the electron acceptor.  The central veins from 4 spinach leaves were removed and mixed with 20mL 400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8 in order to grind up the leaves.  This mixture was strained through cheesecloth, and 200µL of the resulting liquid is spun in the centrifuge at 200xG at 4°C for 3 minutes.  The supernatant is spun in the centrifuge at 1,000xG at 4°C for 10 minutes.  20mL of 400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8 is added to the pellet in order to resuspend it.  This how we isolated the sample of spinach chloroplasts used.  Then, we created 16 test tubes: the blank contained 8mL water and 2mL 100mM phosphate at pH 6.5 buffer, and tubes 1-15 contained 6mL water, 2mL 130 mM DCIP, and 2mL 100mM phosphate at pH 6.5 buffer.  100 µL of the resuspended chloroplast solution is added to each tube, and the completed solutions are transferred to cuvettes.  The initial absorbance for each cuvette was measured at 600nm, and the solutions were placed into their temperature environments.  The blank was left in room temperature (25°C), tubes 1-3 were put into the 0°C ice bath, tubes 4-6 were put into the 12°C ice bath, tubes 7-9 were left in room temperature at 25°C, tubes 10-12 were left in the 35°C heat bath, and tubes 13-15 were placed in the 60°C heat bath.  The tubes were left in their temperature environments for 10 minutes, and then the absorbances were taken again after the ten minutes.  This process was repeated for a total of 30 minutes in the temperatures, recording the absorbance every 10 minutes.  The percent change in absorbance was calculated and absorbance vs time was plotted on an XY graph.  Additionally, a one-way ANOVA test was used to determine if there was a significant difference in the photosynthetic rate at different temperature ranges. 

Results:
The 12 and 25°C temperatures had the largest decreases in absorbance since they had the smallest percentage value for the percentage of the time 0 absorbance that the time 30 absorbance value was at 87.8% and 87.7% respectively, and thus the highest photosynthetic rates occurred at temperatures of 12 and 25°C.  0°C also had a large decrease in absorbance, while 60°C had a much smaller decrease in absorbance.  35°C actually had an increase in absorbance, and all of these trends are seen in Figure 1.  The one-way ANOVA test gave a p-value of 0.024 which is smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. The Tukey-Kramer test results in Table 2 indicate that was 

Discussion:
Overall, this experiment was a success as our hypothesis that the highest photosynthetic rate would occur at 12°C was supported since the results showed that the ideal temperature range was 12-25°C.  The p value of 0.024, which was smaller than 0.05, indicated a significant difference in the decrease in absorbance of the spinach chloroplasts at the different temperatures.  This means that there was certain temperatures at which the chloroplasts photosynthesized better.  The Tukey-Kramer test results indicated that there was a significant difference in the decrease in absorbance, and thus the PS II activity and photosynthetic rate, at the temperature ranges of 12-35°C and 25-35°C.  Since the data in Figure 1 and Table 1 show that the greatest decreases in absorbance occurred in the 12 and 25°C temperature environments and the 35°C  environment actually increased absorbance, we could conclude that the ideal temperature range for the spinach leaves to photosynthesize was between 12-25°C and there starts to be a decrease in photosynthetic ability as the temperature nears 35°C.  
A 1982 study by Öquist states that, “Most plants, irrespective of origin, can photosynthesize and grow in the temperature range 10-35 C” and that there are “two major types of low temperature stress which occurs at temperatures below 0 C” [Öquist, 1982].  Our data supports this statement as the spinach leaves were clearly able to photosynthesize effectively at 12-25°C.  Furthermore, there was not as large of a decrease in absorbance for the solutions at 0°C meaning that the photosynthetic rate decreased at 0°C and that the chloroplasts were likely facing low temperature stress like freezing.  Finally, we can conclude that the chloroplasts likely faced some negative consequences of heat as the chloroplasts in 35 and 60°C environments had the smallest decreases in absorbance and thus the lowest rates of photosynthesis.  It is likely that the warm temperature began to denature the proteins responsible for photosynthesis, and PSII likely underwent photoinhibition as Briantais, et. al suggests [Briantais, et. al: 1992].   
In conclusion, this lab was a success as our hypothesis was supported and an ideal temperature range for the photosynthesis of spinach leaves was found to be 12-25°C.  Possible error could have occurred in our lab as it was very difficult to keep the temperatures completely constant for the duration of the experiment.  A few of the temperature baths, specifically the 35°C bath, fluctuated around the temperature value listed.  Overall, however, the next step would be to try to determine a more specific ideal temperature range and narrow the range down to an ideal value.  Furthermore, ideal temperature ranges for photosynthesis of different plant species could be found.  Photosynthesis relies heavily on the work of proteins, and proteins are dependent upon many factors in their environment such as temperature.  Fluctuation in temperature can have potentially disastrous effects on the ability of photosynthetic species to photosynthesize and survive.
