Title: The Impact of Additional Juvenile Hormone on the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Hormones affect the growth and development of the Manduca sexta, a tobacco hornworm. In order to understand how juvenile hormone specifically affects the M. sexta, an experiment with the addition of JH in the treatment group’s food was performed. The experimental hypothesis stated that if the JH is increased than the juvenile phase will be prolonged. 3 drops of JH was added to the treatment group’s food each day, and the masses of each individual caterpillar was obtained. After a two-week period, the treatment group weighed a statically significent amount more than the controll group, meaning that the juvenile hormone that was introduced impacted the larvae stages of the caterpillar.

Introduction:
Plants and animals use hormones to regulate growth and development, a crucial aspect of their life cycle. Specifically, insects use Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysteroids (E20) [Johnson: 2018]. The Manduca sexta, a tobacco hornworm goes through five larval development stages in which the first four stages consistently have a high amount of juvenile hormone (JH). Sudden increases in Ecdysteroids (E20) allow the M. sexta molt and start its next instar [Johnson: 2018]. After the fifth stage of larval development, the JH levels drop. The JH inhibits the PTTH, a trophic hormone in the brain, from releasing 20E. When JH levels decrease, it stops inhibiting the 20E which allows a small increase of 20E called the commitment pulse that indicates for the larvae to pupate [Nijout and Williams: 1974]. There are many experiments that follow the pupal stages of the M. sexta. In an experiment performed by John Reinecke, J.S. Buckner and S. R. Grugel in 1980, they followed the lifecycle of laboratory tobacco hornworms and how they developed over time. The experimental hypothesis that they presented was that the mass and development of tobacco hornworms would be affected by 24%  formaldehyde and 10% less water [Reinecke, Buckner and Grugel: 1980]. The experiment presented in this lab is similar, except instead of formaldehyde and water, the JH levels of the treatment group will be altered to see how the increase in hormones affects the development of the larvae. In response to the question “how does an increase in JH impact the rate growth within the M. sexta?”, the experimental hypothesis stated that if the JH is increased than the juvenile phase will be prolonged.  

Materials and Method:
There was one controll group with four caterpillars and one test group with four caterpillars. Having a controll group is important because it allows for isolation of the independent variable, the addition of JH, within the experiment. All eight caterpillars were separated into their own compartments in order allow the same amount of food to be given to each caterpillar. Maintaining constant conditions regarding temperature and light allows for the only differences among the groups regarding the independent variable. The controll group was given only 10 g. of food mixed with three drops of water in order to observe how the larvae would typically go through its lifecycle. The food and water must be replaced every day because the caterpillars will not eat the food if it is too dry. In comparison the test group had the independent variable, 4 drops of JH, mixed with its 10g of food and three drops of water to see how the increase in hormone will affect the growth and development of the larvae. Over two weeks, daily mass of each caterpillar will be found and from this, it is possible to find the average mass and standard deviation and calculate the p_value through a two-sample t_test. 

Results:
The average growth determined by mass for the treatment group was 10.60 ± 3.03 g while the controll group’s average growth was 5.94 ± 0.6g as shown in figure 1. The p_value calculated for the data presented was 0.012 with a degree of freedom of 6 and t-value of 3.01. The error bars did not overlap between groups. By the end of the experimental period, the treatment group caterpillars were large, bright green and swollen whereas the controll group were yellow and beginning to pupate. 

Discussion:
The experimental hypothesis states that if the JH is increased than the juvenile phase will be prolonged. The p_value calculated for the data presented was lower than 0.05 and so we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the larvae phases of the controll and treatment groups. Due to the error bars not overlapping, there was a statistically significent difference between the larvae in the treatment group compared to the controll group due to the added JH. This supports the experimental hypothesis that when juvenile hormone is increased in the M. sexta, its juvenile phase will be extended. While the controll group did increase in size over time, they began to turn yellow and start to pupate by the end of the two-week period. In comparison, the treatment group continued to grow throughout the duration of the experiment to the point of being swollen and almost unable to move themselves. They stayed bright green, showing that they were not beginning to pupate. The controll group followed a similar pattern to that of the tobacco hornworms studied in the Life Cycle of Laboratory Hornworms performed by Reinecke, Buckner and Grugel, whose hornworms passed through their 4 larvae stages and after the fifth began to pupate. The hornworms that had formaldehyde in their food did not develop and pupate as fast moving from the fourth to fifth larval stage and supported their experimental hypothesis [Reinecke, Buckner and Grugel: 1980]. The formaldehyde experiment performed in 1980 having similar results to the ones found in the experiment performed in this lab is important because it shows that our controll is reliable whereas the differences in data of the JH treated hornworms was due to the hormones provided. The results of this experiment provide the experimenter with further research questions such as what would happen if the same amount JH was added, but no water was added to each food store each day. Would the caterpillars continue to eat the food in both the controll and treated groups? This experiment provides an excellent example to show how impactful hormones are within the animal kingdom. They allow for the changes regarding growth and development and are a very crucial aspect of life itself.
