Title: Effects of Gentrol pesticide on insect growth and development in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Understanding insect hormones is important as it may be very beneficial to knowing how to best controll insect populations. In this lab, we examined the effect of Gentrol, a common commercial pesticide, on the weight and length of Manduca sexta caterpillars. After cultivating the caterpillars for several weeks, we found that those treated with a Gentrol solution grew significently more than those who were simply given a regular caterpillar. This is indicative that the Gentrol solution effectively mimics insect hormones and disrupts the life cycle of the Manduca sexta caterpillars.


Introduction:
Insects controll many of their physiological processes utilizing hormone-based signaling. Juvenile Hormone, or JH, is a regulatory insect hormone which functions to aid in the growth and development of young prepupated individuals [1]. Specifically, in the case of Manduca sexta, colloquially known as tobacco hornworms, juvenile hormone is used for regulating the type of molt during early instar development. Moreover, it is the simultaneous low presence of JH and rising levels of ecdysterone, a hormone which regulates the timing of molting in insect development, which initiates the start of pupation at the commitment pulse. An excess of JH hormone may be beneficial to the growth of Manduca sexta in its caterpillar stage, but may inhibit, or outright prevent, the pupation of an individual as its commitment pulse nevers happens so the process is never initiated. Gentrol, a common insect pesticide, contains the active ingredient (S)-hydropene, which is known effectively mimic the biological functions of JH [2]. In our experiment, we are examining this claim by testing the impact that treating Manduca sexta caterpillars with Gentrol has on their length and weight, as well as their ability to pupate. If there is no statistically significent difference between the weights and lengths of the caterpillars given untreated food and food treated with gentrol, then there is no correlation, and we accept the null hypothesis. However, if, like we hypothesize, the insects treated with gentrol have a greater length and weight but are unable to pupate, then we can accept the alternate hypothesis.

Materials and Method:
Insects controll many of their physiological processes utilizing hormone-based signaling. Juvenile Hormone, or JH, is a regulatory insect hormone which functions to aid in the growth and development of young prepupated individuals [1]. Specifically, in the case of Manduca sexta, colloquially known as tobacco hornworms, juvenile hormone is used for regulating the type of molt during early instar development. Moreover, it is the simultaneous low presence of JH and rising levels of ecdysterone, a hormone which regulates the timing of molting in insect development, which initiates the start of pupation at the commitment pulse. An excess of JH hormone may be beneficial to the growth of Manduca sexta in its caterpillar stage, but may inhibit, or outright prevent, the pupation of an individual as its commitment pulse nevers happens so the process is never initiated. Gentrol, a common insect pesticide, contains the active ingredient (S)-hydropene, which is known effectively mimic the biological functions of JH [2]. In our experiment, we are examining this claim by testing the impact that treating Manduca sexta caterpillars with Gentrol has on their length and weight, as well as their ability to pupate. If there is no statistically significent difference between the weights and lengths of the caterpillars given untreated food and food treated with gentrol, then there is no correlation, and we accept the null hypothesis. However, if, like we hypothesize, the insects treated with gentrol have a greater length and weight but are unable to pupate, then we can accept the alternate hypothesis.

Results:
From our experiment, we found the average change in weight over the two week period of the caterpillars treated with Gentrol was 9.17g , while the average change in weight of the controll was 4.95g. The average change in length for the Gentrol-treated caterpillars was 45.6mm while the average change in length of the controll was 23.0mm. Using a two-tailed two-sample t_test, we found the p_values for the changes in length and weight to be 2.19E-5 and 1.80E-8 respectively.



Discussion:
There could a variety of unforeseen variables for us to consider in our experimental results. For instance, the controll caterpillars were not prepared by us, but rather by a fellow lab group. This inconsistency could have somewhat undermined the efficacy of the controll group in being a true controll. However, our results tell us that there is a very statistically significent difference between the weight and lengths of caterpillars treated with Gentrol and those that were not, with very low p_values and standard errors that are marginal compared to the difference between the controll and treatment groups. This is indicative that despite potential variables skewing our experiment, our results hold true, and we can accept our alternative hypothesis that the gentrol promotes the growth of the caterpillars. No conclusive observations regarding the pupation of the caterpillars, though, could be made from our experiment, as it was ended long before the expected pupation of our Manduca sexta caterpillars. So a follow-up experiment could verify the effects that Gentrol has on the pupation of the caterpillars, employing a longer experimental run-time in order to best provide true results.
