Title: Effect of colored screens on the duration of Betta splendens aggressive displays

Abstract:
In the intraspecific interactions between male Betta splendens, the fish have both broadside and facing displays of aggression, the most aggressive being the spreading of the branchiostegal membrane also known as a red mane. These aggressive responses are usually caused by a threatening stimulus, such as another betta fish. Studies have shown that color is also a stimulus that can cause an aggressive response among bettas. We hypothesized that the fish would respond aggressively more frequently and for longer periods of time to a red plastic covering as it is the same color as the betta’s red mane display. We observed the number and durations of the bettas’ red mane displays while exposed to blue, clear and red plastic covers. After running an ANOVA test we found the red mane duration of bettas in the blue wrapped tank were significantly longer than those of the bettas in the clear and red tanks. This could be due to the fact that bettas tend to respond more to colors that are more different than their own and the fact that there was low visibility in the red plastic wrap.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior, it aims to explain the physiological purpose for behaviors and how the have shaped evolution. Betta splendens (Siamese fighting fish) are common aquarium fish. In the presence of their own species the Bettas have broadside and facing movements used to signal aggression. Studies have shown that these aggressive responses can be triggered by color stimuli, and that the response is more frequent when the stimulus is a different color than the betta fish [Thompson: 1965]. The broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. The facing movements include extending pectoral fins, spreading of the opercula and protruding the branchiostegal membranes, also known as red mane [Johnson: 2018]. While displaying at one another, male betta fish tend to follow each other’s movements. When one turns to display a facing movement, the other tends to turn to display a broadside movement. [Simpson: 1968]. The purpose of this experiment is observe the behavioral response of Betta splendens to various colored screens wrapped around their tanks in order to determine if the fish react aggressively to color. We hypothesized that the betta fish will respond the aggressively to the red screen due to the fact that the bettas respond aggressively to the sight of other bettas’ red colored branchiostegal membrane.


Materials and Methods:
The betta fish were placed into three compartments with one fish in each compartment. The fish were labeled based on their color, teal, red + yellow, and red + blue. The compartments will be separated by an opaque plate and a clear glass plate. A baseline observation of each betta was made by observing their movements while in isolation. After the observations were made, we wrapped the entire tank in a clear plastic as our control group. One of the opaque plates was removed and the interaction between the teal and the red + yellow was observed for five minutes. We recorded the amount of time before the initial reaction, the number of times the bettas red maned during the five minutes and the amount of time (in seconds) that each red mane lasted. After a five minute rest period, the same process was repeated for red + yellow vs. red + blue, and the teal vs. red + blue. After the observations were recorded, the same tests were done with red plastic wrap and blue plastic wrap covering the tank. Two ANOVA tests were run on the data, one testing the significance of the duration of each red mane, and another testing the significance of the number of times the bettas red maned. It is important to note that when inputting the data, we put durations into groups based on the color plastic wrap on the tank, we did not group the data based on which betta fish were reacting to one another (i.e. teal vs red + blue).


Results:
The ANOVA testing duration of the fishes’ red manes show a significant difference (P=0.000025) between the three plastic wraps. Further testing indicated that red mane duration in the blue plastic (mean= 22.488: +/- 18.627 sds) was significantly longer than both the red (mean= 11.679: +/- 8.940 sds) and clear (mean= 9.231: +/- 7.010 sds) plastic wrappings.  There was no significant difference between the red and clear groups [Fig 1]. The ANOVA testing the number of red manes showed no significant difference (P=0.095) between the blue (mean=7.167: +/- 1.472 sds) clear (mean= 9.5: +/- 2.168 sds) and red (mean= 9.667: +/- 1.155sds) plastic wraps [Fig 2].


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the Betta splendens would red mane for longer durations while in the red wrapped environment was not supported by the data. Betta fish in the blue wrapped environment showed a greater red mane duration than the red and clear wrapped environments. This could be because Betta splendens tend to show a greater response to color stimuli that are least like their own color [Thompson: 1965]. It also could be due to the low visibility in the red wrapped environment. When a betta fish in the middle compartment was exposed to a betta in the right side compartment while in the red environment, the betta in the middle showed no response while the one on the right showed normal aggressive behavior. This could be because the betta in the middle could not see the one on the right as the red wrap lowered visibility, and there was no opaque background on the right side to make the right betta more visible.  This would definitely skew results as the betta fish in the middle would not react to something it cannot see. This experiment helps further our understanding of animal behavioral responses, specifically those of Siamese fighting fish. For further study, we could repeat this same experiment but add an opaque background to the right side to ensure that both bettas can see one another while in the red environment. We could also wrap the tank in different colored plastics to see if there is a different response to a wider range of colors.
