Title: The effect of Curare on Frog Leg Muscl Contration Amplitude

Abstract:
Nerve impulses trigger the release of acetylcholine which opens up the sodium channels in order to generate an action potential. The action potential then allows the release of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum causing a muscle contraction. The independent variable, curare is a plant extract that is known as a poison. The null hypothesis was rejected and the alternative hypothesis was rejected. The data shows that curare does does not decrease the amplitude value of the contraction. It was expected that if curare was present than the amplitude of the contraction would decrease. The logic behind this was that curare is a poison, and given the knowledge of poisons the subject would get weaker as the poison spreads.

Introduction:
Nerve impulses trigger the release of acetylcholine which opens up the sodium channels in order to generate an action potential. The action potential then allows the release of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum causing a muscle contraction. The independent variable,curare is a plant extract that is known as a poison. Curare is known to interrupt the excitation of skeletal muscle[McIntyre: 1951]. The focus of study in the experiment was to see how the addition of curare to a frog leg changed the leg’s contraction threshold. In experimentation the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve were isolated from the frog leg and used to manipulate neuromuscular control. The biological question being asked in experimentation is will the addition of curare to the frogs neuromuscular system decrease the amplitude of contraction? Knowing the impact of the addition of curare on contraction amplitude can let scientist know how to reduce the strength of contractions in vertebrates. In the model system, the frog legs will be tested without curare in their system and then again with curare present in their system. It is expected that with the addition of curare into the frogs neuromuscular system the amplitude of contraction will decrease.


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were prepared for experimentation by degloving the frog skin and clipping the achilles tendon. The frog legs were then pinned by crossing pins of each other to stabilize the frog leg. A strong was then tied to the end of the achilles tendon and suspended to machine. The pin electrodes were then placed in the muscle and impulses were sent and threshold and amplitude values were recorded. This method was done for the first three frog legs without any substance in them, serving as the control group. The same frog legs were then injected with 0.1mL of curare and the process was repeated. The experimental frog legs were then compared to their corresponding control values.


Results:
The p-value for this experiment was 0.269703, which is greater than 0.05, showing that the data between the amplitudes of the control group and the experimental group was insignificant. The control groups standard deviation was 0.05. The experimental groups standard deviation was 0.056862. The stimulus amplitude in the experimental group was overall higher than the control group for all three frog legs. In frogs ‘one’ and ‘three’ the threshold of the experimental group was higher than the control group.



Discussion:
The p-value shows that the alternative hypothesis was rejected and the null hypothesis was no rejected. It can be said that curare does not decrease the amplitude of the muscle contraction in the tested frogs. Based on the data in can be inferred that injecting the frogs with curare delayed the contraction rather than changing the amplitude strength of the contraction. Curare is known as a blocking agent in single muscle spindles in cats[Granit: 1953]. This could be how the contraction was delayed. Since curare is a blocking agent the threshold could have been delayed because there was a partial blockage in the neuromuscular system. Reasoning for no full blockage could be because such a small amount of curare was injected, 0.1mL
