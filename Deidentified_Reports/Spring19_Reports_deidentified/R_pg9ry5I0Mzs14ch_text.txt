Title: Effect of soil-filled water on aggression rates in male Betta splendins

Abstract:
This experiment set out to determine the effect that a drastic change in environment would have on the aggression level of Betta splendins (betta fish) over time. Placing the betta fish in soil-filled water was expected to have a significent effect on their rate of aggression. The interactions between three male betta fish were observed first in clean water, then again in dirty water. Each behavior was assigned a number corresponding to a level of aggression. These numbers were then combined for each trial and divided by the time elapsed to come up with an aggression rate. It was found that there was no significent difference in aggression rate between bettas in the clear water versus the dirty water. 


Introduction:
In many species, males compete with other males for access to female mates [Clutton-Brock: 2013]. Sexual selection refers to one sex selecting mates based on certain morphological traits present in the opposite sex, which often manifests itself in females choosing mates based on the presence of these traits [Prum: 2012]. Males across many species have evolved complex structures that aid them in their competition for access to females [Prum: 2012]. While these structures do not always add a clear benefit to the overall survival of the organism in question, the presence of these structures does confer an advantage in terms of sexual selection [Prum: 2012]. Once females have chosen a mate with these favored traits, the traits are then passed down and gain prevalence within future generations of that species, contributing to the sexual dimorphism of that species [De Lisle: 2017]. Certain behaviors that can aid in reproductive fitness are known as performance traits, which may or may not confer an advantage in regard to natural selection [Oufiero: 2007]. Some of these behaviors are known as agnostic displays, aggressive behaviors intended to demonstrate the fighting capacity of an individual without undergoing the risk that comes with engaging in a fight [Tachon: 1999]. While it can be difficult to meaningfully quantify an organism’s aggressive behavior, Betta splendins (betta fish) in particular are known to have predefined levels of aggression. These behaviors include different fin movements, as well as color changes and the presence of a mane, and can be assigned numbers indicating increasing aggression [Bones: 2017]. In this lab, we set out to determine how a drastic change in environment would affect the aggressive behaviors displayed in the interactions of three male betta fish. We predicted that putting the betta fish in water filled with soil (their natural habitat) would have a significent impact on their level of aggression. 


Materials and Method:
We used three male betta fish, each one with an assigned number (1, 2, or 3). The three fish were kept in a standard size fish tank filled with clean water. Two sets of clear and opaque plastic dividers were inserted into the tank, creating three enclosures of equal size for each fish. We then observed the interaction between each combination of two fish after removing the divider. These combinations included 1 & 2, 2 & 3, and 1 & 3, with observations being made on fish 1, 2, and 3 respectively for each group. For each target fish, we recorded every instance of each following behavior: erect pectoral fin, gill flaring, presence of a mane, fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. For both sets of three behaviors, each behavior was given a numerical ranking (1, 2, or 3) in increasing order to indicate the level of aggression of that behavior. A rest period of five minutes was given between each interaction. We then filled another tank with dirt and then added an identical amount of water. We then observed the same combinations of fish and recorded their behaviors as we did in the clear water. Each observation took place for five minutes, or up until when one fish physically attacked another. We took the point values for each aggressive behavior and multiplied them by the amount of time each one appeared for a given trial, then took this number and divided it by the time elapsed to get a rate of aggression for each trial. A paired t_test was used to test for significance between the aggressiveness in the clean water and dirty water group. 


Results:
The data indicates that the betta fish in clean water had a higher aggression rate on average. Betta fish in the clean water had an average aggression rate of 0.1378±0.0931, while betta fish in the dirty water had an average aggression rate of 0.0133±0.0231. A higher aggression rate means that the fish displayed more aggressive behaviors of a period of time, which the fish in the clean water clearly did. The mean rate of the controll group was not significently higher than that of the experimental group (t = 2.8030, d.f. = 2, P = 0.1072). 


Discussion:
Because the results did not indicate a significent difference in the aggression rates between the experimental and controll groups, our hypothesis was not supported. As such, the null hypothesis was not rejected. While the fish in the clean water did display a higher rate of aggression on average than those in the dirty water, the difference in those rates was not significent, implying that the difference in aggressive behavior may have been due to chance. This experiment is worth repeating, both under the dirty water conditions as well as under different conditions, such as restricted or enhanced nutrient levels. In another experiment, betta fish were exposed to robotic fish in order to gauge aggression in the bettas in response [Romano: 2017]. The duration of several aggressive behaviors was found to be significently different when the bettas came into contact with the robotic replicas. This is in line with our initial hypothesis. A better understanding of aggressive behavior in other species has the potential to improve the welfare of those animals. Across the United States, roughly 1.5 million animals are euthanized by shelters each year [Phillips: 2018]. Many dogs are handed over to shelters due to aggressive behavior, which doubles as the reason many of them are never adopted [Phillips: 2018]. Deeper research and understanding into the aggressive behavior of animals could open up the opportunity to rehabilitate these dogs and make them suitable for adoption.
