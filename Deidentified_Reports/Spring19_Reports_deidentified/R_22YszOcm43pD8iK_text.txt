Title: The Impact of Saltwater on Resource Allocation in Ryegrass

Abstract:
With rising sea levels, irrigation practices, and deforestation, plants are being exposed to increased levels of salinity. The salt creates a decreased water potential in the plant, meaning it is unable to absorb as much water, thus hindering the growth and development of the plant. In order to examine resource allocation in plants exposed to saltwater, the root to shoot ratio of Lolium perenne, or ryegrass, was measured. Since the plants would be unable to absorb as much water, it was hypothesized that the plant would allocate its resources to the roots, thus increasing the root to shoot ratio, in order to increase water uptake. Both the height and weight root to shoot ratios were significantly larger in the ryegrass plants that received saltwater than those that received tap water. Future studies should examine various plant species to observe adaptations coastal plants have made in order to survive in a high salinity environment. 

Introduction:
Sea levels across the United States are rising and will continue to rise in the years to come [Conner: 1994]. Consequently, coastal plants are being exposed to an increased amount of salt water. Furthermore, plants are frequently exposed to saltwater through modern irrigation and deforestation practices [Flowers, 2005]. In order to understand how rising sea levels are impacting the coastal ecosystem, it is important to understand how an increased exposure to saltwater would affect plants. Additionally, with an increased awareness on saltwater presence in the soil, agricultural companies may be able to develop plants that are more tolerable to these conditions. 
While many plant species have adapted to live in environments exposed to saltwater, there are many that are not tolerable of these conditions. Unfortunately, the plants that have not adjusted to salinity exposure likely have decreased growth or do not grow at all [Conner: 1998]. This is a direct result of the salt’s impact on the plant’s ion concentration and decreased water potential [Flowers: 2005]. If plants are deficient in water, they will allocate their resources in a way that would maximize root growth in order to increase water absorption [Johnson: 2018]. In order to observe this resource allocation, we performed an experiment on Lolium perenne, also known as ryegrass. Ryegrass was used because it is widely grown in the United States and also grows at a fast rate, making it ideal for experimentation [Grubinger: 2010]. Knowing that salt decreases water potential in plants, it was hypothesized that if ryegrass exposed to saltwater, the roots would grow longer and result in a larger root to shoot ratio, where the shoot is defined as the stem and leaves combined.

Materials and Methods:
First, four pots were filled with vermiculite. Then 200 mL of water and 100 mL of Miracle Gro was added to each pot. 16 holes small holes were then poked into each pot and two ryegrass seeds were put into each hole. The holes were then covered up with vermiculite. The plants were kept in a greenhouse and watered daily for two weeks. Two of the pots were watered with 100 mL of tap water everyday and the other two pots were watered with 100mL of salt water (3% NaCl). After two weeks, ten rye plants were harvested from the two pots that were watered with salt water and ten plants were harvested from the two pots that were watered with tap water. In order to do this, the plants were carefully pulled apart while submerged in an inch of water in a plastic tub. The plants were then cut apart from the roots by making cuts right above the seed. The root and shoot were both dried and then weighed and measured separately. A two-tailed t-test was ran to test for statistical significance.

Results:
The average root to shoot ratio for both the weight and length of the ryegrass plants was higher in the plants that received saltwater than those that received tap water. The error bars on the graph represent the standard deviation of the weight and length of the plants. For the weight of the plants, the t-test showed the results were statistically significant, t(18) = 7.32, p = 8.44x10-7. For the length of the plants, the t-test also showed the results were statistically significant, t(18) = 7.77, p = 3.68, p = 3.68x10-7.

Discussion:
The ryegrass that received saltwater had a significantly larger root to shoot ratio for both the weight and length than the ryegrass that received tap water, thus confirming our hypothesis. The ryegrass that was exposed to NaCl through the saltwater had a decrease in water potential, forcing the plant to maximize its root growth in order to increase water absorption. Since the plant was allocating its resources to the roots, less resources were available for the stem and leaves of the plant, explaining the increased root to shoot ratio. Furthermore, a 1994 study by William Conner also found an increase in root to shoot ratio in Chinese Tallow Seedlings that received saltwater, further supporting our results. 
While the results were statistically significant it is still important to consider possible errors in order to optimize future studies. The ryegrass used in our experiment and plants from previous literature are not typically grown on the coast and likely would not have adapted to a high salinity environment. Future studies could look at plants common in coastal ecosystems to determine if they have developed a higher tolerance to salt. Another important consideration to take into account when examining our study is that the control group plants were watered with tap water instead of distilled water. It is possible that the increased growth seen in the control condition was due to an impurity from the tap water. Future studies should use distilled water in order to decrease possible error.
