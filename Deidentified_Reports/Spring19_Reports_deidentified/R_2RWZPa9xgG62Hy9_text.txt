Title: Effect of Caffeine on the Strength of [Rania pipiens] Leg Muscle Contractions 

Abstract:
Neuromuscular Control is an important topic in comparative biology. With neuromuscular controll it is important to understand how nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense as well as respond to internal and external stimulus. In this lab we looked at the effect of caffeine on the response (muscle contraction) when the sciatic nerve of a [Rania pipiens] leg was stimulated at threshold. We dissected and exposed the sciatic nerve of a [Rania pipiens] leg. The leg was hung by the gastrocnemus muscle and pin electrodes were inserted into the sciatic nerve to test the response when it was stimulated before and after caffeine was injected. The expectation was that the caffeine, a calcium ion channel agonist, would increase the response, which is the force of muscle contraction. Our data showed a significently higher response after the caffeine was injected. This significance along with the observations, suggests that the amount of caffeine was enough to stimulate the release of more Ca²⁺ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing the number of contractions and force of contractions. This demonstrated the potential effects of caffeine on muscle contraction, perhaps unfavorable to humans. 


Introduction:
In this experiment we evaluated the effect of caffeine on the response (muscle contraction) when the sciatic nerve of a [Rania pipiens] leg was stimulated at threshold (0.1 amps). Ringer solution was used before the caffeine was injected. The neuromuscular system is composed of nerves and muscles and can respond within milliseconds [Johnson: 2018]. Both vertebrates and invertebrates have skeletal muscles that are innervated by motor neurons. The axons of the motor neuron extend into a muscle and then branch to innervate myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. At the neuromuscular junction nerve impulses that arrive there cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. An action potential is generated and spreads through the fiber, stimulating the release of Ca²⁺. The release of the Ca²⁺ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum activates the contracting of the muscle fiber by exposing myosin binding sites on the actin. When the myosin heads move (a power stroke), the myofiber shorten, creating a muscle contraction [Olorunshola: 2011]. [Rania pipiens] act as a good model since they have a well-understood basic physiology, can be dissected easily and have a greater similarity to humans than many other animal models. Ringer solution contains several salts dissolved in water such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. Caffeine, a central nervous system stimulator and Ca²⁺ ion channel agonist, stimulates the release of Ca²⁺ [Olorunshola: 2011]. I hypothesize that after the caffeine injection the [Rania pipien] leg will have a higher response (in volts) when the sciatic nerve is stimulated since caffeine acts as a Ca²⁺ agonist, perhaps increasing the amount and force of the contractions. 

Materials and Method:
A leg was placed in a dissecting pan and with a pair of forceps the skin at the top of the leg was grasped and pulled down towards the foot. Frog ringer’s solution was used to moisten the skinned leg. A dissecting probe was used to gently separate the inner thigh muscles by starting at the upper end and then extending to the knee. The white sciatic nerve was exposed and freed from the connective tissue. The leg was hung by the gastrocnemus muscle and the remainder was pinned down. The pin electrodes were inserted into the sciatic nerve. With the ringer’s solution the sciatic nerve was stimulated at the threshold (0.1) three times and then 0.1 Ml of 200 millimolar caffeine was injected in the gastrocnemus and the sciatic nerve was stimulated another three times. This procedure was repeated for two more legs. A myogram was used to analyze the muscle contractions and record the voltage of the response. A paired t_test was used to test whether the difference after the caffeine injection was statistically significent and a graph was used to depict the mean before and after the caffeine was injected. 

Results:
The mean value of the response before the caffeine was 0.569 volts and the mean value of the response after the caffeine was 1.278 volts, showing a difference of about 0.709 volts (Fig. 1). A paired t_test resulted in the p_value of 0.003, showing that the increase in volts when the caffeine was injected was a significent difference. The general trend was that the caffeine injection in the leg increased the response of the sciatic nerve. 


Discussion:
My hypothesis, that if the [Rania pipiens] leg was injected with caffeine the sciatic nerve response would be higher, was supported. The significent difference after the caffeine injection is perhaps since caffeine is a calcium ion agonist. Caffeine acts through releasing calcium ions from the terminal cisterns of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing more calcium to bind to troponin C. This leads to the uncovering of binding sites for myosin on the actin filament, leading to a power stroke [Johnson: 2018]. The increase in the concentration of calcium ions leads to a “Rachet theory,” which is an increase in the number of power strokes and the force of the contraction [Olorunshola: 2011]. The myogram also showed that before the caffeine was injected the response was normal, but after caffeine was injected there was chemically induced tetany present. An experiment that was done where caffeine was used to alter the skeletal muscle contraction of a [Rania pipiens] showed that caffeine promoted Ca²⁺ release and ultimately resulted in the [Rania pipiens] having a stronger muscle contraction. This experiment could be done again with different concentrations of caffeine to test whether different concentrations of caffeine lead to higher or lower strengths in muscle contraction [Olorunshola: 2011]. If repeated, more trials could also be done to ensure the results are consistent. These results are important since caffeine is used in daily life and a staple for many individuals. Spasms, muscle tremors, and twitching are common side effects of caffeine when too much is consumed, which is not favorable. This experiment helps highlight the risks of ingesting too much caffeine and its effect on the muscles.
