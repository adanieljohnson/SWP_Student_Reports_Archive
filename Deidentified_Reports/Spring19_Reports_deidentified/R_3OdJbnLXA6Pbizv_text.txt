Title: Insect Growth Regulator on [Manducta sexta] caterpillar development

Abstract:
A common form of pest controll is the use of insect growth regulators (IGRs). These regulators are targeted at stopping the growth and development of certain insects by affecting the hormone systems of them. The effect of these IGRs was looked at in regards of the hormones Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone within [Manducta sexta] caterpillars. It was expected that the use of IGRs on the hormones of the caterpillars (through incorporating into their diet) would hinder the growth and development of them. Through running a two-week experiment, using four different types of insect growth regulators, it was determined that these treatments do as they intend, and prevent the growth and development of insects. It was found that the caterpillars who were not treated with any insect growth regulators, developed as normal, going through the stages of life on an expected time schedule. 

Introduction:
[Manducta sexta] is an insect belonging to the order Lepidoptera. The [Manducta sexta] goes through a series of stages while it develops from a larva to a pupa, to an adult moth. This life cycle takes about 38 to 49 days but is subject to change depending on other conditions such as environment or diet. The way that this development is controllled, along with many other factors such as growth, behavior, and physiological characteristics, is by hormone and neuron based signaling. There are usually three main hormones that work within the [Manducta sexta’s] body that controll the life cycle of them. First is Prothoracicotropic (PTTH) or Brain Hormone (BH), which controlls ecdysterone being released. Although it serves an important function to the [Manducta sexta], it was not looked at during this lab. The second important hormone is Ecdysterone (20E), which is in charge molting timing during development. This hormone works together with the third hormone, Juvenile Hormone (JH) in insect development. Juvenile Hormone regulates molding type during development. Additionally, both JH and 20E serve other purposes in adult insects and are needed in order to sustain life in insects [Johnson: 2016]

IG regulator, Precor, Azagaurd, and Gentrol are all substances that were used during the lab, and all of them are classified as insect growth inhibitors. IG regulator is a brand that advertises its ability to prevent insects from becoming adults. Precor, does a similar thing to insects’ development, using methoprene as its active ingredient. Methoprene is an analog to Juvenile hormone [Zou: 2013]. Azagaurd has a natural botanical formula that uses 3% Azadirachtin that regulates insect development. Azadirachtin is isolated from seeds of an Indian neem tree, and causes distortion of the metamorphic cycle in insects, specifically endocrine function [Malczewska: 1988]. Finally, Gentrol has its main active ingredient as (S)-Hydroprene that is used for pest controll. 

Insect growth inhibitors work in different ways to stop the development of many insects. The process of molting and metamorphosis are regulated precisely by JH and 20E. When this balance is interfered with, by means of insect growth hormones, the normal growth and development of the insect will be altered. 

The goal of this lab was to look at the effects of IG Regulator, Precor, Azagaurd, and Gentrol on growth and development of [Manducta sexta] caterpillars; it was also to see how hormones effected the growth and development of the caterpillars and the role IGRs played in altering these hormones. It was hypothesized that the controll group will grow larger and healthier than the other two groups, for both Precor and IG Regulator will inhibit growth and development of the [Manducta sexta] caterpillars.

For the second experiment, it is hypothesized that the controll group will develop more in their life cycle than the other two groups. This is because the Azagaurd and Gentrol will play a role in stopping the development.


Materials and Method:
Two different experiments were conducted on the [Manducta sexta] caterpillars during lab in order to determine how hormones effected their health. During week one, we used three groups of four caterpillars during the experiment. First, all of the caterpillars were weighed in grams and measured in length in centimeters before placing into their randoMly assigned groups. All of the caterpillars were fed 10g of caterpillar food and each group had a different addition to this food. The controll group was fed the 10g of caterpillar food, wet with ten drops of distilled H2O. Group two was also fed the 10g of caterpillar food, but it was wet with ten drops of IG regulator. The third group’s caterpillar food was wet with ten drops of Precor. The caterpillars were checked in on every day to ensure they had enough food and to clean their environment. After seven days the caterpillars were re-weighed and measured, and these values were recorded in a lab notebook. To analyze this data after collection, ANOVA test was performed for the controll group and all treatment groups.

During week two, a similar experiment on the same caterpillars were performed. The only variable that changed from week one was the food that the caterpillars were fed. The controll group continued to be given 10g caterpillar food wet with ten drops of distilled H2O. Group two’s food was switched from being wet with ten drops of IG regulator and given ten drops of Azagaurd in the 10g of caterpillar food. Similarly, the group given Precor during week one was given 10g of caterpillar food, now wet with ten drops of Gentrol. The measurements for the caterpillars on day seven of week one was used as initial measurements for the caterpillars. After seven more days, the caterpillars were reweighed and measured in order to see the effect of the new hormones. A T-test was performed in order to analyze and compare our controll group to one of the treatment groups treated with Gentrol. 


Results:
Week 1-
There was no significance difference between the IG regulator, Precor, and controll group for the change in mass, however there was a significent difference between IG regulator and the controll. The d.f.= 2, and p=0.013. For change in length, there was not a significent difference between IG regulator, Precor, and the controll group, but there was between IG regulator and the controll group. The d.f.=2 and p=0.015. The controll group grew significently more in length and weight (see figures 1 and 2) than the treatment groups.

Week 2-
There was a significent difference between Gentrol and the controll group for the average change in length in caterpillars, for the d.f.=4 and p=0.016. There was also a significent difference between these two treatment groups for the average change in mass for the caterpillars. The d.f.=4 and p=0.015. Figure 3 shows that Gentrol grew more in length than the controll, while figure 4 shows the differences in mass between the two groups, the Gentrol group still growing more in mass than the controll.



Discussion:
Both the hypothesis’s that the controll group would develop more in week one and the hypothesis that the controll group would develop more in week two were supported in this experiment. For week one, a significent difference was observed between the controll group and the group treated with IGR, as well as between the controll group and the group treated with Precor (p=0.013). This was true for both the change in mass and the change in length for the caterpillars; see figures 1 and 2. There was not a significent difference between the group treated with IGR and the group treated with Precor. This is because both IGR and Precor are insect growth regulators, and although they have different active ingredients, they still have similar purposes, and this is to stunt caterpillar growth. These results suggest that the insect growth regulators had an effect on the caterpillar’s hormones that controll growth and development. The same thing can be interpreted from the results obtained during week two, when comparing Gentrol and the controll group. There was a significent difference in the change in length and the change in weight between these groups (p=0.016). When looking at figure 3 and 4, it is seen that the group treated with Gentrol grew more in mass and weight. Despite this, they did not develop as much as the controll group. The controll group was further along in their development, and was pupating, so they were smaller and weighed less. Although the second week of this experiment began with the use of a controll group and two treatment groups, at the end of the second week, three of the caterpillars treated with Azagaurd had died. Do to this, it was decided that, for the purpose of this lab, it would be better to analyze just the Gentrol compared to the controll group, using a T test. While the death of most of the caterpillars treated with Azagaurd was most likely due to the treatment, it would skew the results of the statistical testing if they were included. These statistical significances between the groups showed that the insect growth regulators did stop the caterpillar development both weeks. This most likely happened, for all of the inhibitors have some sort of active ingredient that is similar or a form of Juvenile hormone. As insects develop, their levels of both JH and 20E change based on the stage of life they are in. If there is an excess of a hormone, then the development will be altered. An insect’s amount of JH completely drops off once it begins pupating, and it significently decreases its levels very early on in its life cycle. By adding insect growth regulators to their food, that contain ingredients that imitate JH, this stops the insects from developing into the pupal stage and then adult stage [Johnson; 2016]. This experiment is consistent with another study done that was similar. The study looked at the effect of Azadirachtin on development of [Galleria Mellonella] larvae. Azadirachtin is similar to the insect growth regulators used during this lab and can therefore be compared to our study. It was found that it caused disturbances in the metamorphic process, stopped growth, and caused death. [Malczewska: 1988]. Although it was not the exact same conditions as our experiment, the consistencies within the two experiments make sense due to the purpose of all insect growth regulators.

In the future, this experiment could be used to further research insect pest controll. This could be done by looking at which insect growth regulators had the strongest effect on the caterpillars, and then using this information to research in depth the ingredients within it. With that information it can be broken down and see what ratio of each ingredient is most effective at controllling insects.
