Title:  The Effect of JH Analog on Manduca Sexta Caterpillar Maturation

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillars were treated with JH analog to determine if it inhibited the growth and maturation of caterpillars from larva to pupa. Two groups of three caterpillars received 7 microliters of water, in the controll group, or JH analog, in the experimental group, per ten grams of food, and their weights were recorded every day for a week. Using a two-sample T-test, it was determined that the hypothesis was not supported, and that JH analog does not prevent caterpillar maturation from larva to pupa.

Introduction:
The purpose of the lab is to observe the effect of a JH analog on the weight of manduca sexta caterpillars. JH, juvenile hormone, controlls maturation in manduca caterpillars by allowing them to mature from a caterpillar to a pupa when present at low levels. JH analog mimics JH; by treating caterpillars with the analog, the amount of JH present essentially increases. If JH analog is present, then manduca caterpillar weight will decrease because JH levels will be too high for regular growth and maturation from a caterpillar to a pupa to occur. The independent variable in the experiment is the presence of JH analog in the caterpillars’ diet, and the dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillars in grams.

Materials and Method:
Two groups of three manduca sexta caterpillars were divided into separate containers. The caterpillars in both groups were fed 10 grams of Great Lakes Manduca brand food. Each caterpillar in the controll group received seven drops, or 70 microliters, of water per 10 grams of food. Each caterpillar in the experimental group received 7 drops of JH analog, or 70 microliters, of water per 10 grams of food. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator at 25 degrees Celsius in 24 hours of light and 0 hours dark. Every day for one week, the caterpillars’ weights were recorded. A two-sample T-test was used to compare the averages of the difference in the weight of the caterpillars between the final and initial measurements of the controll and experimental groups. 

Results:
In both the controll and experimental group, the caterpillars grew and matured regularly, as their weights increased steadily over the course of the week. The average change in weight of the caterpillars in the controll group was 7.38, while the average change in weight of the experimental group was 5.93. The p_value of the two-sample T-test was 0.147, which is greater than 0.05, indicating that there is no significent difference between the average change in weight of the two groups.

Discussion:
The data disproves the hypothesis that the JH analog would inhibit growth of the manduca sexta caterpillar and inhibit its maturation by preventing the transition from larva to pupa. There was no significent difference between the average weight difference of the caterpillars that were treated with JH analog and the caterpillars that were not treated. Initially, it was expected that the caterpillars’ maturation would be inhibited because the JH analog mimics JH, which allows the caterpillar to develop from a larva into a pupa when present at low levels. Thus, the expectation was that the caterpillars would not be able to mature into a pupa because the JH analog would cause JH levels to be too high for regular maturation to occur. However, our hypothesis was disproved, likely because not enough JH analog was present to create a significent difference in the maturation of the manduca sexta caterpillar. However, although there was no significent difference in the change in weight of the caterpillar, the caterpillars in the controll group were larger and appeared fatter and more vibrant than the caterpillars in the experimental group, which were smaller and less vibrant green. Our data is not in line with the results of Tunaz’s “Insect Growth Regulators for Insect Pest Control,” which states that insect growth regulators, in this case, JH analog, affect the development of insects [Tunaz: 2004]. The logical next step for this study would be to increase the amount of JH analog given to the caterpillars. The caterpillars were given 7 microliters of analog per 10 grams of food. The experiment should be conducted again, but the caterpillars should be given 12 microliters of JH analog to see if it inhibited their maturation from a caterpillar to a pupa.
