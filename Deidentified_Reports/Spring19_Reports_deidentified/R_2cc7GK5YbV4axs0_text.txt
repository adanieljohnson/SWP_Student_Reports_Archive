Title: Caffeine effects on tetany and fatigue in frog gastrocnemius muscle 

Abstract:
Both the nervous system and the muscular system help to produce muscle contractions. When studying the muscles, it is important to know how certain drugs affect the contraction of the muscles. In this experiment we look at the effect of injecting caffeine into the gastrocnemius muscle of frog legs by comparing an experimental group injected with caffeine and a control group without caffeine. The expectation of this experiment was that the experimental group would have a significantly bigger difference in the V2-V1 voltage than the control group due to the caffeine injection. The results showed that the average V2-V1 difference for the control group was 0.616V, and the average V2-V1 difference for the experimental group was 1.357V. Based on visual and tactile observations, one could see and feel that the frog legs injected with caffeine contracted with much more force than the control frog legs. The measurement of tetany in the experimental frog legs also confirmed the hypothesis. Our data and statistical paired t-test showed that the results were significant, indicating that our hypothesis was supported. Learning and researching more about how drugs like caffeine affect muscle contractions and induce tetany could give us a broader understanding of how the nervous system and the m

Introduction:
This experiment illustrates how the nervous system and the muscular system work together to respond to internal and external environments. Both the muscular system and the nervous system work to produce muscle contractions. The skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates are made up of many myofibrils, and they are bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups. Nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, and acetylcholine is released, leading to a chain of events ending in a muscle contraction. In a process called temporal summation, a muscle contraction is elicited by the repeated stimulation of axons in a given motor unit [Lloyd: 1957]. This eventually leads to the muscle generating the maximum force possible, causing painful muscle cramps or spasms [Parisi: 2003]. When the muscle runs out of ATP, the actin-myosin bridges separate, and the muscles relax; this process is called fatigue. In this experiment, frog legs will be injected with caffeine at the gastrocnemius muscle in order to observe the effects of tetany and fatigue. Specifically, we will observe the difference between the control group frog legs’ force exerted in a normal myogram (V2-V1) and the experimental group frog legs’ force exerted when injected with caffeine. We hypothesize that if frog legs are subjected to caffeine via gastrocnemius muscle injection, then the muscle response will be greater in the treated frog leg than in the untreated frog leg. 

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were obtained and kept moist throughout the experiment with Ringer’s solution. The computer program was set up according to the Bio Lab Manual, and all of the correct parameters were set. The skin was carefully peeled off of the frog leg, exposing the gastrocnemius muscle. The frog leg was pinned down with metal pins and tied to the stimulation set up with a string. The metal stimulator was poked into the gastrocnemius muscle and four normal myograms were recorded. Observations were made of what the leg looked like while stimulated and what the myograms looked like. The value of V2-V1 was recorded. Then 0.1mL of 200mM caffeine was injected into the frog leg and 5 seconds worth of myograms were taken. The differences between the normal myograms and the myograms with caffeine were observed and recorded. The value of V2-V1 was recorded. A paired t-test was performed on the recorded data. The same procedure was carried out with the remaining two frog legs.  

Results:
After the experiment was completed, it was observed that frog legs injected with caffeine showed different responses than the control frog legs through the data collected as well as visual and tactile observation. One saw that the muscle contracted with much more force than the control group, and through touching the muscle one could feel how hard it contracted compared to the control group. In the experimental group, the myograms eventually trailed off from the peak contraction point. The V2-V1 values for the normal myograms had a lower average (0.616V) compared to the averaged V2-V1 value of the experimental myograms (1.357V). The p-value was calculated to be 0.048. Figure 1 shows the average difference of the gastrocnemius response between the control and experimental groups.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that if frog legs are subjected to a caffeine injection in the gastrocnemius muscle, the force generated in terms of V2-V1 will be greater than the force a contraction without caffeine will produce, was supported by the results of this experiment. The paired t-test calculated a value of 0.048, which implies that the results were significant because it is less than 0.05. This means that our experiment was successful in terms of supporting the hypothesis. Based on our observations of the muscle by touching it and looking at it, it can be inferred that the muscle went through tetany and then fatigue after being injected with caffeine. By looking at the myograms, the fatigue can be seen after injecting caffeine, implying that the drug affects the strength of the muscle contractions. Caffeine is a drug that has stimulant properties [Fisone: 2004], so it is reasonable to hypothesize that injecting it into a frog’s muscle will stimulate muscle contractions and eventually induce tetany and then fatigue, like this experiment demonstrated. According to studies, when caffeine is introduced to animals it induces tetany of the muscles and exaggerated tremors, and fatigue [Maloney: 1935]. Caffeine impacts the neuromuscular system, and consequently directly impacts action potentials down to muscle contractions [Lopes: 1983]. Further research can help understand how caffeine affects the body; in the future, studies on drugs such as caffeine and their effects on muscle response could further understanding of how both the nervous system and the muscular system function.
