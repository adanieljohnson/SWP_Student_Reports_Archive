Title: The Effect of Acetylcholine Injection on Muscle Contraction Intensity of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
During the depolarization stage of muscle contraction, Acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal. It then binds to the receptor on the membranes of the muscle fibers, changing the ion permeability of the cell membrane. In this experiment, the effect of injecting Acetylcholine into the gastrocnemus of Rania pipien legs was investigated. It was hypothesized that the injection of Acetylcholine would result in more intense muscle contractions when the leg was electrically stimulated. 3 Rania pipien legs were used, with both controll and treatment processes carried out. The levels of contraction at various voltages, when the sciatic nerve was stimulated, were recorded and statistically analyzed. No significent differences were noted, and thus no significent connection between injection of Acetylcholine and more intense muscle contractions was found. Thus, the injection of Acetylcholine appears to have little to no effect on the intensity of muscle contraction.

Introduction:
Nerves stimulate muscles through the process of excitation-contraction coupling. In the depolarization stage of an action potential, Acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal and bonds to membrane receptors of the cells in muscle fibers. This creates a change in ionic membrane permeability that allows for the influx of sodium into the cell, which is a necessary component of muscle contraction. The organisms used in this muscle contraction experiment were Rania pipiens. Rania pipiens is a species of frog commonly known as the leopard frog, aptly named for the dark spots found on their “slim green or brownish” skin, with their size varying between “5 and 11 cm” in length [Fryer: 2001]. This species is commonly used in experiments, as it is relatively commonly distributed across a wide-range of regions. This experiment served to investigate the effect of Acetylcholine on muscle contraction through the experimental stimulation of Rania pipien legs.  Our hypothesis was that the Acetylcholine injection would cause the muscle to contract at a higher intensity. 

Materials and Method:
The series of observations conducted served to show how muscles, when electrically stimulated, go through a latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period. The effect of stimulus frequency in muscle contractions was also investigated. In order to investigate this process, this experiment isolated the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve of 3 severed Rania pipien legs. The sciatic nerve was exposed for stimulation and the gastrocnemus muscle was freed and attached to a force transducer for contractile measurements. It was ensured that the leg was kept moist by spritzing it with Frog Ringers periodically. The leg was stimulated at a width of 5 ms, with a frequency of 1 Hz, and levels of contraction were recorded from the muscle. For the experimental treatment, the leg was prepared as described above and the muscle was then injected with one micropipette of 10 mg/Ml Acetylcholine. The leg was again stimulated at a width of 5 ms, with a frequency of 1 Hz, and levels of contraction were recorded from the muscle. Both processes were undertaken on all 3 frog legs in the experiment. A statistical paired t_test was conducted on the data collected.

Results:
The p_value of the paired t_test was found to be 0.520, which is far above the designated α-value of 0.05. Thus, the effects of Acetylcholine on intensity of muscle contraction were not found to be significent. As seen in Figure 1, the results between the treatment and controll groups were relatively similar, both increasing until 0.4 Amp. was reached, and then slightly decreasing at 0.5 Amp.

Discussion:
Due to the non-significent results, the hypothesis that injection of Acetylcholine would intensify muscle contraction when the muscle was electrically stimulated was not supported. A potential reason for non-significent differences could be an inadequate period of time for the Acetylcholine to sink in, or the concentration of Acetylcholine could have been too low, thus undermining its potential effects on increasing muscle contraction intensity. The investigation into the effect of Acetylcholine in the neuromuscular system could be further explored by using Acetylcholine of a higher concentration or injecting at a different site. Injections at different sites in the muscle could have significent effects on the intensity of the muscle contraction. Acetylcholine receptors in muscle tend to clump together in postsynaptic groups, and thus if the injection site of the Acetylcholine missed the group of receptors it would not influence the muscle cell [Madhaven: 2003]. However, if Acetylcholine was injected directly into the postsynaptic group of receptors then it is possible that it would greatly increase the intensity of muscle contraction. This potential connection between the location of injection, whether the Acetylcholine was taken up by the cell receptors, and the resulting intensity of muscle contraction poses a possibility for further, deeper investigation.

Figure 1. This chart displays the relationship between increasing amplitude and voltage of contraction for the averages of the controll and treatment Rania pipiens leg muscles. The averages were taken for each value of the controll as well as treatment processes for each of the three legs used in the experiment. *************************************************************************
