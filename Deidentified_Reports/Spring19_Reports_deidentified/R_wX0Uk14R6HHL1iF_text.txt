Title: Effect of Calcium Channel Activators on Muscle Response in Rana pipiens Legs. 

Abstract:
Rana pipiens, also known as the Northern Leopard frog use action potentials to trigger muscle contractions. For this process to occur, Ca2+ must be released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum to trigger crossbridge formation. Thus, we hypothesized that a calcium channel activator will cause increased muscle response in the frogs’ legs. However, our data showed a decrease in muscle response of the frog legs after the legs were treated with the A23187 calcium channel activator. Our p-value of 0.188 also supported our null hypothesis and rejected our alternate hypothesis. It is likely that we did not give the A23187 enough time to be evenly transported around the muscle because we only waited a minute after injection before re-stimulation of the nerve.

Introduction:
Rana pipiens, also known as the Northern Leopard frog, have a nervous system similar to that of humans, in the sense that their nervous system consists of a central nervous system and a peripheral nervous system. These frogs also have nervous systems that are similar to that of humans because they experience action potentials in the same way which results in muscle stimuli and muscle contractions [Donaldson: 2004]. When these action potentials are triggered in the muscle, the Rana pipiens neurons become depolarized, allowing the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). This ACh diffuses into the muscle fibres, opening sodium channels that generate another action potential which releases Ca2+ from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum triggering crossbridge formation between myosin and actin filaments. These crossbridges constitute to a movement that is easily perceivable in a laboratory. Ca2+ also triggers the opening of other gated channels, causing the action potential cycle to continue. Thus, in this lab, by simulating an action potential in a Rana pipiens muscle fibre using a needle stimulator, one should be able to observe muscle responses. Thus, we hypothesize that a calcium channel activator, which will increase the number of action potentials that occur with one stimulus, will cause increased muscle response in the frogs’ legs.

Materials and Methods:
3 frog legs were taken and deskinned from the thigh joint to the feet. Their sciatic nerves were then exposed and separated from the rest of the leg. The frog’s gastrocnemius muscle was then separated from the rest of the leg and suspended from a force transducer at a 90-degree angle and pins were inserted into the legs to keep the legs in place. The sciatic nerve was then draped over the electron probe of the needle stimulator. The nerve was then triggered with action potentials from 0.0A to 0.5A at 0.1A intervals, and again from 1A to 4A at 1A intervals. Their voltage responses were then recorded. The gastrocnemius muscle was then inserted with 0.1mL of 100mM A23187 calcium channel activator. The nerve was then stimulated the same way and their voltage responses were recorded. This was repeated with the other two legs. A Paired T-Test was then conducted with the results to determine significance with an alpha value of 0.05. 

Results:
Figure: 1 shows that the legs undergoing controlled treatment exhibited a higher response in volts than seen by that of those that were treated with the A23187 calcium channel activator. Each of the frog legs also showed a general increase in voltage response when the action potentials stimulated increased. A Two-Sample T statistical test determined a p-value of 0.188, concluded that our results were not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that a calcium channel activator would cause increased muscle response in the Rana pipien frogs’ legs was not supported by our data. Our results, in fact, showed a trend in which there was a decrease in muscle response of the frog legs after the legs were treated with the A23187 calcium channel activator. It is likely that we did not give the A23187 enough time to be evenly transported around the muscle because we only waited a minute after injection before re-stimulation of the nerve. If that was the case, the activators would not have had time to take effect, causing there to be very little difference between the controlled muscle responses and the A23187 treated muscle responses.  It is also possible that not enough of the A23187 calcium channel activator was added to the gastrocnemius muscle, preventing the effect of the treatment from being observed. Additionally, only injecting into the gastrocnemius muscle may have prevented the activator from being transported efficiently to every part of the frog leg. Upon researching Ca2+ in Rana pipiens independently, it became very clear that the effects of Ca2+ on the animals can actually be seen more clearly in the skin of the frogs because Ca2+ in frog skin is concentrated and easily extracted. Thus, in future it would be fruitful to try the experiment without deskinning the frog legs and observing how the movement of Ca2+ would move in the epithelium of the legs and see how that would change the responsivity.
