Title: The effects of caffeine on skeletal muscle contraction 

Abstract:
Skeletal muscles are crucial in the movement of animals. They contract and relax through signaling and chemical release. These processes can be affected by the presence of chemicals so in this experiment we tested the effect of caffeine on muscle contraction. The expectation was the caffeine would cause the muscle to reach chemically induced tetany. The collected data showed that the muscles produced significently stronger contractions once the caffeine was present. This supported the hypothesis and proved that caffeine led to tetany. This shows that the presence of a substance interferes with communication between muscle fibers and further studies could develop a deeper understanding of cellular communication. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles play a vital role in the movement of animals, which in turn makes them vital for survival. In order to aid in this, muscles must contract. In skeletal muscles, these contractions are stimulated by signals sent to the muscles from the brain. These signals pass through the neuromuscular junction and trigger the release of a chemical called Acetylcholine. The Acetylcholine then binds to receptors within the muscle and generates an action potential in the muscle fiber causing calcium ions to be released. These ions then cause the muscle to shorten. This is the process of contraction. Calcium carries information to each myofibril that makes up the muscle and when chemicals are introduced to the body, they can interfere with this process causing different results [Weber: 1973]. A particular chemical, Caffeine, is a known stimulant meaning that it causes an increased release of calcium by the muscle [Rousseau: 1988].  Due to this, we hypothesize that if you inject caffeine directly into a muscle, the muscle will show stronger contractions leading to chemically induced tetany. 


Materials and Method:
10 Myograms were run on 3 different frog legs with each being used as its own controll. Each leg had the skin removed and was kept moist with ringers solution. The gastrocnemus muscle of each leg was then detached at the knee and tied to a stand but remained attached to the leg. A probe was inserted directly into the gastrocnemus of each leg and each was stimulated 5 times at an amplitude of 2V. The strength of contractions from each stimulation was recorded. While still attached to the probe, 1Ml of 200 mmol caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus and the muscle was stimulated 5 more times, still at 2V. The strength of the resulting contractions was recorded. The average contraction strength was found for each leg with and without caffeine present. This data was then compared using a paired t_test. 

Results:
The mean contraction strength for the frog legs without caffeine was 0.284666667V and the mean contraction strength after caffeine exposure was 0.879533333V (figure 1). The standard deviation for the controll was 0.19755104 and the standard deviation for the experimental group was 0.372574521 (figure 1). A paired t_test obtained a p_value of  0.040142. Observations made during the experiment showed that the first leg became very stiff after the caffeine was injected and showed less intense contractions. The second leg became even stiffer after the caffeine was administered than the first and showed less intense contractions as well. The third leg showed results most similar to the first but remained more malleable than both legs 1 and 2 after the caffeine was administered.

Discussion:
The null hypothesis, that the injection of caffeine would have no effect on the muscle, was rejected, and the alternate hypothesis was accepted. The results from a paired t_test showed a significent statistical difference in the strength of contractions after caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus. This supports the idea that caffeine causes calcium to be released at a much faster rate, causing the muscle to contract much more frequently and with more intensity [Rousseau: 1988]. These intense and rapid contractions then cause the muscle to enter into tetany, making the muscle hard and swollen. With this being discovered it shows the effect that chemicals can have on the process of muscle contraction. While only one substance was tested here, it is fair to say that when foreign substances are present, the release of ions, and other substances, such as acetylcholine, that are necessary for muscle contraction can be interrupted. It is then possible that through further testing a substance can be found that inhibits calcium release and stops contractions from occurring altogether. Finding these substances can help to better the current understanding of muscle function, and may even be applied to other muscle types as well [Weber: 1973]. This would then deepen the current understanding of animal movement and could lead to advances in physical therapy method. If muscle movement can be hindered or helped through the presences of attainable substances these substances could be used to aid in rehabilitation from certain muscle related disabilities. These results also aid in the understanding of communication between different cells and tissues. All life forms are sustained through similar forms of communication so understanding how caffeine effects signals sent in muscle fibers can the help to understand how different cells and fibers communicate.
