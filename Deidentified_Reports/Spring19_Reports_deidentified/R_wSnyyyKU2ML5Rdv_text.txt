Title: Effects of Caffeine on Muscle Tetany

Abstract:
Muscles help us to move every day. We explore how muscle activity is affected by caffeine. We tested the frog legs at various voltages to observe myogams with and without caffeine injected into the legs. The average voltage needed to reach tetany for the control was 0.4743 and that of the experimental was 0.9327. The standard deviation for the control was found to be 0.1194 and the experimental was 0.1781. The p-value from the paired t-test was determined to be 0.04967. These results suggest that the caffeine indeed had a significant effect on the voltage needed to reach tetany in the frog legs. Meaning that the caffeine caused the frog legs to have room for more voltage before reaching tetany.

Introduction:
The skeletal muscle of vertebrates and invertebrates consists of thousands of myofibers. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. They do so by using neurons neuromuscular junctions and a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh). Through a process called excitation contraction coupling, calcium ions make muscle move at the will of the brain [D: 2018]. Frog legs will be studied in this experiment. Specifically, the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle in the frog leg. The respective muscle and nerve are used by the frog to jump by contracting and expanding the muscle. In this experiment, we will be monitoring myogams which are electrical pulses in the muscle. We hypothesize that if we stimulate the leg of the frog that has been injected with caffeine, we expect the frog leg to reach tetany at a higher voltage than the regular frog leg.  

Materials and Methods:
My group received three frog legs and placed the legs in a dissecting pan. With a pair of forceps, we grasped the skin at the top of the leg and pulled the skin down towards the foot. The skinned leg was laid in the dissecting pan and moistened with frog Ringer's solution. A dissecting probe was used to gently separate the inner thigh muscles beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. The nerve in the frog leg was freed from its attaching connective tissue using dissecting needle and forceps. The frog leg was then connected to a voltmeter to observe myogams at rates 5, 10, and 20 Hz. After the frog legs reached tetany, the voltage at which that happened was recorded. Caffeine was then injected into the frog leg and the same process was done a second time. Meaning that each frog leg was both its control and experimental. After the raw data was collected, a paired t test was performed.

Results:
Form Table 1, the average voltage needed to reach tetany was more in the experimental than in the control. The average voltage in the experimental was 0.9327 volts whereas the control had a average of 0.4743 volts. From Table 2, the standard deviation for the control is 0.1194 and for the experimental is 0.1781. The p-value was found to be 0.04967. The frog legs became very stiff after the caffeine was injected and the myogams were recorded. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the frog legs will reach tetany at a higher voltage was supported as the p-value was less than 0.05. That means that the results we obtained for the experiment weren’t due to mere chance. The caffeine had an effect on the frog legs by allowing it to make room for more voltage needed to reach tetany. The caffeine caused the frog legs to have an “adrenaline effect” [Prado-Franceshi: 2002]. The caffeine provided the frog muscle with abundant ATP and as a result, cross bridges continued to form in the frog leg that helped the muscle contract provided there was calcium. So the frog legs continued to contract and as a result became stiff as we observed. The frog leg had too much ATP that it continued to join the actin and myosin filaments together and so the leg wasn’t exhausted easily. This process might occur in humans as well as we use the same process to move our muscles. With this in mind, further research can be done to find the optimum dosage of caffeine humans can take in when we desperately need a boost. Studying muscles is still an ongoing process important for the well-being of humans and understanding how to improve muscle activity.
