Title:  Root-to-shoot ratios in relation to nitrogen levels: resource allocation in Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
We aimed to study how different levels of nutrients can impact resource allocation in plants of the same species and to determine the phenotypic results of this resource allocation.  We investigated how 0 grams, 2 grams, and 7 grams of nitrate impact the growth of 6 radish plants when cultivated in a greenhouse and given 200mL of water for 14 days.  We compared their root-to-shoot ratios using ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests. There was a significant difference between the average root-to-shoot ratio mass of the no nitrate plants and the high and low nitrate plants.  There was also a significant difference between the no nitrate group and the low nitrate group, as well as between the no nitrate group and high nitrate groups; however, there was no significant difference between the low and high nitrate groups. Because it did not have nitrate available, the control group had to allocate its resources into collecting nutrients from the vermiculite, therefore creating a higher root-to-shoot ratio.  On the other hand, the low and high nitrate groups had easy access to nitrate and therefore could expand their resource allocation into stems and leaves.

Introduction:
Adaptation to abiotic and biotic factors in an ecosystem is a characteristic of organisms that allow for their survival in adverse or inconsistent environments.  This is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson: 2018].  The levels of the three primary resources (soil nutrients, solar energy, and water) necessary for plant growth may vary in an ecosystem, and as a result, the strategy of resource allocation becomes a solution to this problem.  Within specific species, the resource allocation may also vary and be dependent upon the organs of the plant.  Leaves collect solar energy and carbon dioxide have a high growth rate because of their increased resource allocation.  Similarly, stems aid in this allocation by acting as a supporting structure to lift the leaves towards the sun.  Finally, roots collect macronutrients and transport them to the stem and the leaves [Johnson: 2018].  Transported from roots to leaves in terrestrial plants, nitrogen is one of the most crucial limiting nutrients for plant growth.  The role of nitrogen includes aiding photosynthesis and respiration and forming cells, genes, and enzymes in plant organs [Zhang: 2018].  Although it is an essential nutrient for plant growth, excessive or underprovided amounts of nitrogen can negatively impact the environment in which the plant grows.  Needing to use nitrogen fertilizer in domestic plants is contingent on the current condition and nutrients in the soil where a plant grows [Zhao: 2005].  The biomass of plants and their resource allocations are also closely related.  Through measuring the root-to-shoot ratio of plants, the resource allocation of a certain species can be determined [Johnson: 2018].  We hypothesize that there will be a significance difference in root-to-shoot ratios of the same plan species when different amounts of nitrogen are added.  To test this, we grew Raphanus sativus plants (radishes) in a greenhouse, under three levels of nitrogen to determine the effects of nitrogen on resource allocation.

Materials and Methods:
We planted Raphanus sativus (radish) seeds in six pots of vermiculate soil substitute. We added a different amount of nitrate to the soil of each pair of plots.  The first pair had 0 grams of nitrate and were labeled as “no nitrate”.  The second pair had 2 grams of nitrate added per pot and were labeled as “low nitrate”.  The third pair had 7 grams of nitrate added and were labeled as “high nitrate”.  The plants were given 50mL of Miracle Grow and 200mL of water initially and then subsequently given 200mL of water each day for the next 14 days.  The six plots were cultivated in a greenhouse.    Each plant was removed and placed into a tub of water to loosen the vermiculite and collect individuals replicates of each plot that were free of soil and so the roots weren’t broken in the process.  Six random replicates were taken from each condition, then dried and weighed.  After collecting their weight, we cut the replicates evenly into roots and shoots and weighed them separately.   We used a one-way ANOVA to test for significant differences between the control and experimental groups.  

Results:
From the results of our ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests, we determined that there is a significant difference between the control group (0 grams of nitrate) and the low and high nitrate groups with a p-value of .02.  The average root-to-shoot ratio mass for the no nitrate group was 0.12 ± 0.04 grams; the average root-to-shoot ratio mass for the low nitrate group was 0.08 ± 0.01 grams; and the average root-to-shoot ratio mass for the high nitrate group was 0.08 ± 0.02 grams (Figure 1).   The one-way ANOVA test that we conducted exhibited a p-value of .02 for the average root-to-shoot ratio of the no nitrate group and the average root-to-shoot ratio of the low and high nitrate groups, meaning there is a significance difference there.  The Tukey-Kramer test showed that there was a significant difference value of .001 between the root-to-shoot ratio the no nitrate group and the low nitrate group.  It also showed that there was a significant difference of .04 between the no nitrate group and high nitrate group.  There was no significant difference between the low and high nitrate groups, according to the Tukey Kramer test.

Discussion:
Our results supported this hypothesis by demonstrating a significant difference between the experimental groups and the control group.  The root-to-shoot mass ratio in the no nitrate group was higher than in the other two group than the plants with no nitrate added.  From this, we can draw a conclusion that with no nitrate, the radish plants had to allocate their resources to the roots to prosper in that condition, as mentioned in the study on nitrogen deficiency [Zhao: 2005].  Another observation is that the plants in the low nitrate and high nitrate group had significantly lower root-to-shoot mass ratios than the group with no nitrate did.  We can conclude that the reasoning behind this is that with the accessibility of the nitrate, the plants did not have to allocate their resources strictly to the soil and could expand their allocation to other beneficial organs, like the stems.  Roots are more involved in collecting nutrients from the soil, like nitrogen, than stems and leaves, which have other important functions [Johnson: 2018]. Adding nitrogen to crop plants, such as radishes, could improve agricultural practices and improve growth when nutrients in the soil in a particular environment are not sufficient.  In conclusion, resource allocation is a successful way that plants respond to the biotic and abiotic factors in their environment.  Whether these factors are excess sunlight, lack of water, or excess of nutrients, their phenotypic plasticity will allow them to adapt to the conditions for survival and to maintain fitness.
