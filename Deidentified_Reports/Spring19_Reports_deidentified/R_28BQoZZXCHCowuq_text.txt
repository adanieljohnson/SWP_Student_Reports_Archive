Title: The Effects of Different Wavelengths of Light on the Photosynthetic Activity of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
The process of photosynthesis is crucial to the growth and survival of plants and must be fueled by light energy. Photoreceptors play a major part in sensing and absorbing different wavelengths of light to excite electrons, turning the light energy into chemical energy. Due to past experiments and studies, it is known that certain wavelengths of light have proven to be more effective in the process of photosynthesis because they are more readily absorbed. Hence, we hypothesized that if chloroplasts were exposed to red light, natural light, green light, and no light, those exposed to red light and natural light would have a higher rate of photosynthesis than those exposed to green light and darkness. To test our hypothesis, we prepared a solution of enriched chloroplasts using Spinacia oleracea leaves and used to solution to start an assay to measure the effects of different light sources on photosynthetic activity. Our results partially supported our hypothesis because the chloroplasts exposed to red light, natural light, and green light showed statistically significant differences from the control (p- values respectively:  0.00495, 0.000188, 0.0000143). 

Introduction:
For plants to produce usable forms of energy, their cells must undergo the process of photosynthesis. This energy is then used in the processes of glycolysis and cellular respiration to maintain cell function throughout the plant. Photosynthesis involves the capturing of light waves in the form of light energy to excite electrons (chemical energy) that further the process of energy production. To sense these light waves and absorb them, plants have photoreceptors in chloroplasts that allow them to sense an extremely broad light spectrum from 280- 750 nm [Galvão:2015]. These photoreceptors have come to evolve throughout time to develop different and specialized classes like phytochrome, the red/far-red light receptor, or cryptochrome, a blue light receptor [Suetsugu: 2012]. These receptors allow the plant to respond to light based on where the light is coming from, its intensity, and duration. A common response to different wavelengths of light is the opening or closing of stomata, pores located on the epidermis of leaves. This opening and closing is regulated by guard cells and serves to expose more chloroplasts to light in addition to providing a way for carbon dioxide to diffuse into the plant and oxygen to diffuse out as a result of photosynthesis. As there are different photoreceptors dedicated to sensing different wavelengths, it is found that certain wavelengths of light are more usable to plant cells than others. For instance, chlorophylls have preferential absorption of blue and red wavelengths, while green light waves are often reflected and not absorbed [Wang: 2011]. Hence, if enriched chloroplasts were exposed to red light, natural (sun) light, green light, and no light, then the photosynthetic rates would be different depending on the wavelength of light. In particular, the red light and natural light would have the highest rates of photosynthesis, with green light and exposure to no light would have the lowest rate of photosynthesis. To test this hypothesis, a good source of chloroplasts needed to be obtained and due to its abundance and organic base, Spinacia oleracea (spinach) leaves were used. The way in which we collected data utilized 2,6- Dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) as an alternative electron receptor because when reduced by excited electrons, DCIP loses its dark blue color. Therefore, as photosynthesis takes place, the solution of chloroplasts would become lighter, which can be quantified by using spectrophotometry. 

Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, we extracted chloroplasts from four Spinacia oleracea leaves using differential centrifugation. Four medium-sized Spinacia oleracea leaves were grinded and reduced to liquid by adding 20 mL of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer (pH 8.0). We then obtained a solution of enriched chloroplasts by centrifuging this liquid first at 200xG for 3 minutes and then at 1000xG for 10 minutes. After centrifuging the liquid, we poured the supernatant out of the tube containing a pellet and then added 20 mL of grinding buffer in order to resuspend the pellet and obtain the solution of enriched chloroplasts. To set up our experiment, we used 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer in 15 test tubes. To begin the assay, we added 100 microliters of the enriched chloroplast solution into 12 of the test tubes, using the other three test tubes as our control. We then transferred these mixtures into cuvettes to measure the initial absorbance at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. After collecting the initial absorbance, we placed six tubes (three experimental, three control) in the windowsill for the chloroplasts to become exposed to sunlight, three other tubes under a green light, three under red light, and the last three tubes in a drawer so that those chloroplasts were not exposed to any light. Over the next 30-minute experimental period, we took the absorbances of the tubes every 10 minutes. To effectively evaluate and analyze the data collected, we calculated the percent change for each tube from time zero and used a two-sample paired t-test. 

Results:
The data results shown in figure 1 show that overall, every group (experimental and control) decreased in absorbance from time zero to thirty minutes with the absorbances of chloroplasts placed in sunlight, green light, and red light decreasing most significantly out of the experimental groups. Figure 2 shows the average absolute percent change in absorbance for each group at every time interval and has a mixture of results. Using the average percent change in absorbance at 30 minutes, the control absorbance (Natural Sunlight with no chloroplasts) decreased 17.3% (+/-) 8.18, absorbance in sunlight decreased 85% (+/-)2.4, absorbance in red light decreased 79.8% (+/-) 3.6, absorbance in green light decreased 82.6% (+/-) 2.7, and absorbance in the dark decreased 31.7% (+/-)13.9. After evaluating the data using a two-sample paired t-test to compare each group against the others, we found that there were significantly different results between the control versus natural light, red light, and green light (p-values respectively: 0.000188, 0.00495, and 0.0000143) in addition to no light versus red light, green light and natural light (p-values respectively: 0.0314, 0.00966, 0.0105). Green light versus red (p-value: 0.211) and natural light showed as insignificant results (p -value: 0.420). 

Discussion:
The results of our experiment did not turn out entirely how we had hypothesized because the chloroplasts exposed to green light showed statistically insignificant differences with chloroplasts exposed to natural light and red light but showed significant difference with those exposed to no light and the control. This was not expected because we thought that green light would not be readily absorbed by the photoreceptors in the chloroplasts and that would lead to a lower photosynthetic rate than red light or natural light. However, we did expect the results that the absorbances in red light and natural light would have insignificant differences with each other because both the natural light and red light would have optimum wavelengths of light to be absorbed by photoreceptors. In a study examining green light responses of the stomate found that the green light response relied on photosynthesis-dependent and independent components, implying that there is in fact existence of a green light receptor [Wang: 2011]. With the results of this study providing a possible reason why the chloroplasts exposed to green light may have still experienced an elevated rate of photosynthetic activity, it is still unlikely that the rates would have been as high as the natural light and red light if the green light had been completely isolated. Hence, it is more likely that the chloroplasts adapted to their light environment and moved toward other sources of light that could not be kept out of the experimental set up [Galvão:2015]. Continuing research on how plants receive and respond to their environments can lead to a better understanding of plant evolution and can be applied in the field of agriculture today.
