Title: Herbivory Does Not Induce Resource Sequestration In Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
This study aims to show how herbivory on Raphanus sativus plants does not result in induced resource sequestration, a method by which resources are shifted away from areas exposed to herbivory towards parts of the plant that are less accessible to herbivores. This is due to several traits expressed by the R. sativus plants used in this experiment, such as being a developing plant and having the root as the primary storage organ of the plant. R. sativus was grown in optimal conditions in two groups- a controll (not exposed to herbivory) and experimental (exposed to herbivory). Herbivory was performed by cutting off leaves at the branching point. The results showed no significent difference between the mean root: shoot ratio used to measure growth in the controll and experimental groups. Thus, the hypothesis was supported that R. sativus preferred a growth and/or defense strategy to compensate for biomass lost by herbivory. Further research is required to determine the reasons behind this and how the strategy was put into action. Furthermore, it was determined that resource allocation isn’t affected by an individual factor independently but in relation with other factors. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation in plants in the use of resources for the growth of different parts of the plant depending on the environment a plant is growing in. This phenomenon is affected by a large number of biotic (eg. other organisms) and abiotic (eg. light, soil) factors. Any factor that constitutes the environment of the ecosystem a plant lives in can affect its resource allocation individually, and in combination with other factors. Most abiotic factors affect the availability of resources, thus affecting the growth and reproduction of plants through resource allocation. Biotic factors don’t always directly influence plants in this way. There are various ways biotic factors can influence resource allocation, which can be direct or indirect depending on the method. The effect of other trees of the same species or different species will have a different effect compared to insects and animals living in the same ecosystem.
Herbivory is a very common act performed by many biotic factors such as insects, birds, and animals. It consists of a part of a plants being consumed by these organisms for their sustenance. Unlike predation, where an organism is killed for consumption, herbivory generally leaves plants alive. Herbivory results in a loss of useful resources of a plant, from leaves (for photosynthesis or gas exchange) to sap (sugary fluids used by tree) to fruits (for reproduction). The effects of herbivory on different plants differ greatly, but it has been found that plants try to replace stems and leaves consumed through herbivory if growing conditions are favorable (eg. if there is less competition, ample amount of required resources) [Pratt: 2005]. However, this replacement may be only partial, and come with a price of “reduction of reproduction” [Pratt: 2005]. Another method some plants might use to cope with herbivory is induced resource sequestration, where plants allocate more resources to “tissues inaccessible to foraging herbivores” [Orians: 2011]. 
The organism used in this experiment, Raphanus sativus (also known more commonly as Radish), is a common agricultural crop that is cultivated as an annual plant around the world for its thick taproot [The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica: 1998]. 
The fact that there are many method plants can use to cope against herbivory makes it hard to predict the effect of the coping mechanism of a particular plant, in this case R. sativus (Radish), on its resource allocation. However, in a paper published in 2011 called “Herbivore-induced resource sequestration in plants: why bother?”, a model is introduced where, depending on traits expressed by plants, they could either follow induced resource sequestration or a more general growth and/or defense strategy [Orians: 2011]. According to the model, annual plants that have higher storage in roots compared to shoots which are developing favor growth and/or defense [Orians: 2011]. R. sativus satisfies all these conditions in this experiment. There are other factors in the model, and the conditions of the experiment have traits that lead to both induced resource sequestration and growth and/or defense. However, most of the traits lead to R. sativus following a growth and/or defense model. This means its resources will be focused on replacing or compensating for leaves lost by herbivory. This means there shouldn’t be a significent difference between controll and experimental groups. 
Following this, the main hypothesis will be-
Herbivory does not alter resource allocation to parts inaccessible to herbivores and instead focuses on compensating for parts lost due to herbivory in Raphanus sativus. 


Materials and Method:
Around 30 R. sativus seeds were planted in four small pot containing soil and vermiculite.  Two pots were labelled as Control 1 and Control 2. These plants would grow for two weeks under normal optimal conditions. The other two pots were Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. They were placed in the greenhouse of Winston Hall.
All plants were watered every two days. The pots had holes in the bottom so that excess water could escape during watering. One week after they were planted, herbivory was performed. It was conducted by cutting off half the leaves of each sapling in the Experiment pots. Since each sapling only had two leaves, one leaf was cut off at the branching point of each plant. The mass of all the cut off leaves were weighed. The leaves from Experiment 1 were weighed separately from Experiment 2. The total weight of removed leaves from Experiment 1 was 6.31g, while the total weight of removed leaves from Experiment 2 was 5.02g. 
After two weeks, 3 plants were taken from each pot and their total mass, mass of shoot, mass of root, length of shoot, and length of root were measured. The length of the shoot was measured from the bottom of the shoot to the tip of the leaf of the shoot. 
Since herbivory was performed on the experimental pots, biomass (the leaves) would have been removed from the plants. This in itself would lead to there being a significent difference between the controll plants and experimental plants. Therefore, to account for this difference, the average leaf mass that was cut off of each plant was added to the mass of its shoot. This average leaf mass was calculated by dividing the total weight of removed leaves from each pot by the total plants in each pot (which was calculated by counting the number of plants in the pot). This average leaf mass was then added to the weight of the shoot. The average leaf mass for Experiment 1 was added to the plants taken from the Experiment 1 pot, and the average leaf mass for Experiment 2 was added to the plants taken from the Experiment 2 pot. 
From these measurements, the root-to-shoot ratio was calculated based on weight and length. 



A two-sample t_test was used to check for significent differences between the root: shoot ratios based on both weight and length. 


Results:
As seen from the graphs, in both mass and length, the experimental mean root: shoot ratio value increased compared to the controll. The standard deviation for both controll and experimental for both mass and length is quite large. 
The two-sample t_test showed that the mean root: shoot ratio based on mass (g) was not significently different between the controll and experimental groups (t_stat = 0.639, d.f. = 10, P = 0.268). It also showed that the mean root: shoot ratio based on length (cm) was not significently different between the controll and experimental groups (t_stat = 1.238, d.f. = 10, P = 0.122). 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that there will be no significent difference between R. sativus plants exposed to herbivory compared to those that are not is supported by the results. 
The general trend in both mass and length shows an increase in the root: shoot ratio in the experimental group compared to the controll group. By going of just this, it can be inferred that more resources were allocated to the root, thus increasing the ratio. However, the t_test which shows that there is no significent difference between the groups contradicts this assumption. The standard deviation bars on the graph are quite large as well, which could also be used to infer that the groups are not significently different from each other. 
Since there is no significent difference, this means the biomass of the plants were roughly the same. Herbivory affected the stem of the plant. Therefore, the growth must have compensated for the reduction in the biomass of the stem as predicted in the hypothesis. In this case, the benefits of a growth and/or defense strategy outweighed the benefits of an induced resource sequestration strategy. 
One reason for the benefit of the growth and/or defense strategy is due to the traits of R. sativus in this experiment. Because it is a developing plant, it would be favored by herbivores in a real life setting due to a higher nitrogen content and less developed leaves [Orians: 2011]. Also, since it is a plant where the roots are the primary storage location, the amount of resources sequestered away from developing the roots to fit that function would be very little [Orians: 2011]. 
The growth used to compensate for herbivory could have been due to a plant increasing the number of terminal leaf-bearing stems. In a study called “Herbivory alters resource allocation and compensation in the invasive tree Melaleuca quinquenervia”, M. quinquenervia compensated for herbivory by increasing the number of its leaf bearing terminal stems [Pratt: 2005]. This was done to reduce the impact of the loss of leaves used for photosynthesis [Pratt: 2005]. 
Exact reason for the growth and/or defense strategy being favored and how R. sativus went about performing this strategy will require more research. Perhaps if the plants were grown for longer periods of time and/or subjected to more bouts of herbivory, the results could have been different. Different plants can also be compared to check for the effect of herbivory in a more general manner. Plants can also be exposed to a more natural method of herbivory, perhaps by using insects. 
By looking at the results of this study and the possible ways it can be expanded to deepen our understanding of herbivory and resource allocation, it can be said that there are various ways a factor that effects resource allocation the effect it. A single factor does not affect resource allocation the same way twice. It depends on other factors in the environment of the plant and the ecology that surrounds. This experiment is just a stepping stone to jump off of to explore the various other factors influencing resource allocation in plants.
