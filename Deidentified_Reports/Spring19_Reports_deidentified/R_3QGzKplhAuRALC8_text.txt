Title: Effect of Ecdysterone Concentration on Growth Rate in Manduca Sexta Caterpillars.

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta’s life cycle is heavily determined by the concentration of the hormones Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). In this lab, the amount of 20E in the caterpillars is altered using the IGR AzaGuard to observe how the 20E concentration in a Manduca sexta determines and alters the growth rate and overall life cycle of a Manduca Sexta. The expectation was that the fully concentrated 20E inhibitor would allow the Manduca sexta to grow and the control would trigger the commitment pulse, however, the diluted concentration of AzaGuard would allow for optimum growth and still allow the hornworms to molt. Our data, however, showed no evidence of that. Our data showed no significance between the different concentrations of AzaGuard, and thus, our null hypothesis was supported, and alternate hypothesis rejected. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm is a caterpillar that requires the hormone Ecdysterone and the juvenile hormone for its survival in its progress in its life-cycle. The Manduca Sexta, in their 4th – 5th larval interstar, have a greenish colour, and start browning when they begin to pupate into their adult form, in which they change colour from green to brown. During the 5th level interstar, the JH level is very low, and a small rise in the Ecdysterone also known as 20E level of the caterpillars at this age triggers something called the commitment pulse, which triggers molting [Bryon, 2017]. Thus, the IGR AzaGauard, is an industrial growth hormone that inhibits the behaviour of 20E when introduced into Manduca sexta diet. Therefore, we hypothesise there is a concentration of AzaGuard that when added to the diet, will allow for optimum growth and yet still allow hornworms to molt and become adults, just at a later pace than the control was able to. This is because the low levels of 20E will delay the commitment pulse that occurs when 20E hormone level in the larvae experiences a small spike, which won’t occur if the 20E level is strongly inhibited, which is what would happen with a strong concentration of AzaGuard. 

Materials and Methods:
9 Manduca setxa, all around the weights of 0.5 – 3.0g, were separated into 3 groups of 3 to be fed an industrially produced Menduca sexta diet. Each caterpillar was to be 10 grams of ted GLM diet mixed in with 40 microliters of fluid. Caterpillars 1, 4, and 7 were fed GLM with 4μL of 1:1250 AzaGuard solution. Caterpillars 2, 5, and 8 were fed GLM with 4μL of 1:2500 AzaGuard solution. Then the control group made up of caterpillars 3,6 and 9, were fed GLM with 4μL of distilled water. These larvae were then distributed into 4-cell containers with three caterpillars in each container, one control, one diluted and one full concentration. The containers were kept in an incubator at 28˚C with constant light and their food was changed every 24 hours for 7 days. The weight was noted everyday using a scale and their growth patterns were analysed

Results:
The average growth rate for the fully concentrated fed Manduca sexta was 0.563 grams per day. The average growth rate for the diluted fed Manduca sexta was 0.814 grams per day. The average growth rate for the control fed Manduca sexta was 0.532 grams per day. An ANOVA statistical test determined a p value of 0.00151, which is significantly lower than 0.05 which concluded that the results were not statistically significant. The data also had a standard deviation of 2.517. When objectively observing the Manduca sexta as well, we observed that caterpillar 1, had started browning, and that some of the Manduca sexta, had begun to lose weight, especially the ones that were fed the GLM with the fully concentrated AzaGuard. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the diluted concetration of 20E inhibitor, would create an optimum environment for the Manduca sexta to both grow fruitfully and molt, was not supported by our data. Our results depicted no significant differences in the growth and weight of the caterpillars. This is likely because 4L of solution was likely not enough to observe significant differences between the different caterpillars. Likely, the GLM’s mixed in with the varying solutions contained so little of the solutions that the end resulting GLM’s were too similar to produce identifiable data. One of the fully concentrated fed caterpillars also showed signs of molting. Therefore, it is likely we need to have started with more initially similar caterpillars in a smaller weight range, to eliminate the possibility of molting before it was chemically expected too.
