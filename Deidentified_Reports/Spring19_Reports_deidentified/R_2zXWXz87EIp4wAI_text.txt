Title: Effects of 20E Blocker on the Development of Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
	The main objective of this experiment was to measure the effects of the 20E blocker on the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Nine caterpillars were placed into different containers and fed different concentrations of a 20E blocker. The masses of the caterpillars fed different concentrations were recorded each day for seven days. Before conducting the experiment, the caterpillars that were fed the full concentration of the 20E blocker were presumed to display the most significant growth because the 20E blocker would inhibit regulation of molting, so development would not be restricted. The caterpillars with the full 20E blocker concentration had the most notable growth, resulting in a conclusion that 20E blocker promotes faster and more significant development in Manduca sexta caterpillars.

Introduction:
Scientists often conduct experiments to examine and analyze the effects of different solutions and formulas on growth in bugs in order to control their growth to a desirable size. In this experiment, the Manduca sexta caterpillar’s growth was tested and examined by injecting an 20E blocker into the caterpillars’ food. 20E, or 20-Hydroxyecdysone, is a naturally occurring ecdysteroid hormone that controls molting in caterpillars [Thummel: 2002]. Molting is a process in which caterpillars shed their exoskeleton during development. The blocker for 20E blocks the hormone and therefore regulates molting. These caterpillars were fit for out study because it was easy to see when they went through different stages of development by their physical characteristics. Caterpillars that are fed food with the most concentration of the 20E blocker will display the most significant growth because the developmental molting will not be regulated and therefore will freely operate.

Materials and Methods:
Nine Manduca sexta caterpillars were separated into three groups. Caterpillars numbered 1, 4, and 7 were labeled the “full concentration” group, caterpillars numbered 2, 5, and 8 were labeled the “diluted concentration” group, and caterpillars numbered 3, 6, and 9 were labeled the “control” group. 10g of food were measured for each caterpillar. The caterpillars with the full concentration of Azaguard were fed a concentration with a 1:1250 ratio of water to Azaguard, the caterpillars with the diluted concentration of Azaguard were fed a 2:2500 ratio of water to Azaguard, and the caterpillars with the control food were fed regular caterpillar food with no added concentration of Azaguard. The food was prepared by pipetting the respective concentrations into the food and mixing together the food and the concentration with a silver spoon. After mixing, the food was separated into a looser consistency. The prepared food was placed into plastic containers with small holes poked through the sides for ventilation. Each caterpillar was weighed before being placed into a plastic container with its respective food. A lid was placed over the plastic container and placed into an incubator. Every day for seven days, each caterpillars’ weight was recorded once per day. After the results were collected, the ANOVA statistical test was conducted. The average mass changes between the first day and the eighth day were calculated for each concentration group. From the results, a statistical ANOVA test was conducted.

Results:
All of the Manduca sexta caterpillars grew, but varied at the degrees in which they grew. The control group showed the least amount of growth, the diluted concentration showed the next highest amount of growth, and the full concentration showed the most significant amount of growth. From our data, we used the ANOVA statistical test to make sure that our data was significant with the P-value being 0.00000246. 

Discussion:
Before the experiment was conducted the caterpillars that were fed the full concentration of the 20E blocker were expected to have the most significant growth. The bar graph shows that the caterpillars that were fed the full concentration did have the most significant growth followed by the caterpillars that were fed the diluted concentration and then the caterpillars that were fed the control food with no concentration. The caterpillars with the full concentration of the 20E blocker grew the most because the developmental molting was not controlled so development could proceed to carry out at a quicker and unregulated pace. The caterpillars that were fed the diluted solution and the caterpillars that were fed the control food had less growth because, for the diluted, the development was still somewhat controlled by the blocker and, for the control, the growth was still fully controlled by the blocker. 
In a similar experiment, the 20E hormone was tested by another group to determine its effects on the process of glycolysis [Tian: 2010]. After performing tests on silkworms and having them eat food with the 20E hormone injected into it, the scientists determined that the 20E hormone acted as a general blocker for glycolysis during development. This experiment relates to our experiment because it shows that the 20E hormone inhibits growth by blocking developmental processes such as glycolysis. The 20E hormone is blocked, development is unregulated and is free to function at both a normal and an increased pace.
A possible future experiment could include testing the juvenile hormone in insects and its effects. The juvenile hormone in insect aids in the growth of larva but prevents metamorphosis. The 20E hormone and the juvenile hormone have similar functions, so it would be beneficial to conduct a procedure in which the different functions could be observed.
