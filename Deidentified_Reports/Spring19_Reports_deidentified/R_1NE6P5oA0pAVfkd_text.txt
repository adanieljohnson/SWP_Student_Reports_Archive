Title: The effects of using an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) on the growth of a Manduca Sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment is to find whether there is a relation between the level of concentration (of IGR’s) fed to caterpillars and the impact this level will have on its growth development of the Manduca Sexta. The initial mass of nine caterpillars were compared with seven day increments of mass growth. There were three trial groups tested: a full concentration group, a diluted concentration group, and a control group. The growth patterns defined within these groups showed signs of molting and pupation in addition to concluding there was no statistical evidence to support our hypothesis. The final individual masses we found were inconclusive as each caterpillar’s growth pattern was significantly different within the same trial group. We did find that an increase level of our IGR did increase the final weight of the caterpillar, but further testing should be done to support this claim as our showed no statistical significance. 

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, called the Manduca Sexta is a holometabolous caterpillar that requires a Juvenile hormone in order to pupate into an adult. A holometabolous species is one that undergoes four major life cycle stages: Egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. The larvae of the Manduca sexta are bright green with white stripes and a small horn. The larvae of this species undergoes four to five instars that attribute to the growth of the adult Manduca Sexta [Baker 1986].The manduca sexta requires molting to progress into the next life cycle change in order to change the size, formation of the pupa, and morphology. 

This insect’s development requires the balance of two hormones in order for the insect to molt, pupate, and finally develop into an adult. The juvenile hormone (JH) is a hormone located in the corpus allata that regulates the type of molting during insect development. JH levels tend to be high up until the fourth instar as there is a slight rise of 20E leading to the commitment pulse the caterpillar experiences. By the final instar, JH levels are very low as there is a high level of 20E exposed to the caterpillar. JH is necessary to inhibit the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) in the final instar in order to develop and release the Ecdysterone (20E) steroid hormone [Nijhout 1974].The Ecdysterone (20E) located in the Prothoracic glands is a hormone that regulates the timing of molting during insect development. 

In this experiment, an insect growth regulator (IGR) was used to determine whether there is a correlation in the ratio of IGR to the development of the Manduca Sexta during the fourth and final instar. An insect regulator is a chemical that inhibits the life cycle of an insect, which disrupts how insects grow and reproduce. The IGR used in this experiment is called Azaguard, which prevents molting between the larval, pupalm and nymphal stages and blocks the rise of 20E. Our group will be testing to determine at what level of IGR will have the most growth on the Manduca Sexta. We hypothesize that the Manduca Sexta will experience the most growth when exposed to a higher concentration of Azaguard.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, nine caterpillars with masses ranging from 0.69g to 2.82g were used as subjects during a seven-day testing time frame. Each caterpillar was placed in a container with two air holes with 60g of GLM food (fed every day) inside an incubator at 28℃. The food was used to test the varying concentrations of Azaguard compared to a control group (distilled water). Caterpillars 1, 4, and 7 received 40µl of 1:1250 Azaguard concentration in 60g their of food. Caterpillars 2, 5, and 8 received 40µl of 1:2500 Azaguard diluted concentration in their 60g of food. Caterpillars 3, 6, and 9 received 40µl of distilled water in their 60g of food. The diluted concentration was made by using two equal amounts of 1:1250 Azaguard and distilled water. The ANOVA statistical test was best suitable in establishing the correlation between the impact of growth to the concentration of Azaguard.


Results:
The ANOVA statistical test was used to display all of the collected data. This data was entered into an Excel spreadsheet that then summarized the data by finding the mean value and standard deviation of each diet tested. Notable general trends were that the caterpillars given the full concentration of Azaguard experienced an increase in growth compared to the diluted and the control group. Also, the increase in growth from the diluted concentration of Azaguard compared to the control group.


Discussion:
Based on the results we gathered, there was no consistent significant statistical findings that could support that Azaguard could impact the final weight compared to our control group. Our p-value in this experiment was 0.001507, which means the null hypothesis was rejected. 

In our raw data, caterpillars 1, 4, and 7 were given 1:1250 of Azaguard did increase exponentially at a faster rate compared to the diluted and control group, but showed no significance in comparison to one another. This can be attributed to the dehydration experienced by the 1:1250 caterpillars compared to the diluted and control group’s final weights as an excess of water could have inhibited the growth patterns of these two groups. Caterpillar 1 showed signs of pupation in turning a yellowish-brown color and a severe weight loss (7.03g to 6.76g), which means that the Azaguard did not necessarily block the release of Ecdysterone as the caterpillar was still able to reach pupation faster than the other caterpillars. This finding could change future areas of study as it would be interesting to see if higher levels of concentration could speedup the larval to pupa stage [Baker 1974]. Future areas of study could also test our hypothesis using other IGR’s and comparing it to Azaguard to see if there is a difference in growth between the two [Hatem 2015]. 

If this experiment were to be replicated, the caterpillar weights should be closer in weight or the weights of the individual testing groups should be similar as that is one reason our results are inconclusive. The growth experienced by each caterpillar was different within each testing diet, which makes it more difficult to establish a correlation between the growth and levels of concentration. Also, it would have been helpful if we could have pre-measured the 40µl of each testing group. Human error can always slightly impact the results, and a more accurate representation would precisely reflect our data because we would know it is in fact 40µl of solution.
