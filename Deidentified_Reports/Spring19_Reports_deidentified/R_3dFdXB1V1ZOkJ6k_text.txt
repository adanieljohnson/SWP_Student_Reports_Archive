Title: Effect of Caffeine on Muscle Contraction in Rania pipien Legs

Abstract:
We did a study on the effects of caffeine on the strength of muscle contraction in Rania pipien (frog) legs. Caffeine causes a release of calcium in the muscle tissue with causes the muscle fibers to contract. We expected that injecting caffeine would cause an increase in muscle contraction strength because of the excess calcium it would cause to be released. Three frog legs were skinned and dissected to that the gastrocnemus muscle was tied to a BNC-banana adapter from the achilles tendon. One at a time, the muscles were stimulated with three electrical impulses of 0.2amp and the response was measured in volts. The statistical tests performed showed that the results not significent. Therefore, our hypothesis was not fully supported.


Introduction:
We are doing a study on muscle contraction in Rania pipien legs. Specifically, we are looking at how caffeine affects the strength of muscle contractions. By studying how caffeine affects muscle contraction, we may gain a better understanding of how to use caffeine to get a desired response from a muscle or how to use caffeine to treat certain muscle problems. The contraction of a muscle is a complicated process in which an action potential travels from a neuron to a muscle, stimulating the release of calcium (Ca2+) which then causes the muscle to contract. [Johnson: 2016] Caffeine is a substance that causes the release of  calcium in muscles, thereby causing them to contract involuntarily [Lopes: 1983]. Because calcium caused the muscle to contract involuntarily, our hypothesis is that the muscles injected with caffeine will show a stronger response than the muscles that are not treated with caffeine. 


Materials and Method:
The way in which we tested the contraction if the Rania pipien muscles is by stimulating the muscles before and after being injected with caffeine with 0.2 amps and measuring their response using a BNC-banana adapter. We placed the three frog legs in a dissecting pan and peeled off the skin all the way off starting from the quad muscles. Then we opened the femoral muscle and separated the white sciatic nerve. We then cut the achilles tendon close to the ankle, tied it to a string and hooked it onto the BNC-banana adapter, pinning the other muscles down on the plate. After setting up LabScribe on the computer, we stuck the pin electrodes directly into the muscle. Then we stimulated each of the three legs three times with 0.2 amps and measured the response in Volts. Then we injected each muscle with 1 Ml of 200 mMol caffeine and repeated the process. After calculating the average response for the muscles before being injected and after, we drew the bar graph seen in Figure 1. And also calculated the standard deviation, standard error, and the p_value using the paired T-test as seen in Table 1.


Results:
The average response for frog legs that were not injected with caffeine was 0.6971 volts, and 0.9381 volts in frog legs that were injected with caffeine. In Figure 1. We see that any difference in the strength of muscle contraction was not significent because our standard deviation error bars are overlapping. Also, according to the p_value of 0.1921, any difference we see between the averages is not significent, therefore supporting the null hypothesis. 


Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis in that the caffeine did not cause a significent increase in the force of the muscle’s response to electrical stimulation. Our results are contrast a study done on frogs legs in Nigeria at Ahmadu Bello University. They found that caffeine caused an increase in the strength muscle response and the length of the contraction based off of the amount of caffeine injected [Olorunshola: 2011]. According to this study, caffeine did in fact cause the force of the muscle contraction to increase by a significent amount. Our experiment may not reflect these findings because our sample size is too small to be a valuable representation for muscle as a whole. To further study this topic, I would advise redoing the same procedure, using muscles of a larger organism so that, if there is a slight difference in response with the caffeine, it might be more easily detected.

Figure 1. Average Muscle Response to 0.2amp Stimulus in Volts. Three frog legs without caffeine (left) were stimulated with 0.2amp and their response was measured and averaged. The legs were then injected with caffeine and stimulated with 0.2amp and their response was then measured and averaged (right). The error bars for the legs without caffeine and the legs with caffeine are ±0.4949V and ± 0.3604V respectively.
