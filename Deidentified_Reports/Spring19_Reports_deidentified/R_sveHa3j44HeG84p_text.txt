Title: The Lack of Effect of Different Color Pigments in Leaves on the Rate of Photosynthesis of Lactuca Sativa

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes on the planet.  Photosynthesis occurs in every plant on the planet no matter what shape, size, or color.  In our experiment, the rate of photosynthesis is measured in Lactuca sativa with a green color pigmentation, and a purple color pigmentation.  This purple color in the lettuce comes from anthocyanins, and we wanted to see if anthocyanins influenced the rate of photosynthesis.  In order to measure this rate of photosynthesis, the plants were grinded and centrifuged before finally being measured in a spectrophotometer over time.  The results and P value did not show a significant difference between the purple and green leaves.  This means that the anthocyanins and the purple color did not have any significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis.  

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is one of the most vital chemical processes on the planet.  This process involves plants taking up light, carbon dioxide, and water in order to make usable sugars and energy in the form of ATP.  An important by-product of this reaction is oxygen.  Oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration in animals or any other life forms that require oxygen and the combination of these two reactions make all life on earth possible.  The organism we used in this study was Lactuca sativa, green and purple lettuce.  This organism undergoes photosynthesis and is relatively easy to grind and centrifuge in order to then measure the rate of photosynthesis.  Whether or not different pigmentations of leaves effected the rate of photosynthesis could have had huge impacts on how humans view nature.  There are two main stages of photosynthesis, the light and the dark reactions.  The first is called the light reactions because light energy is used to excite electrons which then power a proton gradient and generate ATP and NADPH.  This NADPH then goes to the Calvin Cycle, also known as the dark reactions.  This cycle uses ATP and NADPH to create G3P, which can be used as an energy storing molecule for the night when there is no sunlight available.  Both the light and dark reactions occur within different areas of the chloroplasts.  In order to best measure the rate of photosynthesis, a molecule of DCIP will be used.  DCIP is a dark blue molecule but becomes colorless when reduced to DCIPH2. In this experiment, the rate of photosynthesis will be measured in both green and purple lettuce.  This idea was chosen because purple lettuce contains anthocyanins which turns the color purple.  We did not know if these anthocyanins and the color change would have any effect on the rate of photosynthesis, so this experiment was done.  In an experiment done by R.E. Smillie, anthocyanins were found to minimize photodamage to photosynthetic tissues [Smillie: 1999].  Since normal leaves are green, and it is rare to see leaves of different colors, we hypothesized that the green lettuce would have a higher rate of photosynthesis because of its green color and ability to absorb sunlight.  



Materials and Methods:
First, a mortar and pestle was used to grind up green spinach leaves along with grinding buffer. The large chunks of the leaves were strained out.  The solution that passed through the strainer was centrifuged at 200 x G for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was poured out into another tube and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 x G for 10 minutes.  Finally, the supernatant was poured out and then the pellet was resuspended with grinding solution.  The entire process was repeated with the purple leaves.  For the final step of the experiment, a blank needed to be made.  3 trials of the green leaves, the purple leaves, and no chloroplasts all needed to be made as well.  These tubes all included water, DCIP so that the absorbance could be measured, reaction buffer, and chloroplasts in the tubes that needed chloroplasts.  An initial absorbance needed to be taken, and then another absorbance was taken every 10 minutes for 30 minutes.  A paired T-Test was used to determine significance.  

Results:
The P value found from the paired T-test was found to be p = 0.245.  This means that any difference in the data was not significant.  As for general trends in the data, the solution without chloroplasts did not drop in absorbance nearly as quick as the two solutions with chloroplasts.  The green and purple lettuce also seemed to drop at a similar rate.  

Discussion:
Based on the P value (p=0.245) determined by the paired T-test, there was no statistical difference between the rates of photosynthesis of the green lettuce and the purple lettuce.  This means that the null hypothesis was accepted, and the alternative hypothesis was rejected.  As photosynthetic rate increased in the plant over time the percent change also went down.  The graph clearly showed that the green and purple lettuce had a photosynthetic rate, but not that there was any difference between the two.  In an experiment focused on temperature and its effect on photosynthetic rates on plants with anthocyanins, the anthocyanins were shown to not inhibit any photosynthetic ability, and that temperature only slightly had an effect [Orin-Shamir: 2015]. This means that the anthocyanins and the purple color did not have an effect on the photosynthetic rate.  Some more supporting data came from an experiment done by Samuel O. Neill.  In his experiment, anthocyanins seemed to have much more of a protective effect on the cells than they had an effect on photosynthesis [Neill: 2003].  This supported our data because the anthocyanins did not really have an effect on photosynthesis but were actually in the leaves to protect from photobleaching from the sun.  In total, the alternative hypothesis was not supported and there was no significant difference between the green and purple lettuce.  Some possible future experiments might include trying to see how the rate of photosynthesis changes when purple and green leaves are left in direct bright light for extended amounts of time.  Since anthocyanins seem to be a way for plants to protect themselves from photobleaching, the green leaves should theoretically have lower rates of photosynthesis after the leaves begin to bleach.  This bleaching could have large repercussions on plant life if it does happen to be true.  Rates of photosynthesis could be altered if anthocyanins are effected by increasing global temperatures.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1:  This is a graph of percent absorbance versus time.  As time moves forward, the percent absorbance goes down as the rate of photosynthesis moves forward.  The initial absorbance was taken and then all other absorbances were based off that first point.  The three lines are for No chloroplasts as a negative control, purple lettuce as the experimental, and green lettuce as the positive control. *************************************************************************
