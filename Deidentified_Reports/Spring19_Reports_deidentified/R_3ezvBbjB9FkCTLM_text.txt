Title: Tetany in the legs of Rana pipiens via caffeine injection can cause biological problems

Abstract:
Muscles contract when presented with electrical stimuli. The strength of these contractions can be altered by presenting drugs, such as caffeine, into the muscle. In this experiment, caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens (frog), and the strength of muscle contraction was observed. It was expected that caffeine would cause chemically induced tetany, or maximum contraction. During the experiment, the muscles contracted stronger when presented with caffeine. Stimulating an action potential in a nerve connected to the caffeine-treated gastrocnemius muscle caused the muscle to reach tetany, and therefore was in a state of maximal contraction.

Introduction:
Muscles contract because of action potentials. A neuromuscular junction is where motor neurons and muscles meet at a synapse. When an action potential reaches the terminal end of a neuron, acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the synapse. When ACh binds to the postsynaptic cell, voltage gated sodium channels are triggered to open, which create another action potential in the postsynaptic cell through the opening of sodium gated ion channels. As this action potential moves down the axon, calcium ions are released into the cell, which triggers the contraction of muscles. Skeletal muscles contract partially before reaching tetany, an involuntary state of complete contraction that occurs after rapid successive stimulation [Sadava: 2014]. Previous studies show that caffeine can enhance physical performance by delaying fatigue in muscles, resulting in a prolonged ability of the muscle to perform as desired without tiring [Williams: 1991]. The research question of this experiment was focused on the short-term effects of caffeine. This experiment aimed to answer whether caffeine raises or lowers the maximum contraction of a gastrocnemius muscle (a skeletal muscle) of a Rana pipiens and to see if the addition of caffeine causes tetany. If there is an increase in caffeine in the gastrocnemius muscle, then the muscle will experience chemically induced tetany.  

Materials and Methods:
Caffeine was introduced into the muscle of a frog to see if tetany could be chemically induced. There were three frog legs sampled. The sample was prepared such that the skin was removed from the leg, and the gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the sciatic nerve. An electrode, connected to the iWork system, shocked the sciatic nerve which artificially sent an action potential to the muscle. First, this was done three times without the addition of caffeine (control) in order to get baseline data for a stimulus on the leg. Second, 0.1mL of 200mM caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle and it was then stimulated three more times. The difference between the control and treatment contraction strengths for each leg were evaluated and physical observations were noted. The amplitude of the electric current was kept constant at 1V for all trials. A paired t-test was done because two sets of data were related to each other in each individual frog leg sample. The control and treatment for each leg were paired.

Results:
Using a paired t-test, the difference between the contraction strengths of the control and caffeine-treated legs was statistically significant (t-value = 6.028, degrees of freedom = 2, p-value= 0.027) (see Figure 1). The differences in contraction strength were 0.102 V for leg 1, 0.066 V for leg 2, and 0.062 V for leg 3. The control group’s average contraction strength was 1.847 V +/- 0.091 V. The treatment group’s average contraction strength was 1.924 V +/- 0.111 V. The muscles containing caffeine reached tetany when an action potential was stimulated. The caffeine caused the muscle to swell, and after being shocked with caffeine, the muscle was firm. The contractions were observed to be stronger in the treatment phases of all three legs than during the control trials. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that an increase in caffeine would result in tetany was supported. The hypothesis was supported because there was statistical significance between the contraction strengths of the control trial and caffeine trial for each of the three legs. When caffeine was added, the muscle went into chemically induced tetany because of an interaction between caffeine and ryanodine receptors [Bazzucchi: 2011]. According to previous studies, this interaction causes more calcium to be released inside the cells, which leads to tetany because the muscle contracts more in the presence of excess calcium [Bazzucchi: 2011]. When the muscle was stimulated in this state, it was forced into maximal contraction. When there was no caffeine, as in the control trials, there were smaller contraction strengths because there was not excess calcium. The data is biologically significant because if a frog were to find caffeine in its environment and ingest caffeine, the functionality of frog’s muscles could be affected. Its muscles would not be able to function as needed because they would be stuck in a state of tetany. It is unlikely that a frog will encounter 0.1mL of 200mM caffeine in its natural environment, but, as demonstrated in the experiment, this level of caffeine would alter the neuromuscular function of the frog.  This experiment can be furthered by testing various caffeine levels and seeing how much caffeine is required in frogs to make a biologically significant change. This information could be useful in examining the jumping or moving capabilities of frogs when they are trying to escape from predators in their natural habitats.

Figure 1. Average difference in contraction strength for control and treatment groups. The paired t-test showed that there was a statistical difference between the contraction strength of the control group and the caffeine treated group (t-value = 6.028, degrees of freedom = 2, p-value= 0.027). The error bars represent one standard deviation from this average, which was +/- 0.091 for the control group and +/- 0.111 for the treatment group.*************************************************************************
