Title: The Effects of an Insect Growth Regulator in the Growth of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment, my group and I questioned what would happen to the caterpillar species, Manduca Sexta If they were fed a food concoction with a dosage of juvenile hormone(PreCor).  Our hypothesis was if we expose Manduca sexa caterpillars to 5 drops of Juvenile Hormone, then their weight and length will increase over the course of 14 days.

Introduction:
This experiment targets the maturity systems of the organism, Manduca Sexta, a moth species often known as a Tobacco Hornworm.  Juvenile Hormone is a hormone vital to the Manduca sexta’s development into an adult.  In the beginning stages, JH is present at a consistent rate.  The change from larva to pupa is marked with an increase in the protein inhibitor, allatostatin(Kramer, 1991) , causing  a rapid decrease in JH and a spike in JH levels called the commitment pulse.  In this experiment, we are examining how continuous levels of JH will affect the Manduca sexta organism as it goes through its stages of life.  We want to know how this hormone affects the organism.  Will the organisms die early?  Will they remain small larvae and never grow?  Or will they continue to grow and become adults?  However, based on the information my group and I have gathered, we think that if we expose the Manduca sexta caterpillars to 5 drops of Juvenile Hormone, then their weight and length will increase over the course of 14 days.

Materials and Method:
Our materials consisted of two 4-cell containers, specially made caterpillar food, mixing containers used to blend together the food and the water or PreCor hormone.  We also used a cell to measure the weight in grams of the caterpillars as well as a ruler to measure the millimeters of the subjects.  The PreCor is used as a vessel for juvenile hormone to the Manduca sexta caterpillars.  We started this experiment with selecting 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars around the same size and placed them into the 4-cell containers; separating the controll group from the treatment group.  We then fed the caterpillars one of two diets, 10 grams of caterpillar food with 5 drops of water added and the second diet being 10 grams of caterpillar food with 5 drops of PreCor.  We then put the caterpillars into an incubator and came back every day for  14 days to measure the weight and length of each caterpillar.  We refreshed the food whenever either the food got dry or if the caterpillars ate all of the food.

Results:
The degree of freedom is 26,  t-value is 0.02695, the One-tailed p_value is 0.489353, and the two-tailed p_value is 0.978706.

The degree of freedom is 26, the t-value is 0.02695, the One-tailed p_value is 0.489353, and the Two-tailed p_value is 0.978706.


Discussion:
Our data seems to support our original hypothesis that the weight and length of the treatment group would increase over time.  However, it was interesting to see how the controll group seemed to increase in weight for the first 8 days of our experiment and for the last 6 days there was a large drop in the weight, my team suspects that this is the sign that the controll group was beginning the process of pupation by reducing their eating and losing a lot of their mass.  We found it interesting that the treatment group did not go through this sudden change in weight, implying that the Juvenile Hormone was keeping the caterpillars from beginning the pupation process, remaining in their larval state.  We also noticed that by day 14, the treatment group looked very unhealthy, they seemed lethargic and their color turned more black than bright blue.  The controll group in contrast were well into their pupation process.  Our group chooses to accept our hypothesis based upon the consistent increase in weight and length over the entire 14 days of our study.
