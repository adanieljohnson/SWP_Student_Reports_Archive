Title: The effects of temperature on Pisum sativun root to shoot weight and length ratios

Abstract:
Field peas, Pisum sativun, go through resource allocation like all other plants in order to make up for lost resources due to temperatures, sunlight, or soil composition. The root to shoot ratio of plants is commonly used when determining how resource allocation has worked on a plant. For example, plants in drier climates may grow longer roots in order to access more water. We predicted that by increasing the temperature, the root to shoot ratio will decrease. We grew field pea plants for 14 days, and then measured the lengths and weights of the plants in order to determine the root to shoot ratio. We found that the root to shoot ratio for weight was significently higher in the room temperature environment, but there was no significent difference between the environments when looking at the root to shoot length. These results show us that temperature plays a bigger role in plant weight rather than plant length or growth.  

Introduction:
Plants are affected by various biotic (living) and abiotic (such as sunlight, temperature, etc.) factors. Abiotic factors lead to resource limitation because of a lack or abundance of sunlight, temperature, win, or soil make-up [Johnson: 2018]. This leads to resource allocation, so a plant can survive in different environments or conditions. For example, in a dry environment, a plant will grow longer than normal root in order to access more water [Johnson: 2018]. The temperature will affect the amount of water present in the plant because a higher temperature leads to a greater rate of water loss in the plant. Previous studies have been done to examine the effects of temperature and root/shoot growth. They have found that warmer climates and warmer soil tend to have shorter shoots and less growth in Norway spruce plants (Picea abies) [Lahti: 2005]. Another article found that in arctic sedges, the root to shoot ratio was smaller in plants in colder temperatures [Kummerow: 1984]. However, in Kaspar’s article, it was found that the taproot of a pecan grew the most when at 30 degrees Celsius, and any temperature above or below that showed a decrease in growth [Kaspar: 1992]. In this experiment, we will be examining the root to shoot ratio in field pea plants, Pisum sativun, that were grown in a hot environment and a room temperature environment. The root to shoot ratio is useful when determining how resource allocation has affected the plant. Based on the previous studies, we predicted that the root to shoot ratio will be lower in the plants grown in higher temperatures because of a lower amount of water present in the environment because of a greater rate of water loss in the plant. 

Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, we prepared four plastic containers by packing them with soil and burying nine seeds into each container. We watered each container with 100 Ml of water and miracle-gro. We placed two of these containers in the heated environment at 32 degrees Celsius, and we put the other two containers by a window in the classroom at 23 degrees Celsius. Every day for the next two weeks we watered the plants with approximately 100 Ml of water. After the two weeks, we selected 10 plants per condition and removed them from their containers. We cut all of the plants directly above the pea. We measured the length (cm) of the root and the shoot, making sure to keep all plants together. We then measured the weight (g) of each plant. For the root to shoot ratio, divide the root value by the shoot value for the length and weight. We used an unpaired t_test to analyze the data. 

Results:
There was a significent difference in root to shoot ratio weight (Figure 1; t_stat= 3.020, d.f.= 18, p= 0.004). However, there was not a significent difference in root to shoot ratio length (Figure 1; t_stat= 1.00, d.f.= 18, p= 0.382). The warm temperature treatment produced, on average, heavier and longer roots and shoots. However, the root to shoot ratio was larger in the room temperature condition because of a greater difference between the root and shoot. In the warm conditions, the average root to shoot ratio weight (grams) was 0.889 +/- 0.175, and the average root to shoot length (cm) was 0.596 +/- 0.107 (Figure 1). In the room temperature conditions, the average root to shoot ratio weight (grams) was 1.089 +/- 0.115, and the average root to shoot ratio length (cm) was 0.579 +/- 0.133 (Figure 1). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported when it comes to the root to shoot ratio dealing with the weight (g), but the hypothesis was not supported for root to shoot length (cm). The root to shoot ratio weight was significently higher in the room temperature plants than the hot environment plants (Figure 1; t_stat= 3.020, d.f.= 18, p= 0.004). However, there was no significent difference between environments for root to shoot length (Figure 1; t_stat= 1.00, d.f.= 18, p= 0.382). These results are similar to that of Kummerow, where the root to shoot ratio in arctic hedges was smaller when the plants were grown in colder temperatures. Our results differed from Lahti’s article, where they found that the Norway spruce grew and weighed the least at 21 degrees Celsius, when compared to 9, 13, and 18 degrees Celsius. This could be due to them having a longer growth period, for example, Kummerow used a growth period of 2 months. The other studies used large plots to grow their plants in [Kummerow: 1984], [Lahti: 2005], [Kaspar: 1992]. They also used different plants that require different conditions than our plants, as described in the introduction. The lack of difference between the root to shoot length could be due to the plants only being able to grow for 14 days and a lack of space in their small containers.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Field pea plants were either grown in a warm environment or a room temperature environment. This figure represents the average root to shoot ratios of both the length and weight of the field pea plants after growing for 14 days. The error bars represent the standard deviation. The difference in the root:shoot weight was significent (t_stat= 3.020, d.f.= 18, p= 0.004), and the difference in the root:shoot length was not significent (t_stat= 1.00, d.f.= 18, p= 0.382). *************************************************************************
