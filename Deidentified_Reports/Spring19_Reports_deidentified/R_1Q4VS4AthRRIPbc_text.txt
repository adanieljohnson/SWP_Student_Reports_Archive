Title: Influence of AZA Guard and Ecdysteroids on Manduca Sexta Development

Abstract:
Abstract: The Manduca sexta, or hornworm, has an 8-stage life cycle, and its timing is controlled by hormones called ecdysteroids. AZA guard was a compound used by the group in order to decrease the amount of ecdysteroids in the developing hornworm. The group separated 8 hornworms into 2 groups—the control and the experimental—and gave the experimental hornworms AZA guard in their food for 8 days. The group expected that the hornworms that ate the AZA guard would develop more slowly. Since AZA guard decreases the amount of ecdysteroids, the larva should progress more slowly towards pupation. The group found that the control caterpillars, which were fed only water with their food, developed more quickly and grew significantly larger than the experimental caterpillars. The group used a two-tailed t-test to determine that the average size of the control group was significantly larger than that of the experimental group. This led to the conclusion that AZA guard and, therefore, ecdysteroids negatively affect the growth of the Manduca sexta. 

Introduction:
Introduction: The tobacco hornworm, or the Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera that has an 8-stage lifecycle. Ecdysteroids are hormones that affect the timing of molting in insects, and they are secreted by the prothoracic glands. When ecdysteroids are high, the developing insect will develop quickly from pupa to full adult. Juvenile hormone (JH) is another significant hormone, and it plays a role in the shifts between stages in the hornworm’s life cycle.  The cycle starts with eggs and then progresses through 5 instar larvae stages. Next, the hornworm goes in to the pupal stage then emerges and develops into a grown adult. Typically, the hornworm increases progressively between instar stages [Grunert:2015]. The ecdysteroids control the timing of this whole process. AZA guard is a compound that is meant to decrease the amount of ecdysteroids in the hornworms exposed to it. Does AZA guard significantly alter the growth cycle of the Manduca sexta? The group hypothesized that the hornworms treated with the AZA guard will not grow as much since AZA guard blocks ecdysteroids, which control the timing of molting, and without it, the hornworms will progress more slowly towards pupation.

Materials and Methods:
Methods: In this lab, the group first obtained 8 hornworms in the instar stages of life and weighed them all. The group then separated them into two groups of 4—the control group and the experimental group. Each hornworm was placed in one of 4 individual chambers in each clear box with holes punched in each side. There were two clear boxes with 4 chambers each. The control group was given 10g of food, as well as 10 drops of water, thoroughly mixed, every day for a week. The experimental group was fed 10g of food and 5 drops of 1:1250 concentration AZA guard, as well as 5 drops of water thoroughly mixed. Each hornworm was given this same amount of food individually each day during the week. The food was replaced every day, and the group weighed each hornworm each day. At the beginning of the experiment and each day after being fed and weighed. The hornworms were placed back in their respective chambers and placed in a 24-hour-light incubator at 35 degrees Celsius. The group used a two-tailed t-test to determine if the control group was significantly larger than the experimental group and a critical value of .05.

Results:
Results: 
The hornworms in the control group were significantly larger than the experimental group, with a two-tailed p-value of .007. Since this value is less than the critical value, the weights are significantly different, meaning that the control group is significantly larger than the experimental group. This means that the AZA guard significantly affects the size and growth of the hornworms over a week time. Even though the control group, on average, began at a lower weight on day one, they overcame the experimental group around day 3 or 4 and steadily grew after that (Figure 1). The standard deviations of the control and experimental data were 3.80 and 1.07, respectively. Additionally, after day 4, the experimental group did not show many signs of growth. 


Discussion:
Discussion: The experimental group did not grow as much as the control group, as predicted by the lab group. The AZA guard blocked the ecdysteroids, which cause the hornworms to grow quickly towards pupation. Since the steroids were blocked, the hornworms in the experimental group progressed more slowly towards pupation and, therefore, did not grow as quickly. This means that the AZA guard negatively influenced the growth of the hornworms and confirms the group’s hypothesis. Based on the two-tailed t-test, the control group was significantly larger than the experimental group at the end of the week. Additionally, the standard deviation of the control group was almost twice that of the experimental group, which means that the control group varied much more than the experimental group. The experimental hornworms were much more consistent than the control caterpillars. This could mean that naturally, hornworms vary greatly in size, but the change in diet caused them to be much more consistent in size. One aspect of the experiment that could have affected the results is that some of the food may have dried up during the day after the caterpillars were fed, which could have caused them not to eat as much. Additionally, the caterpillars may have been able to smell or taste the AZA guard, which may have caused them not to eat as much. If I were to repeat this experiment in the future, I would use a larger sample size of caterpillars because it is natural for some caterpillars to progress more slowly through the growth cycle or to not eat as much as others. Additionally, I would use a 12-hour-light, 12-hour-dark incubator because this would more closely replicate the natural habitat of the hornworms. One experiment done by Stuart Reynolds and Stephen Nottingham discovered that Manduca sexta ate progressively less food as the temperature of their incubator increased [Reynolds:1985]. This could have played a role in the consumption of food by the group’s sample of hornworms.
