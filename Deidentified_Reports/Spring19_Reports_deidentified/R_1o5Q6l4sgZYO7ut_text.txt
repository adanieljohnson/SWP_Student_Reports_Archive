Title: The Effects of Nitrogen on Pisum sativum Growth

Abstract:
Nitrogen is an element utilized by plants to grow, and it is commonly found in plant fertilizers. Nitrogen is a critical component of chlorophyll, the compounds that carry out photosynthesis, and a critical component of amino acids. Together, amino acids and chlorophyll help to “build” the plant. In this lab, we tested the effects of nitrogen on Pisum sativa, the common pea plant. The plants treated with nitrogen were hypothesized to grow taller, with smaller root:shoot ratios than those plants left untreated. The results did not support the hypothesis, with there being no significant difference between the root:shoot length ratios. The root:shoot weight ratios contrasted our hypothesis—the nitrogen treated plants’ ratios were significantly greater than the untreated plants’. Analyzing these results may provide insight into the damaging effects of too much nitrogen in soil.


Introduction:
Mineral uptake is one of the many mechanisms utilized by plants to grow. The roots of plants absorb water and nutrients, and transport said molecules to other areas of the plant. Fertilizers are commonly used to enhance plant growth. Many of these fertilizers contain excess levels of nitrogen, a necessary element for the growth process. Nitrogen promotes activity in the chlorophyll, the compounds which carry out photosynthesis. In addition to chlorophyll, nitrogen is a critical component of amino acids, the building blocks of every organism [Ingestad: 1977]. Nitrogen is taken up and fixed by the plant roots and, in turn, hydrogen (H+) protons are exported from the roots into the surrounding soil [Richardson: 2009]. This release of protons into the soil is commonly referred to as “acidification” [Richardson: 2009]. The pea, Pisum sativum, is a common vegetable farmed in various areas around the world. In this lab, we will focus on the effects of nitrogen, in the form of the fertilizer MiracleGro, on the growth of the Pisum sativum plant. If pea plants are treated with nitrogen, then the resulting plants will have smaller root:shoot ratios as the shoot is growing taller at an increased rate, compared to those plants that have not been treated with nitrogen. 


Materials and Methods:
After obtaining two pots, we labeled one “control” and the other “treatment,” paralleling which pot was to be treated with nitrogen. These pots were then filled with soil and ten Pisum sativum seeds each. The control pot was watered with 100ml of water. The experimental pot was watered with 50ml of water and 50ml of MiracleGro solution (mixed to the box’s provided instructions). The plants were watered every day for two weeks with these same solutions. At the end of two weeks we removed each sprout from the pots and separated the roots from the shoots. We measured each root and shoot in centimeters, and weighed each root and shoot in grams for the control and experimental plants. These root and shoot measurements were then used to calculate root:shoot ratios, in both weight and length, for each plant in each environment. We then used a paired two-sample t-test to determine if there was a significant difference between the ratios of the control group and the experimental group. 


Results:
The plants treated with nitrogen were duller in color, more wilted, and shorter than the untreated plants. The average root:shoot length ratios for the control group and experimental group were 0.676+/-0.124 and 0.822+/-0.405 respectively. The average root:shoot weight ratios for the control group and experimental group were 1.023+/-0.154 and 1.829+/-0.739 respectively, noted in Figure 1. There is no significant difference between the root:shoot length ratios of the control and experimental plants: t-value=1.09, df=18, p-value=0.144. The root:shoot weight ratio of the experimental group was significantly greater than that of the control group: t-value=3.38, df=18, p-value=0.003. These root:shoot weight ratios supported our main observations, considering the lack of growth and wilted nature of the experimental group. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support our hypothesis. The root:shoot ratios of the nitrogen treated plants were not significantly smaller than those of the untreated plants. In fact, the root:shoot weight ratio of the nitrogen treated group was significantly greater than that of the untreated group. The failure of the nitrogen treated plants to grow indicates that too much nitrogen may have been added to the soil. Based on previous studies, the plants treated with nitrogen may have exported so many H+ protons from the roots in taking up nitrogen, that the soil around the plants became too acidic for the survival of the plant [Richardson: 2009]. Had we added less nitrogen, the plants may have grown more efficiently, without the over-acidification of the soil. Previous studies have shown that addition of nitrogen can be very effective in plant growth, if added in the correct proportions [Ingestad: 1977]. This information may be helpful to agriculturalists when determining how often to treat plants with nitrogen or any other added nutrient. It may also be beneficial for fertilizer developers when deciding how much, if any, nitrogen to add to their product.
