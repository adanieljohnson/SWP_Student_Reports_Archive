Title:  Effect of Sevin on Rate of Tetany in Neuromuscular Control of Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
Animals rely on the nervous system to perform many functions including walking, fight or flight response, and instinctual reactions (e.g. flinching, jumping, etc).  Nerves are in controll of these functions and when they are not working properly, there can be serious consequences such as muscle fatigue.  This experiment was done in order to determine how quickly, and at what frequency, tetanus would be reached when the sciatic nerve in the legs of the frog, Rania pipiens, was stimulated repeatedly and at higher frequencies.  An acetylcholinesterase (ACh) inhibitor, Sevin, was used to compare its effect to the normal nerve response.  Before any initial measurements, the frog legs were skinned, revealing the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve.  The measurements were recorded using direct stimulation in order to determine twitch threshold.  The results show there was a significent difference between the frequency in which tetanus was reached in the frog legs with the Sevin and without it, meaning the alternate hypothesis was supported. 

Introduction:
The nervous system is unique to animals.  Other species such as plants do not have nerves and rely primarily on a hormone-based system.  Both vertebrates and invertebrates have myofibers which are bound together to form function groups.  Motor neurons innervate several myofibers at neuromuscular junctions.  Acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal as a result of nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction.  When Ach binds with a receptor on the membrane of muscle fiber, it causes sodium channels to open; the concentration gradient of sodium is responsible for the activation of action potentials, which in turn controlls the response in the nervous system [Song: 2011].  Subsequently, Ca¬¬¬¬2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which in turn activates the contraction (i.e. muscle shortening).  There are three primary ions that have a significent impact in the neuromuscular controll: sodium, calcium, and potassium.  In this experiment, the focus is on muscle contraction, specifically the contraction of the sciatic nerve in the gastrocnemus muscle in the legs of the Northern leopard frog (Rania pipiens).  Sevin is used in this experiment for the treatment group.  Sevin is an insecticide with the active ingredient carbaryl; it is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that prevents ACh from being broken down, resulting in muscles being in a constant state of contraction.  Therefore, we hypothesize that if the frog legs are given an injection of 2% Sevin, they will reach tetany soon than the frog legs without it. 

Materials and Method:
Each group was given 3 frog legs to experiment on.  Each frog leg was to be placed in a dissecting pan.  Forceps were used to grasp the skin on top of the leg and pull it down towards the foot.  Frog Ringer’s solution was used to keep the tissue moist.  A dissecting probe was used to separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the upper end of the knee.  The sciatic nerve was then be removed from the connecting tissue using a dissecting needle and forceps.  The twitch threshold was determined by direct stimulation.  In order to do this, a knot was tied at the end of the gastrocnemus muscle and the leg was hoisted up to the hooks connected to the direct stimulation equipment.  The probes were put into the muscle once it was connected to a computer.  The software used on the computer was Labscribe, which recorded the response the probe detected.  The stimulus (V) was set to 1 and the frequency (F(Hz)) to 10 for each leg.  The frequency was increased by 5Hz until the muscle reached tetany and the points of partial/incomplete and complete/full tetany were recorded.  These initial measurements were for the controll group.  For the treatment group, the same steps were repeated but this time, the legs were injected with 2% Sevin.  A wait time of at least 5 minutes had to occur before resuming with the testing in order to make sure the Sevin had fully spread into the muscle.  The frequency (F(Hz)) and response (V) values were recorded.  The frequency was set at 10Hz it was increased by 2.5Hz until complete tetany was reached.  A paired t_test was used for the resulting values.

Results:
At 10Hz, incomplete tetany was reached for all 3 legs in the controll group.  Legs 2 and 3 reached complete tetany at 15Hz, whereas Leg 1 reached complete tetany at 20Hz.  For the treatment group, all 3 legs reached incomplete tetany at 10Hz.  Once again, Legs 2 and 3 reached complete tetany at the same frequency of 12.5Hz but Leg 1 reached complete tetany at 17.5Hz.  Leg 1 in both the controll and treatment group had a longer response time than Legs 2 and 3.  The results of the treatment group were shown to be statistically significently different than that of the controll group (t_stat = 751, d.f. = 2, P = 1.77∙10-6).  Figure 1 shows the difference in frequency at which tetanus was reached between the controll and treatment groups; the controll group needed a higher frequency to reach complete tetany, whereas the treatment needed a lower frequency.  

Discussion:
Despite leg 1 having a later response time than legs 2 and 3, the alternative hypothesis was supported because complete tetany was reached faster in the treatment group than the controll group.  Complete tetany was reached sooner and at a lower frequency because the Sevin is an acetylcholine inhibitor, which means Ach cannot be broken down and the muscle is in a constant state of contraction, resulting in muscle fatigue.  The main purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on muscle contraction.  The results could be used to assist in treating certain medical dilemmas such as inhibitory responses in the brain; ACh affects both the excitatory and inhibitory afferents due to the stimulation of an action potential on the presynaptic nerve.  Experiments such as this can help in determining the effects of certain inhibitors on the neural response muscles receive [Valentino: 1981].  Additionally, synaptic transmission, which is caused primarily by ACh, allows complex cerebral commands to be transduced into muscular twitches.  Sciatic nerve stimulation has been researched and studied in previous years.  Past experiments have shown that there are many uses for it including how it may be used to help in clinical medicine for issues such as kidney stone therapy and treating patients with disabilities such as the pathological muscle weakness myasthenia gravis (MG) [Petrov: 2018], [Schelling: 1994].  There were some technical difficulties when performing the experiment.  The connection between the probe in the muscle and the computer sometimes faltered and the experiment had to be repeated in order to ensure the data was accurate up until then.  Future studies can be done to determine the extent to which muscles can handle a stimulus by using other organisms and using different kinds of inhibitors or facilitators to govern whether they have the same kind of effect as Sevin; if they do not, these experiments can also help confirm why and how that knowledge can be used in future studies on neuromuscular issues in humans.
