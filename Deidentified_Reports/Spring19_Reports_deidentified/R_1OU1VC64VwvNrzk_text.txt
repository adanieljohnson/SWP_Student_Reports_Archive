Title: The Effects of Color on Male Betta Aggression Behaviors 

Abstract:
The purpose of this report is to determine if color exposure effects male Betta splendins aggression behaviors towards one another. We hypothesized that if male Bettas were exposed to color before and during male versus male interaction, they would red mane for longer durations of time. Nine trials were run in which three male Betta fish were exposed to one another, two at a time. Six trials used colored film (blue and red) to wrap the tank, and three trials used a controll film (clear). We measured the length of time in which they would red mane towards one another to assess changes in aggression behaviors. The male Bettas in the clear film trial served as our controll group, while the Bettas in the colored film were the experimental group. The graphed averages of the two groups showed no apparent trend. Using a paired two-tailed t_test, we calculated the results had no statistical significance between the duration of red manning for male Bettas being exposed to color and not (t= 0.184, d.f.=16, p= 0.856). The study and results help give us a deeper understand of the Betta species, and the nature of their aggressive behaviors. 

Introduction:
Ethology gives us an insight on not only how animal behavior has evolved, but also what sorts of behaviors have contributed to the fitness of a species. Behaviors vary per animal, as many have distinct qualities and actions that play a vital role in their communication to their own and other species. Betta splendins are one of the many species that have a range of observable traits, especially seen with their aggressive behaviors. Bettas are capable of both intraspecific (with members of their own species) and interspecific (with members of another species) behavior, in which they show a number of aggressive displays to warn off their opponent. Some of these observable displays include expanding gills, broadside movements, tail flashing, and red manning. Red manning is classified as one of the more aggressive and threatening displays, as a Betta will face its opponent head-on and open its gill covers in a hostile motion [Bruce: 2003]. Furthermore, Bettas are easily bred and readily available, making them the perfect specimen for our experimental observation [Braddock: 1955]. 	
In this lab, we aimed to test if there was any effect of color on Betta splendins aggressive behaviors. Since Bettas have the ability to see color beyond black and white, we wanted to incorporate the use of a colored stimuli into their interaction and resting periods to see if they would adapt or change their behaviors according to an outside factor. Past studies have found that Betta splendins have a measurable response to brightness and color distribution, and that they respond more aggressively to naturalistic colors and brightness [Bando: 1991].  Using only male Betta splendins, as they tend to behave more aggressively towards one another, we monitored their aggressive behaviors within interaction while being exposed to the natural colors of blue, red, and clear [Elcoro: 2008]. We hypothesized that if the male Betta splendins were exposed to color during their resting breaks and interactions with one another, then they would display more aggressive behaviors than if exposed to no color.


Materials and Method:
Only male Betta splendins were used in our lab, all of which were of similar size and varied only slightly in overall color. The three males were placed into three separate compartments of the same tank, that were divided by both a solid and opaque partition. Our lab group choose red, blue and clear film to wrap the tank throughout the experiment, as they mimic some of the natural colors of Betta splendins exterior. 
First, we wrapped the tank in blue film, covering all surfaces of the glass. We let the male Bettas rest for five minutes within their own compartments. Then, by two at a time, we exposed the male Bettas to one another by removing the solid partition that separated two compartments. We allowed the fish to interact with one another for five minutes, and measured the length of time an individual would red mane at its opponent. After time was up, we would place the solid partition back down to allow the fish a five-minute break period. This process was repeated until all three fish had interacted with one another, and used a small fish net to switch the male in the middle compartment. 
Next, we repeated the process using red film, which covered all surfaces of the glass tank. We replicated the same process, giving the fish a five-minute rest and interaction time while being exposed to the red color. All three males were exposed to one another two at a time, and we again measured the duration in which the individuals would red mane.
 Lastly, we used a clear film to cover the glass tank as our controll, in order to make sure the fish were reacting to color and not a wrapping on their tank.  The same process was repeated between the three males in order to get controll group data. Five-minute breaks and interaction were replicated in the exact same order and form, and we collected red mane duration for the individuals. We then calculated the average red manning duration for the individual Bettas under color exposure and the controll. Once graphs were made with this data, we used a paired two-tailed t_test to calculate p_values and determine significance or insignificance within our results.  


Results:
The average duration of red manning for male Bettas exposed to color (blue and red) was 13.164± 3.9707 seconds and the average duration of red manning for male Bettas exposed to no color (clear) was 14.084±11.68. Graphing the data showed no general trends between the trials of color and no color (Graph 1). Using these results, we used a two-sample t test to calculate a p value. The two-tailed t_test showed there was no significent difference between the duration of red manning of the Betta splendins exposed to color film and Betta splendins exposed to clear film (t= 0.184, d.f.=16, p= 0.856).

Discussion:
Overall, these results do not support our hypothesis that male Betta splendins would exhibit more aggressive behavior when exposed to color during their rest period and interaction between one another. As described in Figure 1, there was no evident trend that alluded to an environment in which more frequent or longer spans of red manning occurred, and the color of the tank seemingly had no effect on how male Betta splendins interacted with each other. On the contrary, past studies have found that Betta splendins do prefer color as a sexual response to one another. Red, oranges, and yellows were found favorable by mates, and the color of the fish plays a large role in the way Betta males adapt and communicate with one another [Clotfelter:2007]. 
Some underlying factors may have skewed our results, and prevented us from seeing a distinct relationship between color and behavior of the male Betta splendins, such as other studies have found in the past. One of the first explanations may include habituation, in which by the time we exposed the fish to the red stimuli, it could have become aware and relaxed within its artificial environment [Clayton: 1968]. At one point in the experiment, one of the male Betta fish was seemingly exhausted or disoriented, and it did not interact with the other fish in the same manner, leading us to believe it did habituate to some degree. In a further experiment, one could prevent habituation by switching out the subjects more frequently, and having access to more male Betta splendins that are not used to this simulated environment. Secondly, our group only had time to run three trials for the controll group, compared to the size trials we ran for the experimental groups. To get more accurate results in the future, it is important to collect equal amounts of data from all the groups our lab experiment was testing. 
Betta fish are a great species in which to study behavior, as their aggressive displays are easily observable and measurable. Even though we hoped to find a correlation between aggression behavior and a color stimulus, our lab group gained a deeper insight on the species itself and how to work with one again in a lab setting in the future.

Figure Legends: 
The Difference in Average Red Manning Durations Between Control and Experimental Groups. When evaluating this graph, there are no apparent trends between the two groups of data, as there are no extreme differences between the two. The average red manning duration for the controll group was 14.084±11.68, and the average red manning duration for the experimental groups was 13.164± 3.9707. *************************************************************************
