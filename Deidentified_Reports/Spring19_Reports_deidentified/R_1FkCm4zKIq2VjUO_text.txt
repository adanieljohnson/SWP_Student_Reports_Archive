Title: The Effect of Nitrogen-Rich Solution on the Root to Shoot Ratio in Pisum sativun

Abstract:
The uptake of nutrients is a key process in plants that allows them to obtain the resources they need to grow and produce energy.  In order to maximize their efficiency, plants can adapt to their environment and alter the allocation patterns of their resources.  One method that plants can use to increase their chance for survival is by altering their root to shoot ratio.  In our experiment, the effect of a nitrogen-rich fertilizer solution on the pea plant (Pisum sativun) was studied.  We predicted that the experimental group supplemented with Miracle-Gro solution would have a decreased root to shoot ratio in comparison to the controll group that was only given water.  After the plants had grown over a 14-day period, the group treated with nitrogen looked much less healthy than the controll group.  Our data for the root to shoot ratio of the mass was statistically significent, but our data for the root to shoot ratio of the length was not significent.  More studies on the effects of too much nitrogen being added to soil could be beneficial in determining how much nitrogen to put in fertilizers in order to maximize growth.

Introduction:
In nature, there are biotic and abiotic factors that affect many different aspects of a plant.  Since there are limited resources, plants must compete for sunlight, nutrients, and water just as animals fight for what they need.  One of the most important aspects that plants can alter is the allocation of resources.  Since the different parts of plants have different functions, their allocation patterns can be altered based on what specific environment they live in [Johnson: 2018].  The roots of a plant are below ground, while the shoots (leaves and stems) are above ground.  The root to shoot ratio is especially important in plants since they each have separate functions, and both are necessary for survival.  Plants can slightly alter their root to shoot ratio allowing them to maximize their allocation of resources [Johnson: 2018].  Depending on which resources are sparse or abundant, plants adapt to their environment and are more efficient with their energy.  It is evident that a high availability of resources in the soil will cause a plant to allocate a larger percent of its biomass into the roots in order to uptake these nutrients [Shemesh: 2011].  A vital part of the soil that helps plants to grow is nitrogen.  Nitrogen is a nutrient that can come in many different forms or ions in the soil but is necessary for the different processes of a plant.  In this lab we will test the effects of adding large amounts of nitrogen on the root to shoot ratio in the Pisum sativun plant.  We hypothesize that if we add extra nitrogen to the soil, then the plant will grow larger and the root to shoot ratio will decrease.

Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis, 18 seeds were planted inside of two pots.  Nine holes were carved out in the soil and two seeds were placed in each hole.  After the seeds were planted, the containers were labeled as controll and experimental and placed in the greenhouse.  The controll plants were given 50 Ml of water and the experimental plants were given 50 Ml of a nitrogen-rich Miracle-Gro fertilizer solution every day for a total of 14 days.  The Miracle-Gro contained a large amount of nitrogen, which allowed our hypothesis to be tested against the controll group.  After two weeks, ten plants were harvested from each container.  They were dumped in a tub of water and the roots were separated from the vermiculite.  The roots were sprayed with water to get rid of all the extra soil that was still stuck and then the plants were dried with paper towels. The plants were then cut at the junction of the roots and stem, right above the seed.  This allowed for the effective separation of the plant into its root and shoot portions.  A ruler was used to measure the length and an electronic balance was used to measure the mass.  Values for the length and mass of every root and shoot were recorded in a table and this data was used to find the root to shoot ratio.  A statistical analysis was then performed using a two-sample t_test with an alpha value of 0.05 for both length and width. This tested for a significent difference between the controll group given just water and the experimental group treated with a nitrogen-rich Miracle-Gro solution.  

Results:
After two weeks, the controll and experimental group plants looked different from each other.  The experimental group was much shorter and had much fewer stems and leaves, while the controll group was more fully grown and larger in size.  Both the roots and shoots of the experimental group were shriveled and not as abundant as those of the controll group.  As shown in Figure 1, the average root to shoot ratio for mass of the controll group was 1.023 +/- 0.154, while the average root to shoot ratio of the experimental group was 1.830 +/- 0.739. From the results of our statistical analysis, we found that the mean of the controll group was statistically significently different for mass (t_stat = 3.375149, d.f. = 18, P = 0.003372).  The average root to shoot ratio for length of the controll group was 0.676 +/- 0.124, while the average root to shoot ratio of the experimental group was 0.822 +/- 0.405.  Based off our statistical analysis, the mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group for length (t_stat = 1.09176, d.f. = 18, P = 0.289337).  

Discussion:
Based on our results, we can see that our data for mass is statistically significent but our data for length is not statistically significent.  While we predicted the root to shoot ratio to decrease, it actually increased.  Based on the observations we took during lab however, we can see that the nitrogen solution that we gave to our experimental group had a negative effect on our plants.  Not only were they much shorter and less healthy, the root to shoot ratio increased in general.  Nitrogen is a nutrient that is necessary in plants and they can’t live without it. The uptake and transport of nitrogen is a process that mainly takes place in the xylem of plants, and inorganic nitrogen is used in the synthesis of many amino acids, which are required for protein synthesis [Pate: 1973].  The root to shoot ratio of our plants may have increased because the extra nitrogen present in the soil caused the plants to allocate their resources more into the roots, causing the biomass of the roots to increase.  However, since there was such a large amount of nitrogen present, it must have had some unpredicted negative effects on the plants’ growth.  It seemed as if this abundance of nitrogen caused the plant to “burnout”.  In one experiment, an excess of nitrogen in soil caused the leaves and fruits of an olive tree to contain large deposits of nitrogen, which damaged their overall quality and appearance [Fernández-Escobar: 2006].  This excess of nitrogen can be applied on a larger scale to fertilizer.  Most fertilizers, such as the Miracle-Gro formula used in this experiment, contain some form of nitrogen to help the plant grow.  Based off our experiment, it seems that too much nitrogen is bad for plants.  One possible explanation is that too much of a single nutrient in the soil could limit the uptake of other vital nutrients that a plant needs for survival.  While the plants in this experiment acquired a lot of nitrogen through the soil, they may have lacked other nutrients which could have caused them to grow less.  More experiments can be completed to find the perfect amount of nitrogen for the Pisum sativun plant, as well as other plants, to benefit from the addition of this nutrient to the soil.
