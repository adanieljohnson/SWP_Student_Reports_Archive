Title: The effects of sodium inhibition on neuromuscular reactions in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The function of muscles and ability to move both voluntarily and involuntarily in Rania pipiens is directly connected the interaction between muscular and nervous systems through electrical and chemical signaling. The inhibition or excitation of these chemical reactions, however, could affect the ability of the muscle to react to various stimuli. Three legs were similarly tested, each once as a controll and once after lidocaine injections as a treatment, to determine the effects of a sodium blocker on muscular reactions to electrical stimuli in, Rania pipiens, R. pipiens. The collected data was quantified by comparing both the change in voltage threshold and change in muscular reaction to the controll threshold before and after lidocaine treatments to determine significent change. The final results showed that there was a statistically significent difference in muscular reactions to the controll threshold but not for change in threshold overall.  In each of the legs there was minute, if any, reaction to the controll voltage threshold after being treated with the sodium blocker because the inhibition of these channels hindered the chemical signaling necessary to trigger muscular reaction. This prevention of free muscular movement as a result of electrical stimuli supports the hypothesis

Introduction:
The nervous system is a vital mechanism for the function of muscular systems, processing chemical and electrical stimuli and processing the signals to enable movement. These neuromuscular interactions allow reactions to various stimuli which can be recorded using a myogram. Myograms are specialized devices that analyze the reactions of muscles, converting movement into Volts as a unit of measurement based on the various levels of electrical stimuli given through a current probe [Johnson:2018]. This unique intercommunication between the nervous system signaling and muscular reactions is specific to animals due to the presence of myofibers in the muscular system [Johnson:2018]. This neuromuscular connection is visibly present in the hind legs of R. pipiens in the gastrocnemus muscle in the thigh and the sciatic nerve which runs longitudinally down the leg [De Luca: 1997]. This relationship is vital to survival as extreme signals are required to trigger high-energy movement of these muscles which enable the frog to jump long distances. Many chemical reactions are triggered by the electrical stimuli that begin the signaling process in the nervous system [De Luca: 1997]. Sodium is one such reactive component of the neuromuscular interactions which is necessary for signals translating muscle movement [De Luca: 1997]. The use of various other chemical stimuli to alter normal chemical reactions in the muscle would disrupt the standard cascade of events between neuromuscular systems [De Luca: 1997]. It is hypothesized that the use of a sodium blocker on the Gastrocnemius muscle would inhibit nervous system signaling, preventing muscle reactions to electrical stimuli.  Abstract cont.  remained in the feet due to the injections not being directly in the sciatic nerve. It is concluded that the injection of a sodium blocker into R. pipiens gastrocnemus muscle minimizes the reactions of the thigh to electrical stimuli due to inhibition of signaling while peripheral areas of the leg were less affected.

Abstract cont.:
hypothesis that the reactions following lidocaine treatment would be decreased compared to the controll.

Materials and Method:
Three R. pipiens legs were tested in two parts, the controll and treatment, to determine the effects of a chemical sodium blocker on muscular reactions to electrical stimuli. Each leg was tested individually to preserve moisture for optimal results of accurate muscle movement. The leg was first prepared by removing the skin from the top of the thigh down to the foot, exposing the gastrocnemus muscle. The muscle was then gently separated to expose the sciatic nerve. Once the nerve was separated from surrounding muscle and connective tissues the electrical current probe was placed for later stimulation. The sciatic nerve was chosen for current probe placement because the nerve itself would not be treated with the sodium blocker, only the gastrocnemus muscle. While handling the sciatic nerve, care was taken to maintain moisture and limit metal exposure in order to preserve the ionized state and ensure accurate muscle reactions. The leg was then connected at two points to voltage apparatus, used to measure the voltage reactions of the muscle to varying electrical stimulus. The controll was then tested by finding the threshold of the leg and recording the reaction in Volts. For the treatment, the gastrocnemus muscle was injected in two spots with 0.05 Ml of 25 mM lidocaine, totaling 0.1 Ml, and was given a 7-minute resting period to allow the sodium blocker to take effect. The leg was then retested at the controll threshold for a reaction before finding the new treatment threshold in Volts. This process was repeated on all three R. pipiens legs and the collected data was analyzed using a two-sample t_test to determine statistical significance.

Results:
The difference in neuromuscular reactivity to electrical stimuli in R. pipiens before and after treatment with lidocaine injections was statistically significent regarding the change in average muscular reaction (t-value: 11.055, DF:4, p_value:0.0003) but not with regard to the change in voltage threshold for muscular reaction (t-value: 1.375, DF:4, p_value:0.241). The average voltage reaction for R. pipiens following lidocaine injections was less than the controll with 0.002 ± 0.003 V while those prior to lidocaine injection were 0.063 ± 0.009 (Figure 2). The average voltage threshold for R. pipiens following lidocaine injections was insignificently greater with 0.153 ± 0.047 V threshold compared to the 0.103 ± 0.041 V in the controll group (Figure 1).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the use of a sodium blocker would inhibit muscle reactions to electrical stimuli in R. pipiens was supported by the findings, however the inhibition was limited as there was still minute reactions to stimuli and greater reactions with increase stimuli. The observations of each frog leg during the controll period showed uninhibited movement in the thigh through to the foot, indicated by higher voltage reactions, while they were significently decreased following the lidocaine treatment, indicated by lower voltage reactions. These findings were supported by previous studies showing similar muscular inhibition due to alternative synthesized sodium blockers [De Luca: 1997]. The study also found that differing sodium blockers and doses can different affect the muscular reactions, suggesting that alternative concentrations of lidocaine and increase in injection sites could have greater effects in limiting muscular movement [De Luca: 1997] This experiment limited the injections site to the gastrocnemus muscle which in turn isolated the effects of the sodium inhibition. Since the electrical current was placed directly onto the sciatic nerve, it was only stopped once it reached the effected muscle, enabled untreated muscle areas to continue to have reactions to stimuli where the gastrocnemus did not. This outcome is directly connected to the biological effects of lidocaine on cellular function in that it acts as a sodium inhibitor which prevents the movement of sodium as needed through the appropriate channels. This cuts of the cascade of chemical signaling which occurs upon stimulation in order to trigger movement, preventing the muscle from completing the action that began to be signaled. The previous studies findings further supported this component of the collected data regarding the effect of electrical stimuli following treatment, requiring greater voltage to produce similar reactions in the legs [De Luca: 1997]. It is concluded that the use of a sodium blocker on a specific muscle system will have effects on the injection site and surrounding areas, inhibiting reactions that were more likely to occur without the blocker; however, the reactions in periphery areas and when more extreme stimuli were implemented were not entirely inhibited. This study could be further expanded to test the effects of increased concentration or injections sited in the sodium blockers, allowing further insight into the degree with which sodium blockers could be used for varying purposes.
