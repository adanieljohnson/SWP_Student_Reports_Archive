Title: Effects of JH Analog Methoprene on Weight in Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In our experiment, we tested if adding eights drops of Methoprene to the experimental diet would result in larger Manduca Sexta compared to that of the of our controll group. Methoprene is a Juvenile hormone analog and is also known as an insect growth regulator, which results in hormonal changes in insects. We were inherently testing how Juvenile hormone would play a role in the development and growth of the Manduca Sexta. On daily occurrences, we weighed both our experimental and controll groups to examine the overall changes in weight observed as well as the physical differences in development. We measured the average change in weight for the controll group to be 12.26+/- 0.595 and 11.6+/- 0.578 for the experimental group. We concluded that there was little significent difference between the average changes in weight and therefore our hypothesis was unsupported. Further testing needs to be done to examine the actual concentrations and times needed to kill a Manduca Sexta with a JH mimic such as Methoprene or our experiment provides no significent benefit to society. 

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone that plays a significent role within the development and growth of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar. Specifically, JH regulates the type of molt a Manduca Sexta caterpillar undergoes during its development [Johnson, 2016]. Once JH is reduced during its development, the commitment pulse begins, and the caterpillar begins to pupate. For Manduca Sexta, the commitment pulse is characterized by a signal that lets the caterpillar know that it is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to begin pupating [Johnson, 2016]. Usually, Manduca Sexta have five larval instars or better understood as phases of development. Manduca Sexta need both JH and ecdysterone (20E) hormones to foster their development and metamorphosis. The absolute concentration and ratio of these two hormones in the hemolymph combined with the Manduca Sexta’s development stage determine what effects both hormones will have [Johnson, 2016]. Insect growth regulators or IGRs cause hormonal abnormalities within insects. If Manduca Sexta were exposed to an IGR that influenced JH, then its JH would increase. Theoretically, this would result in the caterpillars hitting their commitment pulse later than naturally expected and developing into a larger adult. Consequently, this larger weight could put the caterpillar at risk of dying due to its potential inability to sustain a larger weight. To further analyze the effects of this, our experiment is designed to compare the weights of two caterpillar groups, one fed with the addition of deionized water, and the other fed with food with an IGR additive. For this experiment, we will be using the IGR precor methoprene which acts as a JH mimic. If eight drops of precor methoprene are added to the caterpillar food, then the caterpillars will increase in weight (g). Within our experiment, we identified the independent variable as the presence of JH in the food and the dependent variable as the weight of each caterpillar. 

Materials and Method:
Two plastic bins were acquired as a housing environment for our eight rather small caterpillars. Each caterpillar was placed in its own quadrant within either the controll or experimental bin and two holes were added to the sides of the bins to allow air flow. Next, each caterpillar was individually weighed, in grams, on the scale and returned to their respective quadrants in the bin. Following this, forty grams of the stock caterpillar food was weighed out on the scale and added, in ten gram increments, to each plastic bin. The food was rolled up into a small ball and each caterpillar was put back in following this procedure. For the experimental group, eight drops of precor methoprene were added to each ten gram food sample and mashed together. This step was repeated for the controll group, however instead of using precor methoprene, eight drops of deionized water were added to the caterpillar food. 

Results:
The independent variable in our experiment was weight of caterpillars as noted previously in the report. We calculated the average changes in weight of both the controll and experimental groups over an eleven day period. For the experimental group, we concluded with 11.6+/- 0.578 (g) and 12.26+/- 0.595 (g) for the controll group. We also used a two-sample t_test which correlates with a one tailed p_value which we calculated to be 0.081381. Finally, we calculated the degrees of freedom to be 6. This measures how many values in our final calculation are susceptible to variation.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that an addition of eight drops of Precor Methoprene, a JH mimic, added to the caterpillar food would result in increased weight of our experimental group compared to the controll group was not supported. We found little significent difference between the calculated and observed weights between both groups, and evidently the controll group ended up producing a larger change in average weight than our experimental group. There are various causes that could explain this result, however the most plausible cause could be that the increase in JH in the experimental diet affected the release of ecdysterone, and their interaction at the fifth instar caused developmental and growth issues. Normal Manduca Sexta exhibit high levels of ecdysterone and lower levels of JH around the fifth instar prior to pupating. The experimental group most likely exhibited smaller levels of ecdysterone prior to normal pupation and failed to achieve the hormonal concentration ratio ample enough to provide for normal development [Johnson, 2016]. By day eleven, around half of our controll group exhibited a visible commitment pulse compared to the experimental group which showed signs of death. By day fourteen, two of our experimental Manduca Sexta had died and both groups showed decreased weight. In comparing these results to a broader spectrum, our data shows the importance of IGRs in an environmental setting with the goal of limiting reproduction amongst the Manduca Sexta. Most of our experimental group had died off my day fourteen and for someone using IGRs, our data is representative of a potential track that could lead to a limited growth rate of the Manduca Sexta. Further testing would need to be done to examine how much Methoprene, JH analog, would be needed to delay the development process long enough to kill of the Manduca Sexta larvae.
