Title: Injected Caffeine Induces Instant Tetany in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Rania pipiens contract their muscles using motor neurons that send signals to their muscles using Acetylcholine. The acetylcholine triggers the release of sodium and action potential. Calcium is then released which induces the contraction of the muscle fibers. Caffeine helps calcium become more easily used, which is why we hypothesized that if we injected .1Ml of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle that the contractile strength of the frog leg muscle would be increased. After hooking up each leg to an electrophysiology recording equipment and jolting the muscle with .5 amps, we found the strength in voltage of the contraction. The first three legs had a contractile strength of .069 volts, .252 volts, and .475 volts respectively before caffeine was injected. After caffeine was injected the strength increased to .492, 1.029, and 1.318 respectively. The p_value was .0348 meaning that the statistics were significent and our hypothesis being supported.

Introduction:
Rania pipiens, or the northern leopard frog has very powerful gastrocnemus muscles in their legs, which helps generate movement through hopping. These muscles are formed by myofibers, which are “innervated by motor neurons.” [Johnson: 2016]. These motor neurons are neurons within the brain right above the spinal cord that branches out into muscles by neuro-muscular junctions. [Johnson: 2016]. At these neuromuscular junctions Acetylcholine is released which opens sodium channels, which in turn generates action potential and calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causing the muscle to contract. [Johnson: 2016]. This is a big reason why Pana pipiens was used in the experiment. The muscle is very developed, which makes studying it easy. Also, the frogs are bred in labs, so the number of frogs we can study is quite numerous, without harming the ecosystem. Caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant that we use in everyday life. A study found that when they injected caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of mice, the contraction of the muscle was 1.5 times stronger than without. [Brust: 1965]. He attributes this to the caffeine increasing the “availability and mobility of calcium.” [Brust: 1965]. This information is useful because they studied the same muscle. The fact that it was in a mouse does not matter because the mechanism for contracting the muscle is the same between the two animals. This happens because caffeine allows the calcium to be more numerous and easier to use. This means more calcium to activate the contractile mechanisms in the muscle fibers, which would cause the muscle contraction to be stronger. Because of this, we hypothesized that if we injected caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle into the Rania pipiens, then the muscle will generate greater tension power than the muscle before it was injected.

Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, three frog legs were dissected so that the gastrocnemus muscle was exposed. The frog legs were then hooked up, one at a time, to an electrophysiology (EP) recording equipment after wetting it with Ringer solution. We read the data with a program called LabScribe. We then found the threshold voltage of each leg to get a baseline of what voltage would cause any contraction at all. Then we set the pulse amplitude to .5 to find the strength in volts of the muscle contraction. Once that was found, we then injected .1Ml of caffeine with a concentration of 200 microMolars  straight into the same muscle and found the strength of the contraction again in volts. We then repeated this experiment on the other two frog legs. We analyzed the data using a one tailed paired t_test.

Results:
The difference between the legs before the injection and after was very apparent. After the muscle was injected with caffeine it was much harder as the muscle contracted as hard as it could reaching full tetany. The threshold voltage was as follows: the first leg was .5 amps, the second leg was .3 amps, and the last was .2 amps. As you can see in Figure 1, the first frog leg had a contractile strength of .069 volts before caffeine was added and a strength of .492 after, which is a difference of .423 volts. The second frog leg had a difference in strength of .777. Finally, the third frog leg went from .475 volts before the injection of caffeine and 1.318 afterwards. The caffeine immediately caused the muscle to contract to the fullest extent it could. The degrees of freedom was 2 and the t-value was 5.222, which left the p_value to be .0348

Discussion:
The data was statistically significent (p&lt;.05) which means that the null hypothesis was rejected. Our hypothesis was supported by the data that we found. The reason that the strength of the volts was so different between of the legs was because the threshold voltage was different. This means that a .5 pulse amplitude to the first leg was going to cause a weaker contraction in comparison to the last leg because the threshold voltage was lower. However, after the injection of caffeine, the legs typically contracted about 3 – 4 times stronger than before the caffeine was administered. These results make sense with what should have been happening biologically. The caffeine should have helped more of the calcium to be used by the muscle fibers more effectively [Brust: 1965], which meant a stronger contraction. The fact that it was immediate must have meant that the caffeine made the muscle fibers use the calcium that was already inside of the muscle, while the gastrocnemus muscle needed a small jolt to make the fibers use the calcium before it was injected. This explains the instant contraction. The tetany comes from the muscle fatiguing from the exertion of the muscle, which is why after it contracted it would not contract any more. The muscle exhausted its resources and could not exert enough to contract anymore. The next place that the experiment should go is that different muscles should be tested to see if they would work the same way. This experiment was important to do because we ingest caffeine all of the time and we also have the gastrocnemus muscle inside of our own legs, so it is important to see how the two interact.
