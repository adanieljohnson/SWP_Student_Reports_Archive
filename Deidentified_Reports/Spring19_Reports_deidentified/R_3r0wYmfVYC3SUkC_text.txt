Title: Testing the Effects of Temperature on Resource Allocation in Pisum sativun Plants

Abstract:
A prominent environmental stressor today is higher temperatures that affect agricultural environments.  This difference in temperature can cause food insecure regions to produce yields that exacerbate food shortages. This experiment aims to generate information on how temperature affects the resource allocation in Pisum sativun. In ecological communities there are two different types of factors that impact plants. Biotic factors are the stimuli that originate from other organisms while abiotic factors such as wind and water and are non-living stimuli that affect an organism. Plants interact with both types of stimuli in the environment in order to be successful in their communities. Based on previous information, it was predicted that the plants in the incubator at warmer temperatures would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the plants in room temperature. After putting 20 different pea plants in the warm and room temperature conditions for two weeks and measuring their root to shoot ratios, it was determined that the opposite occurred, plants that were in room temperature had higher root to shoot ratio than warm temperature plants. 

Introduction:
In ecological communities there are two different types of factors that impact plants. Biotic factors are the stimuli that originate from other organisms while abiotic factors such as wind and water and are non-living stimuli that affect an organism. Plants interact with both types of stimuli in the environment in order to be successful in their communities. However, as essential nutrients are finite in a given environment, plants have to adapt to based on the resources available in their communities in order to survive. 
	Most species have learned to adapt to environmental conditions with resource allocation, which is how an organism distributes and utilized limited resources, in plants, resources are allocated to the stems, roots, or leaves based on their environment and limiting resources, the growth pattern changes over time due to a property known as phenotypic plasticity. This week in lab, the goal was to compare the responses of Pisum sativun (the field pea) to different temperature conditions. 
Based on a background information, we predicted that the field peas in the incubator would have a higher root to shoot ratio while the plants at room temperature would have a smaller root to shoot ratio. However, in the background information by, Weis Engelbert et al., in 1988 the effects of a higher temperature mostly affected a plants ability to perform photosynthesis. So, it could be predicted that plants in higher temperatures nay have to spend more resources to make their stems healthy. In another study, Gulioni L. et al stated that high temperatures can cause in general stunted growth in plants causing the plant to be unsuccessful and able reproduce. Lastly in a study performed by Chen H et al, in 2003, they determined that a heat tolerance can be developed in plants that allow them to adapt and survive in a harsher warmer temperature, these changes can be seen in the leaves of the plants. 



Materials and Method:
	To begin this experiment about eighteen field pea seeds in four containers of vermiculite were planted along with 100Ml of miracle grow. Each container was watered with 100Ml of water. After that, two containers of field peas were put into an incubator at 32ºC and the other two containers were put near a window in the lab classroom to simulate room temperature. The plants were then watered everyday with 100Ml of water for two weeks. After the two weeks, the field pea plants were harvested, and ten room temperature and ten warm temperature plants were measured and weighed to determine their root to shoot ratio. First the stems of the plants were separated from their roots by being cut at the pea junction. Then the roots and shoots were weighed and measured (in cm) separately. The data was recoded and a two tailed two sample statistical test was utilized to determine the significance of the data.

Results:
The results of this experiment were the average root to shoot ratio for the warm temperature and room temperature groups. The averages were then compared using the two tailed two sample t statistical test to compare the means of each group. A table is displayed in figure one that shows the average mean and standard deviation of the average root to shoot ratio for length and weight. Figure 1 displays a bar graph of the results of the average root to shoot ratios for length and weight. 
Based on the two tailed two sample statistical test, there was a significent difference in the weight means for the warm and room temperature groups as the p value was lower than the alpha value of 0.05 (t-value=3.02, degrees of freedom=18, p_value=0.0037). The length means of the warm and room temperature groups were not significently different as the p value was greater than the alpha value 0.05 (t-value=0.302, degrees of freedom=18, p_value=0.383).


Discussion:
During this experiment the goal was to determine how different temperatures (warm temperature and room temperature) affected resource allocation in field pea plants. This comparison was determined by using the root to shoot ratio. Plants with longer, or heavier roots compared to shoots had a higher root to shoot ratio, while plants with shorter and less heavy roots h a smaller ratio. Based on the two tailed two sample t statistical test there was a significent difference between the weight root to shoot ratios of room and warm temperature plants. This was because the room temperature plants had a significently higher root to shoot ratio (R:S=1.089) than the warm temperature plants (R:S=0.889) meaning that the room temperature plants had more weight and resources allocated to their roots while the warm temperature plants allocated more resources and weight to their shoots. The Root to shoot lengths for the room and warm temperature plants were not significently different. These results negated the original hypothesis as the warm temperature plants put more resources into their stems than their roots, while the room temperature plants allocated more resources to their roots than their stems. The opposite was predicted because it was assumed that the incubator would simulate a more of a desert like environment while the room temperature was thought to stimulate a cold environment.
	These results may have occurred because if the warm temperature plants already had the environment for healthy roots, they may have allocated more resources to their stems. For the cool weather plants, more resources could be allocated towards the roots than the stems because the stems were already accounted for. This directly coincides with the background information provided by Chen and Weis, where the higher temperature seemed to cause more resources to be allocated in the stems of the plant.
