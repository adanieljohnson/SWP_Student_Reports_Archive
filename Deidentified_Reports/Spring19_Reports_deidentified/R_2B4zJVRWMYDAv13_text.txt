Title: The examination of the change in Manduca Sexta growth patterns due to the addition of IGR in their diet

Abstract:
This experiment was preformed to study the effects of Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) on the Manduca Sexta.  Our hypothesis was that the Manduca Sexta treated with IGR would be smaller in mass than the controll since they would be larvae for longer and their growth processes would be thrown off leading to potential growth abnormalities.  To test if this we used 6 total larvae 3 for controll and 3 for treatment.  To feed the larvae we used 10 grams of food with 10 drops of liquid (10 of water for the controll and 5 of water and 5 of IGR for the treatment) and we will measure the masses of the larvae to test the effects of the IGR.  The key results from this lab were our p_value of .137 and an insignificent difference in mass of roughly 2 grams between the treatment and controll, where the treatment was larger.   

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta (MS) is an organism that starts as a caterpillar and through many developmental stages, becomes a moth.  It has been seen that Manduca Sexta is a pest in its infantile stages, when it is a caterpillar, but that it out grows its pest-like behavior as a moth [Byron: 2017].  Many hormones go into the development and maturation of a Tobacco Hornworm, the colloquial name of Manduca Sexta [Johnson: 2018].  The two hormones that were highlighted in the supplied prelab handout in the BIO114 Laboratory Manual were Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) [Johnson: 2018].  These hormones work in concert to mature the organism.  For this experiment we are testing the effects of JH on Manduca Sexta growth and its maturation.  We found this particularly important because, if altering the amount of Juvenile Hormone in a MS would prompt it to develop into an adult moth faster, and therefore being a pest for a shorter amount of time – that would be particularly beneficial for many reasons, particularly farmers.  With that said, we posed the question, “If Insect Growth Hormone (IGR) is used, the particular IGR we used altered the JH levels in MS to inhibit or regulate growth, in our MS’s food will it inhibit their growth and make them comparatively smaller than the controll?”  From this we derived our Hypothesis which stated that we expected our MS treated with IGR to weigh less than our controll with normal food because the MS will be infantile for too long and its natural development will be disturbed.  If this is the case than abnormal defects could be expected, specifically with the commitment pulse being mistimed, and the caterpillars’ transition into pupa [Johnson: 2018].  Our independent variable is the amount of IGR added to the caterpillar’s food and the dependent variable is the specimen’s respective mass.

Materials and Method:
In order to accurately test the effect of IGR in a Manduca Sexta’s diet on their growth we selected six total caterpillars and split them into groups of three.  They are broken into a controll group and a treatment group.  To keep as many variables constant as possible we put two airholes in each cell, gave each caterpillar 10 grams of food, with 10 drops of liquid (10 of water for the controll and 5 of water and 5 of IGR to the treatment), and both groups are kept in an incubator.  The caterpillars are fed every 2 to 3 days and massed every or every other day.  In order for us to come to a conclusion on our experiment we will need to deduce the overall weight change over the 2-week period, to determine IGR’s affects.

Results:
At the conclusion of our lab, our data turned out as shown in Fig 1.  The treatment out grew the controll by almost two grams on average.  The standard deviations for the respective groups were 0.99931 for the controll, and 2.100246 for the treatment.  With that said, our p_value is .137 and since it is greater than the 5 percent confidence interval, the difference in our data is not significent and we accept the null hypothesis.

Discussion:
After seeing out our experiment with the Manduca Sexta for just over 2 weeks, it became glaringly evident that our hypothesis was incorrect.  To restate, our hypothesis stated that we expected the IGR to cause the Treatment to be smaller than the controll due to possibly developmental issues due to throwing off the natural life cycle of the Manduca Sexta.  After collecting our data, we calculated a p_value of .137 which prompts us to accept the null hypothesis which is that the IGR had no significent effect on the growth of the MS.  This comes as no surprise because Manduca Sexta larvae entering their 5th interstellar stage, before pupation, becoming quite large reaching around 10-12 grams [Kanost: 2016] [Johnson: 2018].  Using Kanost’s numbers it is clear that although it seemed that our treatment group were abnormally large, they simply fell near the top end of the expected range, while our controlls fell on the bottom end of that range.  The disparity of mass can be attributed to the treatment larvae getting a longer period to grow before entering pupation.  Around day 9 of our experiment the two groups branched off, the treatment continued to grow while the controll lost weight and prepared to enter pupation.  In addition to the mass of the treatment, they were also longer than the controll, with barely any room left in their habitat by the end of our two-week period.  However, neither growth statistic, as stated about – was not significent.  Some errors that occurred throughout the experiment were our time management as a group, and a miscalculation of the size of our starting larvae.  Since we did not feed and weigh our larvae every day, we could have missed out on valuable data due to missing potential peaks in growth, and also because our larvae were not getting fresh food regularly which may have affected their growth patterns.  Additionally, at the beginning of our experiment, we chose larvae of all different masses, and potentially different stages of growth.  Although their mass values were not very far off from one another they ranged from 1.48 grams to .78 grams, which for such a small organism it can lead to statistical errors.  Our study shows that although chemically and genetically altering organisms can be beneficial, especially in the case of pests such as the Manduca Sexta, preliminary studies must be done to see how each compound effects each organism [Kanost: 2016].  For example, in our study we expected the opposite of what occurred, so to avoid any issues on a larger scale, an experiment like ours should be done first to properly alter organisms for their intended purposes.
