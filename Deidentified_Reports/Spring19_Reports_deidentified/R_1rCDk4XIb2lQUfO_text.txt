Title: An increase in aggression between betta splendins without exposure to bright pigmentation and betta splendins with exposure to bright pigmentation

Abstract:
Wild and captive-bred betta splendins use colorful and aggressive displays in the presence of other members of its own species to defend territory boundaries and to defend resources that are critical for survival and reproduction. A manipulation in the environment of the Bettas would lead to a different coloration perceived by the opposing Betta, affecting the aggressive behaviors being shown. It was hypothesized that if a bright dye is introduced into the environment, then Bettas will display an increased amount of aggressive behavior. Four individual Betta fish were observed displaying aggressive behavior with and without dye. The Betta fish without dye presented lower amounts of aggressive behaviors while those exposed to dye had a higher amount of aggressive behaviors yet, the results were not significent (paired t_test: 0.798, p_value: 0.483, critical value: 0.05). It was concluded that the behavior displayed in this study was influenced by how the Betta’s own skin color interacted with the colored dye. In the future, one should controll for the pigmentation of the fish and dye. This would be interesting to study as artificial selection for male Bettas have led them to be more aggressive and could be potentially influencing females when selecting for mates. 

Introduction:
In this study, we aim to understand how aggressive behaviors in Betta fish, or betta splendins, have evolved and been affected by selective, artificial breeding.  At rest, wild males are inconspicuous, dull grayish brown or green fish that are accompanied by shorter fins [Todd: 2008]. When they are in the presence of another male, they flare their gills and fins and intensify their coloration during this agnostic interaction [Lynn: 2007].  The wild, males with this bright coloration, larger sizes, longer fins, and higher levels of aggression are commonly selected for in aquariums and pet stores [Todd: 2008]. Wild and captive-bred betta splendins use these colorful and aggressive displays in the presence of other members of its own species to defend territory boundaries and to defend exclusive access to resources that are critical for survival and reproduction [Lynn: 2007]. In the wild, Bettas live in sluggish or muddy waters that are dull in color and make the bright displays stand out, alerting other males of their presence. How would a manipulation of the colors displayed in a Betta’s environment affect its agnostic behavior? A manipulation in the environment of the Bettas would lead to a different coloration perceived by the opposing Betta, affecting the aggressive behaviors being shown. It is important to explore Betta’s behaviors as captive-bred Bettas are selected to display more desirable traits for humans, leading to more aggressive traits and altering their behavior. It was hypothesized that if a bright dye is introduced into the Betta’s environment, then the Betta fish will display an increased amount of aggressive behavior.


Materials and Method:
Four individual Betta fish were used in separate containers with removable opaque and clear dividers. The clear dividers were never removed. We labeled the fish F1, F2, F3, and F4 to keep track of their agnostic behaviors. The agnostic behaviors that were recorded included: pelvic fin flickering, tail flashing, tail beating, erect dorsal/anal fin, spreading gill cover, and protruding branchiostegal membrane. We began removing the opaque cover between F1 and F2 as well as removing the opaque cover between F3 to F4 for five minutes. Two members recorded all aggressive behaviors seen during those five minutes and answers were compared to have higher reliability. The opaque divider was put back into place after the five minutes and the Betta fish rested for another five minutes. After this five-minute break, six drops of red food dye were introduced into the Betta fish’s environment. The opaque dividers were removed once more between F1 and F2 as well as between F3 and F4. Aggressive behaviors were recorded once more by two individual members and compared. The data was analyzed by calculating and graphing the average amount of behaviors before and after dye exposure. A one-tailed paired t_test was also calculated to analyze the significance of the data which was determined by a critical value of 0.05.


Results:
Shown by Figure 1, there is an observable difference between the average amount of aggressive behaviors displayed before and after dye exposure. When the Betta fish were not exposed to dye, they presented lower amounts of aggressive behaviors with an average of 17.50±6.56 while the Betta fish exposed to dye had a higher amount of aggressive behaviors with an average of 27±29.34. Although there is a clear difference between both averages, the data was not statistically significent (paired t_test: 0.798, p_value: 0.483, critical value: 0.05).


Discussion:
As Figure 1 shows, there was a greater amount of aggressive behavior after red dye exposure. Despite this trend, which supports our hypothesis, the results were not statistically significent enough to provide substantial support. The trend could have been easily affected by the Betta fish’s own color and how it blended in with the red dye. F1 had a red coloration, F2 had a light-yellow coloration and both F3 and F4 had blue and black coloration. The darker blue and black fish (F3 and F4) displayed a much lower average amount of aggressive behaviors in general and after exposure to dye. The red fish and light-yellow fish (F1 and F2) displayed much more aggressive behavior in general as well as after exposure to the red dye. When aggressive, Betta fish also produce a color flash in which their pigmentation appears brighter than its original color to accompany other aggressive behaviors [Todd: 2008]. On the other hand, non-aggressive behaviors involve color loss as the Betta’s pigment is reduced to a grey or stripped coloration, as well as evasion [Todd 2008]. This non-aggressive behavior is often seen in fish that are less aggressive after interacting with another fish who has responded with aggressive behavior [Todd: 2008]. It was concluded that the behavior displayed in this study was influenced by how the Betta’s own skin color interacted with the red dye. Since the black and blue fish had a much darker coloration, they reacted in a more passive manner while the red and light-yellow fish, which displayed a much brighter coloration and were capable of flashing more brightly, reacted in a more aggressive manner. Additionally, the darker blue and black fish appeared even darker when exposed to red dye while the coloration of the red and light-yellow fish both appeared much brighter. In the future, the significance of such a study would be heightened by controllling for the exact colors of the fish and analyzing how their natural pigmentation would be affected by the specific color dye that is used. This would be an interesting topic to continue to study as artificial selection for traits that make Betta fish brighter, larger in size, and have longer fins has led to the creation of more aggressive male fish that could be influencing female selection [Todd: 2008]. A separate study has found females to prefer the winners when observing contests between two wild males [Jaroensutaisinee: 2001]. It would be noteworthy to observe how well these exaggerated domestic Bettas fare against wild Bettas as domesticated strains are significently more aggressive than their wild counterparts, and determine whether females prefer this heightened aggressiveness [Verbeek: 2006].
