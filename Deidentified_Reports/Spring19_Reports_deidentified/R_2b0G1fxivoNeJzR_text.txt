Title: Effects of Space on Aggressive Behaviors of Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta Splendins display aggressive behaviors when encountering members of their own species. Territorial status and space availability play important roles in Betta’s aggressiveness. In our experiment, we tested the effects of space on the aggressiveness of Bettas by comparing Betta fish’s behaviors encountering in a small tank or a large tank. A paired t_test was used to compare the four Betta fish in the two groups and the results led to a conclusion that there’s no significent difference between the aggressiveness of Betta fish when they encounter in small and large tanks. 

Introduction:
Intraspecific behavior is the behavior that a certain animal presents when other members of their own species are in presence. Betta Splendins, also known as Siamese fight fish, have colorful displays in the presence of other Betta fish. Intraspecific agnostic behaviors of bettas include two main types of movements: broadside movements when a fish turns its side toward an opponent and facing movements when a fish turns its side opposite to the opponent. For broadside movements, the behaviors in increasing order of aggressiveness are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing; while for facing movements, the typical behaviors in increasing order of aggressiveness are pectoral fins erect, spreading gill covers, and red “mane”. [Johnson: 2018]

For Betta fish, the presence of a nest is likely to indicate territorial status and could alter aggressive motivation in male Betta [Bronstein: 1982]. Often the dynamics of aggressive contests change considerably with the value of the contested resource or with asymmetries in ownership, whether the differences are actual or perceived [Austad: 1983]. Since space difference is considered as a territorial resource, we decided to test the aggressiveness of Bettas when two males encounter in smaller space or larger space. Our hypothesis is that male Bettas will be more aggressive when encountering in a smaller space. 


Materials and Method:
We first got four bettas, each two in a small tank, and isolated the two fish in each tank with white plastic divider for 5 minutes. For the controll group, we removed the white plastic divider for both groups, allowed the two bettas to be together in the small tank, and recorded their aggressive behaviors for five minutes. For the experimental group, we put the two bettas together in the big tank and recorded their aggressive behaviors for 5 minutes for each group. Between every two experiments, we isolated the two fish for at least 5 minutes. We scored the behaviors in the following ways: for broadside movements, let “pelvic fin flickering” have a score of 1, ”tail beating” has a score of 2, and “tail flashing” has a score of 3; while for facing movements, pectoral fins erect, we let spreading gill covers, and red “mane” has score 1,2, and 3 respectively. We added the total time in minutes for each behavior and used the total time to divide 10 and then times their different level scores. After data collection, we used paired t_test to compare the data we got. 

Results:
In the first group, the big orange Betta fish tend to has higher aggressive scores than the blue one with half of the five minutes doing pelvic fin flickering in the small tank, but both of the fish only did around 10 seconds of pectoral fin erect in the big tank; while in the second group, the big red Betta fish tend to be more aggressive with 1 min of red “mane” in small tank but only five seconds of red “mane” in large tank. From Figure 1, we could notice that for all four fish in our experiment, they tend to rank higher scores when they are in smaller tank than in bigger tank. By using paired t_test, our data was not significent with Bettas in small and large tanks (t=2.24, Df=3, p=0.11).		

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis that male Bettas will be more aggressive when encountering in a smaller space than larger space. Since individuals of the same species, sex and size may be present different behavior traits in a consistent manner across time, each of they may represent different personalities: either persistent or sporadic[Matessi: 2010]. In our first experimental group, one of the fishes would always escape from the other, and later even the fighter would be tired of starting a fight. However, in Bronstein’s experiment, with nests as an indicator of territory, when both males in pair have nests, there’s a reduction in aggression [Bronstein: 1982]. In our case, if the tank is larger, each of the Bettas might have more territory resource, and they might be less aggressive to other Bettas. However, since our Betta fish used to live in the small tank, and when we moved it to the big tank, we should wait for a period of time for them to acclimate to the new tank rather than record the observations immediately. So, for future experiment, we might put fish to different tanks rather than the tank they’ve lived in to record data. Also, more groups of experiments should be done. In conclusion, male Bettas will not display more aggressive behaviors when encountering in a smaller space than larger space.
