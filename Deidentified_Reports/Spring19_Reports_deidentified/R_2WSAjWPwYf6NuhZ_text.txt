Title: Herbicides effect Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts activity 

Abstract:
Herbicides are used to control weeds in crop plants, but many types also effect the crops themselves. The purpose of this experiment was to determine which of several common types of herbicide would least effect spinach, a common plant crop. Spectricide, Atrazine, and RoundUp were used. The results showed that while control chloroplasts did the best, spectracide was the herbicide that least effected the spinach. Spectracide might be a suitable herbicide to use with spinach. 

Introduction:
Many types of herbicides are used in agriculture to control pest plants, which compete with target crops for light and other resources. In traditional monoculture agriculture, these weed plants are sprayed with herbicides to kill them, but the chemicals used often negatively affect the crops. Several solutions to this problem are used, including herbicides that only affect the leaves of the plant. These are sprayed before planting to kill weeds, but then do not affect the crops once planted. But weeds can grow after planting, and this means that there is high demand for selective herbicides that kill only weed plants. 
The purpose of this experiment is to test several common herbicides on a typical crop plant: spinach (Spinacia oleracea). In this experiment we will test spectricide (active ingredient Lambda-cyhalothrin), atrazine, and RoundUp® (active ingredient Glyphosate), mixing them with chloroplasts taken from spinach leaves. My hypothesis is that RoundUp will most affect the chloroplasts, as it is marketed as a chemical that only affects leaves. In addition, I think atrazine will also have a strong effect on spinach, as previous tests have suggested [Ventrella: 2010].



Materials and Methods:
15 test tubes were acquired. 5 Spinach leaves were added to a mortar and pestle after removing their central veins, and 10ml of 400 mM, pH 8.0 sucrose in Tricine buffer was added. The leaves were crushed in the mortar and pestle to extract the chloroplasts, and after adding 10 additional ml of grinding buffer, the mixture was strained with cheesecloth into a beaker. This mixture was spun in a centrifuge for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm, and after removing excess liquid, was spun again for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm. After removing the excess liquid and then resuspending with 20 ml of grinding buffer, the mixture was stored. 100 μl was added to each test tube, save for the blank tube, and then the tubes were mixed with their respective herbicides; 3 for each type, as well as 3 control tubes. Each tube was left in sunlight for 10 minutes before reading absorbance with a spectrophotometer. They were then left in sunlight 10 more minutes, and read again with the spectrophotometer. This process was repeated once more, giving data for 10, 20, and 30 minutes. 
An ANOVA test was used to measure significance. 


Results:
In order to test effect on activity, the percent change of absorbance was found. This is because some samples started with high absorbance simply due to natural color. Ultimately, the control sample performed the best, which was expected. The herbicide that least effected the spinach was Spectracide.
P= 0.001102

Discussion:
Spectracide did not affect the chloroplast activity as much as the other herbicides, so as long as it effectively killed the weed plants, it might serve as a selective herbicide for spinach crops. Note that it still fell far behind the untreated control group, so this would drastically effect crop yield. Use of this chemical would depend on how much the weeds were affecting the untreated crop. The expected winner, atrazine, appeared to have a very negative effect on the chloroplast activity. Note that absorbance read very high from the beginning, because atrazine was very opaque, but that this did not change throughout the experiment. The high absorbance was not due to the chloroplast activity but simply a result of the murky coloration of atrazine. This may have even hindered the chloroplasts by physically blocking light, further increasing its effectiveness. Atrazine is known to be extremely effective against spinach [Ventrella:2010], so this effect was not surprising.
