Title: Effects of Lidocaine on Sciatic Nerve

Abstract:
The motor neuron, the sciatic nerve of the lower leg communicates with the gastrocnemius, or calf muscle through neuromuscular junctions as every other motor neuron connects with its respective muscle fiber in the body. Stimulation of this nerve would cause a contraction of the gastrocnemius due to an action potential stimulating voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels which causes a cascading effect that eventually ends in muscle contraction. In this experiment we used frog legs that we dissected in order to make direct contact with the sciatic nerve. We then stimulated the nerve using an electrically stimulating apparatus before and after we bathed the nerve in lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, solution. There was a significant difference in the voltage of the action potential between the groups not treated with lidocaine and those that had been treated showing a p-value of .04286.

Introduction:
At neuromuscular junctions, a motor neuron branches out to give it the ability to communicate with many receptors of the muscle fiber. Once an action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, or ACh, is released into the motor end plate of the receiving muscle cell. [Johnson:2018] This then begins a cascade of events which involve activating Na+ channels, the release of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which in turn allows actin and myosin to bind and the muscle then contracts. Lidocaine is a drug that is used as a local anesthetic. [Lin: 2016] This is a proficient use of lidocaine because it is an Na+ channel blocker. This means that lidocaine would inhibit some sodium channels on the motor end plate of the muscle fiber from opening in response to an action potential sent from the motor neuron. This, in response would result in a shorter, or less intense contraction of the muscle. It is hypothesized that if the sciatic nerve, which connects to the gastrocnemius leg muscle, or the calf muscle, is doused with lidocaine, then the resulting contraction of the gastrocnemius will be less severe once the nerve itself is electrically stimulated. 

Materials and Methods:
We used three frog legs to run our experiment and each one served as its own individual trial. We kept the frog legs wet by squirting Ringerâ€™s solution on them every couple of minutes in order to ensure they would be as receptive to the action potential as possible during the control run. We used the same voltage for each trial and recorded the results for both the pre-lidocaine runs and the post-lidocaine runs. For the post-lidocaine trials, we doused the nerve with about two to three drops of lidocaine before attaching the stimulating apparatus and sending volts through the nerve. Since each leg was its own run, a statistical paired t-test was used to better evaluate a difference in a before and after experiment. 

Results:
The voltage reading after stimulation for the pre-lidocaine treatment averaged .866 mV. The average reading for the post-lidocaine was about .485 mV. The difference between these two was found to be statistically significantly different with a p-value of .04286 and a standard deviation of about .3944 for the pre-lidocaine and .3872 for the post-lidocaine. (Figure 1.)

Discussion:
A statistically significant difference was observed in the voltage before and after the sciatic nerve of a frog leg was treated with lidocaine; therefore, it can be resolved that the lidocaine did in fact inhibit some of the sodium channels, reducing the severity of the muscle contraction. This in turn means that the alternative hypothesis was accepted, and the null hypothesis was rejected. Although the p-value was under .05, it was very close to that alpha value. This could bring to question what would happen if a more concentrated lidocaine solution was used or what effect this concentration of lidocaine would have on the sciatic and gastrocnemius of a much larger animal that probably have many more neuromuscular junctions than that of a frog leg. This could help advance the knowledge in the usage of local anesthetics in veterinary surgery procedures.
