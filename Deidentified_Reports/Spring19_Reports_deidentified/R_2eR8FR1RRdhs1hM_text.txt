Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone-Mimicking Insect Growth Regulator on Manduca sexta Pupation

Abstract:
In this experiment, the Manduca sexta was used to test the effects of juvenile hormone (JH) on pupation. Typically, JH levels need to be low for pupation to start. It was hypothesized that if M. sexta caterpillars are exposed to JH-mimicking IGR, they will mature faster, but then never pupate. 6 caterpillars were used. 3 were control, and the other 3 were treated with a substance that mimics JH. Their weights were recorded each week day. Our data was summarized by taking the average change in weight per each group. The treatment larvae did grow faster (on day 2, treatment #1 was 2.77g, while control #1 was 2.05g), but the control ended with heavier final weights. No larva pupated in this amount of time; the null hypothesis could not be rejected. With a p-value of 0.366165 (t-test comparing the groups’ average change in weight), we can conclude that our results were not statistically significant. We can assume from preliminary studies’ results on similar experiments that if the experiment continued, we would get more significant results. This would allow us to bring our study of JH to the world of pest control, sharing its potential benefiting effect of maintaining larval stages. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a moth in the Order Lepidoptera that aids in the studies of pest control and hormone regulation [Johnson: 2018]. Preliminary studies have shown how the larvae and their growth can be manipulated by “insect growth regulators” (IGRs) that mimic certain hormones naturally present in the tissue of Manduca sexta [Nijhout: 1974]. Finding that hormone-mimicking IGRs do in fact inhibit or increase growth of the Manduca sexta can be taken to the field of pest control, showing which hormones to treat insects that are pests either in adulthood or as larvae. The hormone of focus in this present experiment is the juvenile hormone (JH) and its effect on the Manduca sexta. JH regulates when larvae begin to pupate and go through metamorphosis into an adult moth [Nijhout; 1974]. JH levels are high in the larval stage, and then decline right before the larva begins to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. This leads us to wonder, what happens when larva are continuously exposed to an IGR that mimics JH? It is expected that exposure to a JH-mimicking IGR prolongs the larval stage. Interestingly, preliminary studies show that JH-mimicking IGR can aid larval growth at first, but then growth quickly levels off [Johnson: 2018]. The fast, initial growth is due to the fact that JH levels remain relatively high during the first 4 larval instars; after this, JH naturally should drop, and the larva should begin to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. But with continued IGR treatment, a larva should never begin to pupate, as it has effects identical to a constant high level of JH. Therefore, we hypothesize that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to JH-mimicking IGR, it will make them mature faster, but then hinder them from pupating. 

Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, we used a total of 6 Manduca sexta caterpillars. We chose them to have around the same starting weight (an average of 0.903 grams). We divided the caterpillars into treatment and control groups, 3 caterpillars in each. The two groups were placed in two separate plastic shelters, and each individual caterpillar had one separate box with exactly two holes punched through the plastic for their respiration. All 6 caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food consisting of their typical nutrient-rich diet. The control caterpillars received 5 drops of water in their food, and the treatment caterpillars received 5 drops of JH-mimicking IGR in their food. Every week day, we measured our caterpillars’ weights and recorded them in a table. We carried out this experiment for two weeks. 
The statistical test used was a two-sample t-test, comparing the amount of growth of the treatment caterpillars to the amount of growth of the control caterpillars. This t-test donned a p-value that was used to determine the statistical significance of our results. Our data was summarized by calculating the difference between each caterpillars’ final weight and start weight – one numeric value for each caterpillar, three numeric values for each group. We then calculated the average change in weight per group and the standard deviation of each. The averages and standard deviations were presented in a graph. 


Results:
For our experiment, the one-tailed p-value was 0.366165. We found that on average, the treatment caterpillars grew very fast, and then their weights tapered off and had no additional growth. For example, Treatment Caterpillar 1 reached 10.9 grams after three measuring days but never surpassed this weight. Furthermore, Treatment Caterpillar 1 was 2.77 grams on day two, compared to Control Caterpillar 1’s weight of 2.05 grams. On the other hand, the control caterpillars grew and continued to grow; they ended up heavier than our treatment caterpillars. Control Caterpillar 1 and Control Caterpillar 3 achieved weights of 14.98 grams and 13.88 grams, respectively, where only Treatment Caterpillar 2 achieved a weight of 14.02 grams. However, there was one control caterpillar who served as an outlier, beginning at around the same weight as the others, but barely grew. Compared to its heavy counterparts, Control Caterpillar 2 ended at a weight of 3.01 grams. Its outlying effect is shown with the large error bars (standard deviation of 6.51) on the control bar (Fig 1). The outlier is also why the treatment’s average growth (11.14 grams) was higher than the control’s (9.72 grams), even though the control group turned out heavier overall (Fig 1). 

Discussion:
Based on our results, our hypothesis was not supported. The JH-mimicking IGR seemed to aid the caterpillars’ growth at the beginning and hinder their growth at the end, but not significantly enough to prove that JH was the cause of this growth pattern. Our p-value determined that our results are not statistically significant, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Our p-value also describes that our results of the treatment caterpillars having quicker initial growth and slower final growth could have occurred by chance and not directly because of the IGR treatment. Our results were also ultimately inconclusive, due to the fact that no caterpillars pupated out of any group. However, we can assume that the IGR would have continued to keep the caterpillars in their present larval state and inhibit pupation. 
This assumption could be proven with a follow-up experiment, one that tests the same hypothesis, uses the same methods, but is just carried out for a period longer than two weeks. It is possible that if the experiment was just one week longer, we would see the control pupate and the treatment stay behind in the larval state. This could potentially be a very conclusive experiment yielding strong evidence of how and when JH-mimicking IGR should be given to Manduca sexta or other Order Lepidoptera insects in order to keep them at one larval stage.
Other studies have in fact shown that the 5th instar larval stage can be prolonged by JH-mimicking IGR [Nijhout: 1974]. Final instar larvae given JH-mimicking IGR before the time they would have pupated were unable to do so, proving that it does inhibit the Manduca sexta from reaching adulthood [Nijhout: 1974]. This information can be taken out into the fields of pest control; treating insects similar to the Manduca sexta or others in the Order Lepidoptera with JH in their final larval stage will prevent them from becoming pests as adults. It can also be used to prove that generally, treating insects with naturally-present hormones, but at unnatural amounts and growth stages, can in fact keep them young or speed them into adulthood.
