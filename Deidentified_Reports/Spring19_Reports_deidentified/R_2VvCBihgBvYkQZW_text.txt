Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone and Temperature on the Length and Weight of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta is a caterpillar that goes through stages of development to pupate and turn into an adult moth. This caterpillar has two main types of hormones for metamorphosis, Juvenile Hormones and Ecdysterone. In this experiment, we raised eight caterpillars. We fed two of these caterpillars’ IGR, two of these caterpillars Precor, and four of these caterpillars no hormone. We wanted to see the effect that these hormones had on the development and growth of the Manduca Sexta. We also changed the environment of the caterpillars halfway through the experiment to observe the effect of temperature on the growth of the caterpillars. Overall, we concluded that the control caterpillars we able grow the most, and the Precor caterpillars had their growth stunted the most. We observed that the heat did not play a huge role in this experiment. However, our only statistically significant data that we can conclude is that the length and weight of the Precor caterpillars were significantly smaller than the control caterpillars. Therefore, Precor plays a role stunting the growth of the Manduca Sexta. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we observed a certain type of caterpillar, named the “Manduca Sexta.” Our question we were trying to answer is, how does the JH Hormone Precor and IGR effect the length and weight of the “Manduca Sexta?” We also wanted to answer, how does the JH Hormone Precor and IGR effect the length and weight of the “Manduca Sexta” in a 30 degree Celsius incubator? The two main types of hormones in the Manduca Sexta metamorphosis are the Juvenile Hormone and the Ecdysterone. This certain caterpillar has 4 main stages of development, egg, larva, the pupa, and the adult moth. The Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting and the Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molting, (Johnson 2018). JH hormones are present during larval life to allow the larva to grow, but also to help progression from one larval stage to the next. Once the larva gets to a certain size, it is ready for metamorphosis. (Riddiford, Hiruma, Zhou, Nelson, 2003).  JH hormones also regulates multiple functions in adult Manduca Sexta. (Johnson, 2018). We used two types of JH hormones in our experiment, IGR and Precor. Both of these hormones were used to inhibit the development of insects. This will prevent the Manduca Sexta from reaching a pupa phase.  We hypothesis if we feed the caterpillars IGR and Precor in a room temperature incubator, their growth will be inhibited. We also hypothesis that if we feed the caterpillar IGR and Precor in a 30 degree Celsius incubator, the growth of the Manduca Sexta will be inhibited worse than in the room temperature incubator. 

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we needed 2, 4-cell containers for Manduca homes, 2 lids, a sharpie,  a “hole” tool, food, spoon, container to mix food in, balance to weigh food and caterpillars, transfer pipets, and Precor and IGR. Our procedure was as followed. We first gathered our materials, starting with 2, 4-cell containers for the Manduca homes. We punctured two holes in each cell to gives our caterpillars air. We then labeled each cell with the type of food that was in each. Two of our cells were labeled “IGR,” two of our cells were labeled “Precor,” and 4 of our cells were labeled “Control.” We then measured 10g of food for each of our Manduca Sextas. In our square container, we added 7-10 drops of water with a transfer piper to four separate 10g foods. We mixed these very well and placed them in the cells labeled control. We then added 7 drops of Precor to two 10g of food with a transfer pipet, mixed well, then placed them in the cells labeled Precor. Lastly, we added 7 drops of IGR to two 10g food with a transfer pipet, mixed well, then placed them in the cells labeled IGR. We made sure to leave the food in a clump, so it did not dry out. We placed a caterpillar in each cell and continued to check their food and measure them every day for one week. After one week of leaving our caterpillars in a room temperature incubator, we then moved them to an incubator of about 30 degree Celsius, and then continued to check their food and measure them every day for another week. We measured the weight and length. After collecting the data, we took the difference between week from week of weight and length to observe and graph the difference to analyze the effect of the JH Hormone and heat. We graphed the length and weight in a bar graph for each week. We then used a two sample T test to compare the data week to week. We did this to see if our data from Week 1 to Week 2 was significant, then to see if our data from Week 2 to Week 3 was significant. 

Results:
Statistics:  P Value for Control and IGR Week 1 Weight: .073859  P Value for Control and Precor Week 1 Weight: .002478 (statistically significant) P Value for Control and IGR Week 1 Length: .380506 P Value for Control and IGR Week 1 Length: .037841 (statistically significant)  P Value for Control and IGR Week 2 Weight: .666445 P Value for Control and Precor Week 2 Weight: .465689 P Value for Control and IGR Week 2 Length: .471266 P Value for Control and Precor Week 2 Length: .813477  
Our results for week one to week two, when the caterpillars were in room temperature, overall grew. Graph 1, 2, 3, and 4 all show the difference in week one and week two in IGR and Precor. In all of these graphs, the control bar was higher than the experimental bar. This shows that the control caterpillars were larger. Graph 2 and 4 compare Precor and Control, showing precor is significantly smaller than the control bar. In graph 6, this shows that that Precor caterpillar were much smaller than the control caterpillar after observing the bars. The control caterpillars, on average, grew more than the Precor and IGR caterpillar. From week one to week two, the mean control growth difference in weight was 10.32g, the mean Precor weight was 4.54g, and the mean IGR weight was 8.4g. This shows that the control group was much larger than the Precor and IGR caterpillars. This also shows that the IGR Caterpillars grew more than the Precor caterpillars in this week. Only the control and Precor and control weight difference and the control and IGR length difference were statistically significant.  Our results for week two to week three, when the caterpillars were in were in 30-degree Celsius environment, overall shrunk and died on average. The control caterpillars, on average, still grew more than the IGR and Precor caterpillars, despite some outliers. The average control weight difference was 1.96, the average IGR weight difference was .98, and the average precor was -1.26. The Precor caterpillars all shrunk in size, only one IGR caterpillar shrunk in size, and two control caterpillars shrunk while two control caterpillars grew.  By the final day, two control caterpillars died, one IGR caterpillar died, and both Precor caterpillars died. That left us with two control caterpillars alive, one IGR caterpillar alive, and no Precor caterpillars alive.


Discussion:
From our results from week one to week two, we can see that our control group Manduca Sexta caterpillars weighed the most and the Manduca Sextas who ate the precor food grew the least. It is evident that the Precor and IGR hormones were blockers for the development of the Manduca Sexta, supporting our originally hypothesis. We can conclude this due to the fact that the caterpillars who ate the hormones grew less, by a little more than half with the IGR experimental group and less than half in the Precor experimental group. Compared to data from week one to week two, week two to week three caterpillars did worse, while control and precor caterpillars shrunk. Although the data may infer that heat played a negative role, it did not play a statistically significant role. In a similar experiment, it was concluded that temperatures between 14 degrees Celsius and 26 degrees Celsius was when the growth and consumption of the caterpillars increased drastically. The maximum value of growth and consumption was around 34 degrees Celsius, and then after 38 degrees Celsius the growth and consumption of the caterpillars rapidly declined. Kingsolver, Woods, 1997). Therefore, our results should’ve shown that once we put the caterpillars in the 30-32-degree Celsius environment, our caterpillars should’ve shown improvement. This is why I believe that the heat didn’t play a huge role in the growth of our caterpillars, and the hormones that we fed the caterpillars were the cause of the shrinking. I also infer that our control caterpillars shrunk and died due to the fact that when we placed the caterpillars in the heat, they were no longer in an environment of controlled light, which put them at a disadvantage. Therefore, we are unable to conclude much from the impact of heat on our caterpillar’s growth, because our data was not statistically significant, and the hormones could’ve impacted the growth long term by the time they were put in heat. In an article by (Tuxan, Uygun, 2003) they concluded that insecticides with IGRs, like the ones used in this experiment, inhibit specific biochemical pathways. They also stated that some insects may die from this exposure because it causes “abnormal regulation of hormone-mediated cell or organ development.” (Tunax, Uygun, 2003). This could be a reason why three of our experimental caterpillars died by the last day of the experiment and never pupated, because they were not functioning properly due to the hormones we were feeding them. However, this still does not explain why two of our control caterpillars died, which leads us to believe this is the cause of confounding variables, such as being in an uncontrolled environment.   All in all, most of our data is not statistically significant, which does not allow us to conclude anything. However, from observing the trends in our caterpillar’s growth and development, it is evident that the Juvenile Hormones that we fed the Manduca Sexta stunted the growth, and the heat did not play a huge role. The only conclusion we are able to conclude with statistically evident is that Precor stunted the length and weight compared to the control from week 1 to week 2.
