Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone Mimic on Manduca Sexta Larvae’s Life Cycle Abstract

Abstract:
Hormones play very important roles in controllling the pace of the insect growth cycle. In this experiment, we use IGR to mimic the effect of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca Sexta to explore how the caterpillar’s development is going to change in response to increased hormone level. We make a two-tailed hypothesis that “if we add IGR hormone to the M.Sexta caterpillar diet, the caterpillars’ growth will be affected”. Our not statistically significent data failed to support the hypothesis while the growth is definitely altered the normal growth of M.Sexta larvae through direct observation.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluated the effect of JH hormone on the growth of M.Sexta Larvae to study the endocrine controll of insects life.   We are trying to answer the question “How does the JH Hormone mimic – IGR affects M.Sexta larvae’s gowth?” with the two-tailed hypothesis: if we add IGR hormone to the M.Sexta caterpillars’ food, their growth will be affected.
To fully understand this experiment, some background information must be illustrated. Hormones act as chemical messengers that controll insects’ physiology. In the case of M.Sexta, juvenile hormone and Ecdysteroids are crucial for a successful metamorphosis. To pupate and transform into moths, the eclosion called “commitment pulse” is momentous eclosion. It is produced when the signals reaching the indicate that the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate and form a normal size moth [Johnson: 2018]. At the same time, a large amount of Ecdysteroids is released triggered by PTTH. While this is the natural process of hormone change, we can always alter the pace of insect development using insect hormone regulators (IGR). In reality, IGGR can be used to replace toxic pesticides in agriculture. Because IGR only affects insect development but does not target human or any other mammals. It is significent to study the effect of IGRs because they offer a more sustainable approach to pest regulation.


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we started out by preparing all the necessary equipment and choosing the M. Sexta caterpillars. We selected 6 caterpillars roughly in the same size and divided them into experimental and controll groups. These two groups are placed in separate boxes and each individual is isolated in one unit. After that, we prepared the food for the M.Sexta caterpillars. We measured 60g of caterpillar food using weight and separated it into six portions (each one had 10g in it) and then crushed the food into smaller pieces for mixing. Next, we added 5 drops of distilled water into the caterpillar food for the controll group and 5 drops of 1/1250 IGR solution into that for the experimental group using different pipets. After that, we stuck the food into each unit, and labeled the boxes on both the lids and the sides and closed the lids tight. We then placed the boxes into the incubator set to 25 Celsius. In the next two weeks, we took data every day by weighing the M. Sexta caterpillars. Each of the caterpillars was weighted by a standard electric lab weight. There was no need to add food in the first few days since the caterpillars had not finished the food yet. After they finish the first portion of the food, however, we added food for them and kept adding the same amount of food for all them as soon as one of the caterpillars finished its food. A two-tailed two samples t_test was performed to analyze the average percent of weight-change for the caterpillars in the two groups.

Results:
The M. Sexta larvae in the treatment group had an average of 237.2% weight change while the controll group had an average of 279.9% weight change. The treatment group had a standard deviation of 1.355 and the controll group had a standard deviation of 0.820. A visual presentation of the standard deviation and the percentage weight change compared to the initial weight is shown in Figure 1 in Figure Legend. We used a two-sample two-tailed t_test to analyze the results. We knew from the t_test that the degree of freedom of 4, a t-value of 0.466, and a two-tailed p_value of 0.655 (Figure 2). These data indicate that there was not a statistically significent result between the two groups.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that “if we add IGR hormone to the M.Sexta caterpillar diet, the caterpillars’ growth will be affected”, was not supported. There is no significent difference between the results of the treatment and controll groups which means that IGR hormone has no effect on the growth of M.Sexta caterpillar’s growth; even though there is some difference in appearances among the two groups. One of the M.Sexta larva in the treatment group (labeled T3) did not shrink in size like the other individuals. We conclude that it is the juvenile hormone that kept, or at least delayed the stage-change of this M.sexta caterpillar. There is a comprehensive body of evidence that a declining tire of JH is a prerequisite for pupation [Nijhout 1974]. And what we did was keep adding JH mimic to prevent the larvae from having a low level of JH so that they would not start pupation. This is also confirmed in other articles. JH mask the effects of insulin/ TOR signaling in the determination of the final body size and the weight in Manduca rely on distinct mechanisms that reflect different life history strategies [Hatem: 2016]. 
Some error factors that might affect the result of the experiment exist. We have an obvious out-layer in the treatment group that has a much smaller initial body weight comparing to the other individuals. This may influence the mean and standard deviation. We started the experiment by adding three drops of distilled water/ IGR for the controll and treatment groups, but we increased the dosage on the third day to five drops of distilled water/IGR for both groups. The increased dosage can influence the growth speech of the M.Sexta caterpillars. Also, we could not carry the experiment to the end because one individual in the experimental group died. In order to improve, one should include more experimental subjects in each group to reduce the effect of out-layers. The experiment can also be extended through the pupa stage for a more accurate result. 
Understanding how insect hormone works not only let us know more about the biology behind the insect life cycle but also set a foundation for us to further utilize the mechanic behind it. In agriculture, IGR can be used as a toxic pesticide replacement. It is friendly to human health and other insect or animal species in the ecosystem. Many other benefits can also be explored for sure.
