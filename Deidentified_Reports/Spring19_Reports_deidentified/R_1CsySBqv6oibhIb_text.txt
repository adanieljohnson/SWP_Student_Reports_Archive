Title: The Effects of different pH values on oxidation-reduction reactions

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to study the photosynthesis oxidation/reduction reaction rates in spinach and how different pH values affect those rates, using a DCIP decolorization assay. Photosynthesis is an important process for most life on this planet and any environmental factors could alter the oxidation/reduction reaction rates within Photosystems I or Photosystems II, which means it could also affect overall photosynthetic reaction rates in plants. We will be specifically measuring Photosystem II activity using the DCIP decolorization assay to determine whether environmental conditions, such as changes in pH levels accelerate or inhibit the oxidation/reductions reactions. We used DCIP, a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light maximally at 600nm, as our alternative electron acceptor for the Hill reaction. We prepared 3 replicates of each reaction mix with the different pH values and measure each absorbance using a spectrophometer. In the end, the reaction mix with the most accelerated reduction rate in Photosystem II (pH 7 mix) is also the one that lost the most color and had the lowest absorbance. While the reaction mix with the least accelerated reduction rate (pH 4 mix) is the one with the most color and highest absorbance.

Introduction:
All organisms extract energy from one or more external sources, both directly and indirectly [Johnson: 2016]. For plants, energy is captured and stored from the sun via the process of photosynthesis [Johnson: 2016]. The energy that has been stored is then released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm and respiration in the mitochondria, in both plants and animals [Johnson: 2016]. Therefore, the most important metabolic processes carried out by living organisms are photosynthesis, glycolysis and cellular respiration [Johnson: 2016]. Photosynthesis has three stages that run concurrently inside of chloroplasts [Johnson: 2016]. The first two stages absorbed protons of two wavelengths to generate reducing power as NADH, this is called light-dependent reactions [Johnson: 2016]. This reaction also creates a proton gradient needed to drive ATP synthesis [Johnson: 2016]. Within this stage, photosystems I and II occur [Johnson: 2016]. In addition, light independent reactions also occur; the high energy electrons are stored as NADPH2 via photosystem I [Johnson: 2016]. ATP is then generated from the H+ gradient and are consumed by chemical reactions that generate 6-carbon glucose molecules [Johnson: 2016]. The purpose of this lab is to indirectly estimate oxidation/reduction reactions in Photosystem II by extracting and enriching chloroplast spinach in a DCIP decolorization assay, because DCIP is an alternative electron acceptor for the Hill reaction [Johnson: 2016]. DCIP is a dark compound that when reduced to DCIPH2 it loses color [Johnson: 2016]. As a result, this decolorization assay is one of the standard method used to determine whether certain environmental factors accelerate or inhibit the oxidation/reduction reactions in Photosystem II [Johnson: 2016]. In this lab we aimed to determine whether different pH values affects photosynthesis reduction. Photosynthesis is not only an important process that takes place in most life on the planet, but its oxidation/reduction reaction rates in Photosystems I and II are easily altered by environmental factors, like pH levels [Johnson: 2016]. All biological processes can be affected by a change in pH, especially through its influence on enzymes. For example, the key carbon-fixing enzyme in photosynthesis, RuBisCO functions optimally at a pH of 8 [Invers, Romero, Perez: 1997]. Therefore, the rate of photosynthesis will be negatively affected if the pH were raised or lowered, because RuBisCO would begin to work more slowly [Invers, Romero, Perez: 1997]. There are many other enzymes and proteins involved in photosynthesis that would also be negatively affected as well. Another example includes a study done in an experiment researching the effects of low pH on photosynthesis, it was found that acidic soils limit crop growth and productivity [Long: 2017]. Low pHs or acidic soils can also affect plant water uptake, inhibit CO2 assimilation in some plant species, induce oxidative stress and electrolyte leakage [Long: 2017]. Therefore, we can hypothesize that the most acidic mixes (with pH4) and most basic mixes (with pH10) will affect the reduction rate in Photosystem II the most, while the mixes with the neutral pH level of 7, which is closest to its optimal pH of 8, will be the least affected; have the smallest percent change. 

Materials and Method:
We began this experiment by packing and mortar and pestle and three, 50 Ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice. We then removed the central veins of four medium-sized spinach leaves. Afterwards, we placed the leaves in the mortar and pestle and added 10Ml of cold grinding (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) buffer. We started grinding the leaves and then added another 10Ml of grinding buffer until we created a green slurry. Then, we strained the volume of green slurry through a cheese cloth and into a chilled beaker. We then transferred 200 microliters of filtered liquid from the beaker to the microtube labeled “sample A” and stored it in ice. Then we transferred the remaining liquid to the 50Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun it at 200xG for three minutes at 4⸰C on the centrifuge. After the spin, we poured the supernatant out of tube A and into a centrifuge labeled “B,” while also leaving the pellet at the bottom of tube A. We repeated the steps for sample A , for Sample B and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4⸰C at 1000xG. Later, we poured the supernatant out of tube B into another tube, but kept the pellet at the bottom of tube B. Next, we prepared 3 replicates of each reaction mix containing the different pHs. After adding the pH treatment, we had centrifuge it one last time. We then labeled the test tubes and turned on the spectrophometer to read 600nm. We then added 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts to the blank tubes and each tube. Immediately after adding the chloroplasts, we mixed each tube. After mixing, we transferred the mixtures to the spectrophometer cuvettes. We then placed the samples under a light and waited ten minutes before using the spectrophometer to read the absorbances. We had to blank the spectrophometer before reading the absorbances. Finally, we had to repeat this method after 20 minutes and 30 minutes and record the absorbances. We then calculated the average absorbance after each time. We also ran a t_test to find the p_value and determine whether the results were statistically significent. 

Results:
The dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure known as Oxidized DCIP absorbs light maximally at 600nm [Johnson: 2016]. It becomes DCIP2 when reduced and contains reorganized bonds that make it a conjugated C=C bonds, which causes it to lose color [Johnson: 2016]. As a result, the less color it has the lower the absorbance will be, which also indicates a more accelerated oxidation/reduction reaction in Photosystem II. On the other hand, the more color it has, the higher the absorbance will be, which also means a less accelerated oxidation/reduction reaction in Photosystem II. In this case, Figure 1 shows that the reaction mixes with pH 4 had the highest absorbance after each time recorded. Whereas, the reaction mixes containing a pH level of 7 was found to have a decreased absorbance after each 10 minutes under the light. As can be seen in Figure 2, when it came to the mix with the pH of 4, it had a percent change of 14.84 after 10 minutes, a percent change of 4.25 after 20 minutes and a percent change of 14.27 after 30 minutes. Using a two-tailed t_test, we calculated that it had a p_value of 0.000111, making it statistically significent. When it came to the mix with a pH of 7, as seen in Figure 2, it had a percent change of 16.75 after 10 minutes, a percent change of -3.15 after 20 minutes and a percent change of 4.04 after 30 minutes. The two-tailed t_test found that it had a p_value of 0.00663, also making it statistically significent. Finally, the mix with a pH of 10, shown in Figure 2, had a percent change of -3.98 after 10 minutes, a percent change of -14.62 after 20 minutes and a percent change of -4.27 after 30 minutes. The two-tailed t_test found that it had a p_value of 0.000167, making it statistically significent as well. 

Discussion:
Sample B-pellet was used for the DCIP decolorization assay to measure how different pHs (4, 7, and 10) affect the oxidation/reduction reactions in Photosystem II. This assay shows us how differently each sample’s rate of reduction was affected, because the average absorption for all of them varied. To continue, the sample with pH 7 consisted of the lowest absorption averages; ranging from 0.0546nm (after 20 minutes) to 0.0586 (after 30 minutes). Meanwhile, the sample with pH 4 had the highest average absorption; ranging between 0.063 (after 0 minutes) and 0.072 (after 30 minutes). Oxidized DCIP is a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light maximally at 600nm [Johnson: 2016]. The reduced version is DCIP2, which contains reorganized bonds, making it conjugated C=C bonds and causing it to lose color [Johnson: 2016]. The more it loses color, the lower the absorbance will be. As a result, the sample with the least amount of color (the sample with pH 4) had the most accelerated oxidation/reduction reaction in Photosystem II, because it had the lowest absorbance. While, the other sample with the most amount of color (the sample with pH 10) had the least accelerated reduction reaction. Because photosynthesis and its many proteins and enzymes, such as RuBisCO, function optimally at pH 8, it makes sense that the reaction mix with pH 7 had the lowest absorbance and most accelerated reduction rate. The reaction mix containing pH 7 is the closest to optimal conditions. Meanwhile, the reaction mix containing pH 4 had the least accelerated reduction rate and was further from optimal conditions, supporting our hypothesis. Many studies have been done that support this conclusion, such as a study done on the effects of low pH on Photosynthesis, related physiological parameters, and nutrient profiles of Citrus. In this study, researchers irrigated daily with a nutrient solution at a pH of 2.5, 3, 4, 5, and 6 using Citrus sinesis and Citrus grandis seedlings [Long: 2017]. They concluded with finding that the plant in solution with pH 2.5 had greatly decreased root, stem and leaf growth [Long: 2017]. While leaf CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, transpiration and RuBisCO activity also greatly decreased [Long: 2017]. On the other hand, the plant in solution with pH 5 had reached its maximum growth [Long: 2017]. In addition, the plants in solutions containing pH 3-6 had little change in CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, transpiration and RuBisCO activity [Long: 2017]. Another study was done on the effects of pH on seagrass photosynthesis. They used three Mediterranean seagrass species: Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera noltii and increased their pHs, starting from 8.2 to 9 [Invers, Romero, Perez: 1997]. They found that both Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, obtained at pH 8.2, showed a linear decrease in photosynthetic rates as they got higher, especially at pH 8.8 [Invers, Romero, Perez: 1997]. Meanwhile, although Zostera noltii was less sensitive to the increase in pH, it showed a significent reduction in photosynthetic rates at pH 9 [Invers, Romero, Perez: 1997]. As a result, the further away from optimal conditions for photosynthetic rates, the more they will decrease. Through our assay and many other similar studies, we can see that there is a similar trend in decreasing photosynthetic rates as the pH values get more acidic and more basic. Because environmental factors, such as a change in pH can alter photosynthetic rates, oxidation/reduction reaction rates within Photosystems I and Photosystems II are also affected. It is important to understand the negative effects changes in pH can have on photosynthetic processes in plants, especially places at higher risk for these changes. For instance, acid rain affects many countries around the world, especially places surrounded by large numbers of factories and powerplants [Gene, Likens, Wright, Galloway, Butler: 1979]. This type of rain allows low-pH water to spread via precipitation [Gene, Likens, Wright, Galloway, Butler: 1979]. The ecosystem can have drastic changes as the rain soaks into the ground and collects in streams [Gene, Likens, Wright, Galloway, Butler: 1979]. A pH change in bodies of water can not only affect plants but also other living organisms as well, which will cause a domino effect that could destroy and entire aquatic food chain [Gene, Likens, Wright, Galloway, Butler: 1979].
