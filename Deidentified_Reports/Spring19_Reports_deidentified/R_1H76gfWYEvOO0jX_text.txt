Title: IGR and their use in pest controll: how early stage Manduca sexta responds to the introduction of Precor, a synthetic substitute for Juvenile Hormone.

Abstract:
This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of Precor as an insect growth regulator in early instar Manduca sexta larvae. Manduca sexta is considered agood model organism for this sort of trial. The goal of the experiment was to determine if it was true that the introduction of the hormone in food for the larvae would stunt growth and prevent development into further instar stages. It was determined through a two tailed t_test that the change in mass for the controll group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.022, d.f. = 3, P = 0.98). Further areas of study are discussed and it is concluded that the introduction of Precor into larval diets must be tested at higher concentrations. 

Introduction:
Insects are found everywhere. Although insects can be and are beneficial to the environment, some species of insect are pests at different stages of development. Thanks to modern sensibilities, research has begun into pest controll method that are effective in fighting the onslaught of pests, but harMless to the human population. As part of this research is Insect growth regulators (IGRs), which target different hormonal pathways in insects in order to prevent or speed up development. Through the use of hormone manipulation, one can study Manduca sexta and apply the results to a broader and more general insect population[Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we aim to test the efficacy of hormonal treatment through a Juvenile Hormone (JH) synthetic simulator, Precor. JH substitutes have been shown to work in the past resulting in both accelerated development to the pupal stages as well as in physical deformities [Kort: 1991][Gruetzmacher: 1984]. The goal is to determine whether it is true that introduction of JH in early stages of development will stunt growth in Manduca Sexta larvae. This can be helpful in the pest controll problem as it would effectively remove the ability of Manduca sexta to grow to a point that would be damaging as a pest.



Materials and Method:
The experiment involved six caterpillars, three of which were put in a controll group and three of which were placed in an experimental group. The caterpillars  were number 1-6 and fed one of the two following diets: 10 grams of Manduca sexta food with 5 drops of Precor (the JH substitute) or 10 grams of Manduca sexta food with 5 drops of water. While the former diet was fed to the experimental group, the latter was for the controll. Every two days, the caterpillars were massed and their food supply replenished for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks the caterpillars were disposed of and the data analyzed. A two tailed t_test was used to determine whether the difference between the mean mass value of the controll group and the mean mass value of the experimental group were statistically significent.

Results:
Throughout the experiment, both groups of caterpillars were observed to grow at about the same rate. Both groups were equally as mobile and both ate about the same amount of food; when food was replaced, it very often was replaced for all six caterpillars at once. The two tailed t_test demonstrated a lack of statistical difference between the treatment group and the controll group (t_stat = 0.022, d.f. = 3, P = 0.98). It is important to note that one of the caterpillars in the controll group failed to grow more than .2 grams during the two weeks. Although it remained alive for about a week and a half, it finally died. Because this caterpillar performed drastically different than the controll is expected to, it was considered an outlier and not factored into the data

Discussion:
The two groups were found not to have statistically different changes in mass over a two week period. As a result, this study failed to reject the null hypothesis and support the alternate hypothesis. These findings are concurrent with previous research finding that JH stimulation was most effective in adult Manduca sexta as opposed to early developmental larvae [staal: 1975]. This study’s results highlight a continued need to find IGR’s which can be effective at the early stages of development. Many insects are pests at the early stages of life, and research should be conducted into how one can either speed up development past these pest stages, or completely stop it so that the insect never matures enough to cause problems.
