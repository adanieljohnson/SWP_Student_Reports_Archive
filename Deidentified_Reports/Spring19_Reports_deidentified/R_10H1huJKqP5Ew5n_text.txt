Title: Intraspecific Agonistic Behaviors between Betta splendins males in the presence of sustenance

Abstract:
The study of agnostic intraspecific behavior has been important in the study of ethology since its conception. It relates to how species interact and compete for dominance and resources. Specifically, food is a resource that can cause increased aggression between two members of the same species. Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, have long been used in studies due to their consistent and observable agnostic behaviors. This experiment was designed to test the effects of food on the observed agnostic intraspecific behaviors of two male B. splendins. The data collected from this experiment revealed that there is a significent and noticeable increase in the amount of agnostic behavior displayed by the two fish after the food was introduced to them. This experiment provides evidence that an external factor, such as food, will increase the levels of aggression in male B. splendins.

Introduction:
Siamese fighting fish, or Betta splendins, are a relatively common aquarium fish. They have long been known for their highly aggressive and easily distinguishable behavior [Bronstein: 1983].Because their behavior is easy to observe and record, they are often used in experiments regarding aggressive intraspecific agnostic behavior. These experiments have helped show that B. splendins can alter their intraspecific behavior when an exterior element, like food, is introduced to them. The aformentioned intraspecific agnostic behaviors displayed by B. splendins can be categorized into one of two types; broadside movements and facing movements [Johnson: 2016]. The broadside movements consist of, in order from least aggressive to most aggressive: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements consist of, in order from least aggressive to most aggressive: facing an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading the operculum, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes to create a red “mane”. The introduction of food into a tank containing two male B. splendins should increase the measured level of aggressiveness the male B. splenden display towards each other as a result of an external factor being added to their environment in the tank. B. splendins have been historically observed to interact more and display increased levels of aggression when in the presence of a potential mate, which is an external factor for the two males. [Johnson: 1973]. This experiment was designed to observe these intraspecific agnostic behaviors between two male B. splendins in the presence of food. 

Materials and Method:
Prior to the experiment, six B. splendins were not given any food for three days in advance of the experiment so that they would have a greater interest in the food they would be presented with. Two male B. splendins were placed in a tank that contained an opaque barrier which physically separated the two males and prevented them from seeing each other. The barrier was then removed, and the fish were observed for a period of five minutes. Each of their distinguishable intraspecific agnostic behaviors were observed were recorded with a number that represented that specific behavior. In this experiment, one represented the least aggressive observable behavior, pelvic fin flickering, and six represented the most aggressive observable behavior, creating the red “mane” (Table 1). After five minutes, the barrier was put back down and the fish were given five minutes to rest. Then, the previous procedure was repeated with the addition of a pinch of Tetra Pro being added to the water. each other. This entire procedure was repeated twice more with four separate male B. splendins in order to run the experiment a total of three times. After each of the trials, the sum total of both of the fish’s aggression “scores” were added up for both procedures and compared with their scores prior to receiving the Tetra Pro. The experiment used a paired t test to analyze the date for significance. 

Results:
The mean and standard deviation of the score of the male B. splendins’ Intraspecific Agonistic behavior of the male B. splendins before the food was introduced was 8.6667 +/- 5.465 (Fig. 1). The mean and standard deviation of the score of the male B. splendins’ Intraspecific Agonistic behavior of the male B. splendins after the food was introduced was 22.5 +/- 7.12. (Fig. 1). When the food was introduced into the tank, the fish were noticeably more active and aggressive than before the introduction of the food, which was supported by the data (Fig. 2). The mean of score of the B.splendins’ Intraspecific Agonistic behavior after the food was introduced was found to be significently different than the score of the B. splendins. before the food was added to the tank (T-value = 9.003, d.f. = 5, P-value = 0.0003). 

Discussion:
The data collected supported the initial assumption made, that the introduction of Tetra Pro to the two male B. splendins, causes their behavior to become more hostile towards each other. This finding is also consistent with past studies done on B. splendins’ aggression, which examined intraspecific communication between B. splendins and found that it increased in the presence of a female [Bronstein: 1983]. Both this study and past studies found the levels of aggression increase when an external factor is introduced. When conducting this experiment a few concessions had to be made. The first concession was that by the time the experiment was conducted, the six fish involved were noticeably more habituated from the pilot study performed one week prior to this experiment. In the pilot study, the males were observed under similar circumstances with the only major difference being the introduction of a female to the scenario. Over the course of the study, all observations made regarding the different intraspecific agnostic behaviors was subject to human error in the form of misinterpreting intraspecific displays. Due to the angles of the fish and the murkiness of the water, it was sometimes difficult to distinguish movements, and they could have been misinterpreted, which would lead to the fish having an incorrect score.
