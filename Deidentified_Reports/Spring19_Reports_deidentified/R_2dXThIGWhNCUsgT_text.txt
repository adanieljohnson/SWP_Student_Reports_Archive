Title: The effects of altered levels of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta larvae growth

Abstract:
The growth and development of Manduca Sexta caterpillars from their larval stage to pupation and full maturity is controlled by internal processes of hormone regulation. The alteration of these hormones, however, could have significant effects on the process of the organism through its life cycle. Two groups, one treatment and one control, were tested for a two-week period using different diets, one with a chemical hormone trigger, to determine the effects of increased Juvenile Hormone levels on Manduca Sexta, M. Sexta, larvae. These observations were quantified through the change in weight and length to create a metric for the effects on growth and development. The finals results showed that there was a significant difference in the growth of those caterpillars given the hormone trigger and those without it for weight but not for length. The M. Sexta given the trigger showed increased growth in both cases compared to the control. The collected observations supported our hypothesis given that the treatment group of larvae showed no signs of progressing toward pupation while the control either reach pupation or showed preparation stage indicator. It is concluded that the disruption to homeostasis from increased JH in M. Sexta larvae inhibits the ability to reach adulthood due to

Introduction:
Hormone regulation of an organism is central to the functionality of its vital processes and ability to maintain homeostasis. The alteration of hormone levels, whether through overproduction or suppression, would disrupt the equilibrium of an organism and could have varied consequences [Kiguchi:1978]. Manduca Sexta, commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm, are variety of insect that go through a series of metamorphic phases, beginning with the larval stages and ending with pupation into a moth [Kiguchi:1978]. This process relies on a series of hormone triggers that dictate the movement from birth to maturity [Kiguchi:1978]. In the larval stage, M. Sexta are characterized by a distinctive light blue coloration with a protruding red growth on the heat, appearing as a small horn [Johnson:2018]. Hormone regulation is an important factor in the growth and development of larval M. Sexta through to the pupal phase and into maturity. The primary growth hormones involved in this process are Juvenile Hormone, JH, and Ectynsteroid, E20 [Johnson:2018]. E20 controls the phases of juvenile development known as instars, and after the fifth and final instar it triggers the pupation process. This is begun by a slight increase in E20, called the commitment pulse, signaling that the larva is ready to begin preparation for the pupal stage. JH controls processes vital to the development of juvenile M. Sexta, maintaining their larval state until they are ready for the pupal stage. Throughout the juvenile period, JH levels remain high, only dropping after the commitment pulse to allow for maturity into adulthood. It is hypothesized that if the levels of JH are increased in Manduca Sexta larvae, they will persist in a juvenile state for an extended period and be unable to pupate.

Abstract cont.
an inability to chemically trigger pupation under the conditions of higher hormone levels.

Materials and Methods:
Two groups of four M. Sexta were given differing diets to alter hormone levels, testing the effects of increased hormones on development. The control group was separated and given ten grams of standard food for larval M. Sexta with addition drops of water added to soften. The treatment group was given the same amount of standard food, however, alternatively five drops of chemical Precor were added in place of water. By adding water to the unaltered food, the texture of both was made similar to simulate the same eating conditions between both groups. Precor was chosen because it triggers an increased production of JH in the M. Sexta larva. Both the control and treatment were incubated in a constant environment of 27°C, replacing food as needed. This ensured that the only variation to the larvae’s conditions was in their food. The progress of both groups was observing by measuring weight and length each day for two weeks. Once all of the data was compiled, a two-tailed t-test was used to determine whether there was a statistical significance in the difference in growth between the groups.

Results:
The difference in growth and development of M. Sexta treated with and without Precor were statistically significant regarding the average change in weight (t-value = 3.991, DF = 6, p-value = 0.007) but not with regard to overall growth lengthwise (t-value = 1.921, DF = 6, p-value = 0.103). The average weight increases in weight from M. Sexta in the treatment group with 9.97 ± 0.97g whole the untreated larvae only grew in weight by 6.44 ± 1g (Figure 2). The average length growth for M. Sexta treated with Precor was insignificantly greater to with 4.72 ± 0.49 cm of increase compared to the 3.40 ± 1.28 cm in the control group (Figure 1).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that increased levels of JH would cause the larval state of treated M. Sexta to be prolonged was supported by the findings, however the effects on growth and development were not entirely conclusive. The physical observations of the larva across the two-week period showed a divergence in the growth of the control and treatment groups of M. Sexta which suggest that the control group would have all pupated as normal should the testing have continued, while the treatments would not have. When the experiment was concluded, two of the control larvae has already pupated and the other two showed browning, characteristic of preparation stages. These signs, however, were not present in the treatment caterpillars, and two had died prematurely during the experiment. Given these observations, it can be further concluded that beyond the persistent larval stage of M. Sexta treated with Precor, the inability to pupate and potential alteration of other functions related to JH levels are fatal to the caterpillars. These findings are supported by previous studies showing that pupation is rarely possible, if not impossible, beyond a certain level of JH [Kiguchi:1978]. This suggests that, given a lower dose of Precor to increase JH, the larva may have been successful in pupation and survived, however in this experiment the treatment dosage of Precor was moderately high with the intent to observe more extreme effects of increased hormone levels. The previous studies findings further supported data collected regarding the increased growth in the treated caterpillars [Kiguchi:1978]. Where there was only limited increase in the growth of the treated caterpillars compared to the control in this experiment, the previous findings suggest that there is a correlation of larger weight and length in M. Sexta exposed to higher levels of JH [Kiguchi:1978]. This could be due to the continuous signaling caused by JH to increase appetite levels in a growing larval M. Sexta [Kiguchi:1978]. It is concluded that increased JH levels in M. Sexta larvae has a drastic effect on the physiological development and capability of the juveniles to reach adulthood due to the change in homeostasis which prevents the chemical trigger toward pupation. This study could be further used to test the effects of varied hormone levels on M. Sexta through the inclusion of more than one treatment group, each given a differing dosage of Precor.
