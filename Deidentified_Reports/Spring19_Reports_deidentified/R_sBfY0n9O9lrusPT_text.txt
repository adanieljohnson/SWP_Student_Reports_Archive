Title: IGR and its effects on Juvenile hormone and the growth rate of Manduca Sexta as caterpillars

Abstract:
The experiment that we carried out shows the effects of IGR and JH in the Manduca Sexta. By separating the caterpillars into two groups and varying the solution we put in their food, water or IGR, we were able to observe our hypothesis take place. Our original claim would result in the treatment (IGR) group growing at a much slower rate than the controll, with the possibility that they do not reach maturity at all. Our results showed that the controll group had a 55% growth rate, while the treatment group came in a good bit lower, at around 45%.  When the final feeding day came, we saw the variation in groups and found our hypothesis to be relevant, with a p_value of around 0.03.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, commonly referred to as a tobacco hornworm, has a very short life cycle as a caterpillar, making it an ideal organism to research the effects of JH and IGR (insect growth regulator) in the growth rate of M.sexta.(Johnson: 2018) By doing such experiments, we are able to see the effects that hormones can have on different processes in the lives of organisms. Juvenile hormones (JH) plays a crucial role in the developmental stage of the M.sexta, including the variation of molting, or shedding, that occurs once the caterpillar has reached that stage. (Johnson: 2018) The antagnostic hormone, IGR, works in a completely opposite way. Most species will respond to IGR by growing in varying ways which may range from larger, slightly more ideal forms, to a scale of intermediates between immature and adult forms. [Staal: 1975]. These effects have some basic principles they follow, but maintain room for variation, which may allow us find clues about the mode of action of the hormonal processes. This not only provides insight into the hormones of insects, yet also pertains to the hormonal processes of all animals, even humans. For this experiment, we will create two groups of M.sexta caterpillars and give one of them IGR soaked food. We suspected that by giving M.sexta IGR, their developmental stage will be prolonged compared to that of the controll group, with the possibility that they do not even make it to the molting stage, as a result of the inhibiting work of the IGR on the JH. 

Materials and Method:
We began our experiment by choosing six similarly-sized M.sexta and separating them into two different groups of three, controll and treatment. The controll group with an average length of 3.56cm and the treatment group with an average of 3.63cm. The largest M.sexta began the experiment at 4.1cm (treatment) and the smallest at 3.3cm (controll/treatment), making the range 0.8cm.  We gave them each a small cell to live in, which we created air holes in, and provided them with fresh food every other day. Additionally, they all lived in a refrigerator with a controllled temperature when we were not present. The only difference between the two groups was the solution that we soaked their food in. Each M.sexta received a fresh ten grams of food every time we came to check on them, and we put five drops of water (controll) or IGR (treatment) in their food. After the initial feeding, we came back every other day and made sure they had fresh food. We would then record the length of the caterpillars every time to see the growth patterns of those effected by IGR and those that were not. At the end of the experiment we decided to use the T-Test to compare our results for the controll and treatment groups.

Results:
As we first started the experiment, the two groups seemed to be growing in unison, but the different variables created a gap between the two groups as the experiment progressed. The controll group grew faster than the treatment group in the beginning of the experiment. Moving forward with our work, the treatment group narrowed the gap with the controll, but showed a slower start to their development. The final numbers show that the mean percent growth of the controll group (55%) was roughly 10% greater than that of the treatment (45.58%). When we look at the average percent growth, we can also find the standard deviation of the two groups. For the controll group the standard deviation came out at a value of 0.0496, and the treatment group at a value of 0.0393. (These values mean that the controll groups numbers were farther from the mean, while the treatment groupâ€™s numbers were closer to the mean.) One observation that I thought was very interesting was that the treatment group grew very consistently between the three M.sexta that were a part of that group. Additionally, one of the controll group caterpillars fell off and ended up much smaller than any other of the test organism. Some of our M.sexta actually decreased in length by the end of the experiment, contrary to what we thought was even possible. One of these decreases may have actually been a death in our organisms, because the length of the M.Sexta went from 6.5cm to 5.3cm within two days. When we finished the testing and put our raw data into the T-Test, our p_value came out to be just over 0.03. 

Discussion:
According to our p_value that we got from our test, our hypothesis is true. The value was significent and, therefore, rejects the null hypothesis, meaning that our original hypothesis about IGRs inhibition of the JH and, ultimately, the growth rate of the M.sexta. Through greater selectivity of action these hormones appear to fit the requirements for third-generation pesticides and compatibility with modern insect pest management principles. [Staal: 1975]. To clarify what the previous statement means, the M.sexta becomes a pest when it matures into a moth and, therefore, the IGR acts as a pesticide in order to prevent the caterpillar from reaching that stage. (Johnson: 2018)  When forming our hypothesis, we looked at the effects of IGR and how it is used in the world. This led us to the conclusion that if we added the IGR to the food of one group, then we would see that group develop slower, if at all, in comparison to the controll group. This study can show the way that hormones work on the different processes of the body, not only in insects, but all types of organisms. This gives us insight into ways to develop new pesticides and possible medical advancements. Additionally, I believe that this experiment would be much more useful with larger subject numbers and many different hormone-enhancers/inhibitors. This would give us a chance to compare the effects of the many different hormones within the body of these organisms, and possibly ourselves as well.

Figure 1.0: This graph shows the average percent growth of both groups and the standard deviation of each group, as well. The standard deviation shows the amount that one number in the data varies from the average of all the data. Also, the controll group is the group with its food soaked in water, and the treatment group had food soaked with IGR. The y-axis stands for the average percent growth in comparison to the original size average of the groups.*************************************************************************
