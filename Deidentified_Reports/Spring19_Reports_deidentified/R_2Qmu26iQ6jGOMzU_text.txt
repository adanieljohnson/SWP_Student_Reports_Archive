Title: The effect of Martin’s IGR on the development and change in mass of Manduca sexta over time. 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta’s development stems from two hormones within the insect: Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). The balance of these hormones is crucial to the caterpillar’s ability to pupate into adult stage. A change in the balance of 20E and JH will prevent the Manduca sexta from pupating and entering adulthood. In untreated Manduca sexta, they will experience high levels of JH until 4th larval instar, then once the critical weight is reached the caterpillars will enter the 5th larval instar. During the 5th larval instar, there is a significant drop in produced juvenile hormone. During this lab, we used methoprene, a JH analog, to test the growth rate over time and the impact of the development of the Manduca sexta. We added six drops of 0.3mL methoprene to the experimental group of caterpillars’ 10g of given food. The control group received the same food and amount as the experimental group but without the additional hormone. We hypothesized that the added methoprene would prevent the experimental group from pupating and instead continue to grow as caterpillars until death. However, there was no statically significant data between the change in mean weigh in both groups (t-value= 0.503, df=4, p-value= 0.317). Therefore, the null hypothesis was not rejected.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta have an absorbent amount of hormones that regulate their main bodily functions and control their ability to develop. Specifically used for growth and developmental changes within the caterpillars are three main hormones: Prothoracicotropic hormones, Ecdysteroids, juvenile hormones. In this experiment, we will be focusing on only the juvenile hormone, but more specifically its analog, methoprene. In order for a Manduca Sexta to properly develop into the fifth instar stage and molt, there must be a low amount of juvenile hormone and then a sharp increase in its ecdysteroids. One way to disturb the natural process of development is through the introduction of an insect growth regulator (IGR). In this experiment we will be using Martin’s IGR to serve as our insect growth regulator. IGR’s are can cause abnormalities that do not allow insects to complete a full life cycle due to the interruption of their biological systems. Juvenile hormones affect the rate of growth in the Manduca sexta; when the hormone is negated through starvation after critical weigh it reached it can prevent the Manduca sexta from maturing into later larval instar stages [Browder: 2001]. The purpose of this lab experiment is to see how the starvation of growing Manduca sexta would affect their biological systems and metamorphosis. In contrast to the experiment done by Browder, we hypothesized by increasing juvenile hormone in the caterpillars that they would fail to pupate and continue to grow until their death. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta were selected at the 2nd to 3rd instar of development and split into two groups of four. The first group was labeled control and the other experimental. Next, each group was placed into separate plastic containers which included four separate living sections for each caterpillar. Each caterpillar in the control container was given ten grams of the provided Manduca sexta food with six drops of water mixed in. Each caterpillar in the experimental container was also given ten grams of food but with six drops of Martin’s IGR mixed in. The droplets of water and IGR are considered to be the independent variable. Both groups were observed daily and fed and cleaned as needed. After each observation period the Manduca sexta were placed in a regulatory incubator with a natural 12-hour light/ 12-hour dark light cycle. The dependent variable was determined to be the weight and developmental process of the caterpillars over the period of two weeks. They were observed every day at approximately 6:00 pm. The data collected will be observed through a two-sample t-test.



Results:
Over a two-week period, we observed the change in mass of the Manduca sexta in both the experimental and control groups. We were able to recognize many trends between the two groups. We noticed that both groups held a steady mass increase each day. Between Day 12 and 13, six of the eight caterpillars began to lose mass and change in color. The average change in mass after two weeks for the control group was 11.96g +/- 1.73, whereas the average change in mass for the experimental group was 12.66g +/- 2.18 (Figure 1). 

At final examination, the caterpillars in the control group maintained their original turquoise color while the caterpillars in the experimental group had begun to darken and turn a brownish color. In our findings we noted that there was a wide range of growth rates in both the experimental and control groups with the experimental group containing the caterpillar with the largest and smallest change in mass. The mean change in weight was not statistically significant (t-value= 0.503, df=4, p-value= 0.317).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis stated that the continuous ingestion of methoprene would cause the Manduca sexta to grow at a steady yet advancing rate and that the caterpillars would fail to mature from larva into their adult stage. Our hypothesis was not supported with a p-value of 0.317. As stated in the hypothesis, the treatment group maintained a steady growing pattern and failed to mature from larva to adult stage. 

The treatment of the growth hormone preempted death instead of the natural evolution into adult stage. In untreated caterpillars, the juvenile hormone used to treat the experimental group is naturally released during only the larval stage. Because the caterpillars were constantly receiving doses of the juvenile hormone, their systems continued to replicate the actions of larvae stages and prevented the caterpillars from pupating. The continuous ingestion of juvenile hormone explains why the caterpillars from the experimental began darkening before the control group and instead of pupating, began dying. The experimental group caterpillars would die before they were able to mature into the adult stage because they never experienced the sharp decrease in juvenile hormone in the 5th larval instar. In the above-discussed experiment, the Manduca sexta had a rapid decline of juvenile hormone if starved immediately after reaching critical weight [Browder: 2001]. In comparison to this experiment, we concluded that the increase of juvenile hormone in the Manduca sexta would not allow the secretion of juvenile hormone and imminently the pupation of the Manduca sexta into adults. 

Based on the results of the two sample T-test, giving the caterpillars the growth hormone provided weight a result that were not statistically different from the control group. The means of the control and experimental groups were not found to be statistically significant and therefore our null hypothesis was not rejected by our results.
