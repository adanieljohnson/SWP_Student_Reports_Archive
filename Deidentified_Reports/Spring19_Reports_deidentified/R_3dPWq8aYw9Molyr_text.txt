Title: The Effect of Water Color on Aggressive Behavior in Male Betta splendens

Abstract:
Betta Splendens are fish known for their variety of colors, ranging from a combination of different pigments and their aggressive behaviors. These agonistic intraspecific behaviors, characterized by actions such as tail beating and protruding the red “mane” vary by situation. This experiment aims to determine if and how different colored water will impact the aggressive behaviors of the Betta fish. It was hypothesized that red Betta splendens would exhibit more agonistic behaviors in red water. Two trials of two male fish were placed together in green, red, and clear water and the duration of the appearance of the red mane was timed for a total of five minutes. The fish appeared to show more red mane in the clear and red water than in the green water. However, the ANOVA test revealed that there was no significant difference in aggression between the different colors of water. It is possible that the green water was too dark for the fish to recognize each other as a threat. 


Introduction:
Betta Splendens, also known as Siamese Fighting Fish, originated in Southeast Asia. The natural habitat for them is typically rice paddies, ditches, and other shallow, muddy, areas of water with low oxygen [Johnson: 2018].  The fish are known for their aggressive intraspecific behaviors in different situations. They demonstrate aggressive broadside behaviors in which they turn their sides to their opponents such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2018]. When a fish faces its opponent, it exhibits agonistic behaviors such as showing erect pectoral fins, spreading its gill covers, and protruding its branchiostegal membranes known as the red mane [Doutrelant: 2001]. The fish come in a wide variety of colors coming from three main pigments of yellow, red, and black and the scattering of light [Wallbrun: 1957]. Bettas have been bred to maintain their bright fighting colors even when at rest. However, when excited by another male, their colors can darken or change. Previous studies have explored the responses of female bettas to different color males. One study showed that females prefer red males to blue males, showing that color can impact behaviors of the fish [Clotfelter: 2007]. There is no literature on studies that have investigated the impacts of water color on Betta Splendens. However, Bettas have naturally adapted to survive in dark, muddy waters. This experiment is aiming to discover if different colored water will affect the behavior of Bettas. It was hypothesized that red Betta splendens will exhibit more agonistic behaviors in red water because it will simulate the dark water that the fish are native to. 


Materials and Methods:
One tank was filled with room temperature water and dyed with five drops of green food coloring. Two separated resting red male Bettas were placed in the tank together. A timer was set for five minutes and the behaviors of the fish were observed. To standardize the agonistic behaviors, appearance of the red mane was timed in seconds for both fish throughout the duration of the five minutes spent in the green tank. After five minutes, the fish were removed and placed into a separated, clear resting tank for five minutes. Two different red male Bettas were placed into the green tank and total red mane time was timed for five minutes. The procedure was then repeated with the same groups of males in clear water and in red water. The fish were given five minutes of rest before being placed with the other male in each trial. An ANOVA test was used to determine if there was a significant difference in time of aggressive behavior in the fish between red, green, and clear water. 


Results:
The fish appeared to show increased red mane in the clear and red water and lacked slightly more signs of aggression in the green water (Figure 1). However, for all three colors of water, the ANOVA test revealed that the results were not significant (P-value 0.662). 



Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis that red Betta splendens will exhibit more agonistic behaviors in red water. Although the results were not significant, there appeared to be an increase in aggression and red mane from green to red to clear water. This could have been because the green water was too dark for the fish to see each other. Although they are naturally accustomed to dark waters, these fish live in clear tanks. The fish did not seem to recognize or acknowledge each other in the dark green water. Previous studies have shown that the fish can distinguish color in other fish, but this may not apply to color of water [Clotfelter: 2007]. This would explain the statistically similar levels of aggression between the different colors of water. To improve the accuracy of the results, fewer drops of green dye could be added to the water in order to keep the levels of darkness consistent. The results also could have been different if fish were tested directly coming from their natural habitat rather than the clear tank water.
