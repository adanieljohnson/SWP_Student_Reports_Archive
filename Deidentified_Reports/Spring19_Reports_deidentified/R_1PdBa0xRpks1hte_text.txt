Title: Effect of Methoprene, a JH mimic, on the weight of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The effect of Methoprene, a JH mimic, on the weight of Manduca Sexta was examined. Four Manduca Sexta were given food with 8 drops of Methoprene added daily for 14 days and four Manduca Sexta were given food with 8 drops of water added daily for 14 days. It was hypothesized that the caterpillars who received food that contained methoprene would weigh more than the caterpillars receiving food that contained only water.  Data points for days 11-14 were the only used as the weights of both groups began to decrease after 11 days. Additionally, the caterpillars receiving diets with methoprene added showed signs of death after 11 days.  The average change in mass of the Manduca Sexta consuming a diet with Methoprene added was 11.6 +/- 0.578g while the average change in mass of the Manduca Sexta consuming a diet with water added was 12.26 +/- 0.595g. A two-sample t test was used to analyze the data. The p-value was 0.081381. Since this value is greater than 0.05, the hypothesis was rejected. There was no significant difference in the average change in weight between the experimental and control groups. 

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone present in the life cycle of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. In juvenile Manduca Sexta, JH effects the type of molt that occurs. If JH levels in Manduca Sexta are high, then the molt the Manduca Sexta undergoes will result in the caterpillar progressing to the next larval instar. In other words, the caterpillar’s appearance will remain the same, but it will grow bigger. If levels of JH present in Manduca Sexta are low at the same time that levels of Ecdysteroids (a hormone that impacts molt timing) are low, then the commitment pulse will be triggered which results in moderate levels of JH secretion paired with moderate levels of Ecdysteroids secretion. The commitment pulse triggers the Manduca Sexta to begin to pupate. Pupation refers to the encasement of the larvae by a cocoon allowing for the reorganization of internal and external structures. 
The natural development of organisms such as Manduca Sexta can be controlled by manipulating the levels of hormones that are present in their bodies. This regulation is achieved through Insect growth regulators (IGRs) which are hormone mimics. An important question to consider is “How does JH impact the size of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars?” This question can be answered through the use of an IGR, specifically PreCore methoprene, a JH mimic. 
Theoretically, if PreCore methoprene was added to the food of Manduca Sexta, the commitment pulse either would not occur or it would occur later because it can only occur if levels of JH are low. This would cause the Manduca Sexta to remain larvae for a longer amount of time. Konopova expands the idea that it is JH that causes Manduca Sexta to remain larvae instead of pupating. He shows it is not JH that causes caterpillars to remain as larvae, but rather Met and Kr-h, two JH-dependent repressors (Konopova, 2011).  It is expected that the Manduca Sexta larvae exposed to the PreCore methoprene will be larger and weigh more than normal because they will have more time to consume nutrients before pupation. Producing larvae that are bigger prior to pupation could possibly decrease the survivability rates of the Manduca Sexta as the adult moths that emerge from the pupae will be bigger than normal.  
In order to observe the relationship between size of the larvae and JH levels, 8 drops of PreCore methoprene, juvenile hormone (JH) mimic, will be added to the caterpillar food for one group of caterpillars and 8 drops of water will be added to the caterpillar food for another group. It is hypothesized that the caterpillars who receive food that contains PreCore methoprene will weigh more than the caterpillars receiving food that contains only water. 


Materials and Methods:
First, obtain two plastic bins, with 4 compartments each. This will be where you place your caterpillars. Mark one bin as control, and the other as experimental. Then, label each of the compartments 1-4.  Using a hole poker, poke two holes in the external side of each compartment. Next, select eight caterpillars from the bin of caterpillars that are relatively close in size and have not yet started their commitment pulse. Place each caterpillar on the scale one at a time and record their weight in grams. After measuring each caterpillar, place them in an organized order on the table (make sure you remember which caterpillar is which). Measure out 40 grams of the stock caterpillar food, in a weigh boat. Then, in a separate container, break apart the 40 grams of food into four 10-gram portions.  Add eight drops of PreCore methoprene to the food; this will be the food for the “experimental” caterpillars. Repeat this step for the controll group, but add eight drops of deionized water, instead of PreCore. Before placing the food in each compartment, squish the food together into one, collected ball. This makes it easier for the caterpillars to eat. After you place the food into each compartment, place each caterpillar into the compartment. For a period of 7 days, repeat weighing the Manduca Sexta and changing out their food, adding eight drops of Methoprene for the experimental caterpillar’s food and adding eight drops of water for the control caterpillar’s food. Before adding the food, clean each bin out, and throwaway any leftover food/ waste.  A two-sample t test will be used to analyze the results. 



Results:
Figure 1 shows that the average change in mass of the Manduca Sexta consuming a diet with Methoprene added was 11.6 +/- 0.578g. It also shows that the average change in mass of the Manduca Sexta consuming a diet with water added was 12.26 +/- 0.595g. The one tailed p-value was P Value: 0.081381. After day 11 both the weights of the control and experimental group began to decrease. The commitment pulse was observed starting day 12 in all of the control group caterpillars, but was never observed in the experimental group. At day 13 caterpillars three and four of the experimental group started to turn black and show signs of death.

Discussion:
Since the one tailed p-value was 0.081381, a number greater than 0.05, the hypothesis was rejected and the data was not significant. There was no significant difference between the average change in weight of Manduca Sexta caterpillars receiving 10g of food per day with Methoprene added and the average change in weight of Manduca Sexta receiving 10g of food per day with water added. The addition of methoprene to the diet of the Manduca Sexta should have resulted in them having a larger mass than did the Manduca Sexta with water added to their diet because methoprene is a JH mimic that keeps the commitment pulse from occurring, thus allowing the caterpillars more time to consume food. The experiment was carried out for 14 days; however, after day 11, both the weights of the caterpillars receiving the diet with methoprene added and the diet with water added began to decrease in weight, so only the data for days one through 11 were used. The commitment pulse was observed starting day 12 in all of the control group caterpillars, but was never observed in the experimental group. This could have contributed to the results not being significant as the recorded data did not show long periods of time where the control group had reached the commitment pulse and the experimental group had not. Since both groups of caterpillars begun to decrease in weight after day 11, it could be inferred that an external factor was causing the caterpillars to die. One such external factor that could have been soap residue left over in the enclosures of the caterpillars after cleaning them. This could have impacted their pH and interrupted normal functions. 
Another possible reason for the decrease in weight after day 11 could have been that since the caterpillar’s body masses did not need to further increase due to critical weight (weight at which further growth is not needed for normal pupation) being achieved, they could have stopped eating as much. An experiment carried out by Davidowitz showed that greater weights negatively impact body plasticity. He suggests that an evolutionary mechanism may exist to keep weight from becoming too large prior to pupation regardless of if the commitment pulse has been reached (Davidowitz, 2003). This evolutionary mechanism could be to decrease appetite. 
	Theoretically, the weight of the Manduca Sexta should have increased because they were able to continue eating and molting to larger larvae as the control group pupated and reorganized its internal and external organs. Future experiments to test the impact of methoprene, a JH mimic, on the weight of Manduca Sexta could be improved by increasing the size of the enclosure and cleaning it without soap to ensure that external factors did not affect the results. If repeated, the experiment should be carried out for a length of time that allows for the caterpillars to both remain healthy and the commitment pulse to be observed in the control group up until the point of full pupal eclosion.  The experiment would be more valid if more trials were conducted. This research is applicable because if methoprene is shown to be effective at increasing the weight of Manduca Sexta prior to pupation, then it could be used as a method of controlling/ decreasing the population of moths as it has been shown that survivability decreases if they are the Manduca Sexta larvae are larger prior to pupation.
