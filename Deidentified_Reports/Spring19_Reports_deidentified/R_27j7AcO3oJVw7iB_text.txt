Title: Resource allocation and plasticity

Abstract:
Plant allocation provides a variety of strategies which the plant uses to get enough resources for its survival. Natural resources are limited and all the organisms compete against each other to get them. In this experiment we want to demonstrate the necessity of water in plants to do the photosynthesis by varying the temperature of living. We used Scale Cereal plants and made two groups of it to allocated them in different spots, one warmer and the other at a constant temperature which is our control group. We measured both group and compared its root and shoot ratio means for its length and weight and compared them. The weight of the plant allocated in a warmer place is the thing that varies from the plants placed in the greenhouse. Temperature is with no doubt key aspect that affects the plant necessities.

Introduction:
The plant needs dictates the growth of the plant. Consistent with the ‘partitioning’ perspective, changes in allocation patterns have been conceptualized and analyzed as ratios, e.g. root:shoot ratio or reproductive effort [Poorter & Nagel 2000]. Plants allocated in a certain environment will determine its total growth, the growth of the root and the shoot and its weight. Because resources allocated to one function or organ are therefore not available to other functions or organs, allocation implies tradeoffs [Stearns 1992]. The lack of water will make the plant increase the length of the root so can reach more parts of the ground to get enough of it. Water is a major resource that contributes to the plant photosynthesis and thus to get energy to accomplish its vital needs. The plant can’t have sugar (energy) without water, that’s why is an important resource for existence.
 We want to study which parts of plants are more likely to grow longer in a specific environment. We studied the chances of growth in plant by varying characteristics of its allocation, so we can determine which allocation the plant is more able to take the resources from it. The temperature in which the plant is living is key to determine the length and weight root shoot ratio, because its relation with the necessity of water.
Because of the increase of the temperature we think that the ability of water in the soil will decrease and the plant will grow bigger and longer roots in order to get water. So, we hypothesized that plants allocated in a warmer place, the Root:Shoot ratio wheight and length would be higher than the ones allocated in a place with an average temperature as a greenhouse.


Materials and Methods:

We were given Secale Cereal seeds to plant them into two sets of six pots filled with vermiculite. We introduced 6 seeds in each hole of the pot. After that we buried them applying vermiculite over the seeds. We applied them into the pots and then we leveled the 1st pot with greenhouse and the 2nd with incubator. The 1st group was going to be located in the greenhouse is our control group, and the testing group in the incubator at a higher temperature(?). We applied to them miracle gro to speed up its growth. We did irrigate the plants for 2 weeks. We left the plants repose for two weeks and let them grow with all the resources constant. After that, we measured 3 plants of each pot. Then, measured the weight of the whole plant. Afterwards, we cut the plant at the root shoot junction (we decided the root shoot junction would be where the plan changes its color) and measured the individual weight and of the roots and shoots (making sure to keep individual plants together). Later, we measure the length of the individual, roots and shoots. Subsequently, we calculated the R:S ratio with the data previously collected of weights and length separately, and so calculate the average (mean) and the standard deviation, (which is recommended to use the excel table). From the research, we made a graph with the data of the weight and length collected (R:S) 

Results:

The weight R:S ratio of the plants grown up in an incubator an in a greenhouse.

The mean of the length of root:shoot ratio in greenhouse is 1.56 and in incubator is 1.47. The standard deviation in length in greenhouse is 0.4 and in incubator is 0.37.
The mean of the weight of root:shoot ratio in greenhouse is 0.567 and in incubator is 2.54. The standard deviation is weight in greenhouse is 0.3 and 0.68 in incubator.
The t-value is 3.928095, the P-value is 0.01713 and it has 4 degrees of freedom


Discussion:
The results support our hypothesis. As you may observe in the table below, we calculated each possible variable that exists in weigh and length of shoots and roots and its overall weight and length of the plant grown up in a greenhouse (control group) and incubator, and its R:S ratio. 
In the allometric view, plasticity in allocation can be understood as a change in a plant’s allometric trajectory in response to the environment [Elsevier GmbH 2004]. The growth of the plant or the increase of its weight.
We concluded that the R:S weigh average ratio is bigger in plants allocated in the incubator. Furthermore, the R:S length average ratio is also bigger in plants that were allocated in the incubator. So our hypothesis is confirmed but not by too many difference between them. Comparing the 1st graph that shows the average ratio in length, the difference between the two groups it is almost insignificant, so we cannot confirm our hypothesis, and so the temperature in which a plant grows doesn’t affect its length.
However, on the 2nd graph reflects the average weight ratio there is a clear difference between plants harvest in the incubator and the greenhouse, which supports our hypothesis.
