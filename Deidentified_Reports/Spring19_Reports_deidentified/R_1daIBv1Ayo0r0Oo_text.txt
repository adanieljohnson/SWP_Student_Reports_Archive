Title: Male Betta splendens do not react aggressively to models of male fish of the same species. 

Abstract:
Male Betta splendens tend to show aggressive behaviors when introduced to another male of the same species. This is due to the threat another male presents to the others dominance. The two types of aggressive behaviors are broadside movement and facing movement. One of the most aggressive facing movements, the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane resulting in a red mane was quantified and the duration of its exposure was measured in three B. splendens fish to check if male B. splendens react more aggressively (display their mane for a longer duration of time) towards two models of themselves than towards a single model of themselves. An ANOVA test found no significant difference between the groups, not supporting the hypothesis. It was determined that some other factor other than the physical and visual presence of another fish of the same species elicited an aggressive behavior in response. 

Introduction:
Male Betta splendens tend to show aggressive behaviors when introduced to another male of the same species. This is due to the threat another male presents to the others dominance. There are a range of aggressive behaviors that can be quantified and used to measure the reaction of male Bettas. There are two types of aggressive behaviors- broadside movement and facing movement. Broadside movement includes pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing; listed in order of aggressiveness from low to high. Facing movements include erection of pectoral fins, spreading of gill covers, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane (resulting in a red mane); again listed in order of low to high aggressiveness. Other agonistic behaviors include the raising of the dorsal fin, lowering of the head, arching of the back, darting, and nipping [Johnson: 2016]. 
Male B. splendens have been extensively researched and are known to display all types of aggressive behaviors when in the same physical environment with another male. It has also been found that male bettas react to a certain degree of aggressiveness to models of betta fish when exposed to them for the first time [Rhoad: 1975]. Aggressive displays observed were fin erection and coloration [Rhoad: 1975]. 
In this experiment, we have decided to measure the duration of mane exposure in response to a stationary model of a male B. splendens. A model will help us determine if what causes the aggressive reaction of a male betta to another is simply its visual presence or not. Furthermore, whether a male betta will react differently to two models being present i.e. more aggressively will be tested. Thus, the hypothesis is:
Male B. splendens will react more aggressively (display their mane for a longer duration of time) towards two models of themselves than towards a single model of themselves.


Materials and Methods:
How aggressive a male betta is was quantified by the duration (number of seconds) their mane was exposed. 
Two male betta fish models were prepared along with a tank with three male B. splendens separated by opaque pieces of glass. This model fish was a mould of a betta fish that was attached to a weight that anchored its position. For the control, all three fish were observed for 5 minutes, and the duration of mane exposure was measured.
Then, one model fish was placed in the tank with the first fish for 5 minutes and the duration of mane exposure was measured. This procedure was repeated for the other two fish. Each fish was given a period of 5 minutes of rest to prevent habituation and skew the data. 
The same process was repeated except with two model fish. 
An ANOVA test was used to determine if there was a statically significant difference between the duration of mane exposure in the three groups- no model (control), 1 model, and 2 models. 


Results:
As seen in Figure 1, the mean duration of mane exposure by the betta fish when exposed to no model fish (control) was 7.33 seconds ± 10.3709. 
The mean duration of mane exposure by the betta fish when exposed to 1 model fish was 7.31 seconds ± 8.31. The mean duration of mane exposure by the betta fish when exposed to 2 model fish was 0 seconds. There was no standard deviation as there was no variation in the data as seen in Figure 1. It is due to this that there is no bar for standard deviation for the 2 model fish group. 
An ANOVA test found that there was no statistical significance between the control and presence of 1 model fish, the control and 2 model fish, and between 1 model fish and 2 model fish (p= 0.575). 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that Male B. splendens will react more aggressively (display their mane for a longer duration of time) towards two models of themselves than towards a single model of themselves was not supported. This shows that the betta fish did not differ in their agonistic behavior towards no model fish (control), 1 model fish, and 2 model fish. 
A similar result to this study was found in another study where 2 male bettas reacting aggressively to each other did not react towards a dummy model of male betta fish acting as an audience towards their interactions [Dzieweczynski: 2006]. The study suggested that B. splendens are not unresponsive towards models of their own species, but that some other factor other than the simple physical and visual presence of the model caused a reaction [Dzieweczynski: 2006]. Such factors could be pheromones or the initiation of an aggressive behavior. 
Perhaps the quantification of aggressive behavior was not suited to measure aggressive movement. Since there is a low amount of the high level of aggressive behavior (mane exposure), perhaps the duration lower levels of aggressive behaviors, such as pelvic fin flickering or erection of pectoral fins should be measured. 
This direction of extension of this experiment is supported by the fact that lower levels of agonistic behavior, such as pelvic fin flickering and pectoral fin erection. B. splendens behavior has also been measured this way, with significant data in previous studies [Rhoad: 1975]. 
This experiment also adds to previous research on B. splendens behavior (agonistic or not) towards non-living objects. This could have implications for both domesticated B. splendens and wild type B. splendens. The way betta fish react to non-living models of themselves could be linked to objects placed in fish tanks and if there are any correlations in behavior towards the two types of objects. The results could also be linked to energy consumption in wild type bettas. Wasting energy on displaying agonistic behaviors towards an object which will not cause harm would not be useful for survival. Furthermore, factors like pheromones could be investigated to see what effect they have on behavior. The method B. splendens use to distinguish between objects and living aggressors needs to be studied more to gain a better understanding on this topic.
