Title: Effect of Hormones on [Manduca sexta] growth

Abstract:
Hormone regulation is an important topic in comparative biology. With hormones it is important to understand how organisms send signals through their body to controll growth and development, behaviors and physiology. In this lab we looked at the effect of the hormones gentrol and azaguard on [Manduca sexta] growth by creating environments for them to live (plastic container with two holes for breathing) and giving each group of caterpillars different hormones (either gentrol or azaguard) or water (the controll) in their food over the course of 2 weeks. The expectation was that the gentrol, an insect growth mimic, would increase the overall weight and height of the insects compared to the controll, while azaguard, an insect growth inhibitor, would reduce the weight and height of the insects compared to the controll. Our data showed no significent difference in the gentrol hormone, but did show a significent difference in the azaguard hormone, with the azaguard hormone being much shorter in length and much less in weight compared to the controll. This significance along with the observations, suggests that the concentration of azaguard used was enough to physically slow down the development of the caterpillars, by manipulating its hormone balance, preventing it from changing its develop

Introduction:
In this experiment we evaluated the effect of hormones on insect development. The [Manduca sexta], tobacco hornworm, is in the order Lepidoptera, which is composed of butterflies, moths, and skippers. The average life cycle is around 39-41 days and includes the stages egg, larvae, pupa, and adult (holometabolous life cycle). During the larva stage the insects are usually veniform (worm-like) and soft bodied. During the pupa stage their is reduced movement and is sometimes enclosed by a cocoon. In the adult stage the insect has wings, functional reproductive organs, and adult specific organs. Once the animal has undergone a specific developmental stage, it cannot go through earlier developmental stages. Insect growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes utilize hormone-based and neuron-based signaling. The two major hormones within [Manduca sexta] are the ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile (JH) hormones [Riddiford: 2003]. 20E regulates the timing of moting during insect development. Juvenile hormones regulate what type of molt occurs during development and regulates many adult functions [Riddiford: 2003]. Within the [Manduca sexta] stages there is a point called the commitment pulse where the insect gets signals indicating it is large enough and has enough nutrients stored to go into the adult stage [Johnson: 2018]. Based on this information, if the hormone balance was disrupted the caterpillar would not know when to go into the commitment pulse stage and it could perhaps stall or accelerate it, leading to the question of how adding different hormones like gentrol, an insect growth mimic, and azaguard, an insect growth inhibitor could affect their growth. [Manduca sexta] were a model organism to test this experiment because of their relatively short life cycle, ease to manipulate their hormone levels, and since extensive research has been done with them. I hypothesize that if the [Manduca sexta] caterpillars were exposed to gentrol that the insect would grow longer and weight more than the controll since gentrol is a hormone growth regulator and that the [Manduca sexta] caterpillars given azaguard would grow shorter and weigh less than the controll since azaguard is a insect growth inhibitor, preventing them for growing as fast perhaps. Both are insect growth regulators that alters juvenile hormones, which regulated the type of molt during development and regulates multiple functions in adult insects. 

Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, two containers with four sections were gathered and two holes were poked in each section in order to provide air for the caterpillars. Two sections in each container (4 sections total) were for the controll group and two sections on each container were for two different treatment group (2 sections for each treatment group toal).10g of food was weighed out, stirred and then placed in each square. Using a transfer pipette, 3-10 drops of water was added to the food for the controll group. For the treatment groups 3-10 drops of reagent for each treatment group (either 1: 1250 gentrol or 1: 1250 azaguard) was added to the food. The food was in a big clump to prevent it from drying out. Once the caterpillars homes were made, one caterpillar was placed in each section. The caterpillar’s length and weight was taken and tracked over the course of a week. After one week, the differences in height and weight were taken and an t_test was done comparing the gentrol group to the controll group and the azaguard group to the controll group. For the second week, the azaguard group was given gentrol to and the caterpillars receiving gentrol continued to receive gentrol. This allowed 4 caterpillars to receive the gentrol treatment. The 4 controll caterpillars also continued receiving water. After one week the caterpillars’ length and weight were recorded. A t_test was done to compare the gentrol treatment to the controll treatment.

Results:
After the first week the controll group caterpillars grew an average of 41.25 mm longer, the gentrol group grew an average of 38.5mm longer, and the azaguard group grew an average of 18mm longer (Fig.1). The controll group caterpillars weighted an average of 7.22g more, the gentrol group weighed an average of 1.935g more, and azaguard group weight an average of 1.57g larger (Fig.2). A t_test was done to determine whether the differences between the controll-gentrol and the controll-azaguard were significent. The results showed that in the length and height difference the azaguard-controll were significent, but the gentrol-controll were not significent. The p_value for the length between the controll-azaguard was 0.004876 and the p value for weight between the controll-azaguard was 0.000392. For the second week the average length difference for the controll group was -1.605mm and 1.08mm for the gentrol group (Fig.3). For the second week the average weight difference for the controll group was -14g and 4.25g for the gentrol (Fig.4). A t_test was used to test whether the differences between these groups were significent. Based on the two-tailed p values the length difference was significent (p=0.096465), but the weight difference was not significent (p=0.182954). The general trend was that gentrol caterpillars grew around the same length and weight as the controll and the azaguard grew smaller than both those groups in weight and length. Over the second week the general trend showed a decrease in height and weight for the controll and an increase in height and weight for the gentrol. The controll caterpillars were black/green and big and the gentrol caterpillars were puffy and green/black. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis, that if the [Manduca sexta] caterpillars were exposed to gentrol the insect would grow longer and weight more than the controll, was not supported, but the part of my hypothesis stating that the [Manduca sexta] caterpillars given azaguard would grow shorter and weigh less than the controll, was supported. There was no significent difference between the height and weight of the gentrol overall, suggesting that the concentration of gentrol used does not affect the growth of the [Manduca sexta]. Perhaps this is due to a small concentration being included in the food and if more of the gentrol insect growth regulator was added within the food the caterpillars would have grown bigger than the controll. Since the azaguard did significently inhibit the growth of the caterpillars, perhaps the concentration used was enough to affect the physiological processes within the caterpillars. The controll caterpillars were big and green, the gentrol caterpillars were big, plump, and light green, and the azaguard caterpillars were small and dark. One experiment found that when [Manduca sexta] were given juvenile hormones mimics, both the first and second larval instars were normal length, but the third larval instar was prolonged for 1-2 days. Another study did find that larvae that were treated with juvenile hormone grew 50% larger than they normally would have [Grunert: 2015]. In this experiment the hormone was applied topically to the dorsum, perhaps resulting in stronger effects of the hormone on the caterpillars. In a experiment where the juvenile hormones in the [Manduca sexta] were inhibited, the caterpillars appeared with a darker pigmentation and had abnormal development much like the caterpillars treated with azaguard in my experiment [Edwards: 1983]. Within this experiment it was also evident how the JH inhibitors resulted in the prevention of phase change, stalling the caterpillar’s growth and development into the pupa stage [Edwards: 1983]. The research on these hormones in these insects are important and relate to the greater issue of insect pest controll. These insect growth regulators manipulate the regulatory processes of insects that allow them to develop and reproduce. These hormone regulators are less toxic and try to target hormones which are not in other mammals, so it does not affect humans or other animals that are near the pesticide. The use of certain hormone regulators in this experiment helped to demonstrate how they affect the development of these caterpillars and perhaps shows which is more effective at it. If this experiment were to be repeated perhaps there could have been more caterpillars used under each treatment group, creating more replicates, so improve the precision and accuracy of the data. This would also help create more data in case some caterpillars were to die. I also would increase the concentration of each hormone to see if that would create a more significent effect on the insect growth.
