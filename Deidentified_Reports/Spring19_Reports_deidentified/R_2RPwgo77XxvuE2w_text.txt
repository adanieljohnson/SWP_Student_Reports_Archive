Title: The effects of salinity concentrations on photosynthesis production

Abstract:
Certain conditions and reagents play a major role in the function and output of photosynthesis. It is hypothesized that by placing spinach plants into a salt solution, then the water will favor equilibrium and rush out of the cell, leaving not enough sufficient reagents to run the reaction. The production of photosynthesis is monitored with DCIP, which changes from blue to colorless when photosynthesis is occurring. Three different groups were prepared, and each received a different concentration of salinity. Absorbances of the three groups were taken immediately, and then in increments of 10 minutes for 30 minutes. An ANOVA test was used to determine the significance of the results. The ANOVA test showed a significent p_value of 0.002, however the groups that it determined had a significent difference were not biologically relevant, and the results that were relevant showed no significent difference. The data fails to support the hypothesis. This could be due to the need for a higher salt concentration, or due to the type of plant that was used, considering that some research has suggested that spinach plants can withstand salinity stress by altering proteins. This research can be important for further discoveries, especially within the agricultural industry.

Introduction:
The complex cycles involved in photosynthesis can be affected in many ways, such as lack of sunlight, nutrients, or changes in environmental conditions. For this experiment, the change in photosynthetic output will be observed with the addition of elevated salinity concentrations. Without water and other reagents, this reaction is expected to show a reduction in chloroplast output, or even come to a halt. Chloroplast output can be monitored with DCIP, which is a molecule that upon reduction changes from a dark blue to colorless. When DCIP is reduced, it can be assumed that photosynthesis is operating normally. It is hypothesized, that if spinach plants are placed into a salt solution, then the water will favor equilibrium and rush out of the plant. This will result in little water left to facilitate the reactions in photosynthesis, which will cause a lower output from the chloroplast and a lower overall photosynthetic output. It is predicted that DCIP will remain a consistent light blue color, which would indicate that photosynthesis is not running properly. Other research has shown that under high NaCl concentrations, there was a reduction in photosynthetic output. [Goussi: 2018] This is important to note, especially for agricultural or economic purposes. It is imperative to know which plants survive and produce the best in certain conditions, or else that could affect the overall profit of farmers and the economy. For example, it would not be very logical to plant a cactus in a very wet environment, or a plant that is not resistant to salt by the ocean. 

Materials and Method:
First, the chloroplasts must be enriched by differential centrifugation and a sufficient sample must be taken. A series of centrifuging was performed on ground spinach leaves in a buffer with a pH of 8, and the three samples that were taken were then viewed under a light microscope to evaluate which sample contained the most chloroplasts. This is the sample that was used in the assay. A total of 9 test tubes were prepared: 3 containing deionized water, 3 containing 3.5% salinity, and the last 3 containing 7% salinity, each with a fixed amount of DCIP to measure photosynthetic activity. Absorbances were taken immediately by a spectrophotometer set at 600nm, and then in 10-minute increments for 30 minutes. The percent absorbances were averaged and utilized in the ANOVA test to determine the significance of the results.  

Results:
In figure 1, the absorbances of the different time increments were averaged and plotted on a line graph. As seen from the figure 1, the absorption levels changed mostly between 10 to 20 minutes, and then had a consistent average after 30 minutes. The DCIP chemical became colorless. The ANOVA test showed a significent p_value of 0.002, however the groups that it determined had a significent difference were not biologically relevant to the experiment. For example, when comparing group A at 10 minutes and group B at 30 minutes, which donâ€™t have a direct correlation to each other, the ANOVA test determined they had a significent difference. The results that were relevant showed no significent difference, for example group A and group C at 10 minutes showed no significent difference. These are the groups that would be used to determine significance, considering they were groups that differed in conditions.

Discussion:
According to the ANOVA test, the results do not support the hypothesis. No significent difference was found between the 3 groups at the 3 different time periods. There is not only statistical evidence, but also physical evidence for the rejection of the hypothesis. The DCIP changed from blue to colorless, and if photosynthesis was hindered or interrupted, the color would have remained consistent. The color change signifies that photosynthesis was running normally. The data failed to support the hypothesis, and this could be due to the need for a higher salt concentration, or because of the type of plant that was used. Researchers from the department of biotechnology from the Jamia Millia Islamia institution in New Delhi also performed a salinity experiment with spinach plants, and those results suggested that certain plants, like spinach, have different mechanisms to respond to salinity and other combined stress with unique sets of proteins. [Bagheri: 2015] In further experiments, It could be beneficial to use a different plant that has not been found to respond to salinity stress in a positive manner, or raising the salinity levels to a higher degree could impact the results in a way that supports the hypothesis, however more research would need to be conducted. This research is important for further discoveries, especially within the agricultural industry. If a plant cannot withstand salinity stress, but is planted somewhere close to an ocean, or another area of high salt concentration, the plant will not produce good yield. This could not only impact the success of the farmer, but also the agricultural economy. Further research should be done in order to determine the effects of salinity on various plants, with various concentrations in order to ensure the highest yield for local and mass-produced crops.
