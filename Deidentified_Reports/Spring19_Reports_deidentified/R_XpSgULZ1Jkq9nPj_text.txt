Title: Increasing the amount of ACH and its effect on muscle contraction in frog legs 

Abstract:
The nervous system works closely with the skeletal system and aids in muscle contraction. The skeletal system that was studied in this experiment was the frog skeletal system. In this system, Ach is an important neurotransmitter that controlls the contraction of muscles. For this experiment, we focused on the effects Ach had on the muscle contraction amplitude. We hypothesized that an addition of Ach to the gastrocnemus muscle will have a greater muscle contraction amplitude. In order to conduct this experiment we were given a total of 3 frog legs per trial, and we observed the contraction of the muscle without any Ach and then with Ach. We focused on the average contraction amplitude for the two groups and observed that the contraction amplitude for the Ach group was less than the controll group which disproves our hypothesis. We believe that the addition of Ach caused the muscle to twitch rapidly and then induce tetani which would explain the lower muscle contraction amplitude. Overall it would be very beneficial to repeat the experiment and focus more on how Ach is related to tetani in order to ensure that we collect the most accurate data.


Introduction:
The nervous system is an extremely complex system of nerves which sends signals from the brain and spinal cord to various parts of the body. Additionally, the nervous system works to respond to different environments very similar to how the hormone-based system does. However, the nervous system is much more efficient with sending signals because, unlike the hormone-based system, the nervous system sends signals to different parts of the body much more quickly through electrical impulses. The nervous system works very closely with the skeletal system and aids in muscle contraction. The skeletal system that we paid close attention to in this experiment was the frog skeletal system. Many parts of the muscle are involved in muscle contraction and they all work to compliment each other. For a muscle contraction to occur it requires a stimulus that can be created into a response/ contraction, after that acetylcholine vesicles merge to the presynaptic membrane as a result of their being an influx of calcium. The Ach receptors then cause a light depolarization due to an increased sodium entry which opens the ryanodine receptor and finally, the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases the calcium into the cytoplasm. Once the calcium is in the cytoplasm it binds to troponin which exposes the actin-myosin binding sites and results in the contraction of the muscle [Wang: 2014]. In the past there was one specific experiment very similar to what we wanted to do that explored how Ach played a role in muscle contraction. They isolated a frog leg, injected Ach, and shocked the sciatic nerve in the gastrocnemus muscle. Their main purpose for doing this was to explore the effects of Ach on muscle contraction [Brown: 1937]. Therefore, after reading through this experiment we wanted to follow a very similar procedure and observe the differences in muscle contraction between a frog leg treated with Ach, and a frog leg without treatment of Ach. In order to test the effects of Ach on muscle contraction, we isolated the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from a dissected frog leg, shocked the nerve (imitating a stimulus), and observed the contraction of the muscle. We hypothesized that the addition of Ach to the gastrocnemus muscle would result in the muscle contraction amplitude to be greater than the controll group amplitude because an increase in Ach in the muscle would cause the muscle to have a higher tension for a longer period of time.


Materials and Method:
In order to determine the effect Ach had on muscle contraction we studied frog legs. To begin we dissected a frog leg without anything added to it and attached the gastrocnemus muscle to a force transducer. In order to simulate an action potential, we administered a shock to the sciatic nerve through electrical probes which resulted in the gastrocnemus muscle to contract. Using the force transducer, we were able to record the average muscle contraction amplitude. After we recorded our data for the first frog leg, we injected 0.1mg of 10 Ml Ach into the same frog leg and again attached the sciatic nerve to the force transducer and administered a shock. Once the shock was administered, we again recorded the average muscle contraction amplitude. After we finished collecting both controll and experimental data for the first frog leg, we repeated the whole procedure again with two more frog legs and then averaged all of our results. After all of the data was collected, we conducted a paired t_test to determine if the data for the muscle contraction amplitude for both groups was statistically significent.


Results:
Overall the frog legs that were injected with Ach had a lower contraction amplitude than our controll group. The average contraction amplitude for the controll frog leg group was 1.149V +/- 0.187V and the average contraction amplitude for the group injected with Ach was 0.966V +/- 0.045V. In order to determine the significance of our results, we conducted a paired t_test. Our results were (t-value: 1.172, P-value: 0.362, d.f.: 2). While conducting the experiment we observed the contractions for both the controll and experimental group. It was clear that the contraction of the muscle for the experimental group was smaller, when looking at the two average muscle contraction amplitudes, than the controll group which is also clear given the recorded averages.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that adding excess Ach to each frog leg in each trial would increase the contraction amplitude was not supported by our experiment. Based on our results the contraction amplitude went down after we added Ach which was not what we expected to occur. Ach is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the nervous system by stimulating muscle contractions. Given this background knowledge, when constructing our experimental design plan, we expected that when Ach was injected into the frog leg muscle, and a shock was administered, that it would result in the muscle to contract with a stronger force causing the contraction amplitude to be larger than the controll group contraction amplitude. However, our results do not support our hypothesis. The results that we got are not wrong, instead it was our ideas about how Ach would affect the muscle that was incorrect. In order to determine where the experiment went wrong, we needed to reevaluate every step of the experiment and figure out what exactly we could change in order for the results of the experiment to support our hypothesis. There are many things that could have contributed to our results being what they were, for example maybe tetani was induced since there was so much Ach in the muscle which could have been what caused the muscle contraction to be smaller than the controll group. In a study done that focused on the relationship between Ach and Tetani, it was found that the injection of acetylcholine in low concentrations can result in many quick twitch-like responses which will eventually lead to tetani being induced [Brown: 1937]. This result is an example of something that could have occurred in our experiment that we did not realize, and that we should have spent more time observing. Therefore, in the future in order to get results that support our hypothesis we need to change what we are exploring and figure out exactly what is going on. As a result of this we should focus on tetani and how adding more Ach to the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg would make the same muscle fire twice much more quickly rather than making that muscle fire once and be stronger. As a result, tetani would have been induced and the muscle contraction amplitude would have been smaller than the controll group. Since our results did not support our hypothesis it would be very beneficial to our understanding of Ach to repeat the experiment and observe the effects of Ach on tetani. In the future we could do an experiment where we inject different amount of Ach into each frog leg and observe which frog leg reached tetani first. In order to get accurate results we would have to use many more legs in case there was any error in any of the frog legs. This future experiment would allow us to fully understand the relationship between Ach and tetani which would be very beneficial to our knowledge of how muscles function.

This data was collected during our experiment during each of the three trials for both groups, and then the average muscle contraction amplitude was calculated which is displayed in the graph. The error bars displayed are one standard deviation from the mean. We observed the muscle contraction amplitude weakening when we injected Ach (t-value: 1.172, P-value: 0.362, d.f.: 2).
