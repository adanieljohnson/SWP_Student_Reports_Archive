Title: The effect of sodium channel blocker on the contraction threshold of a frog gastrocnemus

Abstract:
Neuromuscular signaling demonstrates the connection between the nervous and muscular systems. In studying this connection, this experiment aimed to look at the relationship between the use of a sodium channel blocker and the threshold voltage at which a muscle contracts. The leg of a Rania pipiens, a northern frog, was used during this lab, as its gastrocnemus muscle is easy to separate from the other leg muscles. We hypothesized that with an injection of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, into the gastrocnemus muscle, a lower action potential would be produced. This meant that more energy would be needed in order for contraction to occur. Three frog legs were used, each as their own controll and experimental group, and the threshold voltages for the initial contraction were recorded in each leg before and after the injection of lidocaine. The experiment showed a trend with the average threshold values, but analysis through a one-tailed paired t_test revealed that the data was not significent. The information gathered during this experiment and others similar provide a greater understanding of the molecular changes that allow for the neuromuscular system to function. 

Introduction:
The muscular system cannot work without the nervous system, as the nervous system generates an action potential that stimulates muscular movement. The neuromuscular system has a level of specificity where it can target individual areas of the body for movement. The endocrine system, in contrast, distributes hormones into the blood for transport throughout the entire body. As an action potential is generated through the nervous system, it continues along the Nodes of Ranvier of a neuron’s axon, allowing the excitation to travel to the muscle. This stimulates contractions, a process assisted by insulating myelin sheath on the axon [Tasaki: 1952]. Contractions that are produced as a result of the action potential can be recorded on myograms to evaluate its amplitude and force. The force of the contraction is dependent on the energy generated through changing concentrations of sodium and potassium, which determine if threshold potentials are reached. Sodium channels allow charge carriers to move across a membrane, depolarizing the cells, and driving an action potential beyond its threshold value [Starmer: 2003]. Contractions are easy to see in the leg of the Rania pipiens, a type of northern leopard frog, as the separation of the gastrocnemus muscle from the rest of the leg is a simple process. The gastrocnemus muscle in this specific organism is incredibly strong in terms of its contractions, as frogs move using jumping movements created by the leg muscles. We hypothesize that if we inject sodium channel blocker into the muscle of a frog leg, then a lower action potential will be generated, resulting in a delayed contraction of the muscle.


Materials and Method:
To test our hypothesis, we utilized three frog legs, each as their own controll and experimental group. Each leg was skinned, and the inner thigh muscles were separated to reveal the sciatic nerve, of which the probe was laid under to provide stimulation. The gastrocnemus muscle was then detached from the leg and suspended from the force transducer by a string. This transducer was connected to the LabScribe program to show the myograms for each contraction. For the controll group, a stimulus had been applied to the first frog leg, starting at 0.0 V and increasing by 0.1 V intervals until a threshold voltage for contraction was reached. This threshold voltage, as well as the amplitude of the contraction, was then recorded for the leg. A final stimulation was presented at 0.1 V above the threshold, and the amplitude of that contraction was recorded as well for reference. 0.1 Ml of sodium channel blocker, specifically 25 millimolar lidocaine, was then injected through a syringe into the gastrocnemus muscle. We waited 3-5 mins before the next stimulating in order to allow time for the channel blocker to being working. The same procedure of the LabScribe program was used again, and the threshold value and consequent amplitude of the contraction were recorded. The process for the controll and subsequent experimental trails were then repeated for the next two frog legs, and the threshold values were averaged. A one-tailed paired t_test was used to analyze the data, with the determination that a significent difference was present with a P-value less than 0.05.


Results:

Throughout the experiment, there were obvious differences in threshold values between each frog leg of the controll group. Qualitative observations showed that the twitches, or contractions, were absent at very low voltages, but were obvious at the threshold value. The contraction of the muscle at a stimulation 0.1 V above the threshold was visibly stronger, and this was also reflected by the amplitude of the contraction present on the myogram. When the sodium channel blocker was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the experimental group, the threshold value for a contraction increased on average. Figure 1 helps to visualize this data, showing that the mean for the experimental group was higher than that of the controll group. Although, the standard deviation for the experimental group was much greater, as depicted by the error bars in the graph. The one-tailed paired t_test showed that these general trend conclusions are not significent, as the p_value was calculated to be 0.335.

Discussion:
The general trend seen in the data was that the input voltage at which threshold was reached was higher for the experimental group than the controll group, as we predicted in our hypothesis. The evaluation of our one-tailed paired t_test value, though, led to the conclusion that our results were not significent, suggesting that the trend we saw in the data is most likely due to chance. This insignificent data thus cannot answer the question of the effect of sodium channel blocker on the contraction of a muscle. In an experiment that studied the effects of lidocaine on the contraction of the heart, it was discovered that many other elements changed the duration and amplitude of the contraction, such as the concentration of the drug, the transmembrane potential, and the pH. It was also noted that the lidocaine used dissociated from the sodium channels rather quickly [Echt: 1989]. Original differences between the threshold values of each Rania pipiens leg were accounted for by the fact that all organisms and their respective processes are different. The other factors mentioned, though, were not originally considered in this experiment, as we did not have the necessary equipment to measure and record external influences. Without taking this information into account for our own experiment, the data cannot be considered consistent between each frog leg. A study similar to the experiment performed found that the spread of a contraction can be prevented through the decreasing of extracellular sodium concentration, as it blocks the depolarization in tissues [Constantin: 1970]. Using this information, a future experiment should maintain the same hypothesis, but a larger frog sample size should be used to increase the chance of obtaining significent data. Data collection could be made more accurate by measuring the output amplitudes after the action potential reaches threshold, or the amount of sodium channel blocker could be changed for a greater observational difference between the controll and experimental group. It is important to study the neuromuscular system, as it is an organism’s process for one of its most recognizable functions: movement. Studies concerning the neuromuscular system help create a greater understanding of the molecular changes behind this normal action.
