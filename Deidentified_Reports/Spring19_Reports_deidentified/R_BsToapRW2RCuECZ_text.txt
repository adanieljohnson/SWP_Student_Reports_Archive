Title: The Effect of an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) on Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
In many insect species, good health trade-offs exist between maximizing body length and weight. Understanding how various species evolve different life history strategies requires knowledge of the physiological mechanisms underlying the regulation of body size and developmental timing. Here, the roles of an insect growth regulator (IGR) in the regulation of the final body length and weight were examined in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The expectation was that the insect growth regulator hormone will increase the length and weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. Ratios would be much greater in the treatment group than the controll group.  Measurement in the treatment group compared to the controll group in order to see the difference in length and weight. Our data showed no significent difference in both groups. The goal of our experiment was to see if the length and weight would increase over time for 14 days to an addition of an insect growth regulator (IGR). Also, our hypothesis was rejected.

Introduction:
Growth controll has important consequences for an organism’s life cycle. Body size can change the organism’s reproductive output as well as performance. Also, developmental time also has an important effect on an organism’s life cycle, especially in geographic locations with seasonality. These two aspects of growth, however, exhibit fitness trade-offs, maximizing body size tends to lengthen the developmental time, whereas accelerating developmental time necessitates the truncation of the growth period, resulting in smaller adult forms [Hatem:2015]. Selection, therefore, molds body size controll and developmental time regulation in a taxon-specific manner. Therefore, this experiment evaluates the influence of hormones on insect development. The Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta, is a common pest of plants and weeds. Caterpillar known as hornworms, due to their worm-like body shape and the presence of a small, pointed horn at their posterior. The adult stage of Manduca sexta is a heavy bodied moth that resembles a hummingbird. The larval stage (hornworm) of this species is more often encountered, as it is residing on the host plant during the day and can cause significent defoliation of economically important crops.  Also, the acquisition of steroidogenic complete by prothoracic glands of last instar Manduca sexta larva is regulated by juvenile hormone (JH) [Johnson:2018]. We hypothesized that if we expose Manduca sexta caterpillar to an addition of an insect growth regulating (IGR) hormone, then their weight and length will increase.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillar that weighted between 0.75 and 0.90 grams and 3 to 4 cm long were selected in day 1. We divided them into two groups of four. One group is the controll and the other is the treatment group.  We prepared our container by puncture holes in the plastic container to allow the airflow for our insects using the hole tool. We then labeled the plastic container number 1 to 8, our group name and the TA, section, and labeled each box as treatment or controll using a sharpie. With a scale for weighing, We measured 10 g of food for each Manduca. We zeroed out the scale before weighting to get an accurate number. For the controll, we took the 10 g of food for each caterpillar and placed in the plastic container and used the pipet to transfer 5 drops of distilled water into the food. For the treatment group, we did the same but instead of distilled water, we added 5 drops of our reagent which was the precore. Precore is an IGR the mimics the effect of Juvenile hormone. We stirred well to mix it with the caterpillar food diet. We kept the food in a big clump because this helped it to not dry. We took measurements and we kept track of our individual caterpillars. We also checked their food. If the food dried out, we replaced it with new 10 g for each caterpillar an addition to the 5 drops of either distilled water or precore hormone. Finally, we placed our container in an incubator. We trashed the used pipets, towels, and weighing container in the waste bin. We closed the reagent and put the food in the fridge, and we cleaned everything out. We measured their weight in grams using the scale weighting and length in centimeter with our Ruler, cleaned their feces, added caterpillar food diet if needed, and kept their environment clean for 14 days. We used one-tailed two-sample t_test (p_value) to analyze our results.

Results:
In the controll group, the mean and standard deviation weight was 6.59g and the mean and standard deviation weight for the experimental group was 6.63g. the mean and standard deviation length for the controll group was 6.69 cm and the mean and standard deviation length for the treatment group was 6.67 cm. the mean and standard deviation of the weight in the controll group was not statistically significently different than the mean and standard deviation weight of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.0269, d.f. = 26, p = 0.4894) [Fig. 2]. The mean length of the controll group was also not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.0381, d.f. = 26, p = 0.4849) [Fig. 1]. On day 9, one of the caterpillars in the experimental group died. In the final ten days, the caterpillars began to lose weight [Fig. 2].

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) will increase the weight and the length for both the controll and treatment group, was not supported. We rejected our hypothesis because we observed no significent difference between controll and treatment, suggesting that insect growth regulator, specifically the reagent we used precore, did not affect the length and the weight in Manduca sexta. It is possible that the insect growth regulation (IGR) had no effect on the length and weight, thus failing to inhibit their ability to identify and interact with other Manduca sexta. [Hatem:2015] Additionally, we could have had an experimental error such as failing to refill their food as often, or they were lacking air flow through the containers. This could suggest that the Manduca sexta were still able to identify the difference between the two groups in their length and weight from their shape, behavioral patterns with us while we measured their length and weight, and movements. While there were not many significent data available, there is some possible improvement that could have resulted in the acceptance of our hypothesis. For example, if we had doubled the amount of IGR in the treatment group to improve our study. The weight, as well as the length, could have increased more over the course of 14 days, seeing an upward trend. Understanding the Manduca sexta's life history in the context of environmental variation and the relatedness of development and behavior could further our understanding of the adaptive functionalities and evolutionary success of development and effect if insect growth regulator in Manduca sexta as well as other living species with possible altered hormones.
