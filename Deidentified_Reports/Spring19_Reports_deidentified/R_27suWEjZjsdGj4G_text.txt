Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca Sexta and their Growth Development

Abstract:
Hormones are an integral part of any organism’s biological development. In particular, the role of insect hormones is crucial for their lifecycle and growth. Looking specifically at the Manduca Sexta, three hormones dictate the stage of life the caterpillars are in: juvenile hormone, ecdysterone, and prothoracicotropic hormone. Focusing on juvenile hormone, it was expected that adding juvenile hormone to the diet of a caterpillar would prolong the juvenile stage and prevent the caterpillars from pupating. The data showed that there was a statistically significent difference between the caterpillars fed with JH and the controll group. The implications for the knowledge that JH can inhibit pupation of caterpillars can be applied to real-world applications such as pesticides or insect growth.

Introduction:
Tobacco Hornworms, or Manduca Sexta, contain three key hormones that regulate their lifecycle: ecdysterone, juvenile hormone, and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). Ecdysterone, or E20, regulates the timing of molting, juvenile hormone, or JH, regulates the type of molt, and PTTH regulates the release of ecdysterone. Manduca Sexta goes through four stages of life: embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. During the larvae stage, the caterpillars go through five instar phases that references their size and growth. During the last instar phase, before pupating, JH levels drop in the caterpillar while a slight bump of ecdysterone, called the commitment pulse, triggers the caterpillar to initiate pupation. Even more important, “During the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm the presence of juvenile hormone (JH) inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)” [Nijhout & Williams: 1974]. By regulating JH, the caterpillar’s developmental stage can be prolonged past the fifth instar. In the experiment conducted, the growth of two groups of caterpillars was monitored to observe the effects of excess juvenile hormone in the system of the tobacco hornworms. We hypothesized that the addition of juvenile hormone to the caterpillar’s food would prolong the juvenile state for an indefinite period of time and prevent the caterpillar from pupating.

Materials and Method:
Two groups of caterpillars, four in each group, were given 10 grams of food each. The controll group was given standard caterpillar food with drops of water while the experimental group was given standard caterpillar food with 4 milliliters of juvenile hormone per 10 grams of food. Both caterpillars were kept in an incubator to assure no differences in environment could influence their growth or health. The weight and appearance of the caterpillars was then recorded daily over a two-week span; new food was given each day with their prospective diet. The weight was recorded using a standardized scale. A two sample T-test was then used to evaluate the average weight change of the caterpillars fed with JH in their diets and the caterpillars that were just fed the standard diet

Results:
The average change in weight for the JH fed group was 7.65 grams and the average change in weight for the controll group was 2.86 grams (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the JH fed group was 2.18 and the standard deviation for the controll group was 1.62 (Figure 1). By using a standard two-sample t_test, the average change of weight between the JH fed group and the average change in weight for the controll group was statistically significently different (t_stat= 3.877, d.f.= 6, p_value= 0.00409). The JH caterpillars also grew 4.79 more grams than the controll caterpillars (Table 2). Over the 14-day period, significent differences could be seen in the color of the caterpillars. The juvenile hormone fed group stayed a light green color for all 14 days, while the controll group started to turn brown around the 7th day. Two caterpillars in the controll group also displayed full pupation on the 10th day

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in a caterpillar would prolong the developmental stage and prevent pupation, was supported. The results indicate that juvenile hormone stopped pupation because the p_value was less than 0.05 and indicates a statistically significent difference between the controll group and the experimental group. It is evident that JH has a significent effect on the development of Manduca Sexta. Researched in a past study, the process of how JH stops pupation is that “JH blocks the release of PTTH rather than the ability of the larvae to respond to PTTH” [Nijhout & Williams: 1974]. With the knowledge that JH inhibits the caterpillars from becoming adults, research into JH pesticides and their effects could be useful for not only regulating insect growth, but also insect hatching. Further research into the role of insect hormones could be beneficial for insect population controll among human inhabited areas.
