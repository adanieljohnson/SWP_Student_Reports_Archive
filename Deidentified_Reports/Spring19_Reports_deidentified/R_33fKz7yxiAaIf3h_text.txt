Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Life Cycle of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, also known as tobacco hornworm, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. It pupates to adult stage through the molting process. The level of Juvenile Hormone controls Manduca sexta’s molting process. We conducted an experiment to testify our hypothesis that if we increase the level of juvenile hormone, the weight of Manduca sexta will remain low. The results of significance in p-value demonstrated that the alternative hypothesis was accepted. However, it indeed showed that JH is related to Manduca sexta’s growth. Further research should include more samples with different JH concentration.

Introduction:
Hormones are special chemical messengers produced in an organism and transported within the body that control most major bodily functions. Manduca sexta, also known as tobacco hornworm, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, same order with moth, butterflies etc. It has 8 stages in its entire life cycle from egg to 5 instar larval stages, then become a pupa, and finally an adult [Kingsolver: 2007] [Haworth: 2017]. There are certain hormones essential to the development and phasic transition of hornworm for it to pupate. Three of the main hormones are Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). PTTH produced by corpus cardiacum regulates the release of ecdysterone by prothoracic glands. Ecdysterones are steroid hormones secreted in prothoracic glands, and different insects have slightly different 20E. Juvenile hormone (JH) esterase activity was found in the plasma of larvae, pupae, and adults of Manduca sexta [Jesudason: 1990]. It produced by corpus allata also differ a little bit in each insect, but most of JHs act in the same way [Kiguchi: 1978]. 20E and JH control the insect’s stage of development by controlling their timing and type of molting. Molting, also known as shedding, is the process that animals cast off a part of its body. For insects, molting is the process when they secrete a new outer layer and shed the old one, which allows them to change size or morphology. Insectile growth stages are separated by molts, and especially the metamorphosis process between larval stage to the pupa stage. Research done by Venkatesh (1988) shows that there is a peak of JH level during the last instar stage [Jesudason: 1990]. Therefore, the level of JH is highly related to the growth of insects, and we were experimenting with this possible relationship with Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta is a great species in examining the effect of the hormone on insectile growth due to its distinguishing features by comparing the markings on the body of larvae and abdomen of the adults [Haworth: 2017]. We hypothesized that if we increase the level of juvenile hormone, the weight of Manduca sexta will remain low.

Materials and Methods:
We set two groups of Manduca sextas with 4 caterpillars in each group. All Manduca sextas were cultivated in the same incubator with same moisture, light condition, and temperature. Each of the Manduca sexta received the same 10 grams of food with 8 drops of JH mimic (IGR) being added to the experiment group, and the control group received 8 drops of water instead. Foods were replenished, and feces were cleaned for every other day. The weight and condition of each Manduca sexta were recorded every day for 2 weeks. We calculated the total change of the weight for each caterpillar and computed the average of change for each group. One-tailed two-sample t-test was used to compare the mean of the change in weight of the experiment group and control group, which showed the growth disparities between two groups. P-value was calculated through 8 caterpillar’s total change.

Results:
The total change of weight of the controlled group ranged from -0.18 grams to 10.83 grams, and 10.11 grams to 15.18 grams for the experimental group (figure 1). The average change in weight for the controlled group is 5.32 grams and 13.135 grams for the experimental group (figure 2). The standard deviation of the total change of weights is 5.51 for the control group and 2.70 for the experimental group (table 1). The p-value of the total change of weights for the two groups is 0.01, which is significant (table 1). The caterpillar 3 in the control group was not in good condition at the beginning of the experiment, and it was reported as died on day 9. Therefore, the data collection of caterpillar 3 within the controlled group stopped on day 8.

Discussion:
The P-value between the total change of weights between the control group and experiment group is significant which indicates that results would not likely to be observed under the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis would more likely to be supported [Tests of Significance]. Therefore, our hypothesis - if we increase the level of juvenile hormone, the weight of Manduca sexta will remain low – cannot be confirmed. We can see that Manduca sexta with JH mimic grows averagely faster compared with those without JH mimic. Previous research done by Hsiao T. and Hsiao C. (1976) with the greater wax moth had revealed the decline in JH level during the last larval stage together with the increase in 20E and PTTH (Molting Hormone – as they described in their research) level. They suggested that the decline in JH level allow the release of Molting Hormone to initiate metamorphosis [Hsiao:1977]. However, we are unable to make any causation correlation conclusion from the data we currently got during this experiment to state that increasing level of JH caused weight gain in Manduca sexta [Tests of Significance]. It is fair enough to inform people about the importance of hormones that would bring to organisms. Understanding the effect of Juvenile Hormone on insectile development is essential to understanding insects’ metamorphosis and puberty. Further research could involve more samples with different concentration of JH mimic to gather more data on the correlation between insectile growth and JH level.
