Title: The Phenotypical Plasticity Effect of Nitrogen on Pisum sativun

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity is the plant's ability to respond to different environmental changes and their response to allocating resources. Nitrogen is an important nutrient for plants because it helps the plant grow and build proteins. Pisum sativun is a type of field pea and is an ideal plant to grow rapidly and in a cool environment. In the lab, root, and shoot length and weight ratio were used to examine the effects of three different nitrogen concentrations over a three-week period to compare differences between resource allocation. It was found that there was no significent difference between the three treatments of nitrogen on weight to shoot length and weight ratio, ultimately accepting the null hypothesis and rejecting the alternative hypothesis. Nitrogen did not affect the root to shoot length and weight ratio due to the fact that nitrogen had been previously shown to help in seedling and flowering production. Some further studies to help encourage statistical differences between different nitrogen concentrations would be a longer time of growth for the field peas. 

Introduction:
Plants are able to grow and survive in vast living environments and conditions due to their phenotypic plasticity. Resource allocation is a term commonly used to describe the pattern in which species distributes and uses its limited resources. Individuals can modify certain allocation patterns and adapt them to different living conditions and environments. Based on a previous study, it has been shown that species adjusted their biomass between shoots and roots in response to differences in light and nutrient availability [McConnaughay: 1999]. Below the ground, a plant takes up water and many essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Plants change in how they allocate their energy and resources based on their living conditions and which nutrients are available for their use. This term is formally called phenotypic plasticity, and it describes the plant's ability to allocate resources based on its environmental conditions. A previous study showed that a population of different plant species of two different genotypes responded differently, growth wise, to nitrogen supply [Robinson: 1988]. The plants with a lower concentration of nitrogen had a higher concentration of nitrogen in the shoots but the nitrogen in the roots of the plants was reduced. Based on these studies, different nitrogen concentrations were used to examine the root to shoot weight and length ratios of Pisum sativun. Pisum sativun, therefore, should be expected to have higher shoots with a higher concentration of nitrogen. Pisum sativun was an appropriate organism to use in this experiment because they grow rapidly in the cool, moist weather, similar to a greenhouse environment. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient for plants because it is a component of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll helps the plant with photosynthesis specifically with taking the sunlight energy and produced sugar out of it. Nitrogen is also a major component of amino acid, an element of protein and without protein, the plant will die. Nitrogen concentration affects resources allocation because if there is more nitrogen in the roots, the plant will grow longer shoots because it has ample resource of nitrogen. The latter would happen if nitrogen was not abundant in the roots, the roots would be longer than the shoots.  In this lab, phenotypical plasticity was measured by increasing the concentration of nitrogen in the Pisum sativun, a field pea, and then examining the effect on the root: shoot length and weight ratio. In this lab, the root to shoot ratio is the measurement used to exemplify resource allocation. Because nitrogen is so important for the shoots of a plant, it is hypothesized that with a decreased presence of nitrogen in the soil, there will be a higher root: shoot ratio.

Materials and Method:
Pisum sativun were planted in 9 different bins, all with vermiculite. Three bins had 50 milliliters of. 25 concentrated Miracle-Gro fertilizer, another three bins had 50 milliliters of  .50 concentrated Miracle-Gro fertilizer and another three bins had 50 milliliters of .100 concentrated Miracle-Gro fertilizer. They were watered and observed every day for 2 weeks in a greenhouse. After the second week, the plants from each bin were randoMly chosen to be measured and weighed. Three separate plants were weighed from one bin. The three plants were weighed together, and the roots were separated from their shoots by cutting each plant at the root to shoot junction. The three shoots were then weighed and root mass was recorded by the total mass minus the shoot mass. The maximum shoot length and root length were recorded to the nearest millimeter and the mean value was recorded. This was then repeated 8 more times for every bin. Root to shoot length and weight ratios were calculated for each of the nine bins. The biomass of the root was divided by the biomass of the shoot. The mean values for root to shoot length and weight ratios were found, and the standard deviation was determined from those values. An ANOVA test was conducted comparing the three different treatments of nitrogen and 0.05 was used as the critical value. 

Results:
The root: shoot weight ratio, the results showed an average of 1.462±0.265 for 100% concentrated nitrogen, an average of 1.511±0.128 for 50% concentrated nitrogen and an average of 1.936±0.502 for 25% concentrated nitrogen. For the root: shoot length ratio, the results showed an average of .905±0.135 for 100% concentrated nitrogen, an average of 1.202±0.155 for 50% concentrated nitrogen and an average of 1.493±0.385 for 25% concentrated nitrogen. The results from the following experiment showed that the three different treatments of nitrogen on Pisum sativun had no significent difference. The ANOVA test concluded that there is no significent difference between ratio: shoot length value of the three different nitrogen treatments (f-stat:4.14, d.f.: 8, p:0.074) (Figure 2). The ANOVA test concluded that there is no significent difference between ratio: shoot weight value of the three different nitrogen treatments (f-stat: 1.806, d.f.: 8, p:0.243) (Figure 1). 

Discussion:
Due to the non-statically significent results, our hypothesis was not supported and the three different treatments of nitrogen did not have an effect on the root to shoot length and weight ratio. A previous study found that biomass allocation patterns of nutrient were less substantial than that of sunlight allocation patterns [McConnaughay: 1999]. An additional study found that the phenotypic response, specifically the mean root, was the least plastic effect for three different grass species and there was little difference between species in overall plasticity [Robinson: 1988]. Field peas have been previously studied and it has been shown that they fix two sources of nitrogen, the atmosphere and the soil, which tends to make studying nitrogen in fields pea more complex. [Sagen: 1993] It was also shown that in field peas, nitrogen deficiency led to a decrease of seed production and flowering termination [Sagen: 1993]. Nitrogen does not have an effect on shoot and root length because the nitrogen is utilized for flowering and seedling production. This explanation provides evidence that the root to shoot length and weight ratios would not be affected by nitrogen. This is due to the fact that nitrogen is a more important resource for reproduction rather than survival, and therefore would not influence resource allocation.  The next step for this study could involve growing the field peas for a longer period of time or using a different organism. The time used to grow these plants showed that there was little difference between the weight and lengths of root: shoot, but having a longer period of time for growth could produce significently different results. An error in our study could have been that field peas can receive nitrogen through the atmosphere, and this may have caused the 25% concentrated nitrogen plants to receive more nitrogen through the atmosphere then through the soil. Also, Miracle-Gro contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, so the other nutrients, phosphorus, and potassium could have been compounding factors. Overall, understanding the phenotypical plasticity in Pisum sativun can help further studies of plant variation and understand better how to successfully grow plants in different environments.
