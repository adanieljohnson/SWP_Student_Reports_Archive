Title: Intraspecific agonistic interactions in the Betta splendens and their response to a replica fish

Abstract:
When the male Betta splendens is in the presence of another male of its species, the Betta engages in aggressive or agonistic behaviors in order to defend its territory (the Betta’s means of survival and reproduction). These agonistic behaviors are displayed through broadside and facing movements (including the protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes). This study compared the behavior of a male Betta when visually exposed to another male Betta to the living male Betta’s behavior when visually exposed to a replica male Betta. The number of red mane episodes, the duration of the red mane episode, and the number of broadside movements were counted in the male Betta in both the real fish and fake fish trials. A two-tailed paired t-test was conducted and found there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Because of the Betta’s dependence on visual cues, we can conclude there was no difference between groups because the Betta could not determine that the fake fish was synthetic because of the clear plastic divider. Although these agonist behaviors require large amounts of energy expenditure, the benefits outweigh the risks in the Betta’s effort to protects its means of survival and reproduction. 

Introduction:
Many of the unusual behaviors of animals can be attributed to their goals of survival and reproduction. In the male Betta splendens, or Siamese fighting fish, the intraspecific and agonistic behaviors exhibited towards other male Bettas is an example of an action performed for a survival and reproductive advantage [Johnson: 2018]. The male Betta’s show of aggressive dominance allows them to defend their territory and all possible female mates within that territory [Oliveira: 1998]. These excessive shows of agonistic behavior send a signal to other surrounding Bettas, allowing the Bettas to assess the dominant power of the defending Betta. 

These agonistic behaviors can be categorized into two types of movement. This first is a broadside movement where the fish turns its side towards its opponent. Typical behaviors in this movement in order of increasing aggressiveness include moving the pelvic fin vertically (pelvic fin flickering), sudden movements with its caudal fin (tail beating), and the closing and reopening of the caudal fin (tail flashing). The second type of movement is a facing movement. In this movement typical behaviors in order of increasing aggressiveness include facing the opponent with pectoral fins rigid, spreading of opercula (gill covers), and protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes creating a flash of red color. Once these behaviors are displayed, the other betta can respond by fleeing, ignoring the behavior, or escalating the situation by showing increasing agonistic behavior [Johnson: 2018].  

We will be testing the male Betta’s response to a realistic replica of a male Betta fish. We will have a control group where the male Betta is physically but not visually separated by another living male Betta. Our experimental group includes the visual exposure of a living male Betta to the detailed replica of a male Betta. We hypothesize that the male Betta will exhibit a greater amount of agonistic behaviors when visually exposed to another living male Betta than when visually exposed to the replica male Betta. 

Materials and Methods:
Each aquarium was divided into three compartments via a clear glass partition and a white opaque plastic partition to both physically and visually isolate the fish. One male Betta was placed into each of the three compartments (N=3). The opaque divider was removed in between fish 1 and fish 2 and their behavior was observed. The number of red mane episodes, the duration of the episode, and the number of broadside movements were recorded in fish 1. The opaque divider was then replaced to once again visually separate the Bettas. The Bettas were then given 5 minutes of rest time. This procedure was then repeated with fish 2 and fish 3 and the behaviors of fish 2 and 3 were observed and counted. No fish was exposed to the same fish twice. 

Fish 1 was then visually exposed to the fake male Betta for 5 minutes while observing and recording the same behaviors (the number of red mane episodes, the duration of the episode, and the number of broadside movements). This visual exposure to the replica male Betta was repeated with fish 2 and 3. We conducted a two- tailed paired t-test to compare the results. 

Results:
In each of the 3 aggressive behaviors counted, the male Betta exhibited a noticeable difference in the average amount of red mane exposures (Figure 1), the average duration of red mane exposures (Figure 2), and the average number of broadside movements (Figure 3). However, the two- tailed paired t-test showed there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. The mean number of displays of the red mane of the male Betta, when exposed to another real male, was not significantly greater than its mean when exposed to the fake fish (t-stat=1.43, df=2, P=0.29). The mean duration of displays of the red mane of the male Betta, when exposed to another real male, was not significantly greater than its mean when exposed to the fake fish (t-stat=2.14, df=2, P=0.17). Finally, the mean number of displays of a broadside movement of the male Betta, when exposed to another real male, was not significantly greater than its mean when exposed to the fake fish (t-stat=2.33, df=2, P=0.14).

Discussion:
We reject our hypothesis that the male Betta will exhibit a greater amount of agonistic behaviors when visually exposed to another living male Betta than when visually exposed to the replica male Betta. Our results and the paired t- test showed there was no significant difference between the displays of agonistic behaviors displayed in a single fish between the two treatment groups. A possible explanation for this lack of a significant difference between treatment groups is the presence of a physical barrier between the real Betta and the replica Betta. The real Betta and the replica Betta were separated by the glass partition during the observation period. Therefore, the living Betta was unable to approach the replica Betta to determine its artificiality. The Betta was only allowed to utilize visual cues in classifying the fake Betta as a threat, as demonstrated through its display of agonistic behaviors. 

Studies in zebrafish have found that a living zebrafish showed a preference towards a three-dimensional model zebrafish with attraction measured by time in proximity to the model fish. The study concluded that zebrafish depend on visual signals to perceive and analyze interspecific reactions [Ruberto: 2016]. These findings can be applied to the Betta fish. The living male Betta visually perceives the model Betta intruding in its territory. The Betta then begins displays of agonistic behavior to assert dominance. In this particular study, the Betta must depend solely on its vision to assess the situation because of the glass partition. 

These agonistic displays of aggression are extremely resource costly. For example, a study done on male shore crabs found that glucose levels were significantly decreased after a show of dominance [Dissanayake: 2009]. The Betta also risks the possibility of injury or mortality by engaging in these agonistic behaviors. However, the benefits outweigh the risks and the male Betta employs these displays of behavior to defend their territory, the source of all resources (future survival) and mates (reproductive success).

Limiting factors of this study include the lack of realism of the replica Betta and its lack of robotic movement. Studies on the interspecific interaction of zebrafish contained a 3D printed zebrafish attached to a robotic arm [Ruberto: 2016]. This allowed for a more realistic fish replica. This study could be modified with a more realistic replica that could interact and respond to the living Betta with the display of the red mane. This study could also be performed by studying the intraspecific behavior of the real betta and the replica Betta when placed in the same tank. The number of agonistic behaviors in this situation could be compared to the number of behaviors of 2 living male Bettas placed in the same tank. 

This study can be practically applied to fishing industries. Although we cannot conclude that all species of fish rely on visual cues, fishermen can use this principle to disguise hooks and lines so fish do not visually perceive them. This study can also be used to explain the complex behaviors of other species. For example, a wolf may engage in agonistic, intraspecific behavior towards other males of its species to maintain and defend its territory. The wolf’s motivation in doing so is driven by the same basis as the Betta; both species seek to increase the probability of future survival and reproductive success.
