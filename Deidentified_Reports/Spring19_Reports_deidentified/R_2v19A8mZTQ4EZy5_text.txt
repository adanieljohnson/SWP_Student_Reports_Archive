Title: Effects of Tubocurarine, A Muscle Paralytic, On Gastrocnemius Contraction in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The gastrocnemus muscle in a Rania pipiens leg goes through excitation-contraction coupling to contract. Excitation-contraction coupling is the process in which muscles contract because an action potential sparks a chain of events that end up causing the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and allowing myosin to bond to myosin binding sites on actin.  It is hypothesized that tubocurarine, a muscle paralytic, will lower the threshold amplitudes of the Rania pipiens leg contractions. Three Rania pipiens were used and served as both the controll group, the legs prior to injection, and the experimental group, the legs after injection of tubocurarine. The muscles contractions were measure using LabScribe and a force transducer. It was found that tubocurarine does result in a lower threshold amplitude in the Rania pipiens legs because tubocurarine competes with acetylcholine nicotinic receptors and prevents communication and action potential pathways. 

Introduction:
The nervous system gives organisms the ability to sense and initiate a response to internal and external stimuli. The nervous system is very fast and allows for stimulus response in milliseconds. Nerves connected to the muscle, motor neurons, stimulate muscle contraction through a process called Excitation-contraction coupling. During this process, action potentials travel along the axon and arrive at the neuromuscular junction and depolarization occurs due to the release of Acetylcholine, or ACh, from the presynaptic terminal. ACh binds to receptors on the muscle fiber membranes and causes the opening of sodium channels. The action potential spreads and goes down the T-tubule causing the DHP receptor to dislodge from the Ryanodine receptor. Once this occurs, Calcium exits the sarcoplasmic reticulum and floods the muscle. The calcium bonds to troponin and changes its conformation allowing myosin binding sites to be revealed. The myosin heads bind to their binding site on actin and use ATP to walk along them. This process causes muscles to contract, and they continue to do so until calcium is depleted, or ATP is depleted. This process occurs in the gastrocnemus of the Rania pipiens because their muscles undergo these processes. [Cooper: 1965] Tubocurarine, a muscle paralytic, causes slight paralysis when a small dosage is given and complete paralysis when a large dosage is given under proper conditions. The curarizing effects begin within two to five minutes of the injection and, in a small dose, last between ten and twenty minutes. [Everett: 1947]. It is hypothesized that if one milliliter of tubocurarine, the muscle paralytic, is injected into the gastrocnemus of the Rania pipiens leg, then the muscle threshold amplitude will be lower than normal. 

Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens legs were obtained and placed in a dissecting pan. Forceps were used to pull the skin off of the leg. A dissecting probe was used to separate the inner thing muscle to reveal the sciatic nerve being careful not to let metal come in contact with the nerve. Frog Ringerâ€™s solution was used to ensure the legs stayed moist throughout the experiment. On one leg the gastrocnemus was cut loose at the Achilles tendon towards the foot and a string was tied around the tendon tightly. The string was then attached to a force transducer. The muscle was strung at a ninety-degree angle. This was achieved by the use of pins holding the leg down and the string being pulled tautly. A probe, connected to the force transducer, was placed under the freed sciatic nerve. A computer was used to power an application, Lab Scribe, that initiated shocks and delivered them to the sciatic nerve to cause a contraction in the gastrocnemus. The computer recorded the amplitudes, measured in volts, of the muscle contractions. Shocks were delivered in the following voltages: 0, 0.1, 0,2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0. Occasionally, shock voltages were changed to determine a more accurate threshold. The amplitudes recorded by the computer were also entered into a table in a lab notebook, and the threshold was clearly labeled. Using the same Rania pipiens leg, the experiment was ran again, except the gastrocnemus was injected with one milliliter of tubocurarine, and after it had time to rest for five minute to ensure maximum paralysis, the experiment was ran the same as before. The process was repeated for the remaining two frog legs. Once completed, a paired t_test was used to calculate the significance of the experiment using the thresholds determined by the experiment. It is important to note that the three Rania pipiens legs served as the controll group and the experimental group; the controll group being the legs prior to injection and the experimental being the legs after injection with the paralytic. 

Results:
There was a significent difference in the threshold amplitudes of the controll group versus those of the experimental group. The threshold amplitudes of the experimental group were lower than those of the controll group (t_stat = 5.918702, d.f. = 2, P = 0.027379), as shown by Figure 1.  Control leg one had a threshold of 1.16 whereas experimental leg one had a threshold of 0.898. Control legs two follows the same trend as controll legs one, meaning the experimental threshold remained lower than the controll. Control leg two had a threshold of 0.541 whereas experimental leg two had a threshold of 0.293. Once again, as seen in the first two legs, experimental leg three remained lower than controll leg three. Control leg three had a threshold of 0.282 whereas experimental leg three had a threshold of 0.137. 

Discussion:
The significent difference indicated by the paired t_test supported our hypothesis that said if tubocurarine is injected into the Rania pipiens leg, then the threshold amplitude will be lower than normal. The threshold amplitude of the Rania pipiens legs that received the tubocurarine injection were lower because the muscle paralytic, tubocurarine, competes with acetylcholine and blocks the transmission of action potentials and information. The nicotinic receptors are not allowed to dock acetylcholine because of tubocurarine [Stone:2007]. Essentially, tubocurarine gets in the way of acetylcholine which results in decreased transmission of action potentials and information. The method used during the procedure worked well because they allowed for a simple, but clear, experimental procedure. In the future, I would not change any part of the method. Future studies should be done on further effects of muscle paralytics like tubocurarine, especially how they could have an effect on humans. The experiment is relevant because it could possibly lead to new discoveries about muscle paralytics and could be used to treat disorders like Tourette syndrome and muscle spasms in humans because small amounts of muscle paralytics can cause temporary paralyzing effects dependent on the dosage and size of the organism receiving it [Everett: 1947]. It could also be used in minor surgical procedures to prevent muscle movement as well.
