Title: Effect on Timing of Tetany When Injecting Calcium Channel Activator into Gastrocnemius of a Rania pipiens

Abstract:
	The nervous system uses calcium to cause the release of neurotransmitters which activate action potentials and eventually muscle contraction. Calcium channel activators are thought to affect the process of muscle contraction due to the increased presence of calcium in the axon terminal. In order to test this activatorâ€™s effect on muscle contraction and more specifically the timing of tetany within the muscle, we measured the time of which tetany was reached within the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens before (controll) and after (experimental) injecting said muscle with 0.1 Ml of a calcium channel activator, 1MM A23187. We hypothesized that when injected, the muscle will be able to reach tetany at a faster rate due to the increased presence of calcium. In order to test this, we stimulated two frog legs with the threshold voltage until tetany was reached before and after treating the muscles with calcium channel activator. After using a paired t_test to determine if the experiment produced statistically different results. Due to the fact that our p value was above .05, our data was not considered statistically different and we were not able to support our alternate hypothesis.


Introduction:
The nervous and muscular system is able to communicate through neurotransmitters in order to cause contractions in the muscular system. When an action potential, caused by a sodium influx into the axon, reaches the axon terminal it causes the release of calcium through calcium channel activators. This influx of calcium allows neurotransmitter vesicles to bind to the membrane and release the neurotransmitter, in this case acetylcholine, which will cause a second action potential in the following axon and eventually the T-tubules. This action potential then causes a conformational change of the ryanodine and DHP receptors which allows calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This calcium binds to troponin which causes tropomyosin to move away from the binding sites of actin and myosin. This then allows myosin, with the presence of ATP, to bind to actin and produce a power stroke and contract the muscle. Calcium Activators, such as 1MM A23187, are thought to affect this process of muscle contraction by increasing the amount of calcium within the axon terminal which would in turn allow for a more efficient release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Hazell explains that these activators lead to alterations in membrane potential and disturbances in calcium homeostasis [Hazell: 1998]. This can affect how the neuromuscular process functions. It is important to not only understand the process of muscle contraction but also how it can be affected through external chemicals due to the fact that it could foster further research within the medical field. Although this experiment is conducted on a Rania pipiens, it can directly affect the human population due to our similar process of muscular contraction. We tested the effect of calcium channel activators on the process of muscular contraction by measuring the time at which tetany was reached within the muscle before (controll) and after (treatment) the gastrocnemus was treated with a calcium channel activator known as 1MM A23187. We predicted that the treatment group would be able to reach full muscle contraction, tetany, quicker than the controll group due to the increased presence of calcium in the axon terminal.


Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis, we measured the time at which tetany was reached within the muscle. First, we removed the skin from the leg and separated the upper leg muscles to isolate the sciatic nerve. We then cut the Achilles tendon and attached it to IXTA isolated simulator while the tendon remained connected to the gastrocnemus muscle. When then used the computer software to stimulate the muscle with a threshold voltage and increased the frequency by two beginning at 10Hz until tetany was reached. We determined the tetany of the muscle by reading the live graph produced by the software. We predicted that tetany was reached when the graph increased quickly leveled out and had minimal to no bumps throughout. We then recorded the frequency at which this was achieved. After, we injected the muscle with .01 Ml of 1MM A23187 and measured the time at which tetany was reached through the process explained above. When then repeated this process with the second and third leg and recorded the results. After we recorded our data, we used a paired t test to calculate the p values of the measured values in order to determine if our data was statistically significent.


Results:
The frequencies at which tetany was reached of the experimental group was not statistically different than our controll group (t_stat = 4.0, d.f. = 2, P = 0.057). In all three legs in the table above, the frequency values of the experimental group were higher than that of the controll group. Also, the differences between the controll and experimental group frequencies in all three legs were very similar with an average difference of 2.6Hz. The first leg had a significently higher frequency values at which tetany was reached than the last group while the second leg obtained values in-between the two.   	
 


Discussion:
From our results, we were not able to determine the effect of the calcium activator on the tetany of the gastrocnemus muscle due to the fact that we were able to support our null hypothesis which states that the variables were not statistically different. An influx of calcium is able to initiate the binding of vesicles that hold neurotransmitters to the wall of the axon terminal so that the neurotransmitter can be released into the synapse. If a calcium channel activator is introduced to this process, calcium would flow into the terminal without the use of an action potential. Although, based off of our experiment, this calcium channel activator had no effect on the frequency at which tetany was reached. In an experiment similar to this one, Kenny treated rats with a calcium channel antagonist, fluispirlene. He found that similar to this lab, it had little effect on the calcium channel induced muscle contraction [Kenny: 1990]. The next logical step in our experiment would be to change how we measured tetany within the muscle. Calcium channels may affect the time at which tetany is reached rather than the frequency. Also, we could have increased the amount of frog legs used in the experiment to decrease the significance of external factors that affected our results. Furthermore, we could make sure to measure the exact moment at which tetany was reached to improve the accuracy of our results. Fatigue also could have had a significent effect on the frequency values obtained due to the fact that frequency values of the treated group, measured after the controll, were always higher than that of the controll. Lastly, we could have altered the amount of activator administered to the separate legs. This could possibly give us a better understanding of what extent calcium activators alter muscular processes. Although our experiment showed no significance, it is important to understand this process and the effect of channel activators due to the fact that it has the potential to affect medical research and eventually the public. In conclusion, calcium channel activators could have a possible effect on the function of muscles. Although, our results did not show a significent difference between the measurements of the controll and experimental group. Due to this, we were not able to determine if calcium channel activators had an effect on the tetany and overall contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle within the Rania pipiens.
