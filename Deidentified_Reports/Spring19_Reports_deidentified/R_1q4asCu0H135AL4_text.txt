Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta Development 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillar’s growth cycle and development are dependent upon both Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). 20E triggers the timing that the larvae will molt; whereas, JH determines the type of molt. So, this lab tested the effects of JH on the development of Manduca sexta on a controlled and experimented group. JH was added to the diets of the experimental group. It was hypothesized that by increasing the amount of JH given to the caterpillars there will be a decrease in average final weight. Thusly, the hypothesis was rejected based on the outcome of the experiment and data analysis. So, the experimental group's final average weight did not decrease in comparison to the controls final average weight.



Introduction:
The purpose of this insect hormone experiment is to test and determined the result of JH (Juvenile Hormone); similar to an insect growth regulator (IGR), on two groups of four larvae Manduca sexta caterpillars that are 11-12 days old. Over their life period, the caterpillars will go through various molting periods triggered by their hormone Ecdysterone (20E). Then in its life cycle, JH will trigger the type of molt in development once the 20E triggers a molt. “JH plays a key role in the development of insects from embryo to adult” [Sanburg: 1975]. So, if JH is high it will prevent it from molting and remain as larvae. However, in the presence of high JH, it can also cause the caterpillars abnormalities that reduce their insect survival rate via low egg hatch rate and especially by inhibiting and limiting maturation. Ergo, by increasing the amount of JH given to the caterpillars there will be a decrease in their average final weight.

Materials and Methods:
The eight Manduca sexta caterpillars approximately 12 days old and 1.5 – 2.5 grams in weight were divided into two groups of four. Then they were placed into two four-cell containers with air holes and kept in a controlled environment (incubator 28˚C with constant light). Two diets were derived for the two groups. Diet one was a control diet where Four caterpillars receive 10g of Manduca sexta food plus 60 microliters of water each. Then diet two was given to an experimental group of four caterpillars that received 10g of Manduca sexta food plus 60 microliters of JH analog (precor 1:1250) each (refilling as needed for low food and dehydrated food). The weights (g) and observations were recorded daily over the course of the experiment (11 days). Once all the data was collected an average growth was calculated and a two-sample t-test was conducted to analyze the data and outcome.

Results:
The average mean weight growth of the control group was 0.7465 grams per day, while the experimental group was found to be 0.7425 grams per day. This depicted that there was a ±1 standard deviation of the data, which can be seen in figure 1. So, to properly analyze the results a two-sample t-test was ran which concluded that due to the p-value being 0.475 which is greater than 0.05 the results are not statistically significant. This depicted that the results from the average of the final weight of the control group were not statistically different from the experimental group.

Analysis of the results and observations offered insight into trends seen throughout the experiment. The beginning of the first week the observations depicted that the control and experimental groups were growing at a steady rate with the control group growing at a faster rate. Both of the groups were also a greenish blue color and produced a substantial amount of fecal matter daily. However, towards the end of week one and start of week two, the control group became more sluggish and lethargic while also seeming to turn orangish-brown in color and recoiled into themselves but slowed in their weight gain. On the other side, the experimental group was gaining weight at a consistently slow rate. They also required more replenishment of their food and clean up in their container. The experimental also began to get a slightly orangish color change towards the last day of the experiment  


Discussion:
The hypothesis stated that by increasing the amount of JH given to the caterpillars there will be a decrease in average final weight. However, this alternative hypothesis was rejected, and the null hypothesis was then accepted. This was rejected because the data analysis was determined to be not statistically significant at 0.05. Although, the lab noticed that there was a slight inhibition in the growth weight and molting process due to the JH; however, the number of caterpillars going into a molting phase was higher in the control and not present in the experimental group at all. So, the JH seemed to slightly inhibit the commitment pulse in the experimental group resulting in no molting to occurring. So, in essence, there were some differences between the control and experimental groups; however, the differences were deemed not statistically significant enough thus rejecting the alternative hypothesis and affirming the null hypothesis. This occurred most likely because there was not sufficient JH added to the food source for the Manduca sexta larvae. The JH can affect the larvae ability to pupate. Ergo, if the lab had administered more JH droplets to the larvae food than the hypothesis would have been more successful because there would have been a greater difference created.
