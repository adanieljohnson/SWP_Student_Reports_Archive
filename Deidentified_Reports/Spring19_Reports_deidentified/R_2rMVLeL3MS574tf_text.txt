Title: The Effect of Precor IGR on Manduca Sextas Life Cycle

Abstract:
Hormones are an important study in biology looking at the effects it has on the body and its various functions. They send signals throughout the body regulating growth stimulating specific cells to perform specific tasks. Ecdysterone and juvenile hormones are both found in manduca sextas helping the organism regulate growth and development. The brain of the organism lowers the juvenile hormone levels while increasing the ecdysterone to start the process of pupating. In the experiment, we added Precor, an insect growth regulator that is an analogue of the juvenile hormone, in the treatment group to see the growth effects on manduca sextas. We hypothesized that the high level of juvenile hormones will cause the insect to not pupate and decrease in size. The data shows a decrease in average length for the treatment group and an increase in the control. However, the hypothesis is rejected because the weight and length of the treatment group was not statistically significant from the control group. 


Introduction:
This experiment looks at the effect of hormones on insect development. Hormones are chemicals that send signals to the body and control physiological development. The brain releases electrochemical outputs with hormones controlling behavior, growth and physiology. A Manduca sextas life cycle consists of development, molting, pupa formation and adulthood. [Nijhout: 1974] Life cycles can vary depending on their living conditions and diet. The ecdysterone hormone is a type of steroid hormone that manages when an insect should molt and controls other developmental functions. Juvenile hormones are produced in the prothoracic glands controlling the type of molt an insect should development. Both hormones work simultaneously together in order to keep the animal alive. Once the body has enough nutrients to form into an adult moth, it goes into commitment pulse where the brain releases an increase of ecdysterone and juvenile hormones are low. This experiment manipulates the juvenile hormone level with an insect growth regulator, Precor. The Precor added in the treatment group’s food will serve as the independent variable while the length and weight of the insects will serve as the dependent variables. It is hypothesized that since the low levels of juvenile hormones trigger the commitment pulse, the Manduca sextas exposed to Precor will lose weight and decrease in length thus having a less chance of survival. 


Materials and Methods:
First punch two holes on all eight containers and label the containers with numbers 1-4 distinguishing which are the control and treatment. Then weigh ten grams of food for each eight Manduca sexta. Stir each 10 grams of food separately mixing in either 8 drops of the Precor analogue of JH for the treatment group or 10 drops of distilled water for the control group. The weight, measured in grams, and length, measured in centimeters, of each manduca sexta was measured daily for the duration of fourteen days and stored in an 25 degree celsius set incubator. Food was replaced roughly after every one to two days depending on how much was consumed. A two sample T-test was run to test the null hypothesis and the mean difference between the treatment and control group of Manduca sextas.


Results:
A two sample t-test was conducted to compare the treatment and control group of the Manduca sextas. The mean weight of the control group was not statistically significantly different than the experimental group (t-stat= 0.85, df= 26, P= 0.40). Furthermore, the mean length of the control group was not statistically significantly different than the experimental group (t-stat= 1.17, df=26, P=0.25). The average length of the control group increased between day four and seven going past the treatment group but declines back on day seven; however, day six had the largest standard deviation out of all the average control lengths. (Figure 1) After day twelve, the average control length increased while the treatment group began to slightly decrease. (Figure 1) The standard deviation for control weight is significantly higher than the others ranging from 0.12 to 3.857. The average weight control group began to increase after day three surpassing the treatment’s average weight. (Figure 2) After day twelve, the weights for both treatment and control both decreased. (Figure 2)

Discussion:
Our collected data rejects the hypothesis since the results in weight and length was not statistically significant as reflected in a p-value greater than 0.05. However, the average length of the treatment group did show a decline. Past research has found that injecting manduca sextas with juvenile hormones stopped it from being able to begin pupating. [Nijhout: 1974] This experiment can be run again for a longer duration to see if the manduca sextas in the control group actually pupate while the length and weight of the treatment group declines significantly. The idea that injecting insects with juvenile hormones to lower their chances of survival can help humans develop an insecticide to kill what people consider “pests” like the Manduca sextas. In the long run it will allow scientists to control the population of the pests in a certain environment making it beneficial to people like farmers. Farmers can eliminate or decrease the pest population in their crops.
