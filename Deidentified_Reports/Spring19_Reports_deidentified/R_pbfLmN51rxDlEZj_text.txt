Title: Agonistic Behavior Between Male Betta Splendens of the Same Color and Different Colors

Abstract:
Betta splendens display a range of intraspecific agonistic behaviors in male:male interactions. This experiment focuses on the impact of color on the interactions of male Bettas; specifically, we question whether aggression differs in interactions between fish of the same color and fish of differing colors. We chose to analyze the effect of pigmentation because it has been demonstrated that Bettas have the ability to discriminate based on color, and in other species of fish, it has been determined that color may be a behavioral strategy. The duration of the display of red mane (the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane) was used to quantify the aggressive behaviors of individual Bettas. The tested hypothesis was that the duration of the red mane display would be higher in interactions between different colored fish than between fish of the same color. After four timed interactions between two red and two blue Bettas, our data did not support the initial hypothesis. The results demonstrate that there is no significant difference in length of red mane display based on color; however, it is possible that the tendencies of individual fish could have skewed our results, and that an increased sample size or slightly modified experiment could yield different results. 

Introduction:
This experiment focuses on the intraspecific agonistic behaviors of male Betta splendens (Bettas), a species also referred to as Siamese fighting fish, which originated in southeast Asia and have since then become common aquarium fishes. In the wild, male Bettas are a dull gray/green color, and their color shifts to a bright red or blue upon the arrival of another male. Domestic Bettas have been selectively bred to maintain their fighting colors at all times. In the presence of another male, these fish will also display a range of agonistic behaviors, categorized as either broadside or facing movements [Johnson: 2018]. Broadside movements are exhibited as the fish has turned its side towards the other male, and are distinguished by pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements are characterized by a male Betta facing the approaching male with its pectoral fins erect, and as aggressiveness increases, spreading his opercula, and finally (most aggressive), the male will protrude its branchiostegal membranes, creating what is referred to as a red mane [Johnson: 2018].
	Our experiment focuses on the question of whether aggression differs between male Bettas of the same color and Bettas of different colors. We chose to focus on color differentiation in displays of aggression because it has been demonstrated in past experiments that Bettas can comprehend differences in color [Thompson: 1965]. Additionally, in the same study, data suggested that male Betta’s coloration was an important aspect in determining operant reinforcement strength, and that responses by male fish responded most to reinforcer coloration when the color was different from its own [Thompson: 1965]. 
The duration of red mane displayed during the interactions between fish will be used to quantify the aggression. My hypothesis is that the amount of time the red mane is displayed will be higher in interactions between different colored Betta splendens than between fish of the same color. 


Materials and Methods:
Two red Bettas and two blue Bettas were used to in this experiment; they were referred to as R1, R2, B1, and B2 to avoid confusion and to organize fish pairing. In order to prevent habituation and to ensure the fish had enough rest before and between interactions, an opaque wall was left between them while the activities were not being observed. The first activity we observed was the interaction between R1 and R2. As a precaution against the males physically attacking and injuring each other, a clear glass wall was left between them even after removing the opaque wall. We set a timer to five minutes when the interaction began, and started it as soon as the visual barrier was removed. One person timed the total amount of time red mane was displayed by R1 while another person timed the total amount of time red mane was displayed by R2. The total time was quantified by starting the timer as soon as the fish began displaying red mane, pausing when the display stopped, and restarting as soon as it began again for the duration of the five minutes. At the end of the interaction, the visual barrier was replaced, and the Bettas were left to rest for another five minutes. This process was repeated for the interactions between B1 and B2, R1 and B1, and R2 and B2, and the corresponding data was recorded in a table. We used a two sample t-test to determine if there was a significant difference in red mane display for same color male Betta interactions compared to different color interactions.


Results:
Our results show that there is no significant difference in time red mane is displayed between male Betta splendens of the same color compared to Bettas of different colors (Fig. 1). We used a two sample t-test to analyze our results. The average time spent with red mane displayed between fish of the same color was not significantly different than between fish of different colors (t-value=0.2189, df=6, p-val=0.417). 



Discussion:
The hypothesis that the duration of red mane displayed would be greater in interactions between different colored male Betta splendens compared to interactions between Bettas of the same color was not supported by our results. I expected there to be a difference in behavioral response to color due to existing data supporting the fact that Bettas can differentiate between color, and that coloration is an important variable in determining operant reinforcement strength [Thompson: 1965]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated in a study on the male cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni that body pigment may be a behavioral strategy [Korzan: 2008]. Although our results could demonstrate that color has no impact on intraspecific agonistic behaviors in Betta fish, it is possible that varying levels of aggression in individual fish skewed our results. The blue fish we used displayed very little aggression during their interaction, and one individual was mostly unresponsive to the presence of another male, regardless of color. It is also possible that the presence of a female during the interactions could impact the degree of aggression displayed; it has been discovered through experimentation that both female presence and the availability of females to competing males can bias agonistic behaviors in male-male interactions [Polgardani, 2017]. Improvements to this experiment could include increasing sample size to avoid the bias of unresponsive individual male Bettas and adding activities monitoring the aggressiveness of red and blue Bettas in male:male interactions with the inclusion of a female of the same species.
