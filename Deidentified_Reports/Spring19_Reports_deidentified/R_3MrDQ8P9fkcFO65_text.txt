Title: CAFFEINE ACTS AS STIMULUS TO INCREASE STRENGTH OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION IN RANA PIPIENS      

Abstract:
Caffeine is commonly used by endurance athletes for its desirable effects on muscle stamina. This study further documented the effects of caffeine on athletic performance by observing the relationship between caffeine and the strength of muscular contractions in the legs of Rania pipiens. A force transducer was used to apply an electrical stimulation to three separate frog legs, and the strength of their muscular contractions was recorded with and without caffeine. It was assumed that the muscles would contract more strongly in response to the stimulation after they had been injected with the caffeine. For all three trials, the results were overwhelmingly significent, and the muscle contractions nearly doubled in strength as a result of the injection; the caffeine even triggered a state of chemically induced tetany in two of the trials. However, because the caffeine was injected directly into the muscle, it is uncertain whether the effects would be as drastic if the caffeine were metabolized instead.

Introduction:
All animals are capable of locomotion thanks to a responsive system of interacting nerves and muscles. When a stimulus is applied to a nerve cell, it can trigger an action potential, which then moves down the nervous system until it reaches the muscle. This prompts a series of chemical releases which then activate the contraction mechanisms of this muscle, causing it to shorten [Johnson: 2018]. The contraction of agonist and antagonist skeletal muscles allows for the controllled method of movement that is unique to all animals [Johnson: 2018]. Other factors outside of an action potential can influence the muscular contraction mechanism, which affects how the muscle moves and activates. For example, substances such as caffeine are known to affect the muscle contraction mechanisms. Caffeine in particular is commonly used as an ergogenic aid by athletes seeking to increase their athletic performance by increasing their muscular strength or stamina [Green et al.: 2018]. Caffeine is also known to produce muscle cramping in high doses, and while this may be attributed to its role in fluid loss [Lowengrub: 1999], this would only explain muscle cramping over long term exposure to caffeine. This study sought to further examine the immediate effects of caffeine when administered directly to the muscle by observing the muscular contractions in the legs of Rania pipiens. Frogs like Rania pipiens use their strong hind legs to propel themselves on land and in water, making them the perfect candidates for observing the effects of caffeine on a major muscle group. A muscle contraction can be stimulated in the leg using a force transducer to apply an electrical shock, which mimics the natural motor nerve impulse. Injecting the frog leg with caffeine and using a myogram to measure the contraction produced by applying electrical stimulation will demonstrate if and how caffeine alters the normal contraction of the muscle. Based on what is already known about how caffeine effects muscular contractions when consumed by humans, it is assumed that if the frog muscle is injected with caffeine, the following contractions will be noticeably stronger.  

Materials and Method:
This experiment used specimens of adult Rania pipiens to demonstrate the effects of caffeine when it is injected directly into the muscle. First, three freshly detached frog legs were degloved to expose the muscles. The gastrocnemus muscle was then detached from the bone and a string was tied around the Achilles tendon. The string was then used to suspend the gastrocnemus muscle from the force transducer at a 900 angle to the rest of the leg, which was pinned onto a lab tray to keep it in place during the stimulation. It is very important to note in this process that the muscle should come into minimal contact with any metal implements.
Once the leg had been set up on the tray and connected to the force transducer, the probes were inserted directly into the gastrocnemus muscle. A baseline should be established by applying a stimulation of 5 pulses at a width of 5 ms, an amplitude of 1 volt, and a frequency of 1 Hz. Once the baseline has been recorded the myogram should be left running while 0.1 Ml of caffeine at a concentration of 200 mM is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle. Any muscular contractions produced by the caffeine will be recorded on the myogram and any visible reactions should be written down. After the caffeine has been injected, a second stimulus should be applied using the same settings as the first stimulus. Once the stimulus has ended, the myogram should be turned off and the strength of the muscle contractions before and after the caffeine injection should be measured by finding the difference between the points of peak contraction and rest for each of the 5 pulses. This process should be repeated on each of the three frog legs. Finally, a paired T-test using the data from all three trials should be completed to determine the statistical significance of the difference in the strength of the muscular contractions before and after the caffeine injection.


Results:
All three frog legs experienced a drastic spike in the strength of the muscular contractions after being injected with the caffeine. The average strength of contraction for all three legs before caffeine was 0.603 V, while the average strength of contraction for all three legs after caffeine was 0.999 V. Additionally, the physical condition of the muscle was noticeably different after the leg had been injected with caffeine. In all three cases, the muscle felt firmer and less elastic after it had been injected and electrically stimulated. In the second and third leg, the muscle was visibly contorted at the injection site and became fully tensed before any electrical stimulation had been applied. A paired t_test showed that these differences were statistically significent (t_stat= 13.5, d.f.= 14, P= 2.13x10-9).

Discussion:
The results of this experiment successfully supported the hypothesis that injecting caffeine into the muscle of Rania pipiens would increase the strength of the muscular contractions. As figure 1 shows, the muscle contractions were much stronger in all three legs, almost doubling in amplitude each time, after the caffeine was injected. Furthermore, the effect of the caffeine was so strong that in the 2nd and 3rd trials, no electrical stimulus was needed to cause the muscle to contract. In both cases, the muscle contracted immediately and was visibly distorted at the injection site by the strength of the contraction. The myogram shows that the injection of caffeine alone was enough to force the muscle into a chemically induced tetany. In this newly established “resting” state, the electrical stimulation did very little to further contract the muscle. Even in the first trial where the observed response was not as drastic, the muscle still experienced a much stronger contraction from the electrical stimulation after it was injected with the caffeine. 
Caffeine’s stimulating effect is due to its impact on the chemical process of a muscular contraction, specifically the way it increases the amount of calcium into the muscle. Increasing calcium in the muscle also increases the number of individual myofibrils that can contract, which in turn increases the strength of the contraction. This information and the data gathered from the study suggests potential benefits of using caffeine both for endurance athletes who wish to increase muscular stamina and for athletes who wish to exert more power; however, it is important for athletes to consider two things before chugging a Red Bull. First, while the caffeine successfully increased muscle strength, it also induced severe cramping and muscle fatigue. The physiological response of the 2nd and 3rd legs is highly undesirable for an athlete looking to enhance performance because it would impair their movement and muscle function. Even the first leg felt tighter to the touch as a result of caffeine, which could lead to exercise associated muscle cramps [Pagel: 2014] and eventually injury. Second, the effects of caffeine in this case were caused by directly injecting it into the muscle, whereas most athletes utilize caffeine through metabolization. For this reason, it cannot be conclusively stated that an athlete who consumes caffeine, either through food or beverage, before performing an athletic activity will have increased muscle strength. For this reason, it would be interesting to observe the effects of caffeine on muscle strength after being absorbed through the GI tract. Unfortunately, this experiment would be difficult to set up with frogs as they would need to be alive while establishing a baseline of muscular strength in order to then feed them caffeine. Additionally, there would need to be enough time between the caffeine consumption and the secondary muscle testing to allow the caffeine to be sufficiently absorbed, which would make the procedure very time consuming. Until this study is conducted, we can only conclude that caffeine significently increases muscle contraction strength when it is directly injected into the muscle in question.
