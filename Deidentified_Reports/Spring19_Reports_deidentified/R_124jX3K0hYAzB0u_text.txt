Title: Resource allocation of Fagopyrum esculentum in a nitrogen rich environment 

Abstract:
This lab’s goal was to look how a plant allocates in resources in response to its environment. Specifically, how a nitrogen rich environment would influence the distribution of resources for the Fagopyrum esculentum, also commonly known as Buckwheat. We hypothesized that if buckwheat is exposed to a Nitrogen rich environment, then there will be an increase in the root to shoot ratio. Meaning that the plant will allocate its resource to the roots in order to absorb more nitrogen to support the plant’s development. This experiment was done by comparing the experimental nitrogen group’s weight root to shoot ratio to the controll group. Furthermore, we calculated and compared the experimental nitrogen group’s length root to shoot ratio to the controll group. After conducting this experiment, we observed a statistically significent difference between the two groups for both the length and weight’s root to shoot ratio. This supports our hypothesis of an increased root to shoot ratio in the experimental nitrogen group. 

Introduction:
When observing a species of plant, one would notice that this plant would looks slightly different when it is in two different environments. It is even seen when looking at a tree located at the edge of a forest and that same species of tree located in the center of the forest. This differentiation is caused by the plants ability to allocate its resources in response to abiotic factors. Based on environmental factors like wind, temperature, humidity, or soil nutrients, the plant can allocate its resources accordingly to maximize its growth in that specific environment [Johnson: 2016]. One of the best ways to measure this resource allocation is looking at the Root to Shoot Ratio for both weight and length. This root to shoot ratio helps researchers see if the plant is putting more of its resources into the roots or into the stem of the plant. A separate study was able to determine that when a plant was exposed to excess Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur, an observable increase in the development of the roots, increasing the Root: Shoot Ratio [Agren: 1987]. This made us curious to see if Nitrogen alone would have the same effect on the development of the shoots. In our experiment, we hypothesized that if Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) was exposed to a highly rich Nitrogen environment, then there will be a greater root to shoot ratio than the controll. The main reason why we chose buckwheat is because it is a native plant to the North Carolina region and that it is highly influenced by its environment. It also grows fairly quickly in almost any environment.



Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we first determined what plant we wanted to study and what abiotic factor we thought would affect resource allocation. After determining that, we planted buckwheat seeds in 4 separate pots, 2 labeled controll and 2 labeled experimental. We then watered every pot with 50 Ml of water and 50 Ml of Miracle grow. We placed the plants in the greenhouse and returned every day for a two-week period and watered the controll pots with 100 Ml of water and then watered the experimental group with 100 Ml of the miracle grow solution, containing nitrogen. After two weeks, we harvested the plants and separated out 10 individuals from the controll group and 10 individuals from the experimental group. We separated the root from the shoots by cutting the plant at the root-shoot junction. Then we measured and recorded the weights and lengths for each of the roots and shoot for the individuals in the controll and the experimental. Lastly, we calculated the root: shoot ratio for weight and length for the experimental and controll group. We then calculated the mean and the standard deviation for each group and then used an unpaired two tailed T-Test to determine if our data was significent. 

Results:
In this experiment, we observed some good data. As seen in Table 1, we observed in the controll group a Root: shoot ratio for the weight to be  and the root: shoot ratio for the length to be  Then in the experimental nitrogen group, we found the weight’s Root: shoot ratio to be  and the length’s root: shoot ratio to be . Then after doing a unpaired two tailed T tests, we found that our results were significent for weight (DF=18, T=4.59, P=0.0002), as well as the length (DF=18, T=6.11, P=). 



Discussion:
Overall, I think this lab was a success. We determined that both of our data supports our hypothesis because the P value for the weight was 0.0002 and  was below the 0.05 confidence interval. This supports our hypothesis of the experimental Nitrogen group has a higher root to shoot ratio than the controll group. This is because with sunlight not being a limiting factor, the plants can allocate their resources to their roots so they can absorb more nutrients to support the ample amount of sunlight. Our data is also supported by another lab’s results. They observed a significent increase in the root to shoot ratio for velvet leaf (46-82%) as well as corn (29-45%) [Bonifas: 2005]. We observed one flaw within our experiment, and that was that our experimental nitrogen group was almost dead. We believe this occurred by over exposure to the nitrogen, that we pretty much fried the plants. For future experiments, I would lower the exposure to nitrogen in our experimental group with the hope that the plants can survive under these conditions. Lastly, this experiment is relevant because it provides farmers and botanists with the knowledge that over exposure to nitrogen can kill your plants, high exposure can increase the allocation of resources to the roots more than normal soil.
