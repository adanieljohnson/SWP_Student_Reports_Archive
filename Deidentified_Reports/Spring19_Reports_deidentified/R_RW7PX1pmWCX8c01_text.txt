Title: The effect of salt water on the Root: Shoot ratio in length of buckwheat

Abstract:
In the experiment, we used buckwheat to study the effects of sodium chloride solution on the root: shoot in length. In order to respond to various environmental factors and resource limitations, plants use resource allocation to strategically deal with scarcity like solar energy, water or nutrients. Plants with larger R:S ratio tend to spend more energy developing a root system in order to absorb more nutrients. Smaller R:S ratio indicates that plants grow more shoots to obtain more solar energy. In the lab, four containers of buckwheat were watered every other day. Two of them received water and the other two received salt water. Two weeks after, R:S in length was measured for each group. The result showed a significent difference between two groups. The buckwheat grown in the salty environment had a much larger R:S ratio in length. Further study could be made on other plants for more specific and accurate results and for future application of the strategy. 

Introduction:
In an ecological community, all the resident plants and animals interact with and adapt to each other [Johnson]. The most important resources plants required are water, nitrogen and solar energy but these resources are usually limited. A plant may utilize more energy and mass to grow a particular structure instead of spending the energy elsewhere. For example, the understory in the rainforest usually allocates most of the energy under the ground since the solar energy is largely blocked by other trees and hard to be obtained. Lower plants are forced to evolve well-developed root system in order to compete with same species for nutrients. An effective way to measure this allocation is the root: shoot ratio. The larger the ratio, the more developed the root system is. In the experiment, we studied the effects of salinity on the root: shoot ratio of buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum. Buckwheat has strong adaptability and grows quickly so it is an ideal plant to use in the study. Treatment of an appropriate concentration of NaCl improves the nutritional quality of sprouts, including the level of phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and antioxidant activity [Jeong-Ho: 2012]. As the addition of NaCl solution increases the concentration of sodium and chloride ions in the soil, the buckwheat would probably develop a stronger root system to increase the surface area of roots for absorbing nutrients. A more developed root system results in larger R:S value. We hypothesized that the buckwheat grown in salty environment will have a larger root: shoot ratio in length than the buckwheat grown in normal area.

Materials and Method:
We prepared four containers, two for experimental and the rest for controll, with wet vermiculite and 50Ml of MiracleGro solution in each. A hand.f.ul of soaked buckwheat seeds was evenly spread on the surface of the soil and was then covered with a thin layer of dry vermiculite. After we put the four containers in the greenhouse with the controllled variables temperature and humidity, we watered the controll group with 50Ml of water and the experimental group with 50Ml of  3% NaCl solution every other day. After two weeks, we picked 3 individual plants from each container and separated each plant at the edge of the shoot and root, which we measured the lengths of in the experiment. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of the R:S in length for two groups. A two sample one-tailed t_test was used to see the significent difference between two groups. 

Results:
The buckwheat in the controll group germinated on the third day and continued to grow till the end of the experiment. The plants were green and grew straight up with long stems and big leaves. For the experimental group, the seeds started to germinate the last day of the experiment, the seeds had long roots with tiny shoots. For the controll group, the value of R:S in length was 0.927±0.148 while the R:S in length for experimental group was 6.19±3.31. The t_test showed there was a significent different between the R:S for two groups as shown in Fig.1 (p = 0.00152, t = 3.88, degree of freedom = 10). 

Discussion:
We accepted our hypothesis and concluded that the buckwheat grown with salinity tend to have larger root: shoot ratio in length. This result implies that for the buckwheat grown in salty area, it tends to put more energy in growing root system. For the experimental group, the shoots sprouted from the seeds with the length of around 3-4mm while the roots grew 10 times longer as seen from the measurements. However, the buckwheat grown in the normal environment was extremely different as the roots and shoots were at a similar length. There are a few reasons that might explain these results. First of all, the addition of salt to the soil increased the ion concentration in the soil. Even though sodium is not generally required in large quantity for normal plants, chloride is an essential nutrient as it is noted especially for its role in helping plants processing photosynthesis, osmotic adjustment, and suppression of plant diseases. Compared with the buckwheat grown in ordinary soil, those grown with more salt will allocate more energy in developing roots. These plants compete to obtain more chloride for further use while growing. Research shows buckwheat is able to grow, flower and accumulate more rutin, a glycoside of the flavonoid quercetin found in many plants including buckwheat [Ravirajsinh: 2014], under 200mM NaCl; moreover, the content of important nutrients in buckwheat was not affected by the high soil salinity [JinLin: 2013]. In the experiment we used 3% concentration solution which was over 200mM and this could be too much salt input for the plants. For further experimental study, we could change the concentration of the solution and re-measure the R:S to figure out the best saline environment for buckwheat to grow. 

As now we have learned a way to measure how plants allocate their energy for growth according to R:S value, we could apply this knowledge for agriculture and plant industry. Nowadays one of the biggest global agricultural problem is the salinity of the soil. For example, on snowy days, we always put salt to melt the ice. The salt eventually goes into the field and affects agriculture. Most of the crops are not able to grow in the saline environment but however, there is an exception called halophyte. Halophytes are the salt-tolerant plants and some of them may be a viable commercial alternative to ease pressure on the requirement of good quality land and water for conventional cropping systems and the utilization of land degraded by salinity [Suresh: 2014]. We could apply the allocation measuring method to these halophytes to study how would the concentration of salinity influence both the roots and shoots. For example, if human consume the leaves of the plant, we could figure out the smallest R:S ratio so that we could obtain the largest amount of shoots. On the other hand, we could also use the same method to increase R:S for other uses. Measuring R:S is an effective to study some plants in the real world.
