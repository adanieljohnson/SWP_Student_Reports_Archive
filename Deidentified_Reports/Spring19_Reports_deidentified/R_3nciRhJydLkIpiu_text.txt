Title: The antagnostic effect of Tubocurarine on the muscular response of the gastrocnemus muscle of the Northern Leopard frog (Rania pipiens)

Abstract:
Nerve impulses cause the release of Acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal which generates an action potential that allows the muscle to contract. Tubocurarine is a chemical that acts as an ACh receptor antagonist and is often used as an anesthetic and acts by blocking ACh’s mechanism in the muscles and disrupt the magnitude of muscular response. The Northern Leopard frog (Rania pipiens) was used in this experiment and its gastrocnemus muscle was tested. The stimulus of 0.5V was used to measure the maximal response in all 3 frog legs with and without the addition of 0.1 Ml of Tubocurarine. The mean response in voltage of the group after the addition of Tubocurarine was statistically significently different than its mean before its addition (t_stat = 9.042073, d.f. = 2, P = 0.012011). Factors such as the difference in the amount of Tubocurarine given to each leg may have affected the results due to the persistent air bubble present in the syringe. Future experiments should look to make sure a precise value of Tubocurarine would be injected into each frog leg whilst also doing experiments combining the use of various chemicals to see its effect on muscular response.

Introduction:
Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junctions in the myofibers cause the release of Acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal which generates an action potential in the muscle fiber. [Dennis: 1981] The action potential spreads through the fiber and opens sodium channels which help the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing the muscle to contract and shorten. [Dennis: 1981] When the actions of ACh is disrupted, neuromuscular controll will also be disrupted. The experimental stimuli is Tubocurarine, which acts as an ACh receptor antagonist and is often used as an anesthetic [Colquhoun: 1979]. It is also used to treat tetanus, encephalitis, and poliomyelitis [Console: 1951]. This suggests that it acts by blocking ACh’s mechanism in the muscles and disrupt the magnitude of muscular response. [Jenkinson: 1960] By using the leg specimen of a northern Leopard frog (Rania pipiens), we can investigate the biological question: How does an ACh receptor antagonist affect the magnitude of muscular response in the gastrocnemus muscle of R. pipiens? The hypothesis of the experiment is that the addition of Tubocurarine will decrease the magnitude of muscular response in the muscle. This hypothesis was chosen as Tubocurarine is an antagonist and will not allow ACh to bind to the receptors of the muscle. Additionally, this experiment was done to gain a direct measurement of activity in muscular response.

Materials and Method:
The frog leg was skinned and covered in Frog Ringer's solution to prevent it from drying. Using forceps, the gastrocnemus muscle was separated from the bone. The threshold stimulus of the frog leg was determined to make sure that all three frog legs respond positively to the set voltage (0.5V). We kept this stimulus value constant and measured the maximal response in all 3 frog legs with and without the addition of 0.1 Ml of Tubocurarine. Each leg was given 5 minutes to process the Tubocurarine after injection. A paired t_test was used to calculate a one-tailed p_value and to determine whether the response in voltage in the group after the addition of Tubocurarine is statistically significently different than its mean before the addition of Tubocurarine against the alpha of 0.05.

Results:
The mean response in voltage of the group after the addition of Tubocurarine was statistically significently different than its mean before the addition of Tubocurarine (t_stat = 9.042073, d.f. = 2, P = 0.012011). The mean difference in response after the addition of Tubocurarine in the Replicants 1, 2, and, 3 were -0.088V, -0.126V, and -0.097V respectively. The mean responses and standard deviations for all three replicants with and without Tubocurarine were plotted on a table and graph (Table 1 and Figure 1). 

Discussion:
According to the collected data, the hypothesis that the addition of Tubocurarine will decrease the magnitude of muscular response in the muscle was supported. We observed a statistically significent difference in muscular response with the addition of Tubocurarine. Therefore, we can conclude that Tubocurarine has an effect on the magnitude of neuromuscular response in the gastrocnemus muscle of the R. pipiens as the p_value is smaller than the alpha of 0.05. Although the sample size of the experiment was small and each frog leg was different in size, the use of replicants prevented individual differences from affecting the results. As seen in Table 1, each replicant had a different controll and treatment response value but the use of this method allowed us to compare each replicant against itself. However, during the experiment, the syringe that was used to inject Tubocurarine had a gas bubble that could not be removed whilst taking up the chemical, so each replicant may have had differing amounts of Tubocurarine. In general, past experiments have shown that this effect has been not only been observed in both animals and humans but was also tested on different types of muscles (slow twitch and fast twitch) [Secher: 1982]. Future experiments should look to make sure a precise value of Tubocurarine would be injected into each frog leg whilst also doing experiments combining the use of various chemicals to see its effect on muscular response.
