Title: Juvenile Hormone’s effect on the Manduca sexta development process

Abstract:
Regulating the development process is an important topic in animal biology. Hormones are one of the main chemical regulators of the development process. Here we look at the effect of introducing the Juvenile Hormone into the Manduca sexta’s diet. The expectation was that the treated caterpillars would have an obvious difference in size when compared to the untreated caterpillars. Our data showed no significent difference in the rate of weight change per day between the experimental and controll groups. This significance suggests that the Juvenile Hormone does not play a significent role in the growth and development of Manduca sexta. In response to these results, we are interested in analyzing different method of administration for hormones in insects. 


Introduction:
This experiment analyzes the influence of hormones on insect development. Hormones and neurotransmitters are powerful chemical signalers that play a significent role in regulating the development process in most mammals. The increase and decrease of certain hormones indicate a period of change within an organism’s development. Often, in insects, an obvious transition that is regulated by hormones is pupation. Pupation is a metamorphosis process where the insect generates a new cuticle indicating a physical transition [Horodyski: 1989]. Pupating is only one of many developmental phases for holometabolous insects. The Manduca sexta is a holometabolous insect that undergoes four growth phases: egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. These transitions are primarily regulated by two hormones: ecdysteroids and the Juvenile Hormone. Previous research shows that the balance between these two hormones triggers the commitment pulse in Manduca sexta [Weeks: 2003]. The commitment pulse indicates the caterpillar is ready to pupate. The commitment pulse is triggered by a rise in ecdysteriods and a low concentration of the Juvenile Hormone [Weeks: 2003]. The Juvenile Hormone, obviously,  plays a significent role in the caterpillar’s growth and development. This bring up the question: can the caterpillar’s growth process be regulated by manipulating its Juvenile Hormone levels? The following experiment addresses this scientific question. If Manduca sexta are treated with a Juvenile Hormone mimic in their food, then those caterpillars will be significently different in size. 


Materials and Method:
Two separate groups of four caterpillars were obtained and placed in vented plastic containers. The eight caterpillars were randoMly assigned to the experimental and controll groups. All eight caterpillars were each given 10g of food, which was resupplied when necessary. The experimental group’s food was dosed three drops of the Juvenile Hormone mimic and the controll group’s food was dosed with three drops of water. The caterpillars were all kept in an incubator and their weight was measured daily for fourteen days. These weights were used to calculate their average rate of weight change per day. A statistical analysis was used to determine the significance of the results. A two-tailed t_test was used to determine if there was a legitimate variance between the rate of weight change between the treated and untreated caterpillars. 

Results:
The mean rate of weight change per day was 0.6479 g/day for the controll group and 0.6581 g/day for the experimental group (Fig.1). The standard deviation of the mean rate of weight change per day was ±0.3629 for the controll group and ±0.2052 for the experimental group. We used a two sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean rate of weight change per day of the controll group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t-value = 0.04889, d.f. = 6, two-tailed p_value = 0.9626). Analyzing the appearance of the caterpillars reveals that all eight caterpillars blatantly grew in size. Caterpillars 1 and 3 in the controll group and caterpillar 3 in the experimental group slowly became darker over the fourteen-day period. All other caterpillars remain a consistent color throughout the experiment. Overall, the controll and experimental caterpillars had similar rates of growth. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that Manduca sexta dosed with a Juvenile Hormone mimic would have a significent difference in their size, was not supported by the results. We reject the alternate hypothesis and accept the null hypothesis. The statistical analysis suggests that the Juvenile Hormone does not play a significent role in the growth and development of Manduca sexta. The literature disagrees with this result forcing us to relook at our experimental method [Weeks: 2003]. It is possible that the Juvenile Hormone mimic had no effect on the caterpillars because it was administered via the food. A past study, found success in this area by administering the Juvenile Hormone via injection into the Manduca sexta’s tissue [Nijhout: 1974]. This could suggest that the way hormones are received plays a role in their ability to actively regulate growth and development. A future study should investigate differences between the administration method of hormones.

The averages only differed slightly and the two-tailed p_value reflects this observation. *************************************************************************
