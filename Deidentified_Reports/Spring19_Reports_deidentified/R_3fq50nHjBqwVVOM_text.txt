Title: Growth Hormones and Regulators and Their Effects on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta experiment regarding hormones, specifically growth inhibitor, did not support our hypothesis that the control caterpillars would grow bigger and longer than the other treatment group caterpillars. Though gentrol and azaguard are both growth inhibitors, they did not seem to inhibit that much growth. We had three treatment groups, one that ended up getting entirely canceled out because all of our test subjects died before completion, with four replications in each group. Each subject received ten grams of food, each lump of food treated with then drops of the chosen substance.

Introduction:

	Azaguard and Gentrol are both growth regulators that have been found to inhibit growth in the subject they are tested on. azaguard is a Insect Growth Regulator, or IGR, that stops insects from molting between larval and pupal stages. Gentrol works very similarly and in fact mimics the juvenile hormone that stops insects from reaching a certain level of growth or maturity.
	In regards to our test subjects, we used organisms called Manduca sexta, or hornworm caterpillars. This organism “is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers (Lab Manual). Using processes such as molting and metamorphosis, the Manduca sexta evolves from an egg to a fully grown adult moth. The main hormones driving this change and growth are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E).
	Upon learning about the properties of azaguard and gentrol and comparing that with what was known about the life cycle of a Manduca sexta, my lab group started to wonder exactly how grown inhibitors would work when tested on these organisms. Would azaguard or general inhibit growth more fully? How well did these hormones actually work?
	Based on these general curiosities, our hypothesis is if the Manduca sexta treatment groups are treated with azaguard, general, and a control substance of water respectively, then the control group will experience the most growth in weight and length while the treatment groups will experience inhibited growth.
	To test our hypothesis, we weight and measured each test subject for weight and length before we started the experiment and then weighed and measured each subject again on the final day (day seven) of our experiment so we can compare the general trends of growth between each one.


Materials and Methods:
To do our experiment, we made sure each treatment group had four replications. The independent variables are azaguard and gentrol while water worked as our control substance. The dependent variable is mass in grams and length in centimeters. Each replication is kept in it’s own cell, thus allowing access to it’s own food supply. Each food supply was ten grams of normal, day to day caterpillar food that was then altered by receiving ten drops of treatment on each food lump. So four caterpillars were given food with ten drops of azaguard, four were given food with ten drops of gentrol, and four were given food with ten drops of water.
	During the time that this experiment ran, the caterpillars were kept in an incubator so that they would all be subject to the exact same environment, thus making that a control factor.
	In regards to statistical tests, we ran a two sample t-test on both the mass and length results for azaguard and gentrol control groups.


Results:
In regards to general trends we saw displayed, it’s important to note that almost all of our azaguard test subjects had passed away by day 7. For this reasons, we altered the experiment to compare only those treated with gentrol and the control.
	That being said, the average change we saw in the mass of each group was significantly different. The average change in mass for gentrol treated groups was 10.3 grams, while the average change in mass for our control groups was .6 grams. The standard deviation was 1.303 and 1.945 respectively, while standard error was 1.699 and 3.785.
	In regards to length, the average change from day one to day seven for the gentrol controlled groups was 3.167 centimeters while the control was -0.93 centimeters. The standard deviation was .44969 and 1.7249 respectively, while standard error was 0.67059 and 1.313.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the control group will experience the most growth in weight and length while the treatment groups will experience inhibited growth, was not supported by our experiment. Firstly, the fact that we had to totally cancel out the azaguard treatment group did not allow us to really see the fullest spectrum of our results. Secondly, gentrol is undoubtedly a growth inhibitor, so the fact that our gentrol caterpillars grew to be bigger than our control caterpillars was very surprising. Perhaps we did not change the caterpillars’ food enough, or didn’t put enough drops of treatment on the food lumps. We were hoping to see gentrol be effective, so as to make the point that it’s a reliable pest control for farmers, people trying to maintain their yard, and more. 
	If I were to try this experiment again, I would use a broader range of inhibitors besides just azaguard and gentrol. This would allow us to find the ‘best’ inhibitor, but it would also make sure we have so many treatment groups and replications that, if a potential problem arose, we would have enough replications that the problem would not be detrimental.
