Title: The effect of nitrogen on the root to shoot ratio of Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the process by which species distribute their limited resources. Many factors can control the length of root growth and shoot growth, however this lab focuses on resource allocation. With scarce resources, plants will need to extend its roots more in order to obtain limited nutrients.  One group was kept as a control group fed with only H20 and Miracle-Gro in vermiculite. The experimental group was grown in a nitrogen enriched environment. The nitrogen enriched environment would allocate resources towards the shoots and the roots would not grow as long as they would in the control group. We hypothesize the group fed with nitrogen will have a lower root to shoot ratio than the control group. We planted radish seeds in six pots of vermiculite. The experimental group was fed with nitrogen, water and Miracle-grow. The control group was fed with only water and Miracle-Gro. The plants were watered daily with 50 milliliters of H20 for 14 days. The root to shoot ratio for the control was greater than that for the experimental by approximately 0.4 millimeters. The p-value was 0.077, rejecting our hypothesis. This idea that nitrogen encourages allocation of resources to the shoots rather than the roots might interest farmers who are looking for longer stems. 

Introduction:
In each given ecological community, all organisms present must be able to interact with each other and adapt. Biotic factors are environmental stimuli that originate from other organisms. Along with biotic factors, all organisms must adapt to the abiotic factors in their environment as well. Plant interactions revolve around these biotic and abiotic factors and their ability to obtain essential resources. The power of resource limitation is a force in selection that involves two important concepts: trade-offs and resource allocation. Resource allocation is the pattern in which species distribute and use their limited resources [Johnson: 2018]. Individual allocation patterns allow them to adapt to different abiotic conditions in their environment whether they are interacting with other species or not. Plants will respond to shifting resources differently and reallocate their resources. This shifting of resources based on environmental conditions is called phenotypic plasticity. Once environmental resources change, a plant will change its allocation strategy for new growth [Bradshaw: 1965]. Our experiment will observe how plants allocate their resources in responses to environmental conditions. Nitrogen is commonly given to plants because it is a major form of chlorophyll, the compound plants use sunlight as a energy source to produce sugars from water and carbon dioxide. If the plant was treated with nitrogen, there would be more resources available, decreasing resource competition. With enriched nitrogen soil, the roots will not have to stretch as far for the necessary resources, allowing the plant to allocate more resources to the shoots. The plant used will be radishes, Raphanus raphanistrum, a leafy plant that germinate quickly and grow rapidly. This will be beneficial because of the short amount of time our experiment takes place in. This lab will measure the differences in one environment versus the other; a nitrogen rich environment versus a controlled growing environment. In the enriched environment, plants will optimize their resources by maximizing relative growth rate. The plants will not have to maximize their root growth for maximum shoot growth [Agren: 2003]. We hypothesize the group fed with nitrogen will have a lower root to shoot ratio than the control group. 


Materials and Methods:
We soaked Raphanus raphanistrum seeds and gathered six pots with vermiculite and split them into two groups; experimental and control. Once the seeds were planted, both groups were given 50 mL of H20 and 50 mL Miracle-Gro. The experimental group was covered with a scoop of nitrogen in each pot before plantation. Each pot was given 50 mL of H20 daily for 14 days in a greenhouse. At the end of the 14 day experimental period, one plot from each pot was extracted and water was used to separate the plants from the soil. Five individual plants were retrieved from each pot and those plants were cleaned of the soil. Each group of five was weighed and recorded. The roots and shoots were then separated and measured in millimeters. From those calculations of length and weight, a ratio was gathered. A two-sample one-tailed t-test will be run and compared to a 0.05 alpha value. 


Results:

The control group had a greater root to shoot ratio in length than the nitrogen group. The enriched nitrogen group had an average root to shoot length ratio of 0.82 +/- 0.035. The control group had an average root to shoot length ratio of 1.24 +/- 0.42. The average root to shoot ratio for the control group was approximately 0.4 millimeters greater than the nitrogen enriched group as seen in Figure 1. A paired t-test was run with the raw data from the experiment and the t-value recorded was 1.76 with degrees of freedom of 4. The data of the root to shoot length ratio was not significant with a p-value was 0.077.


Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis. The root to shoot ratio for p-value was not significant. Nitrogen is a biofertilizer application that would allow the shoots of the plants to grow more than the roots because the radishes do not have to stretch their roots for nutrients and compete with neighboring organisms. The results showed the nitrogen did have a lower root to shoot ratio by length but not enough to make the results significant. We believe this may be because of slight nitrogen poisoning. Nitrogen enriched soil increases the soil’s mineral salts; excess nitrogen takes water from the plant while leaving the salts behind. When the nitrogen stays at high levels, the plant will experience what is called nitrogen burn and experience difficulty growing and wilted leaves [Argen: 2003]. The amount of nitrogen added to each pot was observational and not exact. There is a maximum amount of nitrogen added to each seed that is recommended. It is recommended to give plants more nitrogen in the vegetative state rather than the flowering state [Argen: 2003]. Avoiding Miracle-Gro and enriched soil allows the grower to control the amount of nitrogen the flowering plant gets throughout the process. We believe too much nitrogen and nutrients were given the plant throughout the process through Miracle-Gro and vermiculite soil and decreased flowering rates. The added nitrogen and decreased flowering rates prohibited maximum shoot growth. In another study on yield of radish seeds when treated with nitrogen and other biofertilizers showed increasing levels of nitrogen greatly increased the seed yield and the quality of the radishes. However, they found a maximum amount of nitrogen should be applied for proper results, due to nitrogen poisoning [Panwar: 2000]. Our hypothesis was rejected and may have been supported if we closely measured the amounts of nutrients given to the radishes and ran more trials. In further experiments, combining nitrogen as the only nutrient with one other experimental nutrient could have more notable results on the root to shoot ratio. This study would be beneficial to farmers in order to control the amount of nutrients added to their crops as well as what they want to be added. The effects of chemical burn can be detrimental to a farmers crops so they will find a fixed amount of total nutrients to add to their crops in order to maximize shoot growth, or vice versa.
