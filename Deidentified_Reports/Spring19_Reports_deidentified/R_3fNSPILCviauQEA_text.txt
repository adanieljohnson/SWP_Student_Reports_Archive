Title: Testing the Effects of Temperature of on Aggressive Behavior in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins are tropical fish that display agnostic behavior towards members of their own species. Aggressive behaviors of betta fish are divided into two main types of movement, broadside movements and facing movements. Betta fish are ectotherms, so their body temperatures are modified by their environments, as a result, Betta fish can be very susceptible to temperature changes. The goal of this experiment was to determine how room (19°C) and cool (15°C) water temperatures affected Betta Fish Males’ aggressive behaviors. It was predicted that cooler temperatures water would significently reduce aggression in Betta Fish Males when compared to room temperature. To quantify Betta Fish aggression, a scoring system was created, measuring the amount of time the ‘red mane’ and an erect pectoral fin were observed in the behavior of the beta. Two Betta Fish were observed for five minutes, in both room and cool temperature conditions, then the seconds of aggression for each fish were converted to aggression scores using the scoring system. Betta Fish males were significently more aggressive in the room temperature tank than they were in the cooler temperature tank.  This supports the hypothesis that Betta Fish would become less aggressive when exposed to cooler temperature water.  

Introduction:
Betta splendins or Betta fish are freshwater tropical fish native to Cambodia and Thailand. In their native environments Betta fish have dull colors that change during acts of aggression. However, many years of selective breeding have caused certain Betta fish to retain their aggressive colors even at rest. (P. Lagasse & Columbia University 2018) Betta fish flourish warm areas with shallow water. Betta makes are known to display aggressive intraspecific behaviors behavior when interacting with one another. 
The aggressive behaviors of betta fish are divided into two main types of movement, broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements happen when a fish turns its side towards its opponent. In this position, the betta fish will progressively increase displays of aggression, including pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. (Johnson 2018) During facing movements, the fish will face an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spread its gill covers, and protrude its branchiostegal membranes creating a “red mane”. Other intraspecific agnostic behaviors of the Betta fish include raising the dorsal fin, darting, biting and nipping. (Johnson 2018)
	One Betta fish may respond to another betta’s agnostic behaviors in several ways, such as ignoring the behavior, matching the behavior, fleeing, behaving in a way that signals submission. The responding fish may also express a more intense agnostic behavior in a process called escalating. (Johnson 2018)
	Betta fish are ectotherms, meaning that their body temperature is regulated by their environment, not specific metabolic processes in their bodies. As a result, Betta fish can be sensitive to temperature. Behavior in organisms can change because of differences in temperature. In a study conducted by P. Biro et al, individual Damselfish were observed in warmer and cooler temperature environments. As the temperature increased in the environments of the damselfish, the behavior became bolder (P. Biro et al. 2009). Meaning that the fish executed more risky behaviors, such as ford scavenging and mating. 
In a study by Clarke et al determined that tropical fish like the betta fish have higher resting metabolic rates, the resting metabolic rate of fish increased as temperatures increased. (Clarke et al. 1999)
	Based on this background information. It was predicted that cooler temperatures would significently reduce aggression in Betta Fish Males when compared to room temperature​ because they would have a reduced metabolic rate that limited their display of agnostic behaviors.


Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, first, a scoring system was created to measure the aggressive intraspecific behaviors of the betta fish. This system scored the display of the ‘red mane’ and the erect pectoral fin. The red mane was deemed the most aggressive behavior and the erect pectoral fin was counted as the less aggressive behavior. Betta fish would then be observed and their displays of each type of behavior would be timed. The times of behavior display would then be converted to aggression scores. The number of seconds the betta fish displayed the red mane would be multiplied by two, while the number of seconds the betta fish displayed an erect pectoral fin would be multiplied by one. These two aggression scores would then be added together to give the specific betta fish an aggression score. After the scoring procedure was determined, two betta fish were obtained and held in a room temperature tank that kept them separate and unable to see one another. Then, the temperature of the tank was measured to determine the specific degree of the room temperature tank (19°C). Afterward,​ the cooler temperature tank (15°C) was constructed by adding ice to a fish tank that had an identical construction to the room temperature tank, with glass that could separate two betta fish. 
Then, the behavioral observation began.  In the room temperature tank, the glass separating the betta fish was removed and the behaviors of the two fish were observed for five minutes, unless the two fish began to fight. The same fish were then moved to the cool temperature tank (15°C) and allowed to rest for five minutes. Afterwards, the separation glass was lifted, and the fish were observed again, for five minutes, unless fighting ensued. Two more trials were carried out, using two more pairs of betta fish. Then the seconds of aggression for each fish were converted to aggression scores using the scoring system. 
 


Results:
	The results of this experiment were the average aggression (measured with scores) of six betta fish exposed to room temperature (19°C) and cold temperature (15°C) water. Based on a paired t_statistical test, there was a statistically significent difference in the means for aggression between the room and cold temperature groups (t-value=3.67, d.f.=5, p_value=0.014). Figure 1 displays a line graph displaying how average aggression changed between room and cold temperatures.

Discussion:
This experiment aimed to determine if cooler temperatures would affect aggressive behaviors in Betta Fish. This behavior was compared using a scoring system that quantified the aggressive behaviors of an erect pectoral fin and the display of the red mane. These scores were then used to determine how aggressive the Betta fish males were before and after being exposed to cooler temperature water. 
Based on the data, the Betta Fish males were significently more aggressive in the room temperature tank (Aggression score=290.67) than they were in the cooler temperature (Aggression score=106.83) tank.  This supports the hypothesis that Betta Fish would become less aggressive when exposed to cooler temperature water. 
As stated previously, the temperature of an environment was hypothesized to affect the ability of Betta Fish to display intraspecific agnostic behaviors because Betta Fish are endotherms and the cooler temperatures can lower the metabolic rates of the fish. The aggressive behaviors of Betta fish utilize a generous amount of oxygen in order to be displayed. This coincides with the previous studies that fish can completely change their behavior in different temperatures. The boldness behaviors can change significently as a result of the temperature change. (P. Biro et al. 2009) So, when the Betta Makes were no longer in a comfortable environment, they were unable to display bold activities, such as fighting for territory. Betta fish are also known to have a higher metabolic rate because they are tropical fish (Clarke et al. 1999). This means that the Betta innately need more oxygen for their systems than other fish. The cooler temperatures caused the Betta Fish to have a less efficient metabolic system meaning that they could not obtain oxygen as easily in the cooler temperature tank. As a result of lack of oxygen, the Betta Fish could not display as many aggressive behaviors.
