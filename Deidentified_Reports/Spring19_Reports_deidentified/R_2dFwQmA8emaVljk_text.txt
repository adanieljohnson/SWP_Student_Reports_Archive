Title: Salt water solutions effect on Nerve and Muscle Functions in the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment is to determine the basic properties of neuromuscular control. This will be explored using the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve in a frog leg. Specifically, for this experiment, three frog legs will be injected with a solution of salt water which contains 5 mg of salt in 100 mL of water. Three frog legs were injected with the solution of salt water, and three frog legs were not injected with anything, allowing for differences between an experimental group and a control group to be determined. After conducting the experiment, the average voltage generated by the gastrocnemius muscle in the control frog legs is 0.46 V +/- 0.07571877794 V. The average voltage generated by the gastrocnemius muscle in the experimental frog leg (exposed to salt water) one is 0.10 V +/- 0.03 V. The salt water solution injected into the muscles caused the Direct Muscle Response (V) to be weaker than the Direct Muscle Response (V) of the control group.
The hypothesis for this investigation is that, when the gastrocnemius muscle in the frog leg is injected with 5 mg of salt in 100 mL of water, the relative strength of the contraction will be weaker because there will be a higher Na+ concentration in the nerve cells, causing a weaker action potential to be generated.

Introduction:
In animals and insects, movement is vital for the survival of the specific organism. Movement allows animals and insects to find food, nutrients, exercise, find new territory, and find mates. Movement is controlled through the collaboration of muscles and nerves throughout the organismâ€™s body. The specific muscle and nerve investigated in this experiment is the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve in a frog leg. The gastrocnemius muscle is one of the bigger, stronger muscles present in an organism, controlling leg movement. Another term used to refer to the gastrocnemius muscle is the calf, which is in the lower part of the leg [Eyster, 1935]. The gastrocnemius muscle is a skeletal muscle which means it is attached to a bone within the frog leg. Skeletal muscle consists of myofibers which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, and faced-aggregate. Axons of motor neurons extend into a muscle, and then branch out to innervate several myofibers. This occurs at points called neuromuscular junctions. A nerve stimulates a muscular contraction through a process called excitation-contraction coupling. In this, nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction and cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binds to its receptor, opening sodium channels. The opening of the sodium channels allows for an action potential to be generated within the specific muscle. The action potential stimulates the release of calcium (Ca2+) ion from storage sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating the contractile mechanism in the muscle fiber [Sengupta, 2010]. 
The hypothesis for this investigation is that, when the gastrocnemius muscle in the frog leg is injected with 5 mg of salt in 100 mL of water, the relative strength of the contraction will be weaker because there will be a higher Na+ concentration in the nerve cells, causing a weaker action potential to be generated, than is no salt water was present.


Materials and Methods:
1.	Skin three different frog legs to allow their relative contraction strengths to be determined
2.	Cut one end of the gastrocnemius muscle and tie it to a string which is attached to the elevated clamp
3.	Pin each leg down and attach the metal probes to the gastrocnemius muscle 
4.	Create a control myogram for each of the three frog legs
a.	1V, 0 pulses, frequency 1, pulse width 5 ms
5.	Once the control myograms are obtained, injecrt the frog legs with a mixture of 5 mg/100 mL water 
6.	Reattach the medal probes to the gastrocnemius muscle to obtain three new myograms
The statistical test used in this experiment was a one-sample T-test.

Results:
The average voltage generated by the gastrocnemius muscle in the control frog leg two is 0.36 V +/- 0.07571877794 V, for control leg two the average was 0.50 V +/- 0.07571877794 V, and for control leg three the average was 0.48 V +/- 0.07571877794 V. The average voltage generated by the gastrocnemius muscle in the experimental frog leg (exposed to salt water) one is 0.13 V +/- 0.03 V, for experimental frog leg two the average is 0.10 V +/- 0.03 V, and for experimental frog leg three the average is 0.07 V +/- 0.03 V. For this experiment, a one-sample t-test was used to analyze the results obtained. The degrees of freedom obtained was 2. The t-value obtained was 5.935594. Finally, the p-value for this experiment is 0.02723. When an electrical charge was applied to the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg, the whole frog leg would twitch. When the experimental frog legs were injected with salt water, the experimental frog legs became more turgid than the control frog legs. Consequently, the size of the twitch following the electrical charge was much smaller than the twitch generated within the control frog legs.

Discussion:
In this experiment, the data obtained from the statistical test showed that the data was statistically significant. The data is statistically significant because the P-value obtained is 0.02723, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis for this experiment is rejected and the alternate hypothesis is accepted. This means that the addition of salt water to the gastrocnemius muscle weakens the direct muscle response when stimulated by an electrical charge, compared to the control group of frog legs, that was not injected with a salt water solution. The reason behind the gastrocnemius muscles injected with salt water having a lower direct muscle response than the gastrocnemius muscles without salt water present in them is because the salt water solution increases the Na+ concentration within the muscle. This effects the concentration gradient, affecting the sodium-potassium pump. This higher sodium concentration in the muscles weakens the action potential generated by the gastrocnemius muscle. The weaker action potential generated causes the direct muscle response to be weaker than the direct muscle response generated by the gastrocnemius muscle without injected salt water [Sengupta, 2010]. An application of this investigation to the real world could potentially be that salt water could be a way to help muscles return to a relaxated state after intense exercise. This could assist people who train intensively regularly, by preventing muscle cramps and muscle soreness. The salt water injections would weaken the muscular contractions after exercise, helping the muscle relax.
