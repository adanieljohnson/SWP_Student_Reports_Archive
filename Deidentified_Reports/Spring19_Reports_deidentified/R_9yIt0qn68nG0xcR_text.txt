Title: Effect of Salt Water on Root/ Shoot Ratios in R. raphanistrum  

Abstract:
This experiment set out to determine the effect that salt water would have on the root-to-shoot length ratios of Raphanus raphanistrum samples. The salt water was expected to have a significent effect. This was done by planting two separate groups of R. raphanistrum. The first group was watered with salt water, the second with normal water. The root and shoot lengths were then measured and then taken as a ratio. It was found that on average, samples treated with salt water has a higher root-to-shoot ratio than those treated with normal water. 


Introduction:
The root-to-shoot (R/S) ratio of a given plant refers to the ratio of the plant’s root length divided by the length of its shoot. The theory behind this idea suggests that a plant will allocate resources toward the organ responsible for obtaining the scarcest resource in the plant’s environment [Reynolds, 1982]. Many external factors can affect resource allocation in a given plant, including wind, water, nutrients, and light [Kelly, 2015]. Raphanus raphanistrum is a good candidate in which to observe changes in the (R/S) ratio due to only two weeks being needed to witness growth in its shoot. We set out to observe how salinated water would affect the root-to-shoot ratio in these plants. We predicted watering R. raphanistrum with salt water would have a significent impact on its R/S ratio when compared to samples treated with normal water. 



Materials and Method:
We filled four plastic pots with vermiculite soil, which we treated with generous amounts of Miracle-Gro formula each. When then put two spoonfuls of R. raphanistrum seeds into each pot, pushing the seeds into the soil. We then watered two of the pots with normal water and the other two with salinated water. We repeated this process for two weeks following the initial planting day. All four pots were kept in a greenhouse with under sunlight. 


Results:

The data appears to indicate that the R. raphanistrum samples treated with salt water had a higher R/S ratio on average. Samples treated with salt water had an R/S ratio of 2.941 cm on average, while samples treated with normal water had an R/S ratio of 1.468 on average. A higher R/S ratio means that the roots have a higher length than the shoots, which salt water-treated samples clearly do.


Discussion:
The results indicated that salt water had a significent effect on R/S ratio in R. raphanistrum samples. Research shows that light quality has an effect on shoot growth, but not root growth [Kelly, 2015]. Factors affecting root growth include nitrogen, plant hormones, as well as the distribution of carbohydrates [Wei Xu, 2015]. Treating R. raphanistrum samples with salinated water had a higher root length on average than those treated with normal water. This indicates that in response to the salt water, the plants allocated resources towards their roots in lieu of their shoots in an effort to maximize absorption. It would be worth testing this hypothesis again to see if similar results are found. Another experiment worth performing is observing the effect that soil quality has on R/S ratios in R. raphanistrum. This could be done by mixing the vermiculite with sand or sawdust, then observing the effects on root and shoot lengths in the sample plants.
