Title: Effect of Hormones on [Manduca sexta] growth

Abstract:
Hormone regulation is an important topic in comparative biology. With hormones it is important to understand how organisms send signals through their body to control growth and development, behaviors and physiology. In this lab we looked at the effect of the hormones gentrol and azaguard on [Manduca sexta] growth by creating environments for them to live (plastic container with two holes for breathing) and giving each group of caterpillars different hormones or water (the control) in their food over the course of 2 weeks. The expectation was that the gentrol, an insect growth mimic, would increase the overall weight and height of the insects compared to the control, while azaguard, an insect growth inhibitor, would reduce the weight and height of the insects compared to the control. Our data showed no significant difference in the gentrol hormone, but did show a significant difference in the azaguard hormone. This significance along with the observations, suggests that the concentration of azaguard used was enough to physically slow down the development of the caterpillars, by manipulating its hormone balance, preventing it from changing its developmental phase. This demonstrates how hormones can be used to successfully reduce pests. 


Introduction:
This experiment will be evaluating the effect of hormones on insect development. The [Manduca sexta], tobacco hornworm, is in the order Lepidoptera, which is composed of butterflies, moths, and skippers. The average life cycle is around 39-41 days and includes the stages egg, larvae, pupa, and adult (holometabolous life cycle). During the larva stage the insects are usually veniform (worm-like) and soft bodied. During the pupa stage their is reduced movement and is sometimes enclosed by a cocoon. In the adult stage the insect has wings, functional reproductive organs, and adult specific organs. Once the animal has undergone a specific developmental stage, it cannot go through earlier developmental stages. Insect growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes utilize hormone-based and neuron-based signaling. The two major hormones within [Manduca sexta] are the ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile (JH) hormones (Riddiford, Lynn M, et. al.: 2003). 20E regulates the timing of moting during insect development. Juvenile hormones regulate what type of molt occurs during development and regulates many adult functions (Riddiford, Lynn M, et. al.: 2003). Within the [Manduca sexta] stages there is a point called the commitment pulse where the insect gets signals indicating it is large enough and has enough nutrients stored to go into the adult stage (Johnson AD: 2018). 
Based on this information, if the hormone balance was disrupted the caterpillar would not know when to go into the commitment pulse stage and it could perhaps stall or accelerate it, leading to the question of how adding different hormones like gentrol, an insect growth mimic, and azaguard, an insect growth inhibitor could affect their growth. [Manduca sexta] were a model organism to test this experiment because of their relatively short life cycle, ease to manipulate their hormone levels, and since extensive research has been done with them. I hypothesize that if the [Manduca sexta] caterpillars were exposed to gentrol that the insect would grow longer and weight more than the control since gentrol is a hormone growth regulator and that the [Manduca sexta] caterpillars given azaguard would grow shorter and weigh less than the control since azaguard is a insect growth inhibitor, preventing them for growing as fast perhaps. Both are insect growth regulators that alters juvenile hormones, which regulated the type of molt during development and regulates multiple functions in adult insects. 
 


Materials and Methods:
To begin this experiment, two containers with four sections were gathered and two holes were poked in each section in order to provide air for the caterpillars. Two sections in each container (4 sections total) were for the control group and two sections on each container were for two different treatment group (2 sections for each treatment group toal).10g of food was weighed out, stirred and then placed in each square. Using a transfer pipette, 3-10 drops of water was added to the food for the control group. For the treatment groups 3-10 drops of reagent for each treatment group (either 1:49 gentrol or 1:1250 azaguard) was added to the food. The food will be in a big clump to prevent it from drying out. Once the caterpillars homes were made, one caterpillar was placed in each section. The caterpillar’s length and weight was taken and tracked over the course of a week. After one week, the differences in height and weight were taken and an ANOVA test was done comparing the gentrol group to the control group and the azaguard group to the control group. For the second week, the azaguard group was given gentrol to and the caterpillars receiving gentrol continued to receive gentrol. This allowed 4 caterpillars to receive the gentrol treatment. The 4 control caterpillars also continued receiving water. After one week the caterpillars’ length and weight were recorded. A t-test was done to compare the gentrol treatment to the control treatment.


Results:
After the first week the control group caterpillars grew an average of 41.25 mm longer, the gentrol group grew an average of 38.5mm longer, and the azaguard group grew an average of 18mm longer (Fig.1). The control group caterpillars weighted an average of 7.22g more, the gentrol group weighed an average of 1.935g more, and azaguard group weight an average of 1.57g larger (Fig.2). An Anova test was done to determine whether the differences between each group and the control were significant. The results showed that in length and height difference the azaguard-control were significant, but the gentrol-control was not significant as indicated by the p-values being less than 0.05. The p-value for the length was 0.006323 and the p value for weight was 0.0059. The control caterpillars were big and green, the gentrol caterpillars were big, plump, and light green, and the azaguard caterpillars were small and dark. For the second week the average length difference for the control group was -1.605 and 1.08 for the gentrol group (Fig.3). For the second week the average weight difference for the control group was -14 and 4.25 for the gentrol (Fig.4). A t-test was used to test whether the differences between these groups were significant. Based on the two-tailed p values the length difference was significant (p=0.096465), but the weight difference was not significant (p=0.182954). The general trend was that gentrol caterpillars grew around the same length and weight as the control and the azaguard grew smaller than both those groups in weight and length. Over the second week the general trend showed a decrease in height and weight for the control and an increase in height and weight for the gentrol. The control caterpillars were black/green and big and the gentrol caterpillars were puffy and green/black. 
 




Discussion:
My hypothesis, that if the [Manduca sexta] caterpillars were exposed to gentrol that the insect would grow longer and weight more than the control since gentrol is a hormone growth mimic, was not supported, but the part of my hypothesis stating that the [Manduca sexta] caterpillars given azaguard would grow shorter and weigh less than the control since azaguard is a insect growth inhibitor, was supported. There was no significant difference between the height and weight of the gentrol overall, suggesting that the concentration of gentrol used does not affect the growth of the [Manduca sexta]. Perhaps this is due to a small concentration being included in the food and if more of the gentrol insect growth regulator was added within the food the caterpillars would have grown bigger than the control. Since the azaguard did significantly inhibit the growth of the caterpillars, perhaps the concentration used was enough to affect the physiological processes within the caterpillars.  One experiment found that when [Manduca sexta] were given juvenile hormones mimics, both the first and second larval instars were normal length, but the third larval instar was prolonged for 1-2 days. One study did find that larvae that were treated with juvenile hormone grew 50% larger than they normally would have (Grunert, Clarke, et al.:2015). In this experiment the hormone was applied topically to the dorsum, perhaps resulting in the difference in results. The black look of the azaguard treated caterpillars also aligns with other experiments where when the juvenile hormones in the M. sexta were reduced the caterpillars appeared with a darker pigmentation and abnormal development, like the caterpillars in this experiment (Edwards, J.p., et al.: 1983). 
The research on these hormones in these insects are important and relate to the greater issue of insect pest control. These insect growth regulators manipulate the regulatory processes of insects that allow them to develop and reproduce. These hormone regulators are less toxic and try to target hormones which are not in other mammals, so it does not affect humans or other animals that are near the pesticide. The use of certain hormone regulators in this experiment helped to demonstrate how they affect the development of these caterpillars and perhaps shows which is more effective at it.
If this experiment were to be repeated perhaps there could have been more caterpillars used under each treatment group, creating more replicates, so improve the precision and accuracy of the data. This would also help create more data in case some caterpillars were to die. I also would increase the concentration of each hormone to see if that would create a more significant effect on the insect growth.
