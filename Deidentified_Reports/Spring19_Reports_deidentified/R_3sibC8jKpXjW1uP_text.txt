Title: Caffeine injected into gastrocnemus muscle demonstrates muscle signaling

Abstract:
Frog legs demonstrate muscle signaling when stimulated. The researchers studied the effect of caffeine injection on the amplitude of muscle contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. The gastrocnemus muscle is the rear thigh muscle in a frog. The injection of caffeine induced tetany in the gastrocnemus muscle, which meant the electrical stimulus produced less of an effect than prior to the caffeine injection. The results were not statistically significent, but they were in line with the findings of the field. 

Introduction:
Frog legs can easily be used to study muscle signaling. Because muscles still can contract after an organism is dead, frog legs are a useful model organism for studying muscle contraction. The researchers specifically looked at the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens (a frog species). The gastrocnemus muscle is the rear thigh muscle. The researchers studied the effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle in the frog leg. Caffeine was studied because it enhances how muscles work, which is called the ergogenic effect [Kumar: 2015]. In the study by Kumar, et al., caffeine was found to increase the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the skeletal muscle of frog legs. Caffeine has also been found to increase a frog leg’s contractility of skeletal muscle [Kumar: 2015]. The researchers looked at amplitude measuring the muscle contractions and how caffeine changed the amplitude of the muscle contractions. The researchers hypothesized that the frog legs would contract normally before being injected with caffeine. After being injected with caffeine, the frog legs will probably have induced tetany and contract the maximum amount possible. This may make the frog leg respond less to the stimulation because the muscle will not be able to contract any more.


Materials and Method:
The researchers studied muscle signaling in three frog legs. Each frog leg was a part of both the controll and experimental groups. The frog legs were all tested before being injected with caffeine, which was the controll group. After being injected with caffeine, all the frog legs were stimulated by the probe again to see the differing results, making this the experimental group. Each frog leg was in succession strung up, tested, inject with caffeine, and then tested again. To string up a frog leg, the leg is first degloved, meaning its skin was removed. Next, the leg’s gastrocnemus muscle was separated from its bone at the achilles tendon. The gastrocnemus muscle was then hung from the forced transducer with string. To achieve this, a string was tied around the end of the gastrocnemus muscle and attached to the forced transducer. The frog leg was then pinned down across the tibialis anterior to attach it to the tray and immobilize it. To immobilize the femur, it was also pinned across. By doing this, the researchers ensured that the leg did not move excessively or in a way that would affect the data when stimulated. The gastrocnemus muscle was suspended at 90 degrees, and the precision tensioner was adjusted to make sure the string had a light amount of tension. The stimulation probe (specifically the needle probes) were put into the gastrocnemus muscle, with the red wire above the black wire. This needle probes were connected to a source of electricity, and it delivered the stimulus to the muscle that was specified by the computer controlls. Next, the computer program’s variables were set. The Amp was set to 1, W(ms) to 5, number of pulses to 3, and Hertz to 0.5. The number of pulses was set to three so that we could run the program once to get all of our results on that frog leg for either the controll or experimental group. The Hertz was set to 0.5, which meant the stimulus was slower and easier to observe. The Amp was kept at 1 throughout the experiment. The researchers then stimulated the first frog leg. The frog leg was then injected with caffeine while being stimulated. This process was repeated for each of the frog legs. The researchers chose to use a paired t_test because that is what the results indicate should be used to interpret the data.


Results:
The results were not statistically significent because our p_value was over 0.05 (p=0.122). The muscle reacted as expected when stimulated prior to the injection of caffeine [Figure 1]. When the muscle was stimulated after being injected with caffeine, the caffeine induced tetany. Once tetany was induced, the stimulus was only able to produce very small amounts of amplitude [Figure 1]. The muscle was also cold and stiff after being stimulated once it was injected with caffeine because it was contracting constantly. Before tetany was induced, the gastrocnemus muscle was extremely flexible and squishy.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported because the results were not statistically significent. The predictions made in the Introduction were still accurate. The gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg responded as expected to the injection of caffeine, but the researchers cannot guarantee this did not happen just due to chance. The results obtained while not statistically significent, were the results the researchers were expected to get with this experiment [Kumar: 2015]. The increase in contractility of skeletal muscles of frog legs due to caffeine is documented in Kumar’s study “Effect of Caffeine on Frog Muscle.” Our results indicated this increased contractility. Tetany was induced, as hypothesized in the Introduction. Further testing could be done to see if increasing the amount of caffeine injected would produce greater results. This experiment introduced no new information into the field, but its findings were in line with the already established material.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This figure shows the amplitude response of the frog legs before and after being injected with caffeine. The results from the three frog legs were averaged for the before (controll) and after (experimental) groups. The error bars on the before and after bars indicate the standard deviation.
