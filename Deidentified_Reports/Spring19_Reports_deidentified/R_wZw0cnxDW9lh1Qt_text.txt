Title: The Effect of Ecdysterone Production on the Weight of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
In the experiment the main goal was to determine whether or not adding ecdysterone inhibitor to the Manduca Sexta’s food would effect the growth rate compared to just adding water to the food of the Manduca Sexta. The major results from the experiment were that the null hypothesis was rejected and the alternative hypothesis was accepted. The data shows that there was a growth difference between the controll group and the experimental group. The controll group was able to grow much better than the experimental group which was expected due to the addition of ecdysterone to the experimental groups diet. It was expected that ecdysterone would stunt the growth of the caterpillar since the levels only rise when close to pupation, so if the levels are high in a caterpillar when not ready for pupation the growth would be slower than a caterpillar that was not altered.


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is also known as a tobacco hornworm caterpillar. The life cycle of the Manduca Secta, from egg to adult month, usually ranges from around 30 to 45 days. Since the Manduca Sexta is a caterpillar that goes through larval stages to pupation prior to becoming an adult moth, the caterpillar has a lot of hormones that help trigger certain needed bodily responses. The hormone focused on during experimentation was Ecdysterone, which is secreted by groups of cells in the prothoracic glands. Ecdysterone levels in the catepillar primarily controlls the when the caterpillar is ready to molt. According to Locke levels of  “ecdysterone peak prior to moulting and then drop to non-detectable levels”(Locke, 1997).  The biological question being asked in experimentation is will the feeding and movement behavior of the Manduca Sexta change when ecdysterone levels are varied? Knowing the impact of the variation of ecdysterone levels on the caterpillar can let scientists know how to slow the growth and development of the catepillar if needed. In the model system, the caterpillar's diet will have additional ecdysterone compared to caterpillars with a normal food source. It is expected that if the caterpillars have additional ecdysterone in their diet the growth of the caterpillar will be slower than the caterpillars with normal food source.


Materials and Method:
Prior to experimentation, two four quadrant boxes were each poked with two holes in each quadrat to give fresh air to the caterpillars while they were tested. One box was for the controll group and the other box was used to hold the caterpillars that were tested with extra ecdysterone. Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars were need for experimentation where four were used as the controll group and four were used as the independent variable. The controll group consisted of putting 7 drops of water on the caterpillars food source. The independent variable was the addition of  7 drops of ecdysterone inhibitor on the food source of the caterpillars in the experimental box. The weights of the caterpillars were monitored and recorded over a 2 week period. The caterpillars individual cells were cleaned when the caterpillars was overtaking space. Food was replaced when low and the appropriate drops of water/ecdysterone inhibitor were added depending on the caterpillar.


Results:
From the beginning of experimentation the caterpillars with the ecdysterone heavy diet ate much less and weighed much less than the controll group. As time when on the movement of the experimental group was also much less than the controll group. Towards the end of experimentation the some of the caterpillars in the controll were starting to pupate, while the caterpillars with added ecdysterone showed minimal movement and weight gain. General trends seen through experimentation were that the experimental group ate, moved, and weighed less than the controll group.




Discussion:
The overall data from the lab suggests the that addition of ecdysterone to the Manduca Sexta regulates its growth. 20E’s (Ecdysterone) presence prevents hormones from causing a switch in differentiative program from larval to pupal or from pupal to adult”(Riddiford, 2003).The controll group was able to grow steadily and in some cases even pupate wheile the experimental group weighed much less than the controll group throughout experimentation. The charts show how the the controll group went through constant growth, and the experimental group began to grow and then started to flat line and then even slightly decrease.
