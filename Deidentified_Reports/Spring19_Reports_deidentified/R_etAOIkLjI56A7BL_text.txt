Title: Nicotine and its effects on twitch threshold

Abstract:
The gastrocnemus muscle in many amphibians has been in many research applications in the neuromuscular field of science. Having an analogous muscular-nervous makeup to humans, many discoveries learned from amphibians can be directly applicated to our physiology. In this study, we are studying the effects of nicotine on the threshold for muscle twitch contraction in the femoral muscle in frog legs. Since nicotine has been found to bind to nicotinic receptors that are excitatory on the neuromuscular junction, it was expected that the applied voltage needed to induce contraction will be lowered when nicotine is injected into the muscle. The data collected from this experiment showed no significent different difference in threshold amplitude. This data did not support our hypothesis. Overall, our findings imply that nicotine does not affect voltage threshold in muscles specifically despite its proven affinity for receptors in the neuromuscular junction. 


Introduction:
The neuromuscular junction is arguably one of the most important synapses in the body. This junction conjoins two of the organ systems in the body that together are responsible for the majority of the tasks we perform daily. The focus of our study was to document the effects of allowing nicotine to bind at the neuromuscular junction. Molecules such as nicotine are known as agonists, drugs that bind to and fully activate a neurotransmitter receptor. Many well known street drugs are likewise agonists such methamphetamine.() While nicotine may not have such drastic effects, it too stimulates a specific receptor, the nicotinic receptor in the neuromuscular junction. Nicotine is known to induce shakes and uncontrolllable muscle spasms in high concentrations.[Alim, 1995] This is due to the function of the receptor nicotine is an agonist for. This receptor is an excitatory binding site, one that when bound to, allows the diffusion of cations into the muscle cell. [Cox, 1972]These ions are those that depolarize the muscular cell. When the cell is depolarized enough, an action potential is generated and sent down T-Tubles which lead to contraction in the cell. [Fatt, 1958] Amphibians like humans, have nicotinic receptors in their neuromuscular junction. Thus, like humans, their muscle cells can be depolarized by the agnostic effects of nicotine [Akazu, 1983]. The depolarization of the inside of the muscle is the first in the cascading steps which lead to muscle contraction. It is expected then, when the muscle is stimulated by a voltage, the threshold for contracted to be lower. If nicotine is injected into the muscle, the twitch threshold will be significently lower. 


Materials and Method:
Three frog legs had their skin removed, and their gastrocnemus muscle separated from the bone on the side opposite form the sciatic nerve. The leg around the muscle was pinned down to a table while the gastrocnemus muscle was raised to a 90 degree angle by a string. This string is attached to an apparatus that measures force applied on the string. Also, this apparatus was able to apply a very accurately controllled electric pulse. Using this, the threshold for applied electric pulse to generate tension in the muscle was found in each of the muscles of the three legs. After this, 2Ml of concentrated nicotine was injected into the muscle and the previous steps were repeated. After all of the data was recorded, a paired T test was used to determine if the data was significent or not. 



Results:
The average amplitude needed for tension in the controll group was 0.18 V. The average amplitude needed for tension in the experimental group was 0.16 V. The Standard deviations for the controll and the experimental group was 0.09 and 0.04 respectively. The P value of the paired T test was 0.7. One of the three muscles spasmed when initially injected with nicotine

Discussion:
Due to our P value being larger than 0.05, our data was not significent. This shows that out data did not support out hypothesis, indicating that no significent change in twitch threshold was seen between the two groups. As we were studying solely on twitch threshold, we cannot make any conclusions on the twitches we saw when injecting nicotine into the muscle. When attempting to recreate this lab, it is recommended to have more than three frog legs to allow for a bigger and more reliable data pool which in turn would allow more conclusive statements to be made. Our qualitative observation while not the focus of our lab does reaffirm that nicotine does in fact have effects on the neuromuscular junction. The twitches seen in the muscle when injecting nicotine is very similar to the common side effect of shakes after using nicotine products. Despite our hypothesis not being supported we were able to obtain some knowledge on the agnostic effects of nicotine on the muscular system in the body.
