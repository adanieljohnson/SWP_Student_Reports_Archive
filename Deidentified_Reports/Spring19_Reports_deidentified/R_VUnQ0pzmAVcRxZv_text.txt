Title: The Effects of Nitrogen on Physical Variation of Field Peas

Abstract:
	In order to understand physical variation between plants in different environments, it is important to study resource allocation and how exposure to certain abiotic factors can determine physical attributes of a species. Thus, in this experiment, we tested how nitrogen exposure would physically alter field pea plants. By measuring their root: shoot ratios after a two-week growing period, we would be able to measure the physical variation between a controll and experimental group. We predicted the experimental group exposed to excess nitrogen at germination would have a lower root: shoot ratio, as roots did not need to grow to find excess nitrogen. Yet, due to experimental error, we were unable to obtain enough sufficient data to support or deny our hypothesis. If conducting the experiment again, we would use less of the nitrogen supplement on the experimental group, as it probably caused too much moisture collection, which led to the molding of the seeds and ultimate inability to measure accurate results. 

Introduction:
Depending on an environment, plants tend to physically vary. Species found in a dense forest typically differ from those in an arid climate. Such variation is in part due to resource allocation, in which plants devote energy onto areas that need help in accessing certain abiotic necessities that would otherwise be hard to access. Thus, plants that are not exposed to abundant sunlight may grow taller than those that do. One way in which we can measure the effects of resource allocation is through the calculation of a plants’ root: shoot ratio. Root and shoots have two different functions for the plant, and either may grow according to the nutrient they are trying to access. Root’s main function depends on soil nutrient, such as nitrogen, whereas shoots are responsible for photosynthesis and receiving sunlight. 
Therefore, in this experiment, our lab group aimed to measure the effects of resource allocation on field peas that were and were not exposed to extra nitrogen. In this, we planted four pots of field peas, giving two a nitrogen supplement during the germination step.  By measuring their root: shoot ratios after two weeks of growth, we were going to determine if nitrogen exposure had an effect on their physical makeup. We predicted that if the field peas were given the nitrogen supplement, then they would have a lower root: shoot ratio than those that did not receive nitrogen, as their roots would not have to grow in order to find necessary nutrients. 


Materials and Method:
	In order to conduct this experiment, four pots of field peas were planted, two of which were given 1/3 cup of a nitrogen supplement, miracle grow. Plants were watered every two days in the greenhouse for the span of two weeks. After the two-week period, we collected data from three plants from each pot, a total of 12 plants. We measured the total plant weight, then separated the root from the shoot right above the growing pea. Then we measured both the root and shoot separately, both their weight (g) and length (mm). From this information, we calculated root: shoot ratios for the field peas exposed to nitrogen and those that were not. With these calculations, we used a two-sample t_test to determine variation between the two groups. 

Results:
When collecting our plants from the greenhouse, we noticed the experimental group (nitrogen) did not grow within the two-week span. These field peas did not react well with the amount of miracle grow they were exposed to, which resulted to molding around their seeds (Picture 1). Thus, when recording data, we listed all measurements as 0 for the experimental group. The controll group grew in length and we were able to collect data from those plants. Such measurements were recorded (Table 1). From this graphed data, root: shoot ratios of the controll group are much larger than the recorded 0 for the experimental group (Graph 1). After conducting a two-sample t_test on our limited data, we found the two groups had a degree of freedom of 10, and were significently different, as their two-tailed p_value of 4.02E-7 was less than .05. Yet, due to experimental error, we were unable to truly support or deny our original hypothesis. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that field peas exposed to the nitrogen supplement would have a lower root: shoot ratio, could not be supported or denied because of experimental error. Due to the molding of the experimental group’s seeds during germination, our group could not collect sufficient data to test our hypothesis. Rather, we learned how to repeat this experiment in a more efficient manner. When planting our experimental group, we gave the two pots 1/3 cup of Miracle Gro. Yet, an amount that dense is not recommended for container plants, since the soil can become very compacted leading to limited air space and water collection. Unpasteurized soil to that degree can lead to weeds, insects, and diseased organisms (Smith, 2015). Furthermore, it is necessary the experimental group’s pots have enough drainage, as soil that dense should have the ability to filter. The slots keep soil from collecting to much moisture, which quickly leads to mold, even with adequate ventilation (Millard, 2015). When replicating this experiment, our group would not use the same, dense amount of Miracle Gro to avoid over moisturized field peas, and inevitably, mold. Rather, we would reduce the supplement in hopes to achieve measurements to test our hypothesis.
