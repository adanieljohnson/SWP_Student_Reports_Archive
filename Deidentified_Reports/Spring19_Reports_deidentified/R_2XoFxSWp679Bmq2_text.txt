Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone Analog on Mass and Length of Manduca sexta Larva

Abstract:
In this experiment, we explored the effect of a juvenile hormone analog on the mass and length of Manduca sexta larva. We mixed five drops of Martins IGR analog into the food of four larva and daily measured their mass and length and compared these measurements to the daily mass and weight of four control caterpillars fed the same diet, but without the juvenile hormone activator. Because juvenile hormone regulates insect development, we hypothesized that the caterpillars treated with juvenile hormone analog in their food would grow to a great mass and length than untreated caterpillars. Initially, the treated caterpillars were longer and of greater mass, but by the end of fifteen days, the control caterpillars were longer and of greater mass. Because our data was insignificant, we conclude that juvenile hormone analogs do not promote larva to increase in length or mass but govern other aspects of insect development.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as tobacco hornworms, are pests of the Order Lepidoptera whose lifecycles last between thirty-nine and forty-seven days and include five larval instars and a pupa stage before eclosing into an adult moth [Johnson: 2016]. The development of M. sexta from caterpillar to adult moth is mediated by three hormones, prothoracicotropic hormone, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone [Johnson: 2016]. Juvenile hormone is secreted from the corpus allata gland in the insect’s foregut and has been known to science since the 1930’s [Johnson: 2016] [Staal: 1975]. A high level of juvenile hormone, hereafter known as JH, maintains internal conditions which mediate a larva-to-larva molt; low or nonexistent levels of JH allow the insect to undergo a larva-to-pupa molt [El-Sheikh: 2016] [Johnson: 2016].  Juvenile Hormone Analogs, JHAs for short, are “structural mimics” to JH [El-Sheikh: 2016]. Because JH and JHAs effect the normal development of insects, they are insect growth regulators, or IGRs [Staal: 1975]. The introduction of an IGR such as JHA to an insect has a similar effect to prolonging the period of time when JH is produced by that insect. The introduction of such compounds as JHAs or other IGRs results in extra larval or nymph forms, superlarva, of giant, though perfect proportion, or imperfectly proportioned, half larva-half pupa or -half adult forms [Staal: 1975]. In Spodoptera littoralis and in Spodoptera frugiperda, other species of Lepidopteran pests, the IGR insecticides methoprene, fenoxycarb, and pyriproxypen were demonstrated to extend the duration of the last larval stage, and a statistically significant number failed to develop normally into adults [El-Sheikh: 2016]. The effectiveness of IGRs as pesticides depends on their ability to prevent treated insects from developing into viable adults that can reproduce, rather than outright killing them. Since giant Lepidopteran superlarva do not usually eclose into viable, reproductive adults, and imperfect forms are typically nonviable, IGRs are decent pesticides against Lepidoptera [Staal: 1975]. But are treated caterpillars more pestilential while still caterpillars than untreated larva? If an IGR treatment causes caterpillars to grow longer and heavier, then they would consume more food, and thus be more pestilential. In this experiment, we measured the length and weight of M. sexta caterpillars fed a diet augmented by five drops of the insect growth regulator, Martin’s IGR. Considering that Lepidoptera treated with IGRs may grow into superlarva, it is hypothesized that recently hatched M. sexta larva fed a normal caterpillar diet augmented by five drops of synthetic juvenile hormone analog will be longer and heavier after two weeks than M. sexta fed a normal diet over the same period of time.

Materials and Methods:
We selected eight young M. sexta caterpillars weighing .34 g to 1.04 g and measuring 27 mm to 42 mm and placed them in separate ventilated cells. With an electronic balance, we measured 10.00 g of food (made according to package instructions) per caterpillar used into a plastic container. For this experiment, we initially measured out 80.00 g of caterpillar food. We kneaded the food into one large, homogenous clump, then divided the food into 10.00g balls using a spoon, gloved fingers, and the balance. For the control group, we mixed five drops of distilled water into each caterpillar food ball and placed one food ball in each control caterpillar’s cell. For the treatment group, we made four food balls using the same process as for the control group, but we mixed in five drops of Martins JHA instead of water. We then placed the caterpillar containers into an incubator kept at 28oC with a twenty-four-hour light cycle. Every day for fifteen days we measured and recorded each caterpillar’s mass in grams and length in millimeters and record any other qualitative observations. We replenished food, following the same process as before, as needed. We compared the average masses of the treatment group to that of the control group using a two-sample t-test, and we compared the average lengths with the same test. We evaluated our data using a one-tailed p value.

Results:
The average mass of the treatment group was greater than the average mass of the control group until the eleventh day. The average mass of the treatment group increased until day twelve and decreased until day fifteen. The rate of increase of the average mass was greater from day one to day nine than from day nine to day twelve. The average mass of the control group mostly increased until the last day, and increased at a greater rate than the treatment group after day nine. (Fig 1). The standard deviation for the control group was above three grams because one of the four caterpillars was less than half the size of the other caterpillars until day eleven, when it experienced a rapid growth spurt (Fig 1).  The average length of the treatment group was longer than the average length of the control group until the twelfth day. The average length of the treatment group and the control group both generally increased until a certain point, respectively day thirteen and day twelve. (Fig 2).  It should first be noted that one of the four treatment group caterpillars never ate any food and died after one week. This caterpillar’s data has not been included. Before this caterpillar died, it stopped eating and execrating. The difference in mass and the difference in length were not significant; the P value for our two sample t-test for mass was greater than 0.05 (t-stat = 0.03, df = 28, P = 0.488), and the P value for our two sample t-test for length was also greater than 0.05 (t-stat = 0.87, df = 28, P = 0.195). 

Discussion:
The results of the two-sample t-test for both mass and for length indicate that our data is not significant, and so our hypothesis is rejected. Although the treated caterpillars were longer and of greater mass than the control caterpillars for most of the days in the experiment (Figures 1 and 2), the difference between the two groups was not so great that it could be attributed to the IGR. So according to this data, M. sexta larva fed a normal caterpillar diet augemented by five drops of synthetic juvenile hormone analog will not be longer and heavier after two weeks than M. sexta fed a normal diet over the same period of time. Our hypothesis may have been rejected because our data was imprecise, as demonstrated by wide standard deviations in both Figures 1 and 2. Even in the control group, length and mass varied considerably, as shown by the large standard deviation. Increasing the number of test subjects, and selecting subjects nearer to each other in initial mass and length would increase the precision of the data. On the other hand, our data reaffirms the known action of JH. The introduction of JH prolongs the last instar of Lepidopteran larva before pupation, and the introduction of an IGR to Lepidopteran larva in their final instar before pupation results in malformed adults [El-Sheikh: 2016]. The experiments differed: the larva in this other experiment were topically treated with JHAs and our larva were fed Martin’s IGR; the larva were of a different species compared to ours, but were of the same order, Lepidoptera [El Sheikh: 2016]. Tellingly, this experiment did not measure the weight or length of larva treated with an IGR before they pupated and eclosed into adults; instead, this experiment measured the percentage of treated larva which pupated and eclosed into normally formed adults in comparison to controls [El Sheikh: 2016]. This experiment demonstrates that JHAs decrease the likelihood of treated Lepidopteran larva to pupate and eclose, and by extension, reaffirms that JH governs the type of molt a larva will undergo [El Sheikh: 2016]. JH, and JHAs, both IGRs, do not function as a growth hormone; they do not promote larva to grow to larger masses or longer, as demonstrated in our experiment. Instead, JH functions as a regulator of stages in Lepidopteran development, regulating the type of molt an insect will undergo [Johnson: 2016][El Sheikh: 2016]. So although IGRs may induce Lepidopteran larva to molt into superlarva, extra larval instars of large proportions [Staal: 1975], they do not promote larva to grow heavier and longer within a single instar, as shown in our insignificant data.
