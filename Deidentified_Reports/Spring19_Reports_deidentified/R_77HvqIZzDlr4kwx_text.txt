Title: Effect of Precor Insect Growth Regulator on the Growth and Development of Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The development of Manduca sexta is controlled by its internal concentration of different hormones, like Juvenile Hormone (JH). Precor is an insect growth regulator, which may affect the hormone levels of an organism, and therefore could affect the organism’s development. It was hypothesized that the use of Precor on the Manduca sexta larvae would increase the size and weight of the larvae. The data from the experiment was found to support the hypothesis. The average change in weight and length of the Precor group was 6.22 grams and 31.4 mm, while the control group only experienced a growth of 4.29 grams and 22.4 mm. Using a two-sample T-test, the results were found to be significantly significant. This showed that the use of Precor interrupted the development of the larvae. Possibly, the Precor could be used a form of pest control, as it could limit the number of larvae that reach reproductive maturity. 

Introduction:
[Manduca sexta] is a species of moth native the North Carolina. Their growth and development, from egg to adult, is driven by the presence of hormones. The timing and concentration of Juvenile Hormones (JH) and ecdysterone (20E) determines when and how the larvae will develop [Johnson, 2018]. If the timing and the concentrations of either hormone during development are off, the larvae will fail to develop correctly. Certain substances known as insect growth regulators (IGR) have been known affect hormone levels in insects, and therefore affect the development of said organisms [Tunaz, 2004]. Further inquiry is focused on how the insect growth regulator (IGR) Precor will affect the growth and development of the [Manduca sexta] larvae. It is thought that the addition of the IGR Precor will result in larvae that are larger, in both height and weight, than larvae treated with only water. 

Materials and Methods:

-Four 4-cell containers	-Mixing spoon
-Sharpie	                        -Balance scales
-Food	                        -Transfer pipettes
-Square mixing container-Ruler
-Precor reagent	        -Sixteen Manduca sexta larvae
-Four lids (one for each container)
-Distilled water	        -Hole-making tool

Procedure:

1.	Holes were created in each of the cells of the plastic containers with the use of the hole-making tool. After the holes were created, a sharpie was used to mark two of the container as the Precor group, and the other two as the control group. In each of the groups, the cells were marked 1 through 8. 
2.	Eighty grams (g) of food was measured out into the mixing container.
3.	In the mixing container, a spoon was used to chop up and smash the food until it achieved a semi-smooth consistency.  
4.	Using the pipette, 48 drops of distilled water was added to the food and stirred in. 
5.	Ten grams of the food and water mixture was measured out on the scale. The food was then placed into one of the cells in the control container. Each cell received one 10g ball of food. 
6.	Steps 2-5 were repeated, this time adding the Precor hormone rather than distilled water to the food and placing the food in the containers marked Precor. 
7.	The weight (in grams) and length (in millimeters) of each larva was measured and recorded before they were placed in their respective container cell. Measurements were taken again for each of the larvae on days 7 and 14 of the experiment.
8.	The two-sample T-test was used on the difference in length of weight of the larvae from day 1 to day 14 to determine statistical significance of the results.


Results:
To compare growth between the control and the Precor groups, the difference between the starting and ending measurements (delta) was used for further evaluation. The average change in length of the control and the Precor group was 4.95g and 6.22 g, respectively. The average change in length between the control group and the Precor group was 22.4mm and 31.4mm, respectively. The delta values found in Table 1 and Table 2 were plugged into their own respective two-sample T-tests. It was found that the one-tailed p-value for weight was 0.048, demonstrating that there is at least a 95% confidence that there is a statistically significant difference in the weight of the two groups. The one-tailed p-value for the delta measurements in length was found to be 0.0040, which also showed that there was a statistically significant difference in the length of the two groups with at least 95% confidence.

Discussion:
In the experiment, it was found that there was a statistically significant difference in length and weight between the control and the Precor-treated larvae. This makes sense, as Precor is an insect growth regulator (IGR) and affects concentrations of juvenile hormone (JH) in the organism, and ultimately affect the development of the larvae [Tunaz, 2004]. This effect could be observed within the experiment. By the end of the two weeks, many of the larvae were close to or had begun pupating. On the contrary, the Precor group still bore the coloring and markings of early larvae in their early stages of development. The larvae in the Precor group had simply kept growing, but did not develop like the control, resulting in a much larger change in weight and length than the control. 
A possible error in lab could have occurred. Length measurements could be due to difficulties measuring the larvae with a ruler. As the larvae developed, they tended to shrink up or move often, making measurements difficult. Rounding length measurements happened often. To reduce this in the future, a tape measurer could be used to gather length recordings even when the organism is not lying straight.
Potentially, the use of an IGR could be used as a form of pest control.[Manduca sexta], known colloquially as the “tobacco worm” [Johnson, 2018], is a pest of North Carolina’s tobacco crops. The use of an IGR on these organisms as larvae would not kill them. However, the effect would work to stop the larvae from pupating and reaching adulthood – the developmental stage when the species can reproduce [Kiguchi, 1978]. The effect would be to reduce the number of individuals that can reproduce, so that the next generation would contain fewer offspring. 
Further inquiry may look into other possible IGRs. In future experiments, natural materials like coffee or coconut milk may be replaced as the reagent to see of the addition of these compounds could affect the development of the [Manduca sexta] larvae, and therefore be used as an alternative form of pest control.
