Title: Effect of Glyphosate on the Photosynthesis in Spinach, Kale, and Collard Greens

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the method that plants use to capture energy from the sun light. The energy that plants accumulate through high energy electrons is then transferred into forms of growth, food and other uses in the plant cells. Stopping this energy supply from a plant has the potential to inhibit growth. This is the method that many farmers use when they use herbicide. The herbicide Roundup Pro is a common herbicide used to kill weeds. It is hypothesized that if spinach, kale and collard greens are infected with this herbicide it will decrease the amount of photosynthesis that the cells undertake. It was found using DCIP and a spectrometer to find the amount of photosynthetic activity that Roundup Pro herbicide increased the amount of photosynthetic activity in all of the leafs tested. 

Introduction:
All things get their energy from different sources. Plants capture light from the sun and convert it into energy through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose, water and oxygen. The majority of the aspects of photosynthesis happen in the chloroplast of the plant cell. Many factors can effect photosynthesis, such as the amount of green pigment in the cell, ATP synthesis, factors in the environment, the electron transport complexes, electron carrier molecules and many more. If some of these factors are altered then photosynthesis can be inhibited. This inhibition is how many herbicides work. 
	The herbicide Roundup Pro contains the active ingredient Glyphosate. Glyphosate is a very common ingredient in many herbicides that are directed at killing weeds. Glyphosate works by interfering with the photosynthetic electron transport in plants light reactions (Büchel:1971). This lab will test Roundup Pro on three different types of leaves, spinach, kale and collard greens. The photosynthetic activity of each of the plants will be measured with herbicide and without herbicide to see how effective Roundup Pro is on each plant. It is hypothesis that the plants with herbicide will have a higher absorbance and less photosynthetic activity then the plants without herbicide.  
Photosynthesis activity in a plant cell can be measured in plants by using a molecule called DCIP. DCIP has two confirmations. In one confirmation it can make a solution appear blue and in the other confirmation it can make the solution appear clear. When an electron from the sun hits DCIP it changes confirmation to appear more clear. The amount of photosynthesis II activity can be measured using a spectrometer to detect the change in color. When DCIP turns clear it decreases in absorbance, this in turn represents the amount of photosynthesis happening in the cell. 


Materials and Methods:
First we took out the veins in a few leaves of spinach. Then they were put in a cold mortal and pestle and ground up with 10mL of cold grinding buffer. After that became a slurry, another 10mL of grinding buffer were added and mixed more. This slurry was then filtered through a cheese cloth and the liquid portion was put into a centrifuge tube. After 3 min of centrifuging the liquid from the top of the tube was then poured into another centrifuge tube. After about 10 min of the second tube centrifuging, the liquid was poured out of the top and the pellet at the bottom was kept. The pellet was then mixed with 20mL of grinding buffer. These steps were then repeated for kale and collard greens. 
	After all the pellet solutions were prepared as table one shows.  
Once all the tubes were ready to begin the assay 100 L of the enriched chloroplast was added to all the tubes that called for chloroplast per the table above and were mixed immediately. Each set of tubes was transferred to cuvettes and their absorbance was taken immediately at 600nm. The set of cuvettes was then placed in the window by the sun. After 10 min the absorbencies were read again and placed back in the sun. This process continued until a total of 30 min had passes where the cuvettes were exposed to sunlight. A two sample T-test was used to compare each of the plants with herbicide and the plants without herbicide. 



Results:
The absorbance's of all the different leafs decreased when they were put in the sun for 10 minute increments (Graph 1). The general trends show that Glyphosate increased the photosynthetic activity of spinach, kale, and collard greens. A two sample t-test on the Spinach leafs found that the spinach with herbicide versus the spinach without herbicide was statistically different (p-value=0.004812; t-value=4.35208; dof=6). A two sample t-test on the Kale leafs found that the kale leafs with herbicide and the kale leafs without herbicide was statistically different (p-value=0.001043; t-value=5.9115; dof=6). A two sample t-test on the collard greens with herbicide and without herbicide came to be statistically different (p=value=0.0175; t-value=3.248; dof=6) 

Discussion:
Each type of leaf absorbance decreased with more time in the sun, which means that the photosynthetic activity increased (Graph 1). When an herbicide, Roundup Pro, was added to the leafs, the photosynthetic activity increased substantially. The leave's chloroplast with herbicide and without herbicide were statistically different for each type of plant, but not in the direction hypothesized. This was not what was hypothesized and was surprising to see. It was expected that with Roundup Pro present the photosynthetic activity would be significantly less than the photosynthetic activity in the leafs without herbicide because it would inhibit the ability of the plant to do photosynthesis, however, the exact opposite was shown. After doing some extensive research it was found that the active ingredient in Roundup Pro, glyphosate, has been seen to increase growth in certain plants including barley (Cedergreen: 2010). Other research found that some plants might have certain types of genes that the plant is composed of that cause them to increase photosynthesis with the presence of glyphosate. In a plant where glyphosate inhibits photosynthetic activity the Ala-100-Gly gene was mutated. The mutation caused it to increase photosynthetic activity when glyphosate was added, but after they took away the mutation it went back to being inhibited with glyphosate present (Funke: 2006). These few sources said that they were really unsure as to why the presence of glyphosate in certain plants made it increase the photosynthetic activity, while in others it decreased it.

Graph one shows the average percentage change versus the time in the sun for chloroplasts. The general trends show that spinach had the largest change in absorbance over the 30 min time period in the sun and collard greens had to least. All plants did show a change in absorbance throughout the time 30 min.
Graph two shows the average change in absorbance versus time in minutes. The general trends show that each leaf increased their absorbance at a very similar rate. Spinach had the highest absorbance changes, while kale and collard greens had similar changes during the 30 min time period. *************************************************************************
