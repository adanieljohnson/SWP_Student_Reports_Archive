Title: Manduca sexta Lab

Abstract:
Abstract: Insect growth can be altered in many ways by experimental processes. The insect growth regulator that is used in many experiments controls how the insect would grow whether it is increasing or decreasing in size. In this experiment we looked at a control group that had only water added to the food of the Manduca sexta and a group that was treated with azaguard hormone in the food. The length and weight was measured each day to discover the results and effects the treatments had. The expectation of the hormone was that it would increase the size of the worm and outgrow the control group. There was a significant difference at the 7th day between the two groups and it shows on the graphs and tables. The observations at the end show a difference as well because the control group of worm were large and long with a bright green color while the azaguard treated worms were dull, small and short as if they died earlier in the process.


Introduction:
Intro: In this experiment we tested the effect of hormones on the growth and weight gain of Manduca sexta. The independent variable being the hormone treatment given and the dependent variable is the growth of the worms. A hormone is a regulatory substance produced in an organism and transported in tissue fluids such like blood to activate specific cells or tissues to react.In humans, puberty is where we see most of the hormones our body has to develop us into adults. It is when we chemically and physically become an adult so imagine it as a little kid basically transforming into a big adult but slowly as time goes on so it is hard to see at once. In the Manduca sexta we tested the hormones do a similar thing but it is faster and more visible. The worms molt into an adult then into a moth. Molting can accomplish different things under different circumstances, such as a change in size or a change in form, it is reasonable to assume that the timing of a molt must be adapted to these functions. The onset of a metamorphic molt, in particular, must be precisely controlled because the onset of metamorphosis terminates the growth phase of a larva and establishes the body size of the adult insect(Nijhout 631). Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) was used to affect the growth and size of the worms. N. S. Butter did a labratory experiment of IGR and found that IGR treatment in the larval stage significantly affected both pupal length and pupal weight(Butter 200). Pupal duration of the test insect was significantly extended by IGR treatment. The Manduca sexta have four stages which are the egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. They are regulated by the juvenile hormone that helps with development. In This experiment we gave the worms azaguard hormone and evaluated their weight and length everyday. Testing was done to see if adding 6 drops of azaguard hormone to the Manduca sexta food then the growth in length and weight would increase because adding IGR’s should boost the development of an insect.


Materials and Methods:
 Materials and Methods: The worms were selected out of a container to be put into each groups individual container. The smaller worms were picked so the best results came out of it instead of ones that were already big. Each container was numbered 1 through 8 and labeled with the names of the group members. The worms were weighed on a gram scale and written down in a table. Then measured as accurate as possible by mL’s and recorded as well. To measure the food there was a container on the scale at zero and 10 grams of food were weighed. Then using a syringe,add 6 drops of the azaguard hormone and mix them together. The food is then added to the container with worms in them.This is done 8 times for each worm to eat. For oxygen to breathe there were two holes poked in the sides of the container away from the food. After the first day the worms are put in the temperature controlled fridge. Each day the worms are checked on, measured by mL and weighed by grams. The food is changed, weighed and 6 drops of hormone is added so it is fresh. The weights and lengths of all 8 worms are recorded each day.


Results:
Results: The mean value for the weight of the worm with no hormone was 5.01 grams and a standard deviation of .602. The mean value for the weight of the worm with azaguard was .098 grams with a standard deviation of .414. The control and treated worm’s t-value was 17.76. The mean length of the control group was 23mL and the standard deviation was 5 while the azaguard group was 1 mL with a SD of 9.69. They had a t-value of 5.34.Observing the worms on the last day it was clear that the control group were much bigger and healthier. The azaguard treated group mostly lost length and weight besides about 1 of them. It seemed like a lot of them were dead or slowly dying. Being darker and less plump it did not seem like they had life left. 


Discussion:
Discussion: The hypothesis tested that the azaguard hormone would increase growth in the worms was not supported after doing the experiment. There was a large difference in the control group that had only water nd the group that was treated suggesting that no hormone and natural growth is better than adding the azaguard to the diet of the Manduca sexta. So the hypothesis was rejected. The experiment had places where it could have gone wrong and that is why many are done. The oxygen in the little containers could have been limited and affected the development of the worms largely. The food measured each time was not exactly 10 grams and was inconsistent so the worm could be eating more or less each day depending on who in the group measured it. The measuring errors on the ruler could have subtracted a few mL’s from the length because the worms did not stay still and it was hard to measure them at times.
