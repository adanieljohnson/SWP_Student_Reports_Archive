Title: Effects of rhizobium on the resource allocation of alfalfa plants 

Abstract:
Meticago sativa, or alfalfa, is a leguminous plant that benefits from symbiotic relationships with nitrogen fixing bacteria and can be utilized for environmental productivity. When plants are provided with easily accessible resources, they are able to promote growth in other areas of the body that can be beneficial in numerous ways. We predicted that since nitrogen fixing bacteria congregate in root nodules of alfalfa plants, resources would be allocated to promote shoot growth, thus decreasing the root to shoot ratio compared to alfalfa plants that do not have the bacteria. We confirmed our hypothesis by testing the effects of rhizobium, the chosen nitrogen fixing bacteria, over a period of 14 days. The plants were potted with miracle grow and watered every other day during the experiment. Our results compare the means of the experimental and controll groups in order to determine if there is a key difference in resource allocation between the two test conditions. Overall, our data show there is a significent difference in the means, great enough to show statistical significance that supports our hypothesis. Our findings are environmentally important in the consideration of areas with limited resources and how alfalfa plants might be an asset to those types of environments. 

Introduction:
Meticago sativa, or alfalfa, is a type of leguminous plant that is valued for soil improvement and crop productivity. Alfalfa plants are particularly useful in arid environments because of their ability to produce most of their resources through the utilization of symbiotic relationships with bacteria in the rhizosphere which is a layer surrounding its roots. These relationships promote growth of the plants and allow the organism to tolerate the stresses of environments that lack key resources (Daur et al. 2008). Frequently, alfalfa enter symbiotic relationships with nitrogen fixing bacteria called rhizobium. Root hairs trap the rhizobium and allow for the formation of nodules on the roots of the alfalfa plants. Bacteria are then released and controll the exchange of carbon and nitrogen between the plant and rhizobia (Ramachandran et al. 2011). The nodules are used in the process of nitrogen fixation which is common in leguminous plants. Rhizobium convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium which is the form of nitrogen used by plants. This conversion of nitrogen into its useable form is done through the synthesis of an enzyme called nitrogenase which catalyzes atmospheric nitrogen into two molecules of ammonia (Al-Kahtani et al. 2017). 

The areas to which plants allocate their resources can provide useful information as to how the organism is responding to its environment. When resources are limited, or in excess, plants can allocate energy and nutrients to various parts of their bodies which can promote growth in select areas depending on which resources are limited or in excess. The purpose of this experiment was to test how the introduction of nitrogen fixing bacteria affects the growth of both the shoots and roots of alfalfa plants. Alfalfa plants were used in this experiment because they are easily accessible, affordable, small enough to keep in the lab, and relatively simple to care for. The roots and shoots of alfalfa plants tested both with and without rhizobium were measured to determine to which regions of the plant body the organism allocates its resources for growth when nitrogen, an essential nutrient, is readily available through root nodules produced by the bacteria.

A study similar to the one conducted in this report found that the shoot to root ratio of alfalfa plants that come in contact with a similar nitrogen fixing bacteria is higher than that of plants that do not participate in this symbiotic relationship (Martínez-Hidalgo et al. 2014). Our study compared root to shoot ratio, and therefore the inverse effect of the shoot to root ratio would be expected, so a decrease of the ratio in rhizobium treated plants. 

Because rhizobium and alfalfa plants enter a symbiotic relationship in which nitrogen is readily available for the plant, we predicted that the experimental groups would have longer shoots than the controll groups, thus creating a smaller root to shoot ratio. This was predicted because resources can be allocated to support the growth of the shoot rather than the need for root growth because a primary role of a root is to find nitrogen in the soil. However, since nitrogen is more readily available for plants interacting with rhizobium, the need for the roots to search for nitrogen is not as prevalent as it is in alfalfa plants without rhizobium. 

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, the alfalfa plants needed to be potted for growth. Four plastic pots were filled approximately two thirds full of soil and soaked with water. Next, 50 Ml of Miracle Grow was placed directly to each of the four soil filled pots. To ensure consistency, the same lab mate placed a small hand.f.ul of alfalfa seeds in each of the four pots and sprinkled rhizobium seeds on the top of the seeds in two of the pots, creating the experimental group. The rhizobium was placed directly on the seeds and spread to ensure that all alfalfa seeds had been covered with an appropriate amount of bacterium. Next, a thin layer of topsoil was placed over all four pots, both the experimental and controll groups, and then all four potted plants were soaked with water. The four plants were transferred to a greenhouse, watered with 200 Ml of water every other day, and remained in the testing environment for two weeks. 

After a two week growth period, the plants were retrieved from the greenhouse to determine the root to shoot ratio. In total for both the experimental and controll group, 60 individual alfalfa plants were measured. Three sets of five replicates (each replicate is one individual plant) for each of the four treatment groups, yielding 15 plants per pot, were excised from the pot, cleaned with water, cut at the division of root and shoot, and then measured. To ensure consistency, the same individual cut all 60 plants and another individual measured all 60 plants. The root to shoot ratio was then determined by dividing the length of the root by the length of the shoot. The average of the 30 controll plants and the 30 experimental plants was taken and compared. 

The statistical test used to analyze the significance of the results was a two tailed t - test because the means of the two test conditions were compared to determine significent differences in the root to shoot ratios. The test was completed by documenting the average root to shoot ratio for both the controll and the experimental groups. 


Results:
The mean value for the experimental plants’ root to shoot ratio was statistically significently different than that of the controll plants’ root to shoot ratio (t_stat = 9.99917, d.f. = 29, P = 6.6E-11). 

On average, the root to shoot ratio of the controll group was higher than that of the experimental group (Fig. 1). The length of the roots of the controll group were longer than those of the experimental group (Fig. 2.) On average, the length of the shoots of the controll group were shorter than those of the experimental group (Fig. 3). 


Discussion:
The two tailed t_test results lead us to reject the null hypothesis, that adding rhizobium has no effect on the resource allocation of alfalfa plants, because our data was statistically significent in showing the difference in means of the two target groups. Therefore, as observed in this experiment, when rhizobium is added to alfalfa plants, resources are allocated to promote the growth of longer shoots than roots because nitrogen, a vital nutrient, is more readily available through the root nodules. 

The results of this experiment support the conclusions made in the study entitled Adaptation of Rhizobium leguminosarum to pea, alfalfa and sugar beet rhizospheres investigated by comparative transcriptomics, that shoots of alfalfa plants grow longer in the presence of nitrogen fixing bacteria (Ramachandran et al. 2011). These findings are important for environmental consideration because alfalfa plants are often utilized in areas lacking easy access to resources as well as for the promotion of soil and crop productivity. Since alfalfa can enter symbiotic relationships that allow the plants to have access to key nutrients more readily, the plants can allocate resources to promote the growth of their shoots. 

The shoot of a plant has many functions including structural support, tissues that transport water and food throughout the plant, organs needed for photosynthesis, and cells that prevent water loss. Since the controll needed to allocate its resources to the roots in order to find key nutrients in the soil, these plants were unable to promote the growth of its shoots. One of the controll plant groups, which did not have rhizobium, was found to have wilted on day 11, likely due to its decreased ability to function as well as the experiment groups because it was not able to grow its shoots as long since it needed longer roots to search for nitrogen in the soil. 

The study could be furthered by exploring the effects of other nitrogen fixing bacteria on alfalfa growth as well as the effects of rhizobium on other leguminous plants. In a different setting, perhaps, rhizobium treated alfalfa plants could be tested under various harsh environmental conditions to determine the tolerance level of the organism and how well the symbiotic relationship bodes for both organisms under high levels of stress.
