Title: Decrease in Size of Male Betta splendens’ Active Zone Results in Increase in Male Betta splendens’ Agonistic Behavior. 

Abstract:
Animals need to regulate their behaviors in response to all environmental conditions since they need to gain food, ran away from predators, and avoid intraspecies competition to survive. In order to understand the behavior of animals and come up with better plans to protect biodiversity, it is important to understand how the effect of size of niche influence animals’ intraspecies agonistic behaviors. Our experimental subject was male Betta splendens. Their agonistic behavior we were looking at was the “red mane.” We put pairs of fish in big tanks and small tanks and the durations of the red mane of two fish in five minutes were recorded. The hypothesis was that if the tank size decreases, then the duration of intraspecies agonistic behavior will increase. The resulted significant difference between the duration of the red mane of fish in the big tank and small tank gave us confident evidence to support this hypothesis. This result suggests that male Betta splendens would be more aggressive toward other males in smaller space. This adaptation warns people to pay attention to prevent the size shrinking of Betta splendens in order to keep them from the intraspecies competition.

Introduction:
Agonistic behaviors are adaptive acts which arise out of conflicts between two members of the same species in competitive situations and include aggressive, submissive, and defensive behaviors [Barratt: 2001]. This kind of behavior is important for animals to deal with intraspecies competitions, especially when there is limited food, mate, or space. They use agonistic behaviors to display their strength and dominance to have access to more resource. The subject of today’s experiment is Betta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish. Their agonistic behavior that we were studying was the “red mane.” The red mane is that the fish protrude the branchiostegal membranes located underneath the opercula, during the situation of danger or competition with other Betta splendens [Johnson: 2018]. Previous research showed that males appear to compete for space through the use of aggressive behavior and to coordinate their fighting activities by means of visual signals [Bronstein: 1981]. The Bettas used in this experiment would display agonistic behavior ranges from levels low to high: from more frequent pelvic fin flicking to aggressive bites on each other. Researches also show that aggressive interactions in which both participants strongly punished one produced mutually exclusive home ranges [Stamps: 2000]. For the Bettas, the aggressive interactions could be considered as strong punishment toward each fish since the agonistic behaviors would highly startle another fish or even cause injuries. Based on previous researches, the home ranges, or the activity range for Bettas should be exclusive. This experiment evaluates the influence of tank size, or activity space, on the duration of the agonistic behavior display by Betta splendens, the “red mane.”  The reason why male Bettas were used in this experiment is that its agonistic behavior is visually significant- healthy, domestic Bettas are very aggressive towards members of their own species, and easy for the researchers to observe and record the duration of their “red mane” [Norman: 1963]. Also, the size of the fish is small enough for two fish to fit in a small tank. They also can be kept alive easily and is adaptive in environmental conditions (tanks), so it is easy for researchers to replicate the experiment. The duration of the agonistic behaviors could be measured in seconds for each fish. The hypothesis is that if the tank size decreases, then the ​duration of the agonistic behavior will increase.

Materials and Methods:
There was a large tank and a small tank. The size of the large tank was 25cmx7cmx50cm. The size of the small tank was15cmx11cmx19cm.
Three male Betta splenden were used in this experiment. The control group used a large tank and represented a large activity range. The experimental group used the small tank and represented small activity space between two male Bettas. Other than the tank size, all the conditions were kept the same: temperature, water condition, other dangers.
We assigned the three fish to pair with each other, resulting in three pairs. 
The three pairs were put into both the small tank and the big tank.
One fish was put at each end of the tan and the durations of the red mane of both fish in five minutes were recorded. And there was no physical barrier in the tanks to separate the fish. 
The length of each observation was five minutes, and more than five minutes were given for the fish to rest before the start of the next round of observation.
The total duration of the red mane of each fish in each observation was recorded in seconds.
The statistical test we used was the paired t-test​. 


Results:
The average duration of red mane displayed by a Betta in the big tank is 26.16± 47.04 seconds, and the average duration of red mane displayed by a Betta in the small tank is 93.23±90.78 seconds (Figure 1). The average difference was 67.07 seconds. There was a ​significant difference between the duration of red mane displayed by Betta in the big tank and small tank (t= 3.46, df=6, p=0.01). We also noticed habituation in the observation. The Bettas red mane were mainly displayed in the fist three minutes. And as the time of exposure increased, the red mane display was less frequent. Also, the Bettas could display the red mane even before turning around and facing another fish directly.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if the tank size decreases, then the duration of the agonistic behavior will increase, was supported by the experiment results. We had confident evidence to conclude that male Bettas are more aggressive when there is a smaller space between Bettas. With smaller activity space between Bettas, they became more aggressive since the competition for space and the possibility for competition for mate was higher [Bronstein: 1981]. This finding fitted the general rules of animal behavior since higher fitness is correlated with a high amount of resource they can access. If the fish could use its agonistic display to show its dominance and strength of the space and the other fish surrender to its power, it could get the whole access of the space, leading to higher fitness [Bronstein: 1981]. 
The habituation we noticed in the observation shows Bettas’ strategy to save energy. The “red mane” would cost energy that could be used in swimming, finding food, mating, therefore, the Bettas only displayed when it is necessary [Clayton: 1968]. When the fish went through some time with the other fish and they didn’t bite each other to death, the level of danger then decreased, and there was no need for red mane to be displayed anymore.
The observations that Bettas could sense the male competition even before visually see the other fish may be influenced by hormones.  Results from past experiments suggest that male Siamese fighting fish secrete substances which affect mirror-induced aggression and respiration rates [Colyer: 1976]. 
Future researches may want to use new fish for each set of observation to avoid the effect of habituation Bettas may develop during the previous observation. Also, a large amount of repetition is needed for the conclusion to be accepted with confidence.
Finer equipment may be needed for more accurately time the duration of the Bettas since sometimes human eye may miss some occurrence of the red mane. And the definition of showing the red mane needs to be refined since the Bettas sometimes only partially display the red mane, not to the full extent.
Understanding the influence of activity space between Bettas on the duration of agonistic behavior could shed a light on how human beings could improve the environmental conditions to keep the Bettas and other kinds of fish. Enough space may be needed to avoid severe damage to the fish caused by intraspecies competition.
