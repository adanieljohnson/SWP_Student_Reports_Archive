Title: The Effect of Precor on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment is to determine whether or not Precor, substituting in for Juvenile Hormone, has an effect on the size of Manduca sexta caterpillars. This will be tested in terms of the caterpillars’ heights and weights collected during the experiment, with a Two-Sample T-Test being conducted to test both. Here, Precor is acting as a substitute for Juvenile Hormone, which is a hormone that controlls the molting of the caterpillar larvae. The hypothesis of this experiment was that the group treated with Precor-soaked food would be larger, in weight and length, than the controll group would be. This hypothesis was not supported by the results obtained, proving that further expanding on this particular experiment or on other similar studies needs to be done.

Introduction:
This experiment is designed to test the effect of Precor, a Juvenile Hormone substitute, on Manduca sexta caterpillars. Juvenile Hormones “are long chain organic molecules that are produced mainly by glands located on either side of the fore-gut, called the Corpus Allata” (11). Juvenile Hormone, or JH as it will be referred to in this experiment, controlls the molting during the caterpillars’ development. It is known that a rise in the level of JH could cause faster or greater levels of molting into a larvae in these caterpillars. This experiment has been designed to test the question- “Would Precor, a JH supplement, have an effect on the size of the Manduca Caterpillars?”. The experimenter’s hypothesis for this was that the group that would be treated with Precor-soaked food would be larger, in weight and length, than the controll group, proving that Precor would increase the size of the test subjects.



Materials and Method:
Method and Materials
Materials:
1. 2, 4-cell containers
2. 2 lids
3. Sharpie marker	
4. “Hole” tool
5. Food (in refrigerator)
6. Spoon
7.Square container
8. Balance
9.Transfer Pipets
10. Reagant (Precor)
11. 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars

Method:
1. Puncture holes (2) in each cell of the container
2. Label containers in Sharpie
3. Number the cells that will be storing a caterpillar to keep track of them (1-8)
4. Measure 40 g of food 
5. Stir the food 
6. Weigh 10 g of food for all 4 of the controll group caterpillars (the ones that will be treated with water) 
7. Place in the plastic box
8. Use the transfer pipet to add 100 Ml of water to the food
9. Place 10g of soaked food for in each of the 4 cells of the first container
10. Repeat steps 4-8, replacing the container with the second one, replacing the caterpillars with the test group, and using the Precor (0.1 concentration) instead of water
11. Measure weight and length of each caterpillar for the original measurement
12.Record these measurements in the lab notebook
13. Place the caterpillars in their cells
14. Place the container in an incubator (24 hours of light)
15. Each day for the duration of the experiment, record the length and width of each caterpillar, while also replacing the food in each cell if it is dried out
16. Throw away all trash, put materials in storage, and wash them
17. Completely clean up lab area


Results:
All of the caterpillars that were tested started off weighing between 0.5-1.0 grams and being between 3-4 centimeters in length. For the controll group, they gained between 0.9-10.07 grams in weight and between and between 1.2-4.5 centimeters in length (as seen in Table #1). For the test group, they gained between -0.47-7.04 grams and between -0.5-3.2 centimeters (as seen in Table #2). With the data collected and averaged, a Two-Sample T-Test was conducted to determine whether or not the test group was significently heavier than the controll group. It was concluded that it was not. Another Two -Sample T-Test was also conducted to determine whether or not the test group was significently longer than the controll group. It was determined that it was not. Also observed was one caterpillar (#8) that died during the experiment and another caterpillar (#2) that also appeared close to death. There also appeared to be outliers, which could have skewed the results.

Discussion:
First off, the results of this experiment did not support the experimenter’s hypothesis. This could be due to many reasons, particularly that the concentration of the Precor that was used in the experiment was not enough to make for a noticeable or significent effect in the weight or length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. There are also many other possible explanations for the hypothesis not being supported. One, of course, being that Precor and JH itself does not increase the size of the caterpillars no matter its concentration. Other potential reasons for this could include that the experiment was not done for a long enough period of time or that the JH was not introduced to the caterpillars at the right point in their development. Also, the experiment could always have resulted in this way due to unrecognized experimenter error(s). All of these bring into question the what the next step is in this experiment. I believe that the best thing to do next would be to expand the experiment. It should be done with larger numbers of subjects and trials and it should be done for a longer period of time to rid the experiment of any outliers. After that, the next best thing to do would be to test different concentrations of Precor. This experiment has a lot of room for improvement and for taking the next step, so it could move forward in multiple different directions besides the ones listed.
