Title: The Effect of pH on the Photosynthetic Rate of Spinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis occurs when plants harness sunlight in order to synthesize energy from Carbon dioxide and water. The rate at which plants are able to perform photosynthesis can be affected by pH. In this experiment, we tested the effect pH levels have on the chloroplast present in photosynthesis. To do so, we tested the rate of absorption change over ten minutes in the chloroplast of Spinacia Oleracea under varying pH levels. We measured ATP production through the rate of electron acceptance in DCPIP. We hypothesized that lower pH would inhibit photosynthetic activity due to an increased acidity as pH levels decrease. Our findings were not significent, indicating that the pH levels tested did not have an effect on the number of chloroplasts in photosynthesis. 

Introduction:
Energy plays an integral role in processes carried out by cells. Due to the fact that plants are capable of synthesizing their own food from inorganic substances, making them autotrophs, plant cells must utilize exterior sources such as light in the production of their own energy. Photosynthesis is the process by which cells produce their own source of energy, glucose. The process of photosynthesis starts with light-dependent​ reactions occurring in the chloroplasts’ thylakoid membranes. Here, an electron transport chain works to reduce oxidized compounds through electron acceptors as ATP is produced. The light-dependent reactions create a proton gradient in order to drive ATP production. It is possible to measure ATP production through the rate of electron acceptance in compounds such as DCPIP- a compound that is colorless when reduced, and dark blue when oxidized. This fact enables one to understand that when there is a decrease in absorbance, there exists a negative correlation to an increase in electron acceptance, increasing photosynthetic reactions (Johnson: 2016). 
	As the rate of photosynthesis increases, so does the rate of glucose output, allotting the cell an increased level of energy to power other processes integral to cellular function. Scientists have long considered variables that may affect photosynthetic rates, either increasing or decreasing them. Potential affecters such as pH levels, for example, have been tested. A previous study was conducted, examining the effects of pH changes on photosynthesis in three Mediterranean seagrass species. It was found that the reduction in photosynthesis caused by the rising pH levels was relatively small (Invers: 1997). For this lab, pH was chosen due to its importance in an organism’s ability to thrive over a range of pH levels.  In considering photosynthetic reactions, it is important to gain an understanding of the effects pH level have on the presence of chloroplasts in photosynthesis. The pH levels tested were 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The rate of photosynthesis (absorbance) at different pH levels were compared at an initial time 0 and again after 10 minutes. It is hypothesized that out of the pH levels, lower pH will inhibit photosynthetic activity the most due to an increased acidity as pH levels decrease. 


Materials and Method:
A mortar and pestle, beaker, 3 50 Ml centrifuge tubes, grinding buffer, 130 mM DCPIP, and reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) were cooled in an ice bucket. Four spinach leaves were deveined, then rinsed and blotted dry before being added to the cold mortar and pestle. There was 10 Ml of grinding buffer poured into the mortar and the leaves were ground into a thick paste. After this, 10 more Ml of grinding buffer was added to the mortar and the mixture was strained through cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. The mixture was poured into a centrifuge tube and spun at 200 x G, 4C for 3 minutes. The supernatant was then poured into the second centrifuge tube and spun for 10 minutes at 1000 x G, 4C. The supernatant was poured out and the 20Ml grinding buffer was poured into the pellet and gently mixed. 4Ml of the suspended mixture was distributed into each of 5 new centrifuge tubes, and 6Ml of pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 were added to a centrifuge tube respectively and labeled. The five tubes were then spun for 10 minutes at 1000 x G 4C. The supernatant was then drained and 2Ml of grinding buffer was added to each centrifuge tube. 200 microliters of each centrifuge tube were micropipette 3 times into test tubes, yielding 15 test tubes for 3 replicas of each pH buffer. One additional test tube served as a blank. The solutions of each test tube were created according to the following: (TABLE INSERTED HERE WITH THE SOLUTIONS). A portion of each sample was poured into a cuvette and their absorbance was measured and recorded. After 10 minutes, the readings were recorded again. 

Results:
Figure 1 demonstrates the trends of the average absorbance at each pH at each time increment (time 0 and after 10 minutes). Table 1 depicts the average percent change in absorbance between time 0 and after 10 minutes, with pH 5 having the largest percent change. Percent change demonstrates the photosynthetic activity that occurred in each sample. Table 2 is a summary of the ANOVA statistical test. The results were insignificent with a p_value greater than 0.05.  

Discussion:
The objective of this lab was to determine whether certain pH levels inhibited photosynthetic activity. Although lower pH levels had a greater inhibitory effect on photosynthetic activity over the 10-minute time interval, as demonstrated in figure 1, the absorbance’s at pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 had no significent difference. The p_value was shown to be 0.396, a value greater than 0.05, indicating that the hypothesis predicting a greater inhibition in lower pH levels was rejected. Other studies conducted have suggested that pH levels do in fact affect the rate of photosynthesis, so it is possible some errors may have occurred during the experiment, affecting the results gathered. For example, there were 2 outliers in our percent change in absorbance after 10 minutes. Overall, as pH levels increased, percent change in absorbance decreased. The two outliers in this data set were pH 7, which had a lower percent change in absorbance than pH 8, or pH 9, and pH 9 had a higher percent change in absorbance than pH 8 did. It is possible this difference in absorbance is due to certain tubes receiving less chloroplast than others when the solutions were prepared. Our results, however, still demonstrated that pH 5 had the greatest inhibitory effect of all the levels tested. These findings are consistent with a study that compared the effects of pH changes on photosynthesis in three Mediterranean seagrass species. It was found that as pH levels increased, there were minimal effects on photosynthetic inhibition (Invers: 1997).
	Another study was conducted, testing the effects of low pH on photosynthesis. This study found that the survival of Citrus plants was highly insensitive to low pH levels (Long: 2017). The results of this experiment show similar results to that of Long’s study: that pH had a very low effect on photosynthetic activity. It is possible that recording absorbance’s after longer periods of time had passed could have led to an increased effect in photosynthetic activity. It is also possible that this experiment could have needed higher concentrations of pH to have more of an effect on photosynthetic reactions.  
	Studies of metabolic effects due to pH are not adequately conducted. Although we know that intracellular pH regulation is caused by changes in ionization of dissociable groups in an enzyme, we do not know exactly to what extent​ pH plays a role in photosynthetic activity (Smith: 1979). Additionally, since the findings in this experiment contradict with previous studies conducted, as well as align with others, it should be recreated to further comprehend the effect pH has on photosynthesis if it has any at all. It would be integral for this experiment to be repeated with higher levels of pH, and with even amounts of chloroplasts in each tube tested. By determining the effect pH has on photosynthesis, plant growth in areas that are more or less acidic could be greatly increased.
