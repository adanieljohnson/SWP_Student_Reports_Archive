Title: The effect of Precor, a JH agonist, on the growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta is a caterpillar which undergoes a commitment pulse before transitioning from the larval stage to the pupal stage.  Our experiment is to test whether increasing JH concentration will prevent the caterpillar from reaching the pupal stage.  We hypothesize that an increase in JH through Precor will affect the weight of Manduca sexta.  We added Precor to the diets of three M. sexta, while keeping three others as a control.  Our testing found no statistically significant difference between the mean percent change in mass of the two groups (P = 0.6379, t-stat = 0.4742, df = 40, α = .05).  However, the masses of the control caterpillars were beginning to decrease as they began to molt while the masses of the experimental caterpillars began to steady.  We could not support our hypothesis but recommend further testing with a longer time interval and more subjects.  Increased time would allow for the control M. sexta to molt, giving the experimenters data to fully see the effects of an increase in JH.  If found to work, Precor could be used as an insecticide that would not cause harm to the human species.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effect of hormones on the development of Manduca sexta.  Manduca sexta is an insect in the same order as all butterflies, moths, and skippers and is commonly referred to as the tobacco hornworm [Johnson: 2016].  The larval stage for Manduca sexta lasts between 13 and 18 days, traversing through five different stages of larval development [Johnson: 2016].  Two hormones (Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E)) work together to control when the Manduca sexta exits the larval stage of development and enters the pupal stage [Johnson: 2016].  Ecdysone 20‐monooxygenase was found to increase in concentration at various times during the development of the Manduca sexta [Mitchell: 1999].  The largest concentration of Ecdysone 20‐monooxygenase is found in both body fat and midgut as a singular peak during the pupal‐pharate adult stadia of Manduca sexta [Mitchell: 1999].  Ecdysone 20‐monooxygenase saw increases in concentration at the end of the fifth larval stage before dropping back down for the pupal stage [Mitchell:1999].    This peak is the commitment pulse for the Manduca sexta and is the catalyst for the transition of the larvae to undergo processes to enter the pupal stage [Johnson: 2016].  At this point, the 20E concentrations surpass that of the JH concentrations, inducing apoptosis for the larval cells in Manduca sexta [Jindra: 2012].  Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) affect the processes within an insect to prevent growth without having any affect on the processes in the human system [Johnson: 2016].  This makes them perfect insecticides as they will prevent insect damage but do not have the same detrimental side effects of DDT and other such pesticides.  For the Stephanitis pyrioides, commonly known as the Azalea lace bug, IGRs are used to prevent viable eggs, protecting the viability of Azalea plants [Joseph: 2019].  Our experiment uses Precor to introduce an excess of Juvenile Hormone into the diet of Manduca sexta.  We hypothesize that an increase in JH through Precor will affect the weight of Manduca sexta because an increase in JH will keep the JH concentrations higher than the 20E concentrations, preventing the M. sexta from entering the pupal stage.  If this experiment is effective, Precor can be used as an insecticide to regulate the metamorphosis of Manduca sexta and prevent the harmful effects of adult M. sexta on crop yields.

Materials and Methods:
Three Manduca Sexta were separated into each a control category and an experimental group.  They were each placed in separate compartments of individual plastic containers with holes for air flow.  10g of food was measured and placed into each compartment, along with the corresponding M. Sexta.  The compartments were then labeled, giving each caterpillar an identification from 1-3 along with their respective treatment group.  The food in each for each member of the control group was given 6 drops of dH2O, and then mixed up before being placed back in the compartments.  6 drops of Precor was mixed in with the food for the members of the experimental group.  Precor will increase the JH levels in the life of the Manduca sexta.  Each M. Sexta’s mass was then recorded.  Every 2-3 days, the caterpillars were weighed, and their mass was recorded.  At this same time, the compartments were cleaned out of all M. Sexta excrement as well as any left-over food.  New food was prepared in the exact same way as the first and placed back in the compartments.  After three weeks, the compartments were cleaned out and the caterpillars disposed of.  The percent change between the first mass and each subsequent mass was calculated and averaged to determine the average percent change in mass of both the control group and the experimental group.  A two-sample t-test was used to compare the average percent change in mass of the control group to the average percent change in mass of the experimental group.

Results:
The mean percent change in mass of the M. Sextas in the control group was 791.04% (Fig. 1).  The mean percent change in mass of those in the experimental group was 833.69% (Fig. 1).  The standard deviation of percent change in mass of the M. Sextas in the control group was 272.95% (Fig. 1).  The standard deviation of percent change in mass of the M. Sexta in the experimental group was 302.77% (Fig. 1).  We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results.  The mean percent change in mass of the M. Sextas with only dH2O was not statistically significantly different than the mean percent change in mass of the M. Sextas in the group with the Precor (P = 0.6379, t-stat = 0.4742, df = 40, α = .05).  When observing the caterpillars, Control #3 began to turn a brown color on day 12.  On that same day, control #2 also began to salivate over the food, turning the food a dark brown color.  Control #2 also began to shrivel up and became squishier than any of the other caterpillars.  On day 14, Experimental #3 gained a hard casing, adding a hint of brown to its color.  Also, on day 14, all the Manduca sexta in the control group had lost weight since the day before, while those in the experimental group stayed stagnant.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that an increase in JH through Precor will affect the weight of Manduca sexta, was not supported.  This could be because of the low sample size used in this experiment.  Using only three Manduca sexta in each experiment could have produced results that are not representative of the entire population.  There also could have not been enough JH in the food.  In order to prevent the commitment pulse, the JH concentration would have had to stay above the concentration of 20E in the Manduca sexta [Mitchell: 1999].  If the six drops of JH used in the food was not enough to surpass the concentration of 20E in the commitment pulse, the Manduca sexta would still begin the process of turning into a pupa.  Another explanation for insignificant data could have been the time constraints.  In the last three days of the experiment, the Manduca sexta in the control group began to lose weight.  This suggests that the control caterpillars were beginning the process of metamorphosis, using their excess weight as energy to turn themselves from larva to pupa [Johnson: 2016].  If the experimentation had continued for a longer amount of time, we might have been able to see if any caterpillar in the experimental group underwent metamorphosis as well.  As it was, none of the Manduca sexta tested completed the metamorphosis process.  If further testing were to prove that Precor was an effective method of increasing JH concentrations in Manduca sexta, Precor should effectively prevent the caterpillars from advancing into the pupal stage [Jindra: 2012].  Further testing could also compare other JH agonists as well as 20E antagonists to determine which is the most effective at controlling the Manduca sexta population.
