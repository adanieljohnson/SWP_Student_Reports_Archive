Title: Effect of Electrical Stimulation on the Minimum Threshold for Frog's Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
In this experiment, the gastrocnemus muscles of frogs are studied based on measuring of their voltage response after direct electrical stimulation. According to this current study, researchers believed that decreased amounts of lidocaine within the frog muscle will cause an increase in the required stimuli therefore raising the threshold. To measure the twitch response and corresponding threshold for 3 frog legs, researchers attached the muscle to the LabScribe ToolBar System, saturated with either lidocaine for the experimental group or no solution for the controll group. The three frog legs voltage responses varied between the controll and frog leg where there was a difference recorded in the thresholds for both groups. However after conducting a paired sample t test, yielding a p value of 0.3165, researchers found the experiment as not statistically significent, therefore the hypothesis wasn’t supported.

Introduction:
The gastrocnemus muscle plays a critical role in the contractile properties of many organisms.  Many factors contribute to how muscle contraction occurs which begins after action potential or a stimulus converts into a response. By having a direct stimulation or one source of action potential,twitches can occur to elicit muscle contraction for smaller organisms. The muscle contraction process continues when the extracellular calcium enters the terminal button while the acetylcholine vesicle will merge into the presynaptic membrane. Then the acetylcholine will bind to ACh receptors allowing for the influx of sodium into the muscle fiber, triggering depolarization in the cell. The sarcoplasmic reticulum will release calcium and through the increases of calcium, it prevents tropomyosin from blocking the binding sites that aid in contraction. During stimulation, a muscle twitch occurs as a nerve is pinched which in this experiment is exemplified through the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve, located on the latter end of the gastrocnemus muscle  will be stimulated through the lab in order to find the voltage. Within past experiments, researchers have found that Cd2+ reduces stimulation responses based on impact of decreased Ca2+ which is critical to muscle contraction [Toda: 1976]. From this study, researchers found that the Cd2+ in concentrations of 0.1 to 2 nM within the isolated frog sciatic nerve of the gastrocnemus muscle did not significently impact the stimulation or twitch tension. After completion of nerve stimulation, the researchers conducted the inhibitory effects of Cd2+ through electrical stimulation in which there was still no recorded difference. However, researchers did discover that Cd2+ does interfere with the release of acetylcholine during depolarization but doesn’t have that same effect towards the post-synaptic membranes.
In this current study, the researchers focused on how decreases in lidocaine within the gastrocnemus muscle of Frogs, Rania nigromaculata, will increase the required threshold for stimulation. Using the understanding of lidocaine as a binding site for ACh within ion channels, researchers believed in its role as an excitatory component for stimulation of the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle, therefore aiding in muscle contraction. 

Materials and Method:
In this lab, researchers used 3 frog legs to test for controll group and experimental group. The experimental group received 25 nM of lidocaine as treatment while the controll group solely received ringer solution. Prior to setting up the 2 groups, the researchers prepared the frog legs by  placing it into the dissecting pan and gently separating the muscles and connective tissues to seemingly reveal the sciatic nerve. After initial preparation, direct stimulation was conducted using the LabScribe ToolBar System. The frog legs were tested separately in which lidocaine was added for one group and just ringer solution for the controll group. For each frog leg, a specific amplitude in voltmeters, typically starting with values less than 1, was tested to determine the minimum threshold stimulus required with single pulses of constant duration. Once the researchers observed no twitch response at certain amplitudes, they began to test for ones closest to the potential threshold and then identified it for recording data. The researchers found the threshold values and compared it respectively between the controll and experimental group. After this, a sample paired t_test was used which was two tailed based on comparison of lidocaine levels vs controll group on gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs. 


Results:
Based on the experiment, it is evident that researchers aimed to find the minimum threshold values required once electrical stimulation occurred though the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog, The researchers were successful in this attempt and they focused their study on the role of lidocaine as a binding site for ACh in facilitating electrical stimulation for the experimental group through injections of 25 nM onto the frog legs. Once they found the minimum thresholds, as recorded in Figure 1, they were able to compare the differences between the controll and experimental group. Considering the controll group lacked the lidocaine solution, it was predicted that these will block neurotransmitters that aid in muscle contraction and reduce the threshold levels or lack responses. As predicted, the controll groups consistently produced lower thresholds for stimulation of electrical responses. For the controll groups, the threshold values were 0.25, 1 and 0.18 V  in comparison to the experimental group with 0.345, 2 and 0.28 V. However, after completing statistical analysis through a two tailed paired test, the experiment was found as lacking statistical significance. Our results from the statistical test are as follows (p value= 0.3165,DF=2, SED=0.301 )


Discussion:
The results from our study suggest that our data doesn’t support the hypothesis of decreasing lidocaine role in raising the threshold required for electrical stimulation of a frog leg. Although the hypothesis wasn’t supported in this experiment, researchers still believe that the lidocaine played a significent role in exciting stimulation for the frog leg muscles. Based on their observations through the experiment, they noticed how the solution aided in twitch response in comparison to the controll group. Similarily to previous experiments, researchers potentially found that their solution that they tested as an excitatory element could’ve represented a neurotransmitter blocker. As in Toda’s experiment, they discovered that Mn2+ contributed to the blocking of Ca2+ , which ultimately inhibited the stimulation more than their expected factor, Cd2+ [Toda: 1976].  Researchers believe that many of the results couldve been based on the difference in size of each frog leg and potentially the handling of the groups during dissection. To further these studies, researchers intend to ensure equal treatment as far as size, temperature and other conditions for each frog leg making the electrical stimulation experiment have a greater statistical significance without confounding variables. Overall, researchers studied how decreased lidocaine increases threshold values , requiring greater amplitudes, however was unable to support this hypothesis after statistical analysis.
