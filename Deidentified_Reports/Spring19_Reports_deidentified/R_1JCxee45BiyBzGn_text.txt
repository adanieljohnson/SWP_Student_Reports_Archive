Title: Nitrogen-rich soil has inconclusive effects on root-shoot length ratio of Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity is a specific plant’s ability to allocate resources based on different environments.  When observing the allocation plasticity of the Raphanus raphanistrum plants, nitrogen-levels are a major factor to look at due to nitrogen’s importance in the radish plant’s growth.  Nitrogen, taken up by the roots, enhances plants’ metabolic processes.  Under high-nitrogen levels, there is a stimulation of local root growth which leads to an inhibitory effect on the growth of the root system of a plant due to the nitrogen influx.  Therefore, we hypothesize that the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil will be lower than the root:shoot length ratio of the plants grown under normal conditions.  Despite the average root:shoot length ratio of radish plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil being lower than those grown under normal conditions, the two-sample t-test gave a p-value of 0.077 showing that the data wasn’t statistically significant.  This was due to the usage of Miracle-Gro and nitrogen burning.  A future experiment could implement more precise measurements and control of the nitrogen content in the soil.  This experiment can further be applied to farmers understanding how much nitrogen/fertilizer to add to control crop growing patterns

Introduction:
Plants adapt and interact with both the environment and other organisms in ecological environments.  Most plants, in order to survive as long as possible, actively work to maintain necessary resources like nitrogen, water, and sunlight.  However, these resources can be limited during the time in which plants grow and reproduce.  Environments are diverse over space and time, therefore plants must modify their growth and development to adapt to environments to obtain the essential resources [Yang: 2005].  Resource allocation is the overarching term to describe the way in which a species uses their limited resources in order to survive [Yang: 2005].  Plants exhibit phenotypic plasticity, which is the ability to allocate their resources (express different phenotypes) based on different biotic or abiotic environments [Agrawal: 2002].
When it comes to species modifying their allocation plasticity, some species have little plasticity and while others have a lot of plasticity.  The Raphanus raphanistrum (radish) plant is an ideal organism for this experiment because of its high allocation plasticity [Agrawal: 2002].  Radishes are used for many experiments due to their prominent root growth patterns and quick adaptation to different environments.
When looking at plant growth, resource allocation can be examined for both above and below the ground through the roots and shoots of plants.  The growth of an individual root or shoot does not depend only with the nutrient condition experienced by itself, but also the conditions put onto all other parts of the plant [Yang: 2005].  When an individual root finds a nutrient-rich soil area it usually increases its growth rate, but other parts of the root system respond to this by decreasing their growth rates even though the nutrient condition of the other roots has not been altered [Yang:2005].  Zhang’s study examines the relation of root growth in thale cress plants in varying nitrogen levels [Zhang:1999].  The study shows that under high-nitrogen levels there is a stimulation of root growth, but there is an inhibitory effect on the root system as a whole under the high-nitrogen levels [Zhang:1999].  Within nitrogen-rich soil, roots do not have to grow as much due to the plentiful amount of nitrogen near the roots [Zhang:1999].
	This experiment examines the phenotypic plasticity and allocation of radish plants in response to a nitrogen rich soil by looking at the responses of radish plants in high-nitrogen soil.  Nitrogen is a core resource for the internal and external metabolic processes of plants, and the availability of nitrogen, taken in by the roots of plants, enhances these biological processes.  This experiment allows for a better understanding of how varying nitrogen levels can impact root growth which is tied to the overall health of the plant.  Nitrogen’s effect on plant growth is examined in this experiment by observing plants in two different environments.  Based off the knowledge that there is an inhibitory effect causing roots to grow less under high-nitrogen levels, we hypothesize that the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil will be lower than the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown under normal conditions.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, radish seeds were gathered and soaked for 20-30 minutes before planting.  Six plots, 4 inch x 4 inch, were separated into two groups.  Three of the plots were labeled nitrogen-rich plots while the other three were labeled control.  The three plots labeled control were then put into large black trays with holes in the bottom and filled to the top with vermiculite.  The three plots labeled nitrogen-rich plots were filled halfway with vermiculite, given a gram of nitrogen, then filled to the top with vermiculite.  All the plots were watered the given 25mL of Miracle-Gro (less than the 50mL suggested because of the nitrogen in Miracle-Gro).  Nine holes, 2-3 times the size of the seeds, were then made throughout each plot, and the holes were filled with seeds and covered with vermiculite.  The plants were then watered daily for two weeks.
	After two weeks, the radish plants were pulled out of the tray and their roots were separated and patted dry with a paper towel.  Five plants were chosen from each of the three control group trays.  The roots were then separated from the shoots by cutting each plant apart at the root-shoot junction.  The maximum shoot length and root length were measured to the nearest mm, and the mean value of length of both the maximum root and shoot was recorded for each of the three groups of five plants.  The root:shoot length ratios for the three groups were then calculated.  This process was then repeated for the nitrogen-rich plots.  After growing under different conditions, the root:shoot ratios of the nitrogen-rich and control plots were compared using a one-tailed two-sample t-test with the critical value of 0.05 significance level.


Results:
General trends are seen in Figure 1 that the average root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil is lower than the radish plants grown under normal conditions.  The average root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil is 0.820.035 compared to the higher average root:shoot length ratio of radish plants grown under normal conditions 1.240.417.  This difference was not proven to be statistically significant after conducting a two-sample t-test.  (t-value=1.75, df=4, and p-value=0.077).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported in that the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil will be lower than the root:shoot length ratio of the radish plants grown under normal conditions.  An explanation that could have impacted our results is the use of Miracle-Gro, in both the nitrogen-rich and control groups, which contains nitrogen provided by urea.  Miracle-Gro acted as a confounding variable in the experiment as the additional nitrogen added to both plots was not accounted for.  This impacted the direct comparison between the nitrogen-rich plots and the control plots by causing the levels of nitrogen between the two to be more similar than intended.  Studies have shown how Miracle-Gro quickly allows nitrogen to become available to plants’ roots to promote rapid growth [Pradhan: 2010].  Miracle-Gro, with a NPK ratio of 24-8-16, has been seen through studies to provide plentiful for plant root growth [Pradhan: 2010].  Another explanation for the results could have been the nitrogen-rich plots experiencing nitrogen burn from the Miracle-Gro added into the already nitrogen-rich plots.  Nitrogen burn could have caused little growth to the entire nitrogen-rich plants entirely, lowering the shoot length of the plants.  The goal of the experiment was for similar shoot lengths, in order to focus on the different root lengths for the nitrogen-rich and control plots, but the nitrogen burn did not allow this to happen.  High nitrogen levels have known to be detrimental to growth in how excess nitrogen takes water away from the plants and increases salt concentration [Kang: 2018].  Plants obtain water through an osmotic pressure gradient, and when nitrogen builds up around the roots, the pressure close to the roots becomes too high and the water reverses out of the plant [Kang: 2018].  This causes plants to become dehydrated and growth can stop if nitrogen stays at high levels [Kang: 2018].
The next logical step following this experiment would be to account for the nitrogen involved in Miracle-Gro in relation to the additional nitrogen added to the plants in future experiments.  This would be done by modifying the procedure to pay close attention to the exact nitrogen content of the soil in the different plots.  Paying attention to nitrogen content would help avoid nitrogen burn and create better established comparisons between non-nitrogen-rich plots and nitrogen-rich plots.  Also, future experiments working with varying levels of nitrogen could be implemented to compare a range of nitrogen’s impact on root:shoot length ratios of plants.  Varying levels of nitrogen added to soil could be used to test nitrogen burn and observe its role in plant growth.
	Understanding the impact of nitrogen on root:shoot length ratios of radish plants is important for farmers who grow radish plants.  It is essential for farmers to understand growing patterns, and with knowledge of how much nitrogen/fertilizer to add to radish plants, farmers are able to control their plants exactly how they want them.  This understanding helps grow radish crops to avoid problems where roots are overlapping each other and production is lost.  Understanding plant growth is important for maximum efficiency which allows for the best production of crops and food for as many people as possible.
