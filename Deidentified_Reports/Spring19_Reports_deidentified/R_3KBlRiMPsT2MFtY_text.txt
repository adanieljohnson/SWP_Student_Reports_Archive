Title: Effect of Turbulent Water on Agonistic Behavior in Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Betta splendens will exhibit natural docile behavior around any other species of fish, but when confronted with another member of their species, betta splendens will display several signs of aggression including facing and broadside maneuvers, and flared operculums. This experiment studies the effect of water turbulence on intraspecific competition among betta splendens. Betta splendens in the wild avoid turbulent water as much as is possible because they see it as unsuitable for defensive procedures (against other bettas). The data showed that among groups of two betta fish exposed to turbulent and still water, the difference in the percentage of total time in contact with another fish spent displaying agonistic behavior was insignificant, leading to the rejection of our hypothesis and the acceptance of the null hypothesis that water turbulence does not effect agonistic behavior among betta splendens.

Introduction:
Betta splendens (betta fish) display high levels of aggression and are prone to attacking other bettas when housed together (especially evident in males). These aggressive males will exhibit a tell-tale flared operculum when stressed, frightened or otherwise agitated by the presence of another fish. We tested two groups of two bettas each, recording what percentage of their total time together was spent displaying agonistic behavior when the water was still, and when the water was turbulent. Bettas in the wild usually avoid turbulent water as they perceive it to be unsuitable for defense, so this type of water is unfamiliar to them [Bronstein: 2013]. The hypothesis is that betta fish will spend a greater percentage of time displaying agonistic behavior when the water is turbulent versus when the water is still.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment we used stopwatches, fish tanks with removable dividers, fish nets, 4 betta splendens organisms, an electric toothbrush, paper towels and a computer with excel. We began by putting two bettas together (group 1) and observed their interaction in still water for five minutes. We recorded the duration the fish each spent displaying aggressive behavior (flared operculum) and divided it by their total time spent together. We repeated this for group two. After letting the fish rest for five minutes, we repeated the same experimental design for groups one and two, with the toothbrush in the water, turned on, creating turbulence. We inputted our raw data into excel and used a statistical paired 2 sample t-Test to test for significant difference. 

Results:
The percentage of time spent displaying agonistic behavior in still water was 0.629 +/- 0.193 and in turbulent water it was 0.741 +/- 0.242. (t Stat=-2.317, df=3, P=0.104) More agonistic behavior was displayed in turbulent water, but the difference was not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
While there was more agonistic behavior observed from bettas in turbulent water, the difference was not statistically significant leading to the rejection of our hypothesis and instead accepting the null hypothesis that the turbulence of water has no effect on agonistic behavior in betta fish (Figure 1). We had initially hypothesized that under environmental stress, bettas may experience heightened responses to factors including other fish. Since this was not the case, we can assume that betta fish are not effected by changes in their environment when confronting opponents [Kasumyan: 2003]. A possible limitation was that we only tested two groups, a sample size which may have been too small for the results to be representative of the species.
