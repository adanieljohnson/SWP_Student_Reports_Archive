Title: Nitrate Concentration has No Effect on Resource Allocation in Pisum sativun

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to determine if there is a significent difference in resource allocation in field peas (Pisum sativun) when in an environment of high nitrogen concentration versus low nitrogen concentration. It has been previously believed that in low nutrient conditions, a plant will allocate more resources to its roots in an effort to compensate for the lack of resources and in high resource areas, more energy will be allocated to the shoots to increase growth rate. Based on this information, it is hypothesized that plants in a low nutrient environment will have a high root to shoot ratio and plants in a high nutrient environment will have a low root to shoot ratio. This hypothesis was tested by growing plants for two weeks under both high and low nutrient conditions by controllling the amount of nitrogen in planters and then comparing the masses of the roots to the shoots. The results found that there is no significent difference between the average root to shoot ratios of the two different conditions. 


Introduction:
In any environment, an organism has to make decisions regarding what it does with the resources that it collects. This is important because an efficient use of limited resources may be the essential factor in determining which organisms pass on their genes and which fail to pass them on. The study of the use of such resources is relevant to us since we live in the natural world and therefore have a limited supply of resources, so it may be beneficial to mimic how nature has evolved to allocate resources over the last 4 billion years since that is surely the most efficient way. 
	Thus far it is known that how plants allocate their resources depends on their specific needs throughout their lifecycle, but there is no general rule for resource allocation [Bennet: 2012]. Plants that focus on growth rate and have ample resources, such as vines or weeds, will allocate more resources to their stems and leaves (the shoots portion). Plants that focus more on long-term growth or have fewer resources will allocate more resources to their roots in an effort to supplement their growth via nutrients pulled from the ground. In less nutrient dense areas this becomes mandatory because the only way for a plant to fully sustain itself is from securing resources from the ground so more energy must be allocated to the roots in order to make up for the lack of resources [Agren: 2003]. 
	Given these facts about the tendencies of resource allocation, we want to ask the question: how will the root to shoot ratio, the ratio of resources allocated to the roots compared to the resources allocated to the stem and leaves, compare in two different environments: one with plentiful resources and one with limited resources. Based on the the known information, we hypothesize that plants living in a high nutrient environment will exhibit a lower root to shoot ratio than plants living in a low nutrient environment. 


Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis, we first planted field peas under the two different conditions. We obtained four planters and filled them about two thirds with soil and then added field pea seeds. To the controll group we simply watered them and then filled in the final third with soil and added some more water. To the experimental group, the seeds were added the same way but additionally, 2.5g of nitrate was added before the final third of soil was placed on top. These planters were then left in a greenhouse and watered daily for a period of two weeks. 
After the two week growth period, the plants were harvested and prepared for measurement first by removing the soil from the planter, in an organized way, and placing it in roughly half an inch to an inch of water to let it loosen and to remove the soil so it was only roots. Afterwards, three plants were separated from each mass of planter root and placed onto paper towels that were labeled with the appropriate treatment, planter number and plant number. The plants were then separated into roots and shoots by cutting them just below seed and each section was massed and recorded to give a ratio of root mass to shoot mass. After all masses were recorded, the plants were discarded and a one tail, two sample t_test was done on the average ratio of root to shoot mass for controll plants and root to shoot mass for plants with nitrogen. 


Results:
The experiment found that there is no significent difference between the root to shoot ratio of field peas when planted with nitrogen versus when planted without. The average root:shoot ratio for the controll group that received no nitrate was 0.586 +/- 0.158 and the average root:shoot ratio for the experimental group that recieved 2.5g of nitrate was 0.495 +/- 0.073 (t_stat = 1.18, d.f. = 10, P = 0.132). The general trend, as can be seen in Figure 1. was that both groups had similar root to shoot ratios with the controll group having a slightly higher average as was expected, but not enough to be significent as both groups had overlapping standard errors. 


Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis. It is possible that the known information is wrong, but more likely it was that the difference in resources was not enough for there to be a significent difference in root to shoot ratio or that the sample sizes were too small so the standard deviation could relatively large. These findings seem to contradict the facts stated in the Introduction to the paper, yet it is unlikely that those facts are wrong, rather it seems that we did not develop an effective way to test them. This result seems to directly contradict with at least one other paper that claims there is a clear difference in the way plants allocate resources when faced with differing conditions [Ngâ€™Oma: 2017], which is the opposite of what this study found: that there is no significent difference in the way plants handle resources in differing conditions. 
	The best way to further test this hypothesis would be to try it again with a larger sample size, perhaps 7-10 plants per planter. This would give us a much clearer view on the differences in the resource allocation of the two conditions because a sample size of only 3 plants per planter is quite small and so random error could have a much greater effect. Additionally one may want to expand the study to include more species of plants because perhaps the differences in resources of field pea plants are too few for a significent result to occur.
