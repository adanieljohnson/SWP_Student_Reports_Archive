Title: Manduca sexta and the effects of azadirachtin blocking hormone inhibiting growth and maturity.

Abstract:
In this study, Manduca sexta is a caterpillar that undergoes a holometabolous life cycle eventually turning into a moth. Ecdysterone is a growth hormone that regulates the developmental stages in its life cycle, so scientists have questioned how to block the hormone in order to regulate the reproduction of the pests which harm environmental and economical aspects. Azadirachtin, the blocking hormone of ecdysterone, and water were used on the experimental and control groups where their masses were recorded everyday in order to see the physical impacts on the caterpillars growth. The results were significant, according to the p-value of 0.00424, in which the control group had the greatest average change in mass in a 10 day period in comparison the experimental group. All caterpillars in the control group had pupated while none in the experimental group had finished their larva stages. The study showed that azadirachtin had a significant impact on the growth of the caterpillar and the stages it experiences in its life cycle. Azadirachtin is a great hormone to use as a pesticide since the blocking hormone inhibits the growth of the caterpillar and stops reproduction. 


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is a pest know to feed off the leaves of various plants, harming the production of crops for farmers. The caterpillar follows a holometabolous life cycle meaning that it has four major life stages: the egg, larvae, pupa, and adult all within a short and observable period of time. When the insect is at it’s larvae stage, the hormones ecdysterone and juvenile hormone impact its developmental stages leading up to the commitment pulse, indicating the larvae is ready to pupate. So scientists question what happens to the growth of these larvae when one of these hormones are blocked, such as ecdysterone, which regulates the timing of molting during insect development. The hormone azadirachtin blocks ecdysterone, and according to previous research  “at low doses, pupation occurred in most of the cases, but the resulting pupae were defective for the most part.” [Schlüter, 1985] This is important to know because if there is a solution to figure out how to control the growth or rate of the caterpillar’s development, it can help farmers in regulating the health of their crops. If the Manduca sexta does not receive ecdysterone (20E), then the insect will keep growing as larvae because they will not contain the hormone to regulate when they are matured to molt.

Materials and Methods:
In this procedure there were a total of of eight caterpillars, four caterpillars in the control group and four caterpillars in the experimental group. The four caterpillars in the control group were treated with 10 grams of food with five drops (2.5 mL) of water each from a pipette. The four caterpillars in the experimental group were treated with 10 grams of food with five drops (2.5 mL) of azadirachtin solution each from a pipette. The azadirachtin blocked the hormone 20E which enables viewers to see the growth rate of the experimental group in comparison to the control group. The caterpillars were checked on each evening to measure their mass, clean their living spaces, and to give more food with either water for the control group or the azadirachtin solution for the experimental group. The caterpillars were maintained in an incubator where they had 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark which was in a 25 degree celsius temperature. Because the two groups were split into a categorical and measurement variables, the statistical test used was a one tailed two-sample t-test.


Results:
By the end of the trial, all caterpillars in the control group were alive and all caterpillars in the experimental group, except caterpillar labeled three, were alive. The mean change in mass of the control caterpillars was 5.07 g +/- 1.41 g and the mean change in mass of the experimental caterpillars was 1.38 g +/- 1.30 g (Figure 1). The control group was the categorical variable and the experimental group was the measurement variable, because of this the statistical test was the one tailed t-sample t-test. From the results, there were 6 Degrees of Freedom, a T-Value of 3.85, and 0.00424 One-Tailed P-Value. On day 10, all of the caterpillars in the control group had pupated but the caterpillars in the experimental group remained in the larvae stages. In both the control and experimental groups, the caterpillars declined in their masses after 10 days. The final masses of the control groups varied in large compared to each other while the masses of the experimental groups remained very similar besides the mass of experimental caterpillar labeled three. 

Discussion:
Based on the results found, the hypothesis was not supported because the control group that contained the hormone ecdysterone grew to larger masses in comparison to the experimental group. The p-value shows how the data was significant, which means that if this procedure were repeated, the difference in the control and experimental group would most likely be replicated. Since the hypothesis was not supported, it can be interpreted that when ecdysterone is blocked by azadirachtin, it prevented normal development into the pupal stage because it  “reduced brain levels of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)-like activity, which is the stimulation of in vitro moulting hormone synthesis by the prothoracic glands.” [Barnby, 1990] Because ecdysterone is blocked, its concentration levels can never rise after the 4th larva stage, so the caterpillars remained at this stage. When ecdysterone doesn’t reach its concentration peak, it cannot reach its second peak to trigger the commitment pulse indicating it is ready for pupation. When the caterpillar is ready for pupation, there is a significant release of 20E from the prothoracicotropic hormone, but this is blocked by azadirachtin which caused the experimental group to remain their size. The data does not support the hypothesis but it does show that azadirachtin blocking hormone is a pesticide. This is important because it proves how crops may be regulated if they contaminate their fields with this growth blocking hormone. According to previous research, “good results in insect control are obtained with azadirachtin containing seed extracts under field conditions.” [Schmutterer, 1988] This is important because then the caterpillars will not reproduce and spread throughout crops if they are properly taken care of. Because the data is so significant, a new hypothesis to test for future procedures could be to test the concentrations of azadirachtin on varying groups of caterpillars and test to see their changes in mass.

The caterpillars consuming water had a significant increase in growth compared to those consuming azadirachtin. The standard deviation remained almost equivalent for both sets of data.*************************************************************************
