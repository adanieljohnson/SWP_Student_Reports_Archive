Title: The Effect of Ecdysterone Inhibition On the Growth of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar 

Abstract:
Our experiment on the Manduca Sexta caterpillar focused on the effect of hormones on development. The inhibition of certain hormones, specifically Ecdysterone, or 20E have a detrimental effect on the growth and development of the caterpillars. We experimented with two groups of four caterpillars, each received the same amount of food. The experimental group received food with 20E blocker while the control received food with water. We monitored their growth over 14 days. We found that the control group was statistically larger both in weight and in length than the experimental. This significance suggest the the inhibition of 20E negatively impacted the growth and development of the experimental group. 

Introduction:
Hormones are responsible for many daily activities of both plants and animals. They do everything from regulating blood glucose levels and body temperature, to control the “fight or flight” responses. Many insects produce hormones, including the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta, or more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm, is a common pest species present within the Americas. The Manduca Sexta caterpillars produce hormones throughout their larval stages. Here we focus on the hormone Ecdysterone, or 20E. The 20E hormone is responsible for the timing and shedding of the former cuticle (Copenhaver: 1982). This allows for the larva to grow and develop during each of its five stages of larval development. This was noted in Philip Copenhaver and James Truman’s study on the role of hormones in the development of the Manduca Sexta larval stage. The caterpillars are a noted model organism because of the extensive research done on their specific hormonal changes throughout their larval development. The Manduca Sexta has four distinct stages of development embryo, larval, pupal, and adult. For this lab, we will be focusing on the larval stage of the insect. This experiment treats one group of four caterpillars with a hormone blocker that inhibits the effects of the 20E hormone. We will monitor their weight, length, and appearance and compare the results to a control group that is treated with distilled water. A decrease in the production of the 20E hormone will result in the prohibition of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar from increasing in growth and length and will prevent them from developing into adulthood. 


Materials and Methods:
Our experiment was comprised of one control group of four Manduca Sexta caterpillars that were given 10g of food, per caterpillar,  that had been mixed with five drops of distilled water. Our experimental group is comprised of four Manduca Sexta caterpillars that were given 10g of food, per caterpillar, that had been mixed with five drops of an 20E hormone inhibitor, aza- guard. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator and fed a regular diet of specific caterpillar food. The weight (g) and the length (cm) were recorded everyday for a period of 14 days. We will use a two-sample t-test to compare the averages for both the mass and the length of both the experimental and control groups. 

Results:
The mean weight increase per day of the control caterpillars was 0.824 g while the experimental was 0.180 g (Figure 1). The mean length of the control was 0.232 cm and the experimental was 0.021cm (Figure 2).  We used a two-sample t-test to analyse the data. The mean weight was significantly different between the control and the experimental groups (t-stat = 2.74, df = 6, P = 0.017). The length of the caterpillars was significantly different between the control and the experimental groups (t-stat = 3.123, df = 6, P = 0.021). When observing the caterpillars on day 14 there was a noticable difference between the groups. The experimental group was pale in color and visibly smaller than the caterpillars in the control group. From visuals alone, there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that a decrease in the production of the 20E hormone will result in the prohibition of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar from increasing in growth and length and will prevent them from developing into adulthood, was supported. Overall, the 20E inhibitor had a detrimental effect on the growth of the experimental caterpillars. We observed the caterpillars over the course of 14 days and began to notice a difference after the first four days. It is possible that the differences between the caterpillars was skewed as two of the control caterpillars died, from an illness, before the end of the trial. Although that is a possibility, it is unlikely as a difference was visible when all eight caterpillars were alive. The experimental consumed less food and were less active than the control group. Previous experiments conclude that the inhibition of 20E prevent the proper development of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar (Copenhaver: 1982). This suggest that the experimental caterpillars were prevented from developing properly which resulted in their small weight and length.The 20E hormone is responsible for the timing of molting cycles. A disruption in these cycles prevents the caterpillar from proper development, which ultimately results in slow, if any growth.  A further area of study would be to increase the amount of 20E in the caterpillars and see if they would develop normally or more quickly.
