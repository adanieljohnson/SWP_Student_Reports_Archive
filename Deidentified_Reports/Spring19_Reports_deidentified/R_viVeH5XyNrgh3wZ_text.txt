Title: The Manduca sexta Remains in a Larval Stage of their Life Cycle when Introduced to an Ecdysterone Inhibitor

Abstract:
Hormones are responsible for the maturation and development of all animals. One animal that hormones’ importance can be seen in is the Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta are insects that have a metamorphosis cycle leading to their transformation into a moth. In order for this to occur, they must experience a drop in juvenile hormone and ecdysterone, followed by a small peak in ecdysterone known as the commitment pulse. This commitment pulse initiates their transition into pupation. In order to observe how significant this pulse is in the life cycle of the larvae, researchers introduced our treatment group to a substance that acts as an ecdysterone blocker to compare them to a control group that received normal food. Researchers expected that the treatment group would remain in the larval stage and fail to pupate if introduced to the ecdysterone blocker. Over the course of about ten days, researchers observed the two groups’ behaviors and physical appearances. The data showed no significant differences, although their physical states suggest that the blocker affected their growth rate and drive towards pupation exceptionally. 

Introduction:
Hormones are vitally significant in the growth and development of all animals. In humans, hormones are responsible for the maturation from childhood, to adolescence, to adulthood. Similarly, they contribute to the growth and development of many animals from a beginning stage, to intermediate stage(s), to the adult stage of life. One animal that exhibits how significant hormones are in the life cycle of organisms is the Manduca sexta.  The Manduca sexta is an animal that undergoes metamorphosis and transforms from a caterpillar larva into a moth. Hormones are endocrine-secreted chemicals that serve important roles in the development and growth of insects and mammals. Two of the hormones that allow the Manduca sexta to metamorphose into moths are ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Molting is a characteristic of insects’ reaching adulthood. The onset of this metamorphic molt must be precisely controlled because it terminates the growth phase of the larva and determines the size of the adult insect’s body [Nijhout: 2015]. Before molting occurs, the Manduca sexta goes through five instar larva stages. During fifth stage, there is a significant drop in juvenile hormone and ecdysterone levels, followed by a small peak in ecdysterone known as the commitment pulse. Under normal conditions, juvenile hormone levels remain low while ecdysterone simultaneously rises. This process initiates pupation and the Manduca sexta’s transition into adulthood [Lab Manual: 2018]. In a similar experiment, Manduca sexta were injected with juvenile hormone which resulted in their final instar stage being prolonged [Nijhout: 2015]. The purpose in carrying out this recorded experiment was to observe the effects on the insect’s pupation pattern if introduced to a substance that acts as an ecdysterone blocker. Adding ecdysterone blocker to the subjects’ food will hinder the commitment pulse from occurring and cause the Manduca sexta to remain in a larval stage.

Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out this experiment, researchers obtained eight Manduca sexta larvae using four as a control group and four as our experimental group. Each of the larvae were divided into two containers based upon which group they belonged to and divided into individual cells within their containers. Each larva in the control group received approximately 10 grams of untreated food each day, while those in the experimental group each received 10 grams of food treated with the ecdysterone blocker. In order to evenly distribute the blocker, 40 grams of food was measured and added approximately 40 milliliters of the blocker, then mixed it evenly and distributed ten grams to each larva. Each following day, the larvae’s behaviors were observed, and their masses recorded in order to compare the differences between the control and treatment groups over the course of twelve days. A two-sample t-test was then used to determine the differences in the maximum weights between the larvae that received an ecdysterone blocker in their diet and those that did not. This statistical test encompasses data from the first ten days, as one of the subjects in the treatment group died on the eleventh day. 

Results:
The maximum mass of the larvae in the treatment group was 4.32 +/- 1.97 grams and the maximum mass for the control group was 10.36 +/- 0.55 grams (Figure 1). The t-value was 5.89, the one-tailed p-value was 0.0005, and the degrees of freedom were 6. The maximum masses recorded between the two groups were statistically significantly different. Throughout the experiment, the control group was much more active than the treatment group as they consumed more food, continued to increase in size, and produced more waste. All of the larvae reached their maximum weights within the range of 2 to 6 days; however, the treatment groups’ weights were significantly less than the control groups’. Additionally, the control group eventually pupated, while the treatment group remained in the larval stage throughout the experiment. Within 11 days, one of the larvae in the treatment group had died. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported in that the treatment group was hindered from pupating because of the ecdysterone blocker. The blocker was introduced through the Manduca sexta’s diet and compared the effects to a control group that received untreated food. Those in the treatment group became progressively less active each day, leading to one of their deaths. It is unclear whether its being unable to pupate caused its death, or if they stopped eating the food and starved as it was noticed that they were not eating much nor producing much waste each day in comparison to the control group. Cells in the Manduca sexta change their commitment individually in response to ecdysone. That is, the larvae will only produce pupal cuticle when ecdysterone induces a molt [Riddiford: 1978]. This makes sense that the treatment group did not pupate because they were not able to experience a commitment pulse because the ecdysterone inhibitor did not allow them to experience a commitment pulse. This lack of ecdysterone resulted in their permanent larval stage and inability to mature. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups, and their behavior and failure to pupate and other studies’ results in response to the ecdysterone inhibitor evidence this. A more advanced study that would have interesting results would be to introduce both juvenile hormone and ecdysterone blockers to the treatment group to observe their effects on the larvae.

The average maximum weight for the control group was 10.36 +/- 0.55 grams, while the treatment group’s average maximum mass was 4.32 +/- 1.97 grams. These results exhibit a t-value of 5.89, a degree of freedom of 6, and a one-tailed p-value of 0.0005.*************************************************************************
