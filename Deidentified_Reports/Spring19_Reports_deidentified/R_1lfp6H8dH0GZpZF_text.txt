Title: Affect of Temperature and Light intensity on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleracea  

Abstract:
 Since Spinacia oleracea is vastly distributed worldwide​, it is important to do a study to determine the best growing conditions for Spinacia oleracea to be applied in an agricultural setting. Spinacia oleracea has optimal survival conditions of 30℃ and decent light exposure. However, this experiment was done to test what combination of temperature and light conditions affect the photosynthetic activity of Spinacia oleracea samples. It was predicted that the dark lower temperature experimental group will have the lowest average change in photosynthetic activity. The average change in photosynthetic activity of the light high-temperature experimental group was the highest, the light and dark low-temperature condition groups had a similar change in photosynthetic activity. The light high-temperature experimental group potentially had the highest average change in photosynthetic activity because the conditions were most similar to the optimal growing conditions for Spinacia oleracea. An idea for further study would be to identify appropriate soil conditions for Spinacia oleracea to help further optimize its growth. 

Introduction:
While most plants rely on the presence of light in order to participate in photosynthesis, temperature while not as important is also a factor of effective photosynthesis. Extreme temperatures and/or light intensity can have an effect on photosynthesis especially if the plant is not well equipped to adapt to these extreme conditions. For example, an experiment done on Potamotagen pectinatus L. revealed the light and temperature dependence of its photosynthetic rates [Adams: 1989]. The spinach leaf, Spinacia oleracea, is native to central and western Asia and in 2016 the world production of spinach was 26.7 tonnes. Spinacia oleracea is mainly grown in China where the environmental conditions allow for optimal growth. Spinacia oleracea, like many other plants, utilizes Photosystems in its chloroplasts in order to metabolize light into usable energy. For example, Photosystem II is the initial protein complex that relies on the presence of light for activation in order to start the cascade that produces ATP in the stroma of the chloroplasts. In this experiment, we explored what factors, such as environmental conditions and chemicals, would affect the efficiency of photosystem II in Spinacia oleracea. While considering that Spinacia oleracea’s optimal temperature has been reported to be around 30℃ [Hikosaka: 1997]and that Photosystem II relies on the presence of light for activation, Spinacia oleracea were placed under conditions that altered the ​light intensity and temperature as a simulated environmental factor. Essentially, under what conditions do Spinacia oleracea leaves start to see a decline or increase in their photosynthetic level? This study of the proper conditions of Spinacia oleracea is important because the optimal growth conditions need to be observed so that the crop can continue to be grown efficiently. Taking into account that Spinacia oleracea grows optimally in light and 30℃ conditions, we predict that the experimental groups placed in the dark and lower temperatures conditions will have the lowest levels of chloroplasts as the plant will not be able to efficiently utilize Photosystem II in the chloroplasts.

Materials and Method:
Preparation of ~5 spinach leaves with 400mM Sucrose grinding buffer was taken from the Centrifugation procedure from the Lab Manual written by AD Johnson [Johnson: 2016]. After preparation, initially measure the absorbances of the samples for the Time Zero data then 5 tubes were placed into each light and temperature condition. The absorbances were measured every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. Multiple T-tests were run in order to validate the data. The room temperature and ice bucket, water bath and room temperature, and water basket and ice bucket groups were compared from both light and dark conditions. T-tests revealed that from the comparison for light and dark groups under the room temperature and ice bucket conditions, water bath and room temperature conditions, and water bath and ice bucket conditions. Outliers had to be removed in order to validate the data.

Discussion:
Considering that the groups under light conditions in room and high temperatures had the highest average change in absorbance, this means that Photosystem II was most active under these conditions. Although the light high temperature group was found to be insignificent compared to the light room temperature, the light room temperature was still found to be significent compared to the ice bucket conditions.  Nevertheless, the high average change in absorbance of the light room temperature group could potentially be due the room temperature, 23℃, being closer to the optimal thermal conditions for Spinacia oleracea, 30℃ [Hikosaka: 1997]. As the temperature is closer to its optimal temperature, Photosystem II must have been more active in more chloroplasts for the average change in absorbance to be so large. As a result, Photosystem II must have been least active in the groups that were in low temperatures as they had the lowest average change in absorbance due to the conditions being so far from optimal thermal conditions; As hypothesized, it must have been too cold for the chloroplasts to have active Photosystem II complexes. While our hypothesis was supported by the data that suggested that cold conditions yielded lower levels of chloroplasts, further studies must be done to support the hypothesis that dark conditions yield lower levels of chloroplasts. This is similar to the experiment done on Potamogeten pectinatus L  where they concluded that the photosynthetic rate of the plant was dependent on light and temperature conditions [Adams: 1989] It is possible that the outliers and insignificance in our data could have been caused by the dark condition groups not being fully immersed in dark as we had to move them into the light to measure the absorbances. A further study must be done in order to isolate the dark group so that they are only exposed to dark conditions. This study was important because it proved that Spinacia oleracea prospers at temperatures around 23-35℃ and in lighted conditions. This can be applied to the growth of Spinach in an agricultural setting since Spinach is produced in such large quantities; This study now allows for optimal growth of the Spinacia oleracea plant.

Figure 1: Effect of light intensity and temperature on the photosynthesis activity in Spinacia oleracea. Light conditions (blue bars) were only significent in low temperatures and room temperatures. Dark conditions (orange bars) were only significent in low temperatures and room temperatures as well. Five samples were used in each group, they were exposed to their respective conditions for thirty minutes total. Change in photosynthetic activity was measured by an increase in absorbance.*************************************************************************
