Title: The Effect of pH on the Photosynthetic Rate of Spinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis occurs when plants harness sunlight in order to synthesize energy from Carbon dioxide and water. The rate at which plants are able to perform photosynthesis can be affected by external factors. In this experiment, we tested the effect pH levels have on the chloroplast present in photosynthesis. The rate of absorption change over ten minutes in the chloroplast of Spinacia Oleracea under varying pH levels were​ tested. ATP production was measured through the rate of electron acceptance in DCPIP. It was hypothesized that lower pH would inhibit photosynthetic activity due to an increased acidity as pH levels decrease. It was found that the pH levels tested did not have an effect on the rate of photosynthesis. Examining the effects of pH on photosynthetic rate is integral when considering the rising issue of acid rain and snow both in North America and Europe.

Introduction:
Energy plays an integral role in processes carried out by cells. Due to the fact that plants are capable of synthesizing their own food from inorganic substances, making them autotrophs, plant cells must utilize exterior sources such as light in the production of their own energy. Photosynthesis is the process by which cells produce their own source of energy, glucose. The process of photosynthesis starts with light-dependent​ reactions occurring in the chloroplasts’ thylakoid membranes. Here, an electron transport chain works to reduce oxidized compounds through electron acceptors as ATP is produced. The light-dependent reactions create a proton gradient in order to drive ATP production. It is possible to measure ATP production through the rate of electron acceptance in compounds such as DCPIP- a compound that is colorless when reduced, and dark blue when oxidized. This fact enables one to understand that when there is a decrease in absorbance, there exists a negative correlation to an increase in electron acceptance, increasing photosynthetic reactions [Johnson: 2016].   As the rate of photosynthesis increases, so does the rate of glucose output, allotting the cell an increased level of energy to power other processes integral to cellular function. Scientists have long considered variables that may affect photosynthetic rates, either increasing or decreasing them. Potential effects such as pH levels, for example, have been tested. A previous study was conducted, examining the effects of pH changes on photosynthesis in three Mediterranean seagrass species. It was found that the reduction in photosynthesis caused by the rising pH levels was relatively small [Invers: 1997]. For this lab, pH was chosen due to its importance in an organism’s ability to thrive over a range of pH levels. In the United States, acid rain and snow is falling at an annual acidity value averaging about pH 4 [Likens: 1974]. This rain is believed to be responsible for the increased acidity levels found in soil [Krug: 1983]. In considering photosynthetic reactions, it is important to gain an understanding of the effects pH level have on the presence of chloroplasts in photosynthesis. The pH levels tested were 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The rate of photosynthesis (absorbance) at different pH levels were compared at an initial time 0 and again after 10 minutes. It is hypothesized that out of the pH levels, lower pH will inhibit photosynthetic activity the most due to an increased acidity as pH levels decrease. Additionally, it is hypothesized that high pH levels with have less of an effect on photosynthesis. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to test the effect of pH levels on chloroplasts, a mortar, and pestle, beaker, 3 50 mL centrifuge tubes, grinding buffer, 130 mM DCPIP, and reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) was​ cooled in an ice bucket. Four spinach leaves were deveined, then rinsed and blotted dry before being added to the cold mortar and pestle. There was 10 mL of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8 poured into the mortar and the leaves were ground into a thick paste. After this, 10 more mL of grinding buffer was added to the mortar and the mixture was strained through cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. The mixture was poured into a centrifuge tube and spun at 200 x G, 4C for 3 minutes. The supernatant was then poured into the second centrifuge tube and spun for 10 minutes at 1000 x G, 4C. The supernatant was poured out and the 20 mL grinding buffer was poured into the pellet and gently mixed. 4mL of the suspended mixture was distributed into each of 5 new centrifuge tubes, and 6 mL of pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 were added to a centrifuge tube respectively and labeled. The chloroplasts were treated with the pH solution for 15 minutes. The five tubes were then spun for 10 minutes at 1000 x G 4C. The supernatant was then drained and 2 mL of grinding buffer was added to each centrifuge tube. 200 microliters of each centrifuge tube were micropipette 3 times into test tubes, yielding 15 test tubes for 3 replicas of each pH buffer. One additional test tube served as a blank. The solutions of each test tube were created according to the following: (Figure 1). A portion of each sample was poured into a cuvette and their absorbance was measured and recorded. After 10 minutes, the readings were recorded again. 

Results:
Figure 2 demonstrates the trends of the average absorbance at each pH at each time increment (time 0 and after 10 minutes). Percent change demonstrates the photosynthetic activity that occurred in each sample. A large percent change indicates the specific pH level had the largest inhibitory effect on photosynthetic reactions. The opposite is true for a low percent change. The pH 5 showed the largest percent change between time 0 and 10, and the pH 10 showed the lowest percent change. The data showed an inverse relationship between pH level and photosynthetic inhibition: as pH level increased, photosynthetic inhibition decreased. There were two outliers to this data set: the absorbance change at pH 7, and pH 9. The statistical test utilized to analyze the data was one way ANVOA t-test. The ANOVA test indicated that the p-value was 0.396. 

Discussion:
The objective of this lab was to determine whether certain pH levels inhibited photosynthetic activity. Although lower pH levels had a greater inhibitory effect on photosynthetic activity over the 10-minute time interval, as demonstrated in figure 1, the absorbance at pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 had no significant difference. The p-value was a value greater than 0.05, indicating that the hypothesis predicting a greater inhibition in lower pH levels was rejected. Other studies conducted have suggested that pH levels do in fact affect the rate of photosynthesis, so it is possible if the experiment itself could be restructured to limit potential external affectors. Additionally, it is possible that human error could have affected the results gathered. Despite the statistical insignificance of our experiment, overall as pH levels increased, percent change in absorbance decreased. There were 2 outliers in our percent change in absorbance after 10 minutes. The two outliers in this data set were pH 7, which had a lower percent change in absorbance than pH 8, or pH 9, and pH 9 which had a higher percent change in absorbance than pH 8 did. The optimal pH level for growth of Spinacia Oleracea is between 6-7.5, indicating that at pH 7, change in absorbance should be minimal [Gardener’s Net]. Additionally, pH 7 is a neutral level, which could also explain minimal effect of photosynthetic inhibition. This could explain why the pH 7 appeared as an outlier in the data set. Our results demonstrated that pH 5 had the greatest inhibitory effect of all the levels tested, and that pH 10 had the least inhibitory effect of the levels tested. These findings are consistent with a study that compared the effects of pH changes on photosynthesis in three Mediterranean seagrass species. It was found that as pH levels increased, there were minimal effects on photosynthetic inhibition [Invers: 1997]. Another study was conducted, testing the effects of low pH on photosynthesis. This study found that the survival of Citrus plants was highly insensitive to low pH levels [Long: 2017]. The results of this experiment show similar results to that of Long’s study: that pH had very little effect on photosynthetic activity. It is possible that recording absorbance after longer periods of time lead to an increased effect in photosynthetic activity.  Studies of metabolic effects due to pH are not adequately conducted. Although we know that intracellular pH regulation is caused by changes in ionization of dissociable groups in an enzyme, we do not know exactly to what extent​ pH plays a role in photosynthetic activity [Smith: 1979]. Additionally, since the findings in this experiment contradict with previous studies conducted, as well as align with others, it should be recreated to further comprehend the effect pH has on photosynthesis if it has any at all. Although Spinacia Oleracea has an optimal pH level for growth, the plant can be grown successfully in a variety of pH levels, compared to the capacity of other plants [Sanders: 2001]. It is possible that if a different plant was tested, the results could highlight the effect pH has on plants with a smaller capacity to thrive in certain pH levels. Additionally, restructuring the experiment to test lower pH levels, ones that more adequately reflect environmental crises such as acid rain, could aid in the understanding of the effect of pH on photosynthetic rate. By determining the effect pH has on photosynthesis, plant growth in areas that are more or less acidic could be greatly increased. This is why it is integral to examine the interactions between acid rain and vegetation. Increased levels of acidity could lead to changes in land use and as a result, would call for changes in practices in order to maintain successful vegetation [Krug: 1983].
