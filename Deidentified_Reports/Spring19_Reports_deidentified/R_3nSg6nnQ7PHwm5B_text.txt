Title: The Effect of SEVIN, an Acetylcholine Inhibitor on Muscle Contractions of a Frog Leg

Abstract:
This lab will investigate neuromuscular controll of a frog leg under specific conditions. We will isolate the gastrocnemus muscle in the frog and use a computerized system to submit a pulse that will create a twitch in the leg. As our treatment, we will use SEVIN, an ACh inhibitor, to test how the muscle reacts with and without the presence of ACh. We hypothesize that the leg will not twitch because no action potential will occur without ACh. We found that with the addition of SEVIN, the leg still twitched, but significently less than then controll group. We used a two-tailed T-test to determine if our results were significently significent and they were not. Making us fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

Introduction:
In this lab we will be using frog legs demonstrate neuromuscular function under certain conditions. In order to demonstrate neuromuscular controll, we will isolate the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from the frog leg. We will administer a voltage to the muscle to initiate a muscle twitch. To do this we will use a computerized system called iWorx to administer a known voltage to receive a twitch, the system also records the response of the leg in Voltage. The overall purpose of this lab is to understand the nervous system and its interactions with muscles and nerves. A twitch is one single short muscle contraction [Johnson:2018] 

We asked the question that if we treat the frog leg with SEVIN how will the twitches differ? SEVIN is an Acetylcholine (ACh) inhibitor. ACh is very important in muscle contraction in chemical synapses. ACh innervates muscle fibers which create nerve impulses in muscles [Britannica:2018]. Muscle fibers are bundles together which make up a motor unit, a motor unit is a single motor axon [Sadava: 2016]. Multiple motor units make up nerves and muscles. [Johnson:2018] The axon which is the motor unit is where the ACh travels down and transmits its signals at junctions between motor units [Sadava:2016]. Without ACh, the postsynaptic membrane won’t be activated, and ions won’t flow, and the signal will not pass. This will be measured by the strength of the leg with and without ACh. Measured in voltage. We hypothesize that the leg will not twitch because no action potential will occur without ACh. The purpose of this lab is to determine how ACh plays a role in muscle contraction, and how SEVIN (a pesticide) affects the movement of organisms [Carpentar: 1961].


Materials and Method:
To begin this lab, we needed to prepare the frog leg. To start we removed the skin on the leg to expose the muscle, bones, and nerves. The leg was placed on a board and pinned down to prevent the frog leg from moving. This helped to keep the probe in the leg and prevent the leg from moving out of place when the twitch is administered. We began by administering 1.0V at 1 Hz and recorded the voltage by the twitch. And repeated three times for each leg. Continuously spraying the frog with frog electrolytes so the muscle does not dry out. Once the leg had been tested three times, we injected 20mg of SEVIN directly into the muscle and waited five minutes to let the solution get into the synapses. We massaged the leg in order for the solution to spread throughout the muscle as well. The amount of massaging affected how much the leg twitched. We administered 1.0V an additional three times and recorded the responses. Then repeated the same procedure with two more legs. We used a two-tailed T-test with an alpha value of 0.05 to perform statistical analysis to compare the leg with SEVIN and without SEVIN. We took an average of the three trials controll for each leg and took an average of the value for each leg and did the same with the experimental (with SEVIN). We tested the hypothesis by observing, visually and through that data, if the leg twitched weaker with the addition of SEVIN.  

Results:
The statistical test we used was a Two-tailed T-test comparing the controll and treatment of the averages of legs 1-3. Our P-value is 0.09 which is larger than the alpha value of .05. Our P-value is significent but approaching significance. Table 1 is a representation of the data recorded for the twitch response from each leg. Each leg had three trials each for controll and treatment, the table shows the average value. The twitch response reduced by at least half for the treatment group. Figure 1 shows the controll versus treatment for each leg and compares it to the average. The standard deviation bars on the average graph are very small and show the standard deviation between the values calculated. The response from the controll legs varied slightly, but the treatment responses were very consistent. 

Discussion:
We found no evidence of error in our trials. One outlier in the data is the controll group for leg 1. The average is low compared to the controll group for leg 2-3, but the trail for leg 1 is consistent with the rest of the data. An alternate explanation for this could be that each frog leg has a different output for the same amount of voltage applied, and this frog is particularly deficient in ATP, causing a particularly low voltage twitch [Carpentar: 1961]. Although our results were consistent with our hypothesis, we can conclude that a source of error for any strange data points could be due to a different amount of massaging done per leg. The different massaging time after the insertion of SEVIN, could lead to an uneven distribution of the SEVIN, and therefore a varying twitch output. Also, the SEVIN could have been localized in different positions of the muscle because the insertion was not in the same section of the leg every trial [Johnson:2018]. 

As I mentioned above, SEVIN is intended as a commercial pesticide [Carpentar: 1961]. This was a potential downfall for the study because we did not use an insect. An idea for future study could be to repeat this study on a muscle of an insect and compares the results to see if there is a statistical difference between the two organisms. This would be an interesting study to compare many different types of organisms to see how SEVIN impacts their muscles differently and how we can compare the physiology of their muscle systems and nerve integration [Johnson:2018]. 

Overall, this study displayed the neuromuscular controll of a frog leg and how it can be manipulated by an ACh inhibitor [Johnson:2018].
