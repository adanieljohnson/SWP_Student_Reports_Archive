Title: Agonistic Behavior in Betta splendins: Cold Water Decreases Activity

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to examine the effect of cold water on agnostic behavior in Betta splendins. Cold water has a negative effect on metabolism and this experiment aims to observe the influence of this change on the behavior of Betta fish. This experiment tests if a decrease in the temperature of water will result in shorter time displays of red manes in Betta fish as a result of decrease in metabolic function. Betta fish were placed in two separate aquariums under room temperature and cold water conditions and agnostic behavior was quantitatively measured by timing the display of the fish’s red mane. The study found that the display time was less for fish in cold water compared to room temperature water. The data demonstrated that cold water decreased agnostic behavior of Betta splendins which is supported by the explanation that lower temperatures decrease metabolism which inhibit behavior.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the behavior of Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, by observing their responses to another species member in cold water. Betta fish are model organisms because of their colorful displays in the presence of other species members [Johnson: 2018]. Intraspecific behaviors of bettas include broadside movements, like pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing, and facing movements, like erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and protruding red manes [Johnson: 2018]. These are known as agnostic, or aggressive, behaviors and this experiment specifically evaluates how long the fish display their red manes, which are protrusions of branchiostegal membranes [Johnson: 2018]. This agnostic behavior provides information about the behavior of Betta fish when placed under the stress of cold water. Temperature has been seen to negatively influence the metabolism of organisms, which is the process in which energy and materials are transformed in an organism and exchanged with its environment [Gillooly: 2001]. Temperature has this effect because it decreases the rates of biochemical reactions that take place within an organism that are needed for metabolic processes to occur [Gillooly: 2001]. It was predicted that cold water will decrease the metabolic rate of the Betta fish which will in turn decrease their display of agnostic behavior in order to conserve energy. If male Betta splendins are placed in room temperature water and cold water, then the fish in cold water will display their red manes for shorter periods of time.

Materials and Method:
Two male Betta splendins were placed into an aquarium filled with 17 degrees Celsius water and separated by a solid barrier. The fish were allowed to rest for five minutes. The barrier was removed and the time each fish displayed their red man was recorded over a time span of five minutes. After the five minutes the barrier was replaced. The same process was repeated with two different male fish. Ice was placed in a separate aquarium to obtain a temperature of 14 degrees Celsius. After 10 minutes of adjustment to the water, the same interactions were repeated in the cold water between the same two pairs of fish. A paired t_test was conducted to determine if the results were statistically significent.

Results:
The results showed that the fish in cold water displayed their red mane for shorter periods of time in comparison to fish in room temperature water. Figure 1 shows that the average time of red mane display per five minutes (seconds) was 56 +/- 50 seconds under cold water conditions and 205 +/- 40 seconds under room temperature conditions. The mean of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 5.20, d.f. = 3, p = 0.0138).

Discussion:
The data supported the hypothesis which stated that Betta fish in cold water would display their red manes for shorter periods of time. The display times were less in cold water compared to room temperature water as seen in Figure 1. Previous studies have observed that fish have a specific range of temperatures in which they function best. A study conducted with Carassius auratus, or gold.f.ish, found that their final biomass was lower at the lowest and highest temperatures tested (23°C and 31°C) [Imanpoor: 2011]. The highest final biomass was obtained at 27°C which demonstrates that fish function best at certain temperatures with decreased levels of growth at lower temperatures [Imanpoor: 2011]. This temperature dependence can be explained by the influence of temperature on metabolic processes. It has been observed that as the body temperature of fish decrease, changes in the chemistry of their cells reduce metabolic activity [Johnston: 1987]. The use of nutrients of aquatic animals depends on digestive enzymes and a study evaluated two of these enzymes, amylase and lipase, in Betta splendins [Thongprajukaew: 2010]. It was found that the enzymes function best at different temperatures. For example, the neutral amylase isoform showed optimal temperature characteristics at 40 degrees Celsius [Thongprajukaew: 2010]. This study reinforces the explanation that temperature influences the metabolic processes of fish which can in turn influence behavior. The difference in the display times of agnostic behavior in the fish, measured through the presence of red manes, is therefore likely due to the inhibitory influence of the cold water on the metabolic functions of the fish.
