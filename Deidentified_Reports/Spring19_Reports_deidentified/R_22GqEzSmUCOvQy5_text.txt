Title: The growth and developmental effect of the addition of juvenile hormone to the food of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The holometabolous life cycle of Manduca sexta causes the process of hormonal regulation to be essential in order for the insect to progress throughout its four main life stages. The expectation was that if the juvenile hormone was added, the Manduca sexta would not be able to reach the pupation stage and would remain in their juvenile state for their life duration. Both a control and treatment group of Manduca sexta were used in order to determine the effects of the addition of juvenile hormone, specifically on the weight and visual appearance of the organisms. The statistical data showed no significant difference between the two groups, but the biological changes illustrated the differences in growth and development due to the addition of juvenile hormone. The treatment group was unable to reach pupation like the control group was, and rather they only presented baggy and dark skin. While it was unclear the exact significance of the addition of juvenile hormone on the Manduca sexta, another hormone, ecdysterone, also plays a role in development, and so by understanding the optimal amounts of these two hormones, it could be possible to advance the knowledge of lepidopteran growth, metamorphosis, and development.

Introduction:
Hormonal regulation is an important life sustaining and progression process of insects that allows them to molt from one life stage to the next, which is essential for their survival [Johnson: 2018]. Manduca sexta are an example of an insect with a holometabolous life cycle, meaning that they experience four major stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult [Johnson: 2018]. During the transitions between these stages, major body reorganization occurs, especially when the insect goes through pupal metamorphosis as it changes from what is commonly known as a caterpillar and into a butterfly [Johnson: 2018]. Additionally, during these transition periods, there are fluctuations of two hormones, ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, which determine both the timing and type of molting that the insect experiences [Johnson: 2018]. In this situation, molting refers to the process in which the epidermal skin cells of an insect secrete cells to form a new outer layer, known as a cuticle, and the old skin is shed [Johnson: 2018]. Specifically, juvenile hormone causes the exhibition of morphogenetic effects that act as a retardation of metamorphosis, or in other words, the maintenance of the present life stage of the insect [Safranek: 1980]. Since juvenile hormone is suspected to cause suspended growth and development in insects, a change in the amount of juvenile hormone present could affect the life cycle of Manduca sexta [Safranek: 1980]. To explore how hormones regulate insect physiology, Manduca sexta, or tobacco hornworms, were daily monitored in order to understand the effects of the insect hormone the juvenile hormone, or JH, on lepidopteran growth, metamorphosis, and development. The fluctuation of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta determines when the insect changes from a larvae and pupates into an adult, and so it is expected that the addition of juvenile hormone to the food of the Manduca sexta to impact their life cycle and stages. If the juvenile hormone is added, the Manduca sexta will not be able to reach the pupation stage and transform into adults, but they will rather remain in their juvenile state for the entirety of their lives.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars, of weights between 0.49 grams and 3.85 grams, were each placed into a separate compartment of a plastic container. Each compartment had air holes to allow the insects to breathe, and 10 grams of food were properly weighed and placed into each compartment with the respected Manduca sexta. For the four control Manduca sexta, 7 drops of di water were dispensed with a transfer pipet onto the food in each compartment, and for the four treatment Manduca sexta, 7 drops of juvenile hormone were dispensed. The food was stirred in order to attempt to prevent it from drying out. After all eight Manduca sexta received their food and either di water or juvenile hormone, they were placed into an incubator at 25℃. Due to consumption, the Manduca sexta food was replenished typically every other day, and again either di water or juvenile hormone were added. Additionally, the feces that were produced by the Manduca sexta were removed from their compartments each day upon observation. The Manduca sexta were monitored daily for fifteen days, and their daily weights were collected using a standard lab balance, as well as their qualitative visual observations were recorded. Measuring weight was a good proxy for Manduca sexta development because it is relatively easy to measure, and past studies demonstrate the weight changing patterns, life stages, and pupation of Manduca sexta. A one-tailed two-sample t-test was performed to analyze the differences in Manduca sexta weight over time within the control and treatment groups, and to compare them. This data was transformed by finding the weight change for each Manduca sexta from the first day of experimentation until the day in which each organism was the heaviest, and then an average was calculated for the control and treatment groups. The differences in these averages were then compared.

Results:
A one-tailed two-sample t-test was used to analyze the average of the difference between the weight of the Manduca sexta on the first day of experimentation and the day in which each Manduca sexta was heaviest in both the control and treatment groups. The mean difference between the weight of the Manduca sexta on the first day and the day in which each Manduca sexta was heaviest for the four Manduca sexta in the control group was 7.7525 grams, while the mean difference between the weight of the Manduca sexta on the first day and the day in which each Manduca sexta was heaviest for the four Manduca sexta in the treatment group was 8.8625 grams (Fig. 1). The standard deviation of the four Manduca sexta in the control group was 2.17462 grams, and the standard deviation of the four Manduca sexta in the treatment group was 1.40971 grams. On average, the weights of the control group of Manduca sexta increased during the first seven days, and then they began to mainly decrease for the next eight days. For the weights of the treatment group of Manduca sexta, the weights mainly increased rapidly until day seven or eight, and then the weights mostly remained the same with slight increases or decreases each day for the next eight days. The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the treatment group (t-stat = 0.856623, df = 6, p-value = 0.21227). Upon recording daily observations of the control and treatment groups, the skin color of most of the control Manduca sexta began changing from a green or light green to a yellow or brown color between days ten and eleven as the organisms began to pupate (Fig. 2). For the treatment group, their skin remained green, light green, or even white in color until day twelve in which their skin became very dark and baggy, but not in the form of a pupa. During the pupation of the control group, little movement and no eating was witnessed, while for the treatment group, there was still some movement and feces production as their skin was turning dark brown and black but not in a pupation sense (Fig. 3). As a result of the experiment, the patterns in which the control group gained weight and then lost weight, while the treatment group continued to gain and then maintain their weight, exhibit differences in growth and development.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that if the juvenile hormone is added, the Manduca sexta will not be able to reach the pupation stage and transform into adults, but they will rather remain in their juvenile state for the entirety of their lives, was not supported. Since the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the treatment group, statistically, the hypothesis was not supported. Although, based on the daily changes in appearance through visual observations, the hypothesis did seem to be supported because the control group of Manduca sexta successfully reached the pupation stage, while the treatment group with the addition of juvenile hormone failed to lose weight and began to appear baggy and dark but avoided pupation. Therefore, it is possible that the addition of juvenile hormone negatively affected the treatment group by forcing them to remain in their juvenile state rather than enter pupation based on the observations, but according to the statistics, the control and treatment groups were not significantly different. This contradiction is most likely due to the statistics not accurately representing the witnessed biological changes of the Manduca sexta. Additionally, in past investigations, it has been determined that the juvenile hormone seems to delay or prevent the beginning of the metamorphosis process, causing the Manduca sexta to remain in their infant life stages [Safranek: 1980]. This suggests that juvenile hormone does have an effect on Manduca sexta, as well as the evidence of biological changes between the control and treatment groups, even though this statistical data doesn’t agree. Furthermore, due to the fluctuation of other hormones during the life cycle of Manduca sexta, such as ecdysterone, it could be that the precise measurements of the fluctuations between juvenile hormone and ecdysterone have greater effects. Therefore, in order to further this experiment, the hormone ecdysterone could also be manipulated in order to determine the optimal amounts of each hormone for Manduca sexta in order for them to pupate [Safranek: 1980]. Understanding the relationship between the multiple hormones that regulate the sustainability of life for Manduca sexta could further scientists’ knowledge of how to provide the best conditions and most optimal nutrients for lepidopteran growth, metamorphosis, and development.
