Title: The Effect of PreCore Methoprene Insect Growth Regulator on Manduca Sexta Caterpillar Weight

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators are important components of hormone control in biology. With many farmers dealing with crop growth, it is important to understand the creatures that are eating their plants and how to inhibit their reproduction. Here, we look at the effect of PreCore methoprene, JH hormone mimic on the manduca sexta caterpillar growth patterns. The prediction was that the weight of the caterpillars would increase, since the caterpillars would be unable to reach the commitment pulse at an early time, and would continue to inject more nutrients. However, our data showed no significant difference in the weights of the caterpillars fed food with the PreCore methoprene and the weights of those fed without the IGR. The results suggest that PreCore methoprene is an IGR that does not manipulate the release of the JH hormone in manduca sexta caterpillars. This experiment also suggests that there is an adaptation in the manduca sexta caterpillars that allows the caterpillar to inhibit the effects of the PreCore methoprene. 

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone present in the life cycle of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The hormone, primarily present before the commitment pulse, regulates the type of molt (or change in size/morphology) during development. When the level of JH decreases, the commitment pulse is produced signaling that the caterpillar can begin pupating. [Tunaz: 2004] However, what would happen if this hormone was manipulated? What if the caterpillar had more JH than needed? Insect growth regulators (IGRs) cause hormonal abnormalities in insects, that sometimes reduce the rate of insect survival [Staal: 1975]. In the case of Manduca Sexta caterpillars, if the JH was exposed to an altering IGR, the amount of JH would increase. Thus, the commitment pulse would occur too late, and the caterpillar would pupate into a large adult. This could potentially decrease its chance of survival. In order to prove this, different levels of JH, combined with the IGR, must be ingested by the caterpillars, to analyze their survival rates and developments. This is because the extra JH will elongate the time before the commitment pulse, allowing the caterpillar to intake a surplus of nutrients. A possible IGR that would manipulate the amount of JH produced by the caterpillar is PreCore methoprene, a JH mimic. If 8 drops of PreCore methoprene, juvenile hormone (JH) mimic, are added to the caterpillar food, then the caterpillars will increase in weight (g). This would cause the caterpillars to reach the commitment pulse later and pupate into larger sized adults. Our independent variable is the presence of the juvenile hormone in the food. Our dependent variable is weight of each caterpillar.

Materials and Methods:
1.	Get two plastic bins, with 4 compartments each. This will be where you place your caterpillars. Mark one bin as control, and the other as experimental. Label each compartment with the number of your caterpillar. Using a hole poker, poke two holes in the external sides of each compartment. Make sure the holes are open, to ensure the caterpillars can breathe.
2.	Select 8 caterpillars from the container. Make sure the caterpillars are relatively small, larger sized caterpillars are normally closer to the commitment pulse.
3.	Place each caterpillar, one at a time, on the scale, and record its weight, in grams. After measuring each caterpillar, place them in an organized order on the table (make sure you remember which caterpillar is which). 
4.	Measure out 40 grams of the stock caterpillar food, in a weigh boat. Then, in a separate container, break apart the 40 grams of food. Next, add 8 drops of precore methoprene to the food. Mix everything together. Repeat this step for the controlled group, and add 8 drops of deionized water, instead of precore.
5.	Measure out 10 grams of the mixed food on the scale. Before placing the food in each compartment, squish the food together into one, collected ball. This makes it easier for the caterpillars to eat. After you place the food into each compartment, place each caterpillar into the compartment.
6.	Repeat steps 3-5 every day for a period of 7 days. Before adding the food, clean each bin out, and dump any excess waste into a trash bin.
7.	After 14 days of collecting data, discard of the caterpillars in a bag, provided by your TA.


Results:
The calculated change in weight was based off of the weight measurements from days 1 to 11. This was done for caterpillar 1-4 in the experimental group and caterpillars 1-4 in the control group. Then, for each control and experimental caterpillar, the quantities calculated were averaged. This resulted in an average change in weight for each group of caterpillars (control and precure methoprene). For the experimental group, the average change in weight was 11.6. The average change in weight was 12.26 for the control group. The standard deviation for the weight of the control caterpillars was +/- 0.595 and +/- 0.578 in the experimental caterpillars (Fig 1). As aforementioned, we used a two-sample t-test to analyze the data above. The mean of the weight control group was not significantly different than that of the experimental group (Fig 2). When observing the caterpillars on the last day, the only visible difference was that one of the caterpillars had died. Note, the last day of observation was day 14, not day 11 which was the last day the caterpillars were weighed. As a result of this experiment, both the control and experimental caterpillars had around the same change in weight. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that 8 drops of PreCore methoprene added to the manduca sexta caterpillar food would cause the caterpillars to increase in weight, was not supported. There was no significant difference observed in our statistics, at the 0.05 level. Thus, this suggests that the presence of the insect growth regulator PreCore methoprene in the caterpillar food does not manipulate the change in weight in Manduca sexta caterpillars. It can be suspected that the PreCore methoprene had no effect on the JH hormone in the caterpillars, allowing them to continue growing at a normal rate, even if a commitment pulse was not evident. We were unable to determine, however, if the control and experimental caterpillars had the same pattern of growth, as the data showed the weights decreasing and increasing at various rates. Furthermore, past investigations have found that the JH hormone is not necessary for normal pupation, thus making it not an important factor in the growth of the manduca sexta caterpillar [Browder: 2001]. Understanding the manduca sexta caterpillarâ€™s growth development can further our understanding of how the caterpillar grows. It can also inform farmers or those facing problems with the caterpillars how to naturally inhibit their growth and get rid of the caterpillars all together.
