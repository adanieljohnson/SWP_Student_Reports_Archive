Title: Excessive Insect Growth Hormone’s Delays Tobacco Hornworm Pupation 

Abstract:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is an important organism useful for experiments regarding growth.  It’s short lifecycle and obvious pattern of growth allows ease of observation in determining where in its lifecycle M. sexta falls at any time.  Here we observe how the addition of hormone to M. sexta alters its lifecycle and ability to develop.  The hypothesis of the experiment is that the addition of insect growth hormone (IGR) to the M. sexta food would cause late pupation at a larger size.  Data was collected by massing the M. sexta that received normal food and the group that received IGR and normal food, and then comparing overall growth. The statistical test used to analyze data collected did not show significant differences in the M. sexta development with IGR and without IGR since neither group experienced pupation.  The p-value was 0.366165.  There was an abnormal amount of growth in the IGR group – a difference of about 3 grams – which suggests that wit IGR more growth will occur and the M. sexta will pupate at a larger size, although it was not determined whether pupation will occur.  The importance of this research lies in the potential development of IGR as a method of controlling the M. sexta population in an environmentally safe manner.

Introduction:
In this experiment, the effect of hormones on the growth of insects – Manduca sexta in this case – as they develop from larvae into adults will be examined.  In M. sexta growth and development, there are two main hormones that guide their transitional growth: juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone.  M. sexta goes through several phases of development, known as instars, before pupating [Johnson: 2018]  .  M. sexta has five instars before pupation occurs.  The process of pupation occurring is indicated by a darkening of the larvae. [Johnson: 2018] They eventually shed this dark coating during pupation and take on their mature form.  The term molting describes the transition from larva to pupa to the final adult state of the M. sexta.  The five instars that precede pupation in M. sexta are dependent upon the rise and fall of JGH and ecdysterone.  The hormone IGR (insect growth regulator) over-activates juvenile hormone [Johnson: 2018].  The term ontogenesis refers to the development of an organism from the earliest stage to maturity [Hayes: 2014].  A good deal of research has been conducted on how external, naturally occurring factors affect levels of JH.  JH is secreted by the corpora allata of insects.  JH specifically affects molting and metamorphosis, as well as the production of some enzymes.  Urea-like compounds have previously been found to inhibit JH in M. sexta [Garriga: 2010].  Thus, despite being a very necessary and important hormone for growth, JH is very easily manipulated by internal factors in M. sexta.  The purpose of this experiment is to determine if external factors and chemicals to a larval M. sexta can lead to changes in the pattern of M. sexta growth.  Specifically, the hormone IGR can lead to an overactivation of JH.  This experiment tests the following hypothesis: if JH is overactivated by the addition of IGR, then larval M. sexta will remain in their larval state longer than typically expected.  This is because typically before pupation, the levels of JH in M. sexta decline.  IGR is known to enhance the production of JH in the M. sexta body.  Therefore, by adding IGR, the levels of JH in the M. sexta body should remain higher for a longer period of time, which leads to the expectation that the M. sexta treated with IGR will remain in the larval state for longer.  The independent variable of this experiment is IGR, specifically the quantity added, while the dependent variable is the mass of the caterpillars as well as the observed state in their development cycle.

Materials and Methods:
In order to test the hypothesis of whether the addition of IGR to Manduca sexta food will cause late pupation in the M. sexta, the following steps were completed.  2 cases to hold the caterpillars and their food were gathered, along with 6 M. sexta, a balance, the food itself, as well as water, Insect growth regulator (IGR), and a dropper.  10 grams of food were massed for a total of 6 measurements.  3 of the food samples received 5 drops of IGR, while the remaining 3 food samples received no IGR.  All food samples had several drops of water added to them.  One case was labelled “control”, with individual containers labelled “control #1”, “control #2”, and “control #3”.  The same was done to three cells in the other case, however control was replaced by “experimental”.  The M. sexta collected were each massed initially, with attempt being made to gather M. sexta of a similar initial mass.  For the next few weeks, observations were made and M. sexta from both groups were massed on a daily basis with a standard lab balance, while food was replenished in accordance with the above method of food preparation as needed.  The data for the control group and experimental group was then averaged respectively and a two sample t-test was then used to compare the results regarding the growth of the M. sexta in both groups by a measure of mass to suggest whether the hypothesis was supported or not. 

Results:
Both the control group and the experimental group started with an average mass of 0.903 grams.  The control group, on the final day of the experiment, had an average mass of 10.62 g, while the experimental group had a final average mass of 12.07 g (Fig. 1).  None of the Mandcua sexta fully pupated, although one from each group began to.  The M. sexta that began to pupate from the control group was much smaller when pupation began to occur than the M. sexta that began to pupate from the treatment group.  The standard deviation for the control group was 6.51, while the standard deviation for the treatment group was 1.67 (Fig. 1).  The one-tailed two sample t-test provided a one tailed p-value of 0.366165.  In the experiment, the treatment group did average a higher mass than the control group.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the overactivation of JH through the addition of IGR would cause the Manduca sexta to remain in a larval state for a longer period of time than would naturally occur was not statistically supported.  Although observationally the one control M. sexta that did begin to pupate did so much earlier and at a smaller overall mass than the M. sexta from the treatment group that began to pupate, since neither M. sexta actually pupated a genuine observation cannot be made.  Furthermore, the one-tailed p-value given by the two-sample t-test was not statistically significant.  The treatment caterpillars did grow faster than the control caterpillars and began pupating later and at a larger size than the control group. Past experimentation has documented that M. sexta typically grows about ten grams from its initial mass during the larval stage [Reinecke: 1980]. Despite this evidence, the experiment fails to support that the IGR was effective in causing overactivation of JH due to an abnormal amount of larval growth in the M. sexta due to the insignificant p-value.  There was also a failure to reject the null hypothesis in this lab.  Although the results somewhat correlated with the hypothesis at an observational level, there’s no proof that this wasn’t due to mere chance due to the lack of statistical significance from the data itself.  Due to the inconclusive results provided by both data and observation, it cannot be supported that IGR caused the experimental group to remain in a larval stage for a longer period of time than the control group.  This data suggests that any similar future experiments conducted should be run for a longer period of time, so the transition into the pupal phase can be examined and conclusive results can be gained.  The completion of the lab in a future testing would allow scientists to potentially use IGR as method of controlling the population of M. sexta, and might inspire similar experiments on other insects, serving as a method of insect population control on a broader scale.
