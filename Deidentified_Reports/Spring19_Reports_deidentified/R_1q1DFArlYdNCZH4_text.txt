Title: The Manduca Sexta has a Negative reaction to Juvenile Hormone

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta tobacco hornworm is very sensitive to hormones, as they can be detrimental to their growth and development stage of life. In this experiment, we tested the effect of juvenile hormone in their food by separating them and giving out controll and experimental food. The results of our study were not shocking, because we found that our most of our experimental group died. We used a t test to determine if the differences we found were significent and in the end they were. 


Introduction:
 The Manduca Sexta caterpillar is a tobacco hornworm with an extreme sensitivity to hormones, both inside and out of its body, specifically juvenile hormone and E20. When it has reached full maturity, these hornworms metamorphosize into moths.This pupation is heavily reliant on these hormones and if their exposure to them is altered, it can be fatal to these hornworms (Roundtree, Bollenbacher: 1986). In our experiment, we will be testing the Manudca Sextaâ€™s reaction to an increase of juvenile hormone in their diet. If the Manduca sexta is exposed to an excess of juvenile hormone, that will stagnate their life cycle, causing them to remain in their early juvenile stages.



Materials and Method:
 We created uniform environments for our manduca sexta caterpillars to live during the time of our experiment by placing them in an incubator and allowing them to remain there when we were not weighing them. Initially, we begun by choosing our caterpillars and putting them in plastic containers. Using a scale, we measured their initial weight (in grams) and recorded it in a shared Excel spreadsheet. We gave each subject 10 grams of food, and in the controll group we used 6 drops of distilled water to soften and hydrate it and with the experimental group, we also used the 6 drops of water but in addition to this we used 6 drops of juvenile hormone. Everyday, a single team member returned to the lab, weighed each caterpillar, replaced the food respectively, cleaned/disposed of excrement left by the caterpillar, and returned it to the incubator when we were done. After 12 days, the experiment was concluded and we weighed the final weight of each caterpillar and disposed of them and the containers when we were done. As a group we gathered to complete the statistics necessary and we decided to use a 2-tailed, 2-sample t_test. We gathered the information from our shared spreadsheet and used the spreadsheet provided to us to run the test. 


Results:
In the experiment, we found that the controll group developed considerably better than the experimental group. They consistently grew each day as opposed to the experimental group where many of them died. 

Discussion:
 In our experiment we see that the Manduca Sexta that were exposed to the juvenile hormone did not increase in size as the controll group did and this means that we would fail to reject the hypothesis and it was supported. In an experiment done by the University of Washington, these experimenters also found that the Manduca sexta that they gave juvenile hormone to also failed to grow and develop properly, which also means they failed to pupate (Kinguchi: 1978). Due to the excess of Juvenile hormone, and the role that it plays in the development in the caterpillar, they failed to pupate and in the end, most of the caterpillars we experimented with died, because of this.

Figure #1: The Average weight change in the Manduca sexta, where the blue represents the controll group and red is the experimental group. We see that our experimental group had the greatest amount of change within the Manduca Sexta. The t value was 2.65, the p value is .037, and the degrees of freedom is 1.
