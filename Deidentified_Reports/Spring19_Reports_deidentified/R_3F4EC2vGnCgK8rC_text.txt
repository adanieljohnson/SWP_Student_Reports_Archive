Title: Effects of pH in the Stroma on Photosystem II Activity of Brassica oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis involves a series of transmembrane proteins and electron carriers on the thylakoid membrane; through the utilization of solar energy, a proton gradient is generated in the thylakoid. Since the proton gradient is crucial for ATP synthase to produce ATP, if the proton gradient has been intervened, the photosynthetic activity may be affected in some ways. Our experiment uses the DCIP decolorization assay to test the activity of photosystem II in Brassica oleracea. Results show that the photosynthetic activity reached its highest when the pH is 7 and the lowest when the pH is 9 or 11, while pH=5 has a moderate photosynthetic activity. Our experiment shows that altering the pH in stroma from its normal value pH=7.5 do lower the photosynthetic activity. Moreover, the basic environment has the least photosynthetic activity due to the limited number of protons in the stroma. With that being said, pH in the environment does play a role in the photosynthesis of the plants. Inappropriate pH can reduce photosynthetic activity significantly, which may affect other biological processes in plants.

Introduction:
Plants play a unique role in the ecological system due to its ability to convert the solar energy to chemical energy via photosynthesis -- a three-stage process run inside the chloroplasts. Photosynthesis is composed of the light-dependent reaction (which includes the first two stages) and the light-independent (dark) reaction. Light reaction converts light energy, by absorbing photons, and creates a proton gradient that is used to drive ATP synthesis [AskNature Team: 2018]. Calvin cycle (the light-independent reaction uses ATP and NADPH to produce one 6-carbon glucose by combining one carbon dioxide molecule and one 5-carbon ribulose phosphate [Johnson: 2019]. 

The energy-transduction reactions are broken into several steps. When the photons are absorbed in Photosystem II (PSII), the solar energy excites electrons from the water. The excited electrons leave chlorophyll (a photopigment that absorbs blue-violet and red lights very well) and are taken by plastoquinone (Pq). The protons from water are released into the thylakoid in this stage. Pq transfer the electrons to cytochrome b6f, which pumps protons across the thylakoid membrane into the thylakoid and, at the same time, transfers the electrons to the next carrier – plantacyanin (Pc). Pc takes the electrons to Photosystem I (PSI), in which electrons are excited again. The electrons are released again and used to reduce NADPH. During the reduction, some protons are taken away from the stroma and added to the proton gradient in the thylakoid [Johnson: 2019]. The final consequence of this series of energy-transduction, the thylakoid lumen becomes more acidic (pH = 5) than the stroma (pH = 7.5) [Alberts: 2013]. Moreover, due to the constant removal of protons from the stroma, it is even less acidic than the intermembrane space of chloroplast (pH = 7).  Thus, keeping the appropriate proton gradient may be crucial for plants to run photosynthesis and ATP synthesis normally. With that being said, it is interesting to study how important the proton gradient is to the activity of photosynthesis by changing the acidity.
DCIP decolorization assay was used in this experiment since it is a simple assay that produces highly reliable results since it directly manipulates one stage in the light reaction. It is known that PSII can pass electrons to alternative electron acceptors (Hill reaction), and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) was chosen as the alternative electron acceptor due to its color-changing property [Nuffield Foundation: 2008].
					                
Figure 1. DCIP is a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light maximally at 600 nm. When it is reduced to DCIPH2, the bonds rearrange to conjugated C=C bonds, which makes the molecules colorless. 

The color change from blue to colorless (Fig. 1) allows the spectrometer to measure the DCIP reduction to DCIPH2 directly. A decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm shows that the electrons have been taken by the carriers, which shows an increase in PSII activity. 

It is hypothesized that as the pH of the stroma goes up (less free protons in the stroma), the photosynthetic activity will be lowered since there are less available protons to be pumped in, which results in a smaller proton gradient [Thaler: 1973].

Brassica oleracea (commonly known as collard greens) is one of the mainly grown food crops in the world and has multiple uses, such as an antiseptic, diuretic, rubefacient, rich source of iron, Vitamin A and C, etc [Kapoor et al.: 2014]. Such important plants should be studied extensively at which condition is its optimal growing environment. Thus, this study can contribute to agricultural produce.


Materials and Methods:
Leaf Slurry Preparation
Add 10 ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to the mortar and grind the leaves. After adding 10 ml more grinding buffer, strain the slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker.

Concentrating and Enriching the Chloroplasts
Transfer 200μl of the filtered liquid from the beaker, then transfer the remaining liquid to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube and spin it at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4oC. Pour the supernatant out of “A” into the second chilled centrifuge tube “B”. Leave the pellet of debris at the bottom of “A”. Remove 200μl of the liquid from the 50ml tube “B,” and place them into 4 microtubes “Sample of B” each with 50μl and four different pH buffers (pH = 5, 7, 9, and 11). Centrifuge the 50 ml tubes containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4oC. Pour the supernatant into a clean 50ml tube “C”. Add 20 ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it. Transfer 200μl of the resuspended pellet into a microtube labeled “Sample of B Pellet”. Based on previous laboratory results, “Sample of B Pellet” contains the least amount of debris and sufficient chloroplasts, thus the four “Sample of B Pellet” tubes were used for the assay.

Quantifying PS-II Reduction Activity with the Hill Reaction
Prepare three replicates of each pH condition and one blank for spectrometer calibration. Set the spectrophotometer to 600nm. Mix the chloroplast with DCIP; then, measure the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm. These are the Time Zero (T0) data points. Place all samples under the grow light. Record the absorbance readings at 10-minute increments – T10, T20, and T30. 

Statistical Test and Analysis of Results
Use the following formula to calculate the “% Change” in absorbance at T10, T20, and T30:
%change=(〖Absorbance〗_T0-〖Absorbance〗_TX)/〖Absorbance〗_T0 ×100%
Plot the changes in absorbance (average for each group ± standard deviation) against time (in minutes) for each of the 4 treatments. Two-sample t-test might be performed for two trends of values that are close to each other and hard to identify the difference.


Results:
Since percent changes in pH=9 and pH=11 are close to each other throughout the entire 30 minutes, a two-sample t-test was performed to compare the means. 

There is not a statistically significant difference between the PSII activity in the pH=9 and pH=11 conditions (Table 1.). Thus, statistically, it is hard to tell either pH=9 or pH=11 has a higher PSII activity. However, in Fig 1., pH=7 and pH=5 have shown distinguishable trends. 

Discussion:
Changing the pH environment in the chloroplasts can indirectly affect the proton composition in the stroma of the chloroplasts due to simple diffusion. Our hypothesis is confirmed with the experimental results (Fig. 1), with a higher pH, fewer protons will be available in the stroma to be pumped in, thus, less PSII activity will be observed due to the stagnant, slow, reaction rate of the subsequent stages in the light reaction. It is shown that at pH=7, PSII has the highest activity; this coheres with the empirical data that, normally, stroma has a pH = 7.5 [Mohanty et al.: 1992]. With that being said, if we added the pH=7.5 condition treatment, it may have the highest activity among the five treatments. In our experiment, the second highest PSII activity is produced by pH=5.0. In the pH=5.0 condition, more protons are available in the stroma to be used by photosynthesis. However, this abnormal pH value may not be the optimal working environment for many proteins associated with photosynthesis, thus its activity is not as high as the normal pH=7 condition.

Although pH=5 condition still produced a moderate degree of PSII activity (compared to the basic conditions), acidic environments are not optimal for photosynthesis. Moreover, some acidic gases (such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide) could, potentially, inhibit photosynthesis [Heber et al.: 1990]. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the maintenance of a neutral pH under low, or high, pH conditions are an energy‐demanding process. Metabolic costs to overcome this proton gradient might be the cause of decreased photosynthetic rates and, in extreme conditions, may shut down the whole process [Campbell & Stokes: 1985] [Nixdorf et al.: 2003] [Kamjunke et al.: 2005]. 

In the real-world environment, one leading cause that changes the environmental pH to abnormal is the heavy metal waste that enters the eco-system. These wastes pollute the soil and water that organisms live in. [Javed: 2011].  Studies have shown that heavy metals can impact plants to a large degree whether directly or indirectly. Goltsev et al. 2018 show that “chlorophyll a fluorescence indicated that both metals [cadmium and zinc] disturbed photosynthetic electron transport processes which led to a 4- to 5-fold suppression of the efficiency of energy transformation in Photosystem II.” A decline in photosynthetic efficiency (ΔF/Fm′ ) was observed when B. juncea (L.) was exposed to aluminum [Sharma et al.: 2018]. 

This experiment shows that pH changes do affect the photosynthetic activity, while in the real-world environment, some of these pH changes are caused by heavy metal waste, which is much worse since these heavy metals can also directly affect the molecular process of photosynthesis, not only by affecting the pH environment. Since photosynthesis is a key process in plants, further research should be done on investigating how does the reduced photosynthetic activity affect other biological processes in plants.

Figure 2. Effects of pH in stroma on the PSII activity in Brassica oleracea. PSII in pH=7 condition has the highest activity for the whole experiment period. pH=5 condition provides the second highest PSII activity throughout the entire period. At T10, pH=9 has a higher PSII activity than pH=11; however, pH=11 has a higher PSII activity then pH=9 at T30. At T20, the PSII activities of pH=9 and pH=11 are almost the same. Each data point is the mean percent change of 3 replicates from each treatment; error bars are ± S.D.
