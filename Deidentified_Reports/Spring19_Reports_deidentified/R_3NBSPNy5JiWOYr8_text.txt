Title: 20E Blocker Inhibits Development in Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
With the rising food scarcity, it is important to explore alternative forms of pesticides that will prevent or limit the consumption of crops by insects while having no negative side effects on humans.  In this study, we look at the effect a 20E hormone blocker have on the development of the Manduca Sexta.  The expectation was that the development of the Manduca Sexta would plateau as it reached the commencement pulse keeping the insect in a developmental stasis.  While the insects that were not exposed to the 20E blocker would continue development at a normal pace and would reach metamorphosis.  Our data showed a slowing and slight regression in the mass of the insect and that the commencement pulse was never reached.  The significance of our findings and observations suggests that a Manduca Sexta exposed to a 20E blocker will experience an over-regulated period of growth due to a lack of 20E hormone.  Which, ultimately results in the inability to achieve the commencement pulse barring the insect from achieving metamorphosis.

Introduction:
This experiment investigates the effect of hormones on the physical and sexual development of the Manduca Sexta.  Hormones are a vital form of communication used by virtually all forms of complex life that utilize chemical compounds to initiate and sustain slow changes within specific tissues of the organism.  One of the most visible roles hormones play in the life of complex organisms is its role in stimulating sexual development, often referred to as puberty in mammals.  With some insects such as the Manduca Sexta, hormones help stimulate important growth phases that will ensure that the insect has a sufficient amount of stored calories to provide it the energy needed to complete metamorphosis, which itself is initiated and sustained by hormones[Grunernt: 2015].  The Manduca Sexta is used as the model organism in our experiment due to their simplistic hormone systems allowing for easy hormone manipulation, in addition to the ample research done on the their hormone systems. The Manduca Sexta have four sequences in their life cycle: embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult[Campbell: 2017].  In this experiment we treated with a 20E hormone blocker.  We then monitored, documented, and analyzed the development of the insects.  Due to the 20E hormone stimulating growth and acting as a stimulator for the commencement pulse, if it is levels are decreased or blocked all together the pupa should experience decrease in weight and stunted growth.

Materials and Method:
Two groups of three Manduca Sexta caterpillars with masses between 1.5g-2.5g were each placed into two separate containers(one for each group).  Each container was segmented into four self contained areas where each of the three caterpillars would have its own living space with holes punched into the walls for ventilation.  The diet for each group consisted of 10g of caterpillar feed, with 60Ml of water for the controll group and 60Ml of 20E blocker for the test group.  The containers were kept in an incubator at 28° C in a twelve-hour dark: twelve-hour light cycle.  Maintenance of the experiment consisted of weighing the caterpillars and replacing their food everyday for seven days.  A one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to determine differences in the average weight of the controll group caterpillars and the treatment group caterpillars.

Results:
The maximum measured masses of the controll group Manduca Sexta were 9.67g, 8.38g, and 9.58g.  The observation and recording of this data occured three days after the start of the experiment for all three controll group caterpillars.  The mean of the maximum masses of the controll group Manduca Sexta was 9.21g.  The highest recorded masses for the treatment group Manduca Sextas were 4.52g, 5.21g, and 5.83g.  These weights were observed and recorded five days after the start of the experiment for two of the treatment group caterpillars and seven days after the start of the experiment for one of the treatment group caterpillars.  The mean for the highest recorded masses of the treatment group was 5.19g.  The mean mass for the controll group was significently different than the mean weight of the treatment group caterpillars (T-Stat= 2.209, DF= 4, P=0.046).  The controll group was observed to have a brighter and healthier colour of green in addition to being larger.  The treatment group was observed to be extremely thin and possessing a brownish colour.  The controll group grew at a significently faster rate than the treatment group and obtained a higher weight.

Discussion:
The results of our experiment in conjunction of our statistical analysis supported our hypothesis that of the two groups of three Manduca Sexta, the group that was treated with the 20E hormone blocker would experience slower rate of growth when compared to the controll group who were only fed water and caterpillar feed.  The initial weights of the controll group caterpillars were 2.31g, 1.89g, and 2.45g correspondingly weighed a max weight of 9.67g, 8.38g, and 9.58g.  Contrastingly, On the other hand, the treatment group of caterpillars that initially weighed 2.35g, 2.33g, and 1.94g, accordingly weighed 4.47g, 4.42g, and 5.83g. The controll group after 4 days began to lose weight as a result of water loss, most likely as a result of the caterpillars beginning to enter pupation.  The experiment ended with the controll group entering their commencement pulse while the treatment group was still firMly stuck in the pupa stage of their life cycle.  In future experiments we might treat several groups with varying amounts of a 20E hormone to observe what the minimum level of 20E hormone is needed for the caterpillars to achieve commencement pulse.
