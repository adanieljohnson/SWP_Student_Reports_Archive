Title: The Effects of Ecdysterone in the Life Cycle of a Tobacco Hornworm

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta, more commonly known as tobacco hornworms, are insects that rely on juvenile hormone and ecdysterone for development to become adult moths. This experiment was done to examine whether the addition of Ecdysterone to a manduca sexta’s diet would inhibit the insect from reaching the pupation stage. In order to achieve this, two groups were separated: treatment and control. The control group was given normal food that an insect of this kind would eat, and the treatment group was given extra E20 in its diet. Each insect was weighed daily for two weeks in order to allow proper time for growth. The results of this experiment illustrated that the hypothesis was correct, as the commitment pulse obviously never occurred for the treatment group, as they never fully pupated, and each member of the control group did pupate.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect more commonly known as a tobacco hornworm. Manduca sexta are pests to tobacco farmers due to their eating of tobacco plants as pupae. They are considered pests by many farmers, and many steps have been taken to change the life cycle of these insects to not eat so much tobacco. This experiment is relevant because it studies the life cycles of manduca sexta and hormones that affect its growth. In a study done by researchers Reinecke, Buckner, and Grugel, the life cycle of tobacco hornworms was studied at great lengths. These researchers discovered that multiple factors, such as temperature, humidity, basic diet, and diet preparation directly affect the advancement of manduca sexta throughout its life stages [Reinecke, et al., 1980]. This insect undergoes stages development going from larvae, to manduca sexta, to pupating, to the emergence as adults. The development is largely controlled by two hormones, Ecdysterone (E20) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) [Labratory Manual, 2018]. This physiological process governs the overall development of the manduca sexta into an adult. This experiment dealt with the amount of Ecdysterone in the manduca sexta’s diet and the effects it has on growth. If the amount of E20 in a manduca sexta larva is increased in food, then the manduca sexta will never reach the commitment pulse, likely leading to it staying in the larva stage indefinitely and never pupating. The commitment pulse is a point when the larva has reached the size in order to pupate.

Materials and Methods:
The manduca sexta were obtained by the biology department and given to students in order to complete this lab. The students divided the manduca sexta into two groups, treatment and control. The two groups were separated into different containers with four slots each for one manduca sexta. Each container was given punctured holes to ensure manduca sexta were able to have plenty of airflow. The control group was given 10 g each of food mixed with distilled water. They were fed and weighed daily for two weeks. The experimental group was given 10 g each of food as well, but this food was mixed with 10 drops of E20 and water. The required measurement was the weight of each manduca sexta for every day for two weeks in order to track the growth. Also, observations were taken in regard to the manduca sexta’s life cycle, such as color and stage. In order to achieve proper results for this experiment, a two-sample T test was taken to compare the two groups. A bar graph with error bars was used to accurately and concisely depict data taken regarding average of the change in weight of the manduca sexta.

Results:
The mean change in weight from the beginning of the experiment to the heaviest point of each manduca sexta for the treatment group was 2.07 g, and the mean for the control group was 6.87 g (Figure 2). The error bars in this figure denote the standard deviation of the data points. The one-tailed p-value was 0.026, giving the necessary p-value of less than 0.05. The t-value was 4.26. The mean change in weight from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment for the treatment group was 0.62 g, and the mean for the control group was 1.89 g (Figure 1). In the beginning of the experiment, every manduca sexta was a blue-green color. The experimental group initially gained weight and then began to lose it through the rest of the trial. Also, the experimental group remained the blueish color throughout the trial. The experimental group quickly showed signs of being inactive, ultimately leading to the death of manduca sexta B1. The control group molted its skin and began to pupate as well as go through each juvenile stage of life. It began as blue-green, turned yellow, and eventually became a brown pupa. Each member of the control group slightly lost weight before hitting the pupation stage. By the end of the experiment, all four manduca sexta in the control group had pupated. The first manduca sexta to pupate were C2 and C3. 

Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment, it can be determined that the hypothesis was proven true: the manduca sexta given extra E20 in their food never reached the commitment pulse. This idea can be supported by the fact that the treated manduca sexta grew significantly less than the control group. Since the hypothesis was supported, the null hypothesis was rejected, as there was obvious statistical evidence that the amount of E20 had an effect on the life cycle of the manduca sexta. As the results show, the treatment group was significantly affected by the extra E20 in the diet. The control group reached the pupation stage, indicating that this group would lead a healthy adult life. In contrast, the treatment group did not reach a pupation stage; therefore, this group would stay in the larva stage until death. This is exemplified by treatment group B1 which was ultimately killed by the exorbitant amounts of Ecdysterone in its food. Each of the manduca sexta in the treatment group grew initially and then lost a significant amount of weight, with two having weights fall almost to what they were at the beginning of the trial. Also, the treatment group never changed colors from blue-green to yellow, as the control group did. This can be attributed to the fact that these caterpillars never reached the commitment pulse; therefore, never leaving the first larva stage.  In reference to the source in the introduction, the basic diet of the manduca sexta was changed, leading to it not pupating. In reference to the introduction, our hypothesis is supported by the Laboratory Manual’s description of the manduca sexta’s life cycle. The control group of manduca sexta went through each larva stage before pupating [Laboratory Manual, 2018]. An opportunity for further study, similar to what the aforementioned researchers did, could be to change the temperature in which the manduca sexta grow in. These researchers found that when temperature was changed, the growth rates of these insects were altered [Reinecke et al., 1980]. The monitoring of temperature could have significant effects as to how the manduca sexta grow throughout the year, leading to new discoveries on how to limit the amount of tobacco leaves they contaminate.
