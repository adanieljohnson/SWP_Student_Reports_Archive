Title: Energy Allocation in Secale cereale: Increase in Soil Salinity Correlates to Longer Roots

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate the effect of salinity on energy allocation in Secale cereale. The experiment will test the hypothesis that an increase in salt salinity will results in greater root:shoot ratios in plants because they will allocate resources to their roots to better uptake water. Root:shoot ratios are accurate measurements of general allocation through relative biomass because they indicate the ability for plants to allocate resources in a specific environment. The experiment treats a group of rye to 3% salt water and allows both the controll and treatment groups to grow in sunlight for two weeks with daily watering. The study found that the root:shoot ratios were greater in reference to both mass (g) and length (cm) for the plants treated with salt water. The experiment used a two-sample t_test and the p value was 4.20E-7 for the mass data and 1.84E-7 for the length data, rendering both results significent. The trend supports previously published studies that propose the concept that plants have mechanisms to battle water stress due to increases in salinity. Energy allocation under salt stress is significent in plants because it provides insight into the best environments for plant growth and what resources are needed for development.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates phenotypic plasticity and energy allocation in Secale cereale. Also known as rye, Secale cereale, is a good model organism for this experiment because its biomass can be measured easily which is an accurate indicator of resource allocation in plants. Phenotypic plasticity is when plants change how they allocate resources based on their surroundings [Johnson: 2018]. Allocation strategies are not static and instead change over time as an organism’s environment is constantly evolving. Both biotic and abiotic factors influence energy allocation. Biotic factors are living and include competitive species while abiotic factors are not alive and include sunlight and soil. Plants can make changes in how they allocate energy to respond to these factors. For example, plants can increase growth of leaves to increase rate of photosynthesis, grow longer stems to build support, and increase root growth to increase the absorption of nutrients in soil [Johnson: 2018]. General allocation can be measured through relative biomass which indicates the ability of a plant to obtain resources in its environment [Johnson: 2018]. This is more specifically measured by calculating a root:shoot ratio where the biomass of the root is divided by the biomass of the shoot. 
This experiment specifically evaluates the effects of soil salinity on energy allocation in Secale cereale. A high salt concentration in soil as been shown to reduce the ability of plants to acquire water, which is called the osmotic effect of salinity [Machado: 2017]. In a separate experiment with tomato plants, an increase in the salt concentration of soil was seen to increase the activity of a bacterium that increased the water use efficiency [Mayak: 2004]. This study suggested that there may be actions within specific plants to allocate resources towards mechanisms that increase the ability to uptake water. In this specific experiment, this mechanism would be the growth of roots. If Secale cereale are treated with 3% salt water then they will have higher root:shoot ratios than the controll plants because they will allocate energy to grow longer roots in an attempt to obtain water.

Materials and Method:
Four pots were filled three quarters of the way full with vermiculite. 200 Ml of tap water and 100 Ml of miracle grow were added to each pot. 16 holes were made in each pot and two Secale cereale seeds were added to each hole. Two controll pots were watered with 200 Ml of tap water daily for two weeks. Two treatment pots were watered with 200 Ml of 3% salt water daily for two weeks. The plants were allowed to grow in a greenhouse in sunlight. 10 plants were removed from the controll pots and 10 were removed from the treatment pots. Each plant was cut above the seed. The mass and lengths of the roots and shoots were recorded after the two week period of growth and root:shoot ratios were calculated. A two-sample t_test was conducted to determine if the results were statistically significent.

Results:
The results found that the plants treated with salt water had greater root:shoot ratios in reference to both mass and length. The difference in ratio between controll and treatment group was greater with mass compared to length. A two-sample t_test was conducted and found both sets of data to be significent. The p value for mass was 4.20E-7 and the p value for length was 1.84E-7. 

Discussion:
The data supported our hypothesis which stated that plants treated with 3% salt water would have higher root:shoot ratios because they would allocate energy to root growth in attempts to obtain more water. The data was able to support this because the root:shoot ratios were greater in the treatment plants in reference to both mass (g) and length (cm). This means that the rye plants allocated energy to grow longer and heavier roots in response to salt stress from their environment. Salt stress can affect plants through both osmotic and ionic stress. Osmotic stress is when there is a decrease in water availability and this is induced by salt stress through an excess of sodium ions [Sudhir: 2004]. When there is an excess of sodium outside of a cell, water will be pulled out in attempts to balance the ion concentration of sodium in the cell’s environment. This draws water out of the cells and decreases the amount of water available for plants to use in metabolic processes. Ionic stress occurs when there is an excessive accumulation of sodium and chloride which reduces the ability for the cells to take up other nutrients like potassium, calcium, and magnesium that are needed in the cell [Sudhir: 2004]. This excess amount of sodium also has the ability to inactive enzymes and inhibit metabolic processes in plants [Sudhir: 2004]. 
Conclusively, salt stress negatively affects the metabolic processes of plants through both osmotic and ionic stress. One way this stress can be reversed is if the plant allocates resources to increase the uptake of water which is possible through root growth. This way, plants are able to attempt to balance the salt stress and maintain a sufficient water uptake. Future experiments could evaluate the effects of different nutrients on root growth in rye. For example, plants need nitrogen because it is a major product of chlorophyll and amino acids. This nitrogen is obtained from soil so future experiments could test how plants would allocate energy to roots if there was a lack of nitrogen present. Looking at different ways plants change the growth of roots can help better understand the ways that rye are able to adapt to their environment and which conditions are most suitable for their growth.
