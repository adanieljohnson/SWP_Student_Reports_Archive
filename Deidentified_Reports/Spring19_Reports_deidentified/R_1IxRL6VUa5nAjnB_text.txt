Title: Use of the IGR Azaguard Negatively Affects Development in the Manduca sexta Caterpillar by Inhibiting the 20E Growth Hormone

Abstract:
The topic of insect hormones is prevalent in biology and agriculture. It is critical to understand the effects that hormones have on insects development as well to understand the many possible ways to regulate it. In this experiment, we look at the effect of ecdysterone inhibition in the Manduca sexta caterpillar through the ingestion of an IGR.  The expectation was that the restricted ecdysterone would negatively affect the caterpillars' growth into adulthood, as measured by observations in length and weight.  Our data showed no significent difference in mean differences in length between the controll and treatment group but did show a significent difference in mean weight between the two groups. This significance, in conjunction with our observation of the unhealthy state of the treatment group, suggests that our hypothesis was correct since the caterpillars unsuccessfully molted in response to ecdysterone inhibition. This outcome points to wider implications on the ability to regulate hormones on insects for the benefit of agriculture in a changing environment.  

Introduction:
Hormones are an essential component to the development of both insects and mammals. In insects, they mark the physical and chemical transition into adulthood through the process of molting. Molting is described as the change in an insect's morphology when its epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer of cuticle after the old layer of skin is shed. This process enables insects to progress from the larva to pupa and to adults stages [Johnson:2018]. The Manduca sexta is a prime model for this experiment since there is a great amount of research on its life cycle and hormone regulation. In the Manduca sexta, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are two important hormones involved in development. Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt that will occur and Ecdysterone, also known as 20E, regulates the timing of molting [Judy: 1972]. When the Manduca reaches 5th instar larva, there is a small rise in 20E which indicates that the caterpillar has stored enough nutrients to pupate. This experiment treats the caterpillars with a decreased amount of ecdysterone hormone through an insect growth regulator (IGR) compound called azaguard. With our knowledge of 20E, we believe that decreasing the amount of 20E hormone in Manduca sexta should prevent or delay the caterpillars from molting. Thus, they will not be able to create a new outer layer of cuticle to support new internal and external structures. We hypothesize that if the Manduca sexta is treated with azaguard, a 20E inhibitor, they will stop molting. Restricting 20E will prevent the Manduca from molting and so they will be unable to support new structures and will have an unsuccessful growth into adulthood. We track the effects of the 20E inhibition by measuring their length, weight, and overall appearance as a reflection of their development. This experiment would shed more insight on the possible ways to regulate insect growth within agriculture.


Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were equally divided into the controll group and treatment group. The Manducas were in the 2nd or 3rd instar larval stage at the beginning of the experiment. Each Manduca was measured for length (cm) and appearance (color and movement). 4 Manducas were housed into four-celled containers with air holes for each group. 10 grams of food was measured and placed into each of the 8 cells. 8 drops (80Ml) of water was dropped into the food (Great Lakes Manduca) for the controll group with a. 8 drops (80Ml) of concentrated (1: 1) azaguard was mixed into food) for the treatment group with a transfer pipette. The 2 containers of the controll and treatment group were placed into an incubator (24 hour light, 25°C). Food was replenished with the same technique daily after measuring poop amount and cleaning container and container. The length and appearance of each controll and treatment Manduca were measured daily for 13 days except on the 11th day due to researcher complications. The average of the difference in weight and length between their final day and initial day was recorded.

Statistical Analyses:  A one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to determine differences in the average growth in lengths and weights under intake of either untreated or hormone-treated food.


Results:
A two-sample t_test was used to analyze our results. The mean length for the 11 days was 6.68cm for the controll group and 6.19 for the treatment group. Based on this data, the mean length of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the treatment group (t_stat = 1.06, d.f. = 22, 2-tailed P= 0.30). The mean weight for the 11 days was 9.52g for the controll group and 6.68g for the treatment group. Based on the t_test, the mean of the weight controll group was statistically significently different than that of the weight treatment group (t_stat = 4.47, d.f.= 12, 2-tailed P= 0.000767). The directionality is in favor of the controll group for the one-tailed t_test. The p_value is also lower than .05, which suggests that the mean of the controll being larger than the mean of the treatment is very unlikely to be due to chance. 

When observing the caterpillars on the final day, there was not much of a visible difference among the Manducas in their respective group. They appeared to be around the same length and appearance regarding color and luminosity. In terms of qualitative observations taken on the final day, #2 in both groups were the only caterpillars to have yellow-brown patches around the segments and #1 in treatment remained smaller than the rest of the caterpillars. As a result of this experiment, both the controll and experimental caterpillars had around the same pattern of growth.


Discussion:

We hypothesized that treating Manduca sexta caterpillars with azaguard would prevent or delay molting due to its 20E inhibitory properties which would render them unable to successfully develop into adulthood. Our results were able to support this alternate hypothesis through quantitative and qualitative assessments. The weight measurements indicated a statistically significent difference between the controll and treatment group, suggesting that the presence of azaguard the treatment caterpillars’ food decreased their weight by the end of the experiment. One reason for their lower mass could be that they did not create the new layer of cuticle to support new structures. However, it is possible that the treatment caterpillars stopped growing by around the 6th day because they became sluggish and stopped eating as much food. With the limitations and short time frame of our experiment, we have limited evidence to reject the null hypothesis and support the alternate one. The length measurement that we took actually did not indicate a statistically significent difference between the controll and treatment group. We decided to focus on the weight rather than the length to answer our hypothesis since we learned it was a more reliable method of taking data. 
We believe the significance of the length measurements is largely due to the inconsistency and inaccuracy of measuring the lengths of the caterpillars since they are stretched out some days and shriveled up on other days. Although length was the quantitative assessment that we chose to measure at the begin of the experiment, we realized its insufficiencies and decided to measure weight as well. Weight was a much better indicator of development because it was more accurate and consistent throughout the experiment regardless of the physical appearance of the caterpillars. We also knew that the Manducas were stored in incubators with the light on for 24 hours a day, which was inconsistent with their normal biological rhythm and may have had an effect on the outcome of their development. There was also a grave mixup in the experimentation when no members were able to come measure, clean, and feed the caterpillars on the 11th day, which resulted in a gap in the data. In future experimentations, we would stick to weight as a more reliable means of tracking development, provide a more suitable housing condition with the right amount of light, and plan a strict schedule to come in and check the caterpillars.
All of this data suggests that the inhibition of 20E did have a negative effect on the development in the Manduca sexta, since the treatment groups were not able to molt properly and thus have the proper skin to support structures that they would normally grow in their later instar larval stages as well as pupation. The significance and relevance of the data relate greatly with large scale agriculture, food science, animal science, and pesticide use. Understanding hormonal development in the Manduca sexta, as well as other species of insects, enables us to develop better method and equipment for agriculture [Dhadialla: 1996].
