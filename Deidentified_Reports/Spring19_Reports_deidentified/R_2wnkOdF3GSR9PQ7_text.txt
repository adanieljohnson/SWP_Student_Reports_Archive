Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Growth of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta caterpillars rely on both Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) for growth and development. When either of these hormones are affected it can prevent the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the larvae. This lab tested the effects of JH regarding the development of Manduca sexta. Juvenile hormone was added to the food source of the experimental group. It was hypothesized that with the addition of JH into their diets, the average final weight of the caterpillars would decrease. The alternative hypothesis was rejected by the outcome of the experiment and statistical analysis determining there were no significant differences. It was concluded that the experimental group’s average final weight did not decrease in comparison to the control group’s average final weight.

Introduction:
This experiment is designed to test the resulting effects that take place when Manduca sexta caterpillars are given Insect Growth Regulators (IGR). These IGRs can lead to various abnormalities amongst insects and reduce survival rates. This experiment is focused on eight 11-12 days old Manduca sexta larvae and how they react to Juvenile Hormones (JH analogue). It was determined in previous studies that “JH plays a key role in the development of insects from embryo to adult” [Larry: 1975]. Ergo, JH regulates the type of molt that occurs during insect development by determining the level of maturation in the larvae’s growth cycle. Low JH can prevent the larvae from a “normal” molt and causing it to not turn into a pupa and high JH can cause low egg hatch rates and insect survival rate [Lab Manual: 2018]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that by increasing the amount of JH given to the Manduca sexta caterpillars, there will be a decrease in the average final weight.

Materials and Methods:
Eight, 11-12 days old Manduca sexta Caterpillars were used for this experiment. They each weigh approximately 1.5 to 2.5 grams and were dived into two groups of four. The larvae were distributed into two 4-cell containers and kept in a controlled environment (incubator at 28˚C with constant light). The caterpillars were fed one of two diets. Diet one was directed towards the control group which consists of four caterpillars that receive 10 grams each of Manduca sexta food with the addition of 60 microliters of water. Diet two was directed towards the experimental group which consists of four caterpillars that receive 10 grams of Manduca sexta food with the addition of 60 microliters of juvenile hormone analog (precor 1:1250). Each diet was swapped out daily due to the daily consumption and dehydration of the food. The weight was recorded in grams and daily observations were taken over the 11 days of the experiment. The average growth was then calculated, via summation of daily growth of each group and then each divided by 11 for daily average growth, and a two-sample t-test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
The average weight growth for the control group was found to be 0.7465 grams per day, whereas, the average weight growth for the experimental group was found to be 0.7425 grams per day (Fig 1). A two-sampled t-test was taken in order to analyze these results. It concluded that due to the p-value being 0.475 which is greater than 0.05, the results are not statistically significant. The statistical results and observations offered various trends throughout this experiment. Week 1 of observations showed that both control and experimental groups were growing at a steady rate, with the control growing slightly more on average. The caterpillars were a greenish-blue color and produced a large amount of feces daily. Week 2 of observations showed that the control group started to slow down in weight gain and form an orange-brown color while wrapping themselves up. The experimental group continued gaining weight at a consistently slow rate and started turning a slight orangish color towards the last day of the experiment. They required more food replacement and cleanup during this week in comparison to the control group.

Discussion:
The hypothesis stated that by increasing the amount of JH given to the Manduca sexta caterpillars, there will be a decrease in the average final weight. Based on the statistical results it can be concluded that the alternative hypothesis was rejected, and the null hypothesis was accepted. We observed no statistical significance at the 0.05 level, which suggests that the increase of JH did not significantly affect the weight growth of the Manduca sexta. While the trends showed that the control group increased at a higher rate than the experimental it was not a big enough difference and was not significant in the averages. This in turn means that the results from the average weight of the control group was also not statistically significant from that of the average weight experimental group. We believe this occurred because there were not enough droplets of JH added to the food source of these caterpillars. Throughout the observational period of the experience, there was a slight inhibition in the growth weight between the two groups of caterpillars which was most likely due to JH. "Thus, the intermolt change in the lamellar assembly process appears to result from hormone-induced changes in cuticular protein synthesis” [Wolfgang: 1986]. The Manduca sexta larvae were slightly affected by juvenile hormone through the inhibition of the commitment pulse and pupation. The control group was found to have more larvae begin the molt period while the experimental group had barely begun molting. Therefore, we believe that our hypothesis would have had better success if the amount of droplets we used was increased from six to ten drops per caterpillar.
