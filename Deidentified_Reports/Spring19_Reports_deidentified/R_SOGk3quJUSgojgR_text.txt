Title: Heated Environments affect the Growth of the Roots and Shoots of Secale cereal

Abstract:
The objective of the experiment is to determine how the root to shoot (R:S) ratio differs from plants grown in environments with different temperatures. Plants are grown in a green house and a heated incubator for a week to determine the differences between the growth of the roots and shoots of the plants. The primary focus of the experiment was to see the differences of the ratio between the roots and shoots of both incubated and greenhouse plants. We hypothesized that the plants in the incubator would have a higher root to shoot ratio for both length and width. The result of the paired t_test was that the R:S of length was the only significance. Because of this our hypothesis was not supported.

Introduction:
Plants require many nutrients to stay healthy. These include sunlight, water, and soil nutrients, such as nitrogen. Plants will allocate resources to different parts of them to stimulate growth for better getting all the vital nutrients that they require. For example, to obtain more sunlight where it is highly contested for, such as in a rainforest, plants will focus on the growth of their stems so they can grow taller [Larigauderie: 1990]. Relative to temperature, plants will grow their roots larger because in arid climates, the water is concentrated deeper in the ground, where it is cooler, opposed to the rainforest, where the roots of plants are required to be as large [Bennet:2012]. Because of this phenomenon, our group hypothesized that the plants in the incubator would have a larger root to shoot ratio for both length and weight due to the act that water is more of a necessity in dry climates. 

Materials and Method:
First, our group planted seeds into ten pots with each pot containing ten rye seeds. Next we divided the pots into two equal groups of five plants. One group is placed in a greenhouse and the other placed inside an incubator. Each plant was watered each day for a week. The plants would be watered enough so the top layer of soil was covered. After a week elapsed, our group took three seedlings from each pot to measure. To do this, pour water into a larger tub and then take the entire pot and empty it into the larger container. Use the water to loosen the dirt around the roots of the seedlings so they aren’t torn off when removing the plant. Next, cut the plants where the roots and shoots. This is where the stem begins to turn white. We made sure not to separate the roots and shoots from each other so we could tell which shoots and roots were paired together. The we measured the lengths and weights for both the roots and shoots of each plant. Calculate the R:S ratio between the two groups for both lengths and the weights. Next, the averages and standard deviations for the R:S ratios were calculated and a paired t_test was used to analyze the results. 

Results:
Our measures for the R:S ratio for length are (1.48±0.37) for the incubated plants and (1.54±0.38) for the plants inside the greenhouse. The R:S ratio for the weights are (2.55±1.32) for the incubator and (0.57±0.25). The results of the t test for weights are as follows: (p=0.02, t=3.93, d.f.=4). The results of the t test for lengths are as follows: (p=0.79, t=0.29, d.f.=4). 

Discussion:
 The p value of the R:S for the weight of the plant is statistically significent, meaning that the weight of the root is affected based on the environment that it is in. Because the mean is larger in the incubator group than the greenhouse group, the larger average root weight of the plants exposed to the increased temperature of the incubator coincides with our hypothesis. However, we can not accept our hypothesis, due to the fact that the R:S ratio for length between the two groups of Secale cereal was not statistically significent. The reason that the length between the two groups was similar and the weights were significently different is unknown. Generally, the R:S ratio of weight and length will both increase if a plant is exposed to dry or hot environments [DeLucia: 1991]. This is because the plants allocate growth towards different areas to ensure that they receive all the necessary nutrients to survive, in this case, towards the roots because it is the most scarce resource in a dry environment. It is important to note that we only actively tried to change the air temperature of our experiment but had no way to regulate the temperature of the soil. This is important because soil temperature is more correlated with a change in root length and weight, while air temperature is more associated with changes in shoot length and weight [Poorter:2011].
