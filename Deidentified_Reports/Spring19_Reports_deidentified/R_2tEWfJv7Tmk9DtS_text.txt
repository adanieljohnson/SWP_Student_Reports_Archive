Title: Lack of correlation between aggressive behaviors in B.splendens and the presence of a shelter

Abstract:
	This study looks into the intraspecific aggressive behaviors in the Betta Splendens organism and in the reasoning behind the behaviors.  We looked into three different kinds of aggressive behaviors (tail beating, red-maning, and facing) in different settings (with a shelter and without a shelter) to see if the betta fish would exhibit different levels of aggression due to their territorial nature.  We hypothesized that the B. splendens would exhibit more of the aggressive behaviors when the shelter was present than when it was not because they have been known to be more aggressive when their own territory is involved.  The data we found showed only a correlation between setting and shelter for red maning, but it showed that the fish exhibited less red-maning when the shelter was present than when it wasn’t which does not support our hypothesis.  Our data was not significant based on a two-tailed t-test.

Introduction:
Intraspecific behaviors are defined by the behaviors that two organisms of the same species exhibit toward each other.  One of the most prominent intraspecific behaviors is aggressive or agonistic behavior when competing for mates. In the Betta Splendens species of fish, there are two types of agonistic behaviors associated with mating: broadside behaviors (less aggressive) and facing behaviors (more aggressive).  To gain more insight into these behaviors and their triggers, this study will look into how siamese fighting fish exhibit these behaviors when there is territory involved. There is a lot of evidence to support the territoriality of B. splendens, for example, when they build their bubble nests for reproduction, the male will defend the nest through aggressive displays such as gill flaring and fin spreading  [Forsatkar:2017].  Because B. Splendens are territorial organisms, we hypothesized that they will exhibit more aggressive behaviors when there is a shelter present in the cage than when there is not one present.

Materials and Methods:
	This experiment required eight different male betta fish, all separated in their own tank, a rock to act as shelter, and then a tank with a removable partition and a glass wall. The first two sets of two fish were placed in each side of the tank (only one in each side of the tank at a time), first with no partition and no shelter for five minutes, then with the partition for five minutes, then for two minutes with the partition and the shelter, then without the partition and with the shelter for five minutes.  The next two sets of two fish were placed in each side (only one in each side of the tank at a time), first with partition and shelter for two minutes, then with shelter and no partition for five minutes, then then with the partition and no shelter for 5 minutes then without the partition and without the shelter for five minutes. In the time periods without the partition, we recorded the amount of time the fish spend tail beating, facing, and red-maning, all of which are considered to be forms of aggressive behaviors in betta fish. A two-tailed t-test was performed to determine statistical significance.

Results:
In figure 1, the mean with the shelter was 64.65 ± 62.9 seconds, and without the shelter was 92.5 ± 86.0 seconds.  The differences here were not significant (df=3, t=1.79, p=0.67). In figure 2, the mean with the shelter was 86.25 ± 56.1 seconds, and the mean without the shelter was 123.3 ± 73.4 seconds. The differences here were not significant (df=2, t=2.1, p=0.17).

Discussion:
Based on the results we received, we chose not to include the facing behaviors or the tail beating behaviors in the results because there was absolutely no correlation and between those behaviors and the setting.  Also, there was one trial where the fish exhibited little to no aggressive behavior, so we chose to include results and perform statistical tests on both the data with this outlier and without it. Looking at just the red maning data, the trend shows that the B. Splendens behave less aggressively when the shelter is present which does not support our hypothesis that the B. Splendens will behave more aggressively when the shelter is present.  Also, both the data with the outlier and without the outlier was not statistically significant, which further indicates that out hypothesis was not supported. A reason for this may be that the shelter in this case had no reproductive advantage, and the study referenced earlier used a nest that was involved in reproduction which is most likely what accounted for the aggressive territorial behavior [Forsatkar:2017].  While the results from this study did not show any significance, it can have some implications of further study of the behavior of B. splendens and organisms in general. For example, it could provide insight into the reasons behind territorial behavior, as this study did not show any correlation between aggressive behavior and the shelter, it begs the question of what incites territorial behaviors in organisms.  For example, a study done on poison frogs showed that they increased their territorial behaviors when defending their food sources [Prohl:2019]. Similar theories could also be tested in the B. splendens. Another study that examines reasons for intraspecific territoriality shows that the availability of mates will cause aggressive territoriality in many organisms including reptiles, mammals, birds, and fish [Maher:2000].  This too could be specifically explored for just B. splendens and provide more insight into the reasons behind their aggressive behavior.
