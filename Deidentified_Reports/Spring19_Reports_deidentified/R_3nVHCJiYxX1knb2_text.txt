Title: The effect of salt water on the Root:Shoot ratio in length of buckwheat

Abstract:
In the experiment, we used buckwheat to study the effect of sodium chloride solution on the root: shoot ratio. In order to respond to various environmental factors and resource limitations, plants will use a strategy called resource allocation to deal with the scarcity. Plants have large R:S ratio tend to spend more energy developing root system in order to absorb more nutrients and small R:S ratio indicates plants grow more shoots to obtain more solar energy. In the lab, four containers of buckwheat were watered every other day. Two of them received water and the rest received salt water. Two weeks after, R:S in length was measured for each group and the result showed a significent difference between two groups as the buckwheat grown in the salty environment had much larger ratio value. Further study could be made for more accurate and specific results. 

Introduction:
In an ecological community, all the resident plants and animals interact with and adapt to each other [Johnson: 2018]. The interactions between all living organisms are called biotic factors. Also, all organisms have to adapt to the abiotic factors, which is the stimuli of non-living organisms, such as temperature, humidity and etc. Unlike animals which can move around to search for limited resources, plants interactions are less obvious as they lack of the ability to move. The most important resources plants required are water, nitrogen and solar energy but these resources are usually limited. Resource limitation affects the species present in the environment and the behavior of these plants. In order to respond to the resource limitation, plants mostly use two ways – trade-offs and resource allocation [Johnson: 2018]. As a result, a plant may utilize more energy and mass to grow a particular structure instead of spending the energy elsewhere. For example, the understory in the rainforest usually allocates most of the energy under the ground as most of the solar energy is blocked by the tall trees. Lower plants are forced to evolve well-developed root system in order to compete with other plants for nutrients. An effective way to measure the allocation is the root: shoot ratio. The larger the root: shoot ratio, the more developed the root system is. In the experiment, we studied the effects of salinity on the root: shoot ratio of buckwheat. Buckwheat has strong adaptability and grow quickly so it is an appropriate plant to use in the study. Treatment of an appropriate concentration of NaCl improves the nutritional quality of sprouts, including the level of phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and antioxidant activity [Jeong-Ho: 2012]. As the nutrient content in the soil largely increases, the buckwheat would probably have a more developed root system than the normal ones in order to absorb more nutrients. We used 3% NaCl solution to water the plants as treatment group and water for the controll. We hypothesized that the buckwheat grown in salty environment will have a larger root: shoot ratio in length than the buckwheat grown in normal area. 

Materials and Method:
We prepared four containers, two for experimental and the other two for controll, with wet vermiculite and 50Ml of MiracleGro solution in each. A hand.f.ul of wet buckwheat seeds was evenly spread on the surface of the soil and was then covered with a another thin layer of dry vermiculite. After we put the four containers in greenhouse and kept all the other variables such as humidity, temperature the same, we watered the controll group with 50Ml of water and the experimental group with 50Ml of 3% NaCl water every other day. After two weeks, we picked 3 individual plants from each container as samples to measure. We cut the total 12 plant at the edge of the shoot and the root and measure the length of each to get the mean and standard deviation of two groups. Two sample one-tailed t_test was used to see the significent difference between two groups.

Results:
The buckwheat for the controll group started to grow at the end of the first week and for the experimental group, the shoots grew only a little bit during two weeks. However, both the root systems of the two group grew a lot but according to the length, the roots of controll group grew much faster. For the buckwheat grown with water, the value of R:S in length was 0.927±0.148. The R:S in length for the experimental group was 6.19±3.31. For the one tailed two-sample t_test, the p value was 0.00152, t value was 3.88 with the degree of freedom of 10. 

Discussion:
Usually, in the biology experiment, we accept the significance level of 5%. In this buckwheat experiment, the p value was 0.00152 which was much smaller than 5% so we could accept our hypothesis and conclude that the buckwheat grown with salinity tend to have larger root: shoot ratio in length. This experiment result implies that for the buckwheat grown in salty area, it will grow stronger roots compared with the shoots. For the experimental group, the shoots just sprouted from the seeds with the length of around 3-4 mm. However, the buckwheat grown in the normal environment was very different. It grew the root system and shoot at the same speed as they were at a similar length. 

There are a few reasons that might explain these results. First of all, the addition of salt to the soil increased the ion concentration in the soil. Even though sodium is not generally required in large quantity for normal plants, chloride is an essential nutrient as it is noted especially for its role in helping plants processing photosynthesis, osmotic adjustment and suppression of plant diseases. So compared with the buckwheat grown in ordinary soil, those grown with more salt tend to spend more energy in developing roots as these plants compete to obtain more chloride for further use while growing. 

However, the root lengths for both groups were not same even though we add the same amount of solutions to each container. This might be the result that we did not run the experiment long enough to wait until all the plants to grow. Research shows buckwheat is able to grow, flower and accumulate more rutin under 200mM NaCl; moreover, the content of important nutrients in buckwheat was not affected by the high soil salinity [JinLin: 2013]. In the experiment, we used 3% concentration solution which is over 200mM. The result could possibly be due to the duration was too short to see the overall change. The estimated final result could be there is no general difference between the treatment and controll group since the nutrients will not be influenced much. Also, if we both get strong shoots and roots from the plant, we could also measure R:S ratio in weight as weight includes all the roots but length only includes the longest one. In this experiment we only measured the length because the shoots for the experimental group were too tiny to be weighed. 

As now we have learned a way to measure how plants allocate their energy for growth according to R:S ratio, we could apply this knowledge for agriculture or other plant industry. For example, if we plan to grow more leaves, then we could add specific component to the soil which decreases R:S ratio so that we could receive more shoots. On the other hand, we could also increase R:S ratio to have the roots more developed for further study.
