Title: Effects of Food on Intraspecific Behaviors for Male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Male Betta splendins, also known as the Siamese fighting fish or Betta fish, tend to be aggressive towards other male Betta fish. However, studies have shown that aggressive behavior towards their mirror images become mitigated when food is present. Therefore, it was hypothesized that if two male Betta fish are placed in the same tank with food, then they will retreat to the food and not display the most aggressive behavior known as “red mane.” When not given food, the fish expressed on average a longer duration of time for “red mane” than when presented with food. However, the results did not prove statistically significent. The discussion explains how animal behavior is not always guaranteed, animals can respond differently within set conditions. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins are known for their colorful bodies and aggressive behavior. Their aggressive behavior is initiated toward other males and displayed through a multitude of bodily signals. They have two main types of aggressive behavior movements: broadside and facing. During broadside movements, their side is turned to the threat and portray aggressive behaviors through moving certain fins or tails. Pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing are all examples of aggressive behaviors [Johnson, 2018]. For facing behaviors, the most threatening is a combination of protruding their pectoral fins and branchiostegal membrane, along with spreading their opercula. This creates what is known as a “red mane.” However, multiple test indicate that Betta fish will retreat these kinds of aggressive behaviors toward their mirror image (another male Betta fish) when food is presented [Bols: 1979][Hogan: 1974].  Aggressive behaviors are known as agnostic behaviors. Responses to these behaviors can vary. Their competitor can ignore it, flee, submit or escalate. Agonistic behaviors play a role in reproductive fitness. Therefore, it was hypothesized that if food is given in the presence of another male Betta fish, then they both should retreat to the presented food rather than continuing to express “red mane”. 

Materials and Method:
Four fish were set in two separate tanks, two fish in each, with dividers to separate each individual fish. First, both dividers were taken away so two male Betta fish would interact for three minutes with no food. The amount of time red mane was held was recorded along with the amount of times it was shown. Once the time was up, the dividers were placed in the tank again, separating both fish. Both sets of fish then took a five-minute break period.  Each pair had a total of two interactions. For the second interaction, a pinch of food was placed in both tanks once the dividers were lifted and the interaction was held and recorded for another three minutes until separation. A paired two tailed t_test was used to determine significance. 

Results:
As portrayed in Figure 1, the Betta fish who were not given food expressed cumulatively longer time for red mane. The average seconds for the controll group was 88.25±94.60 seconds. The average amount of times red mane was presented was 3±3.2 separate times within the three minutes. While the groups who were presented with food expressed red mane for 26.5±38.69 seconds. The average amount of times the red mane was presented was 2.5±3.3 separate occasions. However, the results for time in seconds were not statistically significent (d.f.:3, t-value: 1.778, p_value: 0.1734). Through observation, the first set of fish without food were very aggressive with one another and their tendency decreased when food was present for they were not as aggressive with food. The second set of fish, one of which displayed some aggression while the other did not. With the presence of food, neither showed red mane. However, the second fish in the second group who showed no signs of aggression throughout the total six minutes ate the most when the food was present in the last three minutes.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was rejected because although the time of aggressive behavior lowered, it was not a significent change in behavior for the Betta splendins once food was presented. The first set of fish were more active than the second, therefore, inferring that they may have been more naturally aggressive. The large standard deviation occurred because one fish never showed their red mane and its partner portrayed red mane fewer seconds than the other two fish in the separate tank. These results differ from Bols and Hogan’s experiments because although there was a decrease in aggressive behavior with the presence of food, our results were not statistically significent. Both experiments addressed how food deprivation played a factor in their fish’s behavior to retreat towards food rather than maintaining aggressive behaviors. The fish in this experiment were not deprived of food, therefore, were more likely not as hungry, hence, not as driven to retreat to food. The experiments also further explained that Betta fish prefer certain types of foods over others. In Hogan’s experiment, he provided brine shrimp whereas in this experiment gold.f.ish food was given. Therefore, there preference or dislike in food may have also influenced the Betta fish behaviors to not significently stop expressing aggressive behaviors. To further this experiment, one can not only deprive the fish of food, but also provide live worms as a food preference instead of shrimp or gold.f.ish food.
