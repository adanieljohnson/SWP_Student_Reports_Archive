Title: Caffeine effects on tetany and fatigue in Rania pipiens’ gastrocnemus muscle

Abstract:
Both the nervous system and the muscular system help to produce muscle contractions. When studying the muscles, it is important to know how certain drugs affect the contraction of the muscles. In this experiment we look at the effect of injecting caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs by comparing an experimental group injected with caffeine and a controll group without caffeine. The expectation of this experiment was that the experimental group would have a significently bigger difference in the V2-V1 voltage than the controll group due to the caffeine injection. The results showed that the average V2-V1 difference for the controll group was 0.616V, and the average V2-V1 difference for the experimental group was 1.357V. Based on visual and tactile observations, one could see and feel that the frog legs injected with caffeine contracted with much more force than the controll frog legs. The measurement of tetany in the experimental frog legs also confirmed the hypothesis. Our data and statistical paired t_test showed that the results were significent, indicating that our hypothesis was supported. Learning and researching more about how drugs like caffeine affect muscle contractions and induce tetany could give us a broader understanding of how the nervous system and the m

Introduction:
The nervous system and the muscular system work together to respond to internal and external environments. Both the muscular system and the nervous system work to produce muscle contractions. The skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates are made up of many myofibrils, and they are bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups. Nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, and acetylcholine is released, leading to a chain of events ending in a muscle contraction. In a process called temporal summation, a muscle contraction is elicited by the repeated stimulation of axons in a given motor unit [Lloyd: 1957]. This eventually leads to the muscle generating the maximum force possible, causing painful muscle cramps or spasms [Parisi: 2003]. When the muscle runs out of ATP, the actin-myosin bridges separate, and the muscles relax; this process is called fatigue. In this experiment, Rania Pipiens frog legs will be injected with caffeine at the gastrocnemus muscle in order to observe the effects of tetany and fatigue. Specifically, we will observe the difference between the controll group frog legs’ force exerted in a normal myogram (V2-V1) and the experimental group frog legs’ force exerted when injected with caffeine. We hypothesize that if frog legs are subjected to caffeine via gastrocnemus muscle injection, then the muscle response will be greater in the treated frog leg than in the untreated frog leg.  

Materials and Method:
	Three frog legs were obtained and kept moist throughout the experiment with Ringer’s solution. The computer program was set up according to the Bio Lab Manual, and all of the correct parameters were set. The skin was carefully peeled off of the frog leg, exposing the gastrocnemus muscle. The frog leg was pinned down with metal pins and tied to the stimulation set up with a string. The metal stimulator was poked into the gastrocnemus muscle and four normal myograms were recorded. Observations were made of what the leg looked like while stimulated and what the myograms looked like. The value of V2-V1 was recorded. Then 0.1Ml of 200mM caffeine was injected into the frog leg and 5 seconds worth of myograms were taken. The differences between the normal myograms and the myograms with caffeine were observed and recorded. The value of V2-V1 was recorded. A paired t_test was performed on the recorded data. The same procedure was carried out with the remaining two frog legs.  

Results:
After the experiment was completed, it was observed that frog legs injected with caffeine showed different responses than the controll frog legs through the data collected as well as visual and tactile observation. One saw that the muscle contracted with much more force than the controll group, and through touching the muscle one could feel how hard it contracted compared to the controll group. In the experimental group, the myograms eventually trailed off from the peak contraction point. The V2-V1 values for the normal myograms had a lower average (0.616V) compared to the averaged V2-V1 value of the experimental myograms (1.357V). The p_value was calculated to be 0.048. Figure 1 shows the average difference of the gastrocnemus response between the controll and experimental groups.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that if Rania Pipiens frog legs are subjected to a caffeine injection in the gastrocnemus muscle, the force generated in terms of V2-V1 will be greater than the force a contraction without caffeine will produce, was supported by the results of this experiment. The paired t_test calculated a value of 0.048, which implies that the results were significent because it is less than 0.05. A paired t_test value under 0.05 implies that these results were not due to chance, but rather due to a correlation between caffeine and muscle contractions. Based on our observations of the muscle by touching it and looking at it, it can be inferred that the muscle went through tetany and then fatigue after being injected with caffeine. By looking at the myograms, the fatigue can be seen after injecting caffeine, implying that the drug affects the strength of the muscle contractions. Caffeine is a drug that has stimulant properties [Fisone: 2004], so it is reasonable to hypothesize that injecting it into a frog’s muscle will stimulate muscle contractions and eventually induce tetany and then fatigue, like this experiment demonstrated. According to studies, when caffeine is introduced to animals it induces tetany of the muscles and exaggerated tremors, and fatigue [Maloney: 1935]. Caffeine blocks calcium from reentering the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which means that actin cannot unbind from myosin, leading to sustained muscle contractions and tetany. Caffeine impacts the neuromuscular system, and consequently directly impacts action potentials down to muscle contractions [Lopes: 1983]. Further research can help understand how caffeine affects the body; in the future, studies on drugs such as caffeine and their effects on muscle response could further understanding of how both the nervous system and the muscular system function.
