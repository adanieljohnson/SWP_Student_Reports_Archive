Title: Effect of Tubocurarine on the Maximum Threshold of Leopard Frog Gastrocnemius

Abstract:
Tubocurarine is a neuromuscular blocker derived from curare and has been the subject of many experiments and questions within the scientific community. In this lab, our goal was to determine the effects tubocurarine had on the threshold stimulus of muscle, particularly the gastrocnemius of the Northern Leopard Frog (Rana pipiens). Using three frog legs, we would remove the skin and use a stimulator the stimulate the muscle of each leg until we reached the maximum threshold, and then doing this again with each frog leg after injecting the muscle with tubocurarine. We had hypothesized that the maximum threshold stimulus of each frog leg after being injected with tubocurarine would be lower than it was before the injection, and our results supported this hypothesis with statistical significance. To find more detailed results on tubocurarine, this experiment could be repeated with varying levels of tubocurarine, and/or tested on different muscles to have a more thorough understanding of the blocker and its effects.

Introduction:
 A muscle twitch consists of these 4 steps: 1. Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. 2. ACh binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. 3. The action potential spreads through the fiber, stimulating the release of Ca2+ from the internal storage site (the sarcoplasmic reticulum) 4. And finally, the release of Ca2+ activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. In this lab, we sought to discover the effects a chemical called tubocurarine on the maximum twitch threshold of the gastrocnemius of a leopard frog (Rana pipiens). Tubocurarine is neuromuscular blocker that in the past [Colquhon:1979] this experiment has led scientists to believe that tubocurarine has a competitive blocking action and an additional voltage dependent blocking action. It is believed that tubocurarine would cause the muscle to not twitch in reaction to stimulus [Katz:1967]. We hypothesize that the introduction of tubocurarine to the gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens will lower the voltage of the threshold stimulus of that muscle.

Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, we would first obtain a frog leg and carefully remove the skin, trying not to use metal tools to do so. Then we isolate the gastrocnemius and cut it at one end by the Achilles tendon, retaining as much of the tendon as possible. We then tie a string to the end of the muscle and attach it to the apparatus, bringing the muscle to a 90-degree angle with the dissection plate, making sure to pin down the rest if the leg as well.
To determine the threshold stimulus of the gastrocnemius:
1.	Click the stimulator preferences icon on the Labscribe toolbar and check that the values are set to:
-	Pulse amp should be 0.000 V
-	Number of pulses should be 1
-	Frequency (f(Hz)) should be 1
-	Pulse width should be 5 ms 
2.	Type 0.000 V in the Mark box and, making sure to press apply, click record to stimulate the nerve with 0.000 V
3.	Change the stimulus amp to 0.1 V and click the apply button to affect the change in amplitude.
4.	Determine the threshold voltage for direct muscle stimulation by increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1 V increments 
-	Record and mark muscle responses
-	Save data file
5.	After determining the control threshold, inject the gastrocnemius in multiple places with 0.1 mL of tubocurarine, letting the muscle rest for 5 minutes before repeating steps 1-4
6.	Run a matched pairs t-test to compare the results 


Results:
 Our results showed that in three trials with a frog leg in each trial being used as the both control and then the treatment results, the threshold stimulus for the treated frog legs was lower than that of the frog legs when they had not been injected with tubocurarine [Figure 1]. When running a matched pairs t test for the threshold stimulus, we found that the difference between the control and treatment stimulus was statistically significant (t-stat = 4.4205, df = 2, P = 0.0476).

Discussion:
  Our results allowed us to reject the null hypothesis and support our alternative hypothesis that the injection tubocurarine of tubocurarine would cause a decrease in the threshold stimulus of the gastrocnemius of a Northern Leopard Frog. This makes sense since tubocurarine is a known neuromuscular blocker [Colquhoun: 1979], and logically this would mean that a muscle affected by this blocker would have a decreased reaction to stimulus. Tubocurarine is even believed to, in certain amounts, completely block any twitch in the muscle in reaction to stimulus [Katz:1967], so it would have been more abnormal if the results had not turned out the way they did. It is also important to note that our results were statistically significant lower values [Figure 1.], and not simply different, since this implies it could be lower or higher. Further implications of this study are that tubocurarine could be helpful in anesthesiology [Gray:1946], prevent patients who have been put under from having muscle spasms that could cause potentially fatal complications. In the future it would be beneficial to repeat this experiment with more trials and varying amounts of tubocurarine in order to gain a more overarching and detailed view of its effects.
