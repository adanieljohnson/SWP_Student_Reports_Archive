Title: The Effects of Acetylcholine Inhibitor on the Muscle Contractions

Abstract:
Many organisms have the ability to sense and respond to the actions and events occurring in their environments. This happens through the functions of nerves and muscles. Without the neuromuscular systems, the bodies of organisms will have a harder time with responds to situations. 

In this experiment, the objective was to determine whether tetany would be reached at a lower frequency using the sciatic nerve when the gastrocnemius muscle was with injected with acetylcholine inhibitor in comparison to the control group. Using three different frog legs that acted as its own control and treatment  group, the sciatic nerve was used to determine the frequency in which tetany was reached. The prediction made was that tetany would be reached at a lower frequency with the acetylcholine inhibitor compared to the control group. The statistical evidence used was the p-values. The p-values that were calculated showed that our data is insignificant. 


Introduction:
The Rana pipen is a wide-ranged species. The location in which it is found ranges from a broad swath of territory from the Hudson Bay south to northern Virginia, and to the west as far as southern British Columbia and eastern Washington and Oregon [Fryer: 2004]. 

The gastrocnemius muscle allows the frog to jump from place to place. The skeletal muscles consist of thousands of myofibers. The individual myofibers are bound together by connective tissues to form functional groups, which are the skeletal muscles proper [Johnson: 2018]. The skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, which have axons that extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers called neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. The nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction causes [the] release the of acetylcholine (ACh), which binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening the sodium channels [Johnson: 2018]. This allows the generation of action potentials with the muscle fiber, causing the release of Ca+2. If the sodium channels remain open over a period of time, the muscles will keep contracting and eventually tire itself out. This can possibly be achieved by temporarily blocking the conduction of signals through extraneous fibers [Joseph 2011]. To test this theory, we hypothesized that if acetylcholinesterase inhibitor prevents acetylcholine from breaking down and has sodium channels open and constantly flows in, it will keep the muscle in constant contraction, and then the muscle will reach tetany at a lower frequency (Hz). 


Materials and Methods:
In this lab, we had three different frog legs given to us in a dissecting pan. Each frog leg acted as its own control and treatment group. We first removed the skin on the legs with our bare hands and a napkin, which helped with getting a stronger grip on the slippery skin. Once the skin was removed, we tore the skin, starting at the top of the leg towards the foot. Then we used a dissecting probe to gently separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. This revealed the white sciatic nerve. We then set up the leg on the stimulator with the sciatic nerve lying on the stimulator electrodes. We followed exercise three for the remainder of the experiment. We connected BNC connector to the computer. For the first control leg, we set up the amplitude to 1 and the pulse to 0. We set the first frequency to 6 and applied the frequency to the sciatic nerve. On the computer, we determined the type of wave of wave it was: incomplete tetany or tetany. We increased the frequency by 2 until the muscle contraction reached tetany then stopped. Without moving the sciatic nerve, we had 0.1 mL sevin, an acetylcholine inhibitor, drawn into a syringe and expelled in the gastrocnemius muscle. We waited five minutes for the inhibitor to diffuse into the muscle. We then started again with an amplitude of 1 and a pulse of 0. The frequency was set to 6 and was increased by 2 until tetany was reached. This process was repeated for the last two frog legs as well. As the experiment was occuring, we took down observation notes of whether tetany or incomplete tetany was reached at each frequency. To determine if there was any significant numbers, we used the paired-t-test sample.  


Results:
For the frequency of the first leg, the control had a frequency of 20 and the treatment had a frequency of 16. For the second leg, the control had a frequency of 22 and the treatment had a frequency of 20. For leg three, the control had a frequency of 18 and the treatment had a frequency of 20. The statistical p-value we calculated was 1.67*10^-6.


Discussion:
The application of high-frequency alternating current waveforms on peripheral nerves has been found to be a potential clinical method for blocking conduction of action potentials through nervesâ€¦ [Joseph 2011]. However, our hypothesis, that if acetylcholinesterase inhibitor prevents acetylcholine from breaking down and has sodium channels open and constantly flows in, it will keep the muscle in constant contraction, and then the muscle will reach tetany at a lower frequency, was rejected. From all the three groups of controlled, the frequency at which tetany was reached was between 18-22. For treatment, tetany was reached between the frequencies of 16 and 20.  From this data, it can be inferred that the data was insignificant. The frequencies between the controlled and treatment were in close numbers. However, there were some errors committed. During the first leg experiment, we used the thigh muscle instead of the sciatic nerve to reach tetany. So, we had to redo the experiment again. This probably caused the muscle to reach tetany faster in both control and treatment group because the muscles were probably already tired for the first failed attempt. Another possible error was not being able to determine complete tetany, so we continued at a higher frequency just to make sure complete tetany was reached. This experiment not only gives us a better insight on the sciatic nerve, but it lets us know the effects and consequences when the sodium channels are left open. In humans, the partial nerve injury is the main cause of causalgiform pain disorders in humans [Seltzer: 1990]. From this experiment, we can figure out which frequency tetany is reached and find ways to prevent the muscle from reaching tetany.
