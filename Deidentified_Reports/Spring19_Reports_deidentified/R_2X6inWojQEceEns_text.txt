Title: The effect of A23187 due to increased stimulation on voltage output

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment is to find whether there is a direct connection between increasing Ca+2 by a calcium activator to the voltage it outputs seen on the gastrocnemus muscle on the Rania Pipien. The role of calcium ions are important to muscle contraction as once the action potential is carried out throughout the fiber, Ca+2 is released causing the muscle fiber to shorten. Six trials were conducted in this experiment consisting of three controll and three experimental groups to determine if there is a significent change between not having calcium activator to having a calcium activator.  This experiment found no statistical evidence to support this claim, which would require further testing to conclude whether there is a direct connection.

Introduction:
The Northern Leopard Frog scientifically known as the Rania Pipien, is a mixture of a green and brownish frog with dark round spots on its back. Rania Pipiens are vertebrates, and like most vertebrates and invertebrates, several thousands of myofibrils are needed to create functional groups to maintain its skeletal muscles [Moo: 2017]. Skeletal muscles consist of motor neurons which extend and eventually join at neuromuscular junctions, which allows for nerve impulses to be carried out in order to release acetylcholine (ACh). ACh then will bind to a receptor, which opens sodium channels to create action potentials that then spreads through the entire length of muscle fiber.

The muscle is able to shorten when Ca+2 is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to the activation of the contractile mechanism, which allows for the re-uptake of Ca+2 to enter back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum causing the shortening [Cota: 1984]. In this experiment, a myogram was used to detect muscle contractions. A myogram is a visual recording of all the stages within a single muscle twitch. 

During the myogram, there are three distinct phases: latent, contraction, and relaxation periods. The latent period begins initially until the start of the contraction, which leads to the contraction period. In the contraction period, the muscles shorten due to the changes within the fibers leading to the relaxation period, which allows for the muscle to return to its normal length. We hypothesize that an increase in calcium via a calcium activator will increase the voltage of the muscle.


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, three Rania Pipien legs were used to compare the change of voltage due to a controll and experimental group at the gastrocnemus muscle. In our experiment setup, we isolated the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipien to test the nerve function of the leg to see the effects of stimulation before reaching tetanus. The sciatic nerve was then attached to electrodes, and the gastrocnemus muscle was rigged to a force transducer. Six trials were conducted using three legs. The three legs were first used as the three trial controll groups before injecting 0.1Ml of concentration for the additional three experimental groups. The controll group received no calcium activator whereas the experimental group used the calcium activator A23187 at a concentration of 100mM. These recordings are collected by connecting the gastrocnemus muscle to the force transducer and observing the voltage output based on the inputted stimulations (amperes). The paired two-sample T-test was used to compare and analyze the difference between the controll and experimental groups to determine whether there is a significent change.


Results:
The p_value found by the paired t- test was 0.188, which is not a significent outcome in concluding that adding calcium activator will increase the voltage output. Many of the values fell within similar margins, and could not therefore support our hypothesis that a calcium activator will increase the voltage output. 

Discussion:
In our experiment, our group hypothesized that the addition of a calcium activator, A23187 would cause a dramatic increase in voltage outputs compared to receiving no calcium activator. Our null hypothesis was rejected indicating that there was no statistical data that could support our hypothesis. 

One of the reasons that contributes to our data not showing much of a difference is that the values were very similar between experiment and controll groups. The A23187 did not have much of an effect on muscle contraction due to the conditions not being as favorable. One study found that A23187 was more effective at a lower concentration than we used in our experiment [Zou: 2001]. 
The results of each controll group could be due to the sensitivity that was observed between each legs. The more sensitive legs (Leg #1 and slightly Leg #2) were more responsive in leading more consistent values whereas Leg #3 was less responsive. This could be due to human error of slightly misplacing the force transducer on the gastrocnemus muscle, which could have yielded different results. Another human error could be not effectively using the Ringer’s solution when needed. Leg #3 was the final leg to be tested, and we probably did not use the Ringer’s solution on the leg until it was time to hook it to the transducers. 

If this experiment were to be replicated, the legs chosen should have similar controll groups before adding the calcium activator. This will provide favorable results in order to draw a correlation between whether or not the calcium activator will increase the voltage output. Also, it would be helpful to have three people conducting the trials on the myogram simultaneously. This will reduce the chances of legs being dehydrated from the lack in Ringer’s solution. Future areas of study should consider whether the calcium activator injection concentration can be increased or decreased to find if there is an optimal concentration of Ca+2 that will affect the voltage in the experiment group [Cota: 1984].
