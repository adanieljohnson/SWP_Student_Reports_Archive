Title: Effect of Caffeine on [Rania pipien] Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
Caffeine, one of the most popular drugs in the world, has the ability to create large changes in the way muscle contractions occur. Specifically, the result caffeine has on Ca2+  and other ions involved in excitation¬–contraction coupling was observed during experimentation. In this lab, this effect of caffeine was looked at in [Rania pipien] legs, specifically the gastrocnemus muscle. By running various trials of stimulating the frog leg both before and after injection of caffeine, it was found that caffeine increased the response amplitude of muscle contractions. 

Introduction:
The somatic neuromuscular system is broken down into many levels in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Both have groups of cells, called myofibers, which are multi-nuclear and cylindrical, and bound by connective tissues. A muscle contraction is stimulated by nerves, which causes changes to acetylcholine and Ca2+concentrations in the cell. With this stimulation, acetylcholine will bind to receptors on the muscle and cause both Ca2+ and Na+ to enter the cell through their specific channels, resulting in depolarization [Johnson: 2016]. This depolarization then causes an action potential within the cell resulting in an influx of Ca2+ which then travels to the actin and myosin filaments within the muscle. These are two different proteins responsible for the contraction of muscles. When the Ca2+ reaches these filaments it activates them, causing contraction of the stimulated muscle. This process is known as excitation–contraction coupling [Kuo: 2015]. To look at and better understand this process, the leg of a [Rania pipien] was used. This is a species also known as the northern leopard frog, which originated from Newfoundland and southern Quebec, and is in the genus Lithobatis [Stebbins: 2003]. 

It is a goal to discover what the effect of caffeine would be on the process during this lab. Caffeine is a drug extremely popular everywhere that acts as a stimulant to the central nervous system. Caffeine has also been said to result in the improvement of physical activity, for it has a direct effect on the skeletal muscle. This is because it has been found that high concentrations of caffeine are able to increase the amount of Ca2+ that is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during excitation–contraction coupling [Tallis; 2015]. Using this information, it is hypothesized that when injected with caffeine, the response amplitude recorded for the gastrocnemus muscle of a [Rania pipien] leg will increase compared to the response amplitude if no caffeine is injected into the muscle. 


Materials and Method:
Three different frog legs were obtained and then skinned in order to reveal the frog thigh, sciatic nerve, and gastrocnemus muscle. Each leg was then cut in between the gastrocnemus muscle and the tibialis anterior muscle, leaving some of the Achilles tendon attached to the cut gastrocnemus muscle. A string was then tied around the Achilles tendon, and the gastrocnemus muscle was hung from a transducer which was connected to a computer, and a stimulus probe was also connected to the computer. This stimulus probe was put directly into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg. The computer used a software called Labscribe 3 by iWorx. This system allowed impulses to be sent to the muscle through the stimulus probe, and was able to record the response amplitude, in volts, of the muscle to the stimulation amplitudes. Once this was set up, a stimulation amplitude was chosen based on the threshold found for each frog leg. The stimulation amplitude was set at 0.5 volts throughout the experiment. First, each frog leg was used as a controll, injected with nothing, and was stimulated at 0.5 volts three times, and these values were averaged. Next, one by one, each frog leg was connected to the set up and the recording on the computer began. Once this recording started, 0.1 Ml of caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle and three impulses were sent to the muscle with a stimulation amplitude of 0.5 volts. The three values were recorded for each frog leg and were averaged. In order to analyze the data through statistical testing, a Paired T-Test was done.

Results:
There was a significent difference between the controll frog legs and the frog legs injected with caffeine. The d.f.=2 and p=0.0549. The response amplitude was much smaller for the controll group, averaging at 0.734 volts, compared to the group injected with caffeine, averaging at 1.638 volts (see table 1). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the frog legs injected with caffeine would have stronger contractions was supported by the data collected. A significent difference was observed between the group before being injected with caffeine (controll), and the group after being injected with caffeine (treatment), as p=0.0549. Before injection of caffeine, the mean response of the [Rania pipiens] gastrocnemus muscle was significently lower than the mean response of the same muscle after caffeine injection directly into that muscle. These results suggest that caffeine had a strong effect on the strength of muscle contraction in [Rania pipiens]. This is most likely due to the effect caffeine has on Ca2+ during a muscle contraction. This is because the contraction in muscles is due, in part, to the Ca2+ leaving the sarcoplasmic reticulum and flowing into the actin and myosin filaments. When more Ca2+ is present during this process, it can allow for stronger and more intense contractions to occur, hence the significent rise in response amplitude seen as caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus. 

A similar study was done on mice that looked at the effect of caffeine on calcium concentration and the muscle force associated with the calcium changes induced by caffeine. Similarly, to the results found within this experiment, it was found that caffeine increased the tension within the muscle of the mice. These results are consistent with our studies, and therefore support the claim that caffeine increases Ca2+ concentration and therefore contraction strength of muscles [Allen: 1995].

In the future, this experiment could be used to further research the role caffeine may have on enhancing physical performance. Muscle contraction is extremely important in physical activities, and starting at a small level, such as [Rania pipien] legs, it was found that its increased contraction strength. This information can be used to assess how caffeine consumption may play a role in humans’ enhancement of physical ability.
