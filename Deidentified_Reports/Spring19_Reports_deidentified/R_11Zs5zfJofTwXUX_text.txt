Title: The Physiological Impacts of Insect Growth Hormones

Abstract:
Research in the insect growth continuous to bring notice in discussion regarding insect protection considering their value in the ecosystem. With intense curiosity to find better ways to alter the physiology of insects, without the need of pesticides, lab continues to occur to decrease their harmful ability. Here, this lab experiments the effects of insect growth hormones on how they might affect the Manduca sexta. The expectation or hypothesis of the lab is that if the Manduca sexta is treated with the IGR levels in its diet, it will not grow normally as the control group. While the observations showed some differences, our data calculation showed that there was no difference or impact by the hormones; hence the differences might have been by chance. The Control and Treatment grew relatively at the same rate until the control caterpillar started their metamorphosis while the treatment continued to grow as larvae. With more experiments, more knowledge can be discovered.

Introduction:
This lab experiment is about studying the life cycle of a Manduca sexta. The M. sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths and skippers [Johnson:2018]. For this lab, the experimentation on the moths. While the life cycle of a M. sexta can vary in the outdoors depending on the quality of the conditions and the type of diet they are exposed to [Johnson:2018][Reinecke:1980]. The lab experiment develops the moths in a constant condition and constant diet of food. There are two types of life cycle. First, there is the Holometabolous life cycle whose life cycle has four major stages: Egg, Larvae, Pupa and Adult. The other type is the Hemimetabolous life cycle which identifies with three stages: Egg, Larvae and Adult [Johnson:2018][Reinecke:1980]. This lab is interested in the Holometabolous of which the experimented Manduca belongs. The life cycle starts with eggs that transition to the larvae stage. The larvae, in this groups, is called “caterpillar” [Johnson:2018][Reinecke:1980]. The larvae go through five transition phases, named as 1st instar larva, then the 2nd instar up to the 5th instar larva. During these instar phases, the Manduca’s ability with the Molting mechanism is critical. During each instar, the Manduca grows larger, so Molting is the process by which the Manduca shades off its older cuticle to create a new outer layer that supports its new body[Johnson:2018]. The cuticle outlier is more like the ‘skin’. After the five larvae stages, the Metamorphosis stage commences; this is the M. sexta’s transition from the “worm-like larvae stage to the pupa stage” [Johnson:2018 ][Reinecke:1980]. The metamorphosis phase activates the extraordinary reorganization of the M sexta’s internal and external body structure. The adult stage makes the end of the metamorphosis.
Before the larva-pupal stage, the commitment pulse must come into play; this is a mark signal that lets the caterpillar aware that it is large enough, and ready with enough stored nutrients to start pupating and develop into an adult moth [Johnson:2018][Reinecke:1980][ Weeks:1986]. Hormones play a huge role. Juvenile Hormones (JH) is one of the three major hormones that control the development of insects, the other two being the Ecdysterone (20E) and the Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH) [Johnson:2018][ Jesudason:1990][Staal:1975]. The JH are produced in different forms, but most of them act same. The JH is crucial in the growth of insects as it regulates the types of molt (skin) during development of the life cycle, plus the hormone continues to regulate other functions when the insects are in adult stages.
During this phase, the growth hormone levels of JH drop to a critical low point while simultaneously the 20E levels rise high, as for the commitment pulse to be activated. This experiment test on what happen to the caterpillars when the growth hormones, JH, are kept from dropping.
For the past decades, farmers have solely relied on direct toxic agents, pesticides, to address issues with insects and pests [Johnson:2018][Isman:2008][Schneider:2004]. However, considering the importance of insects to the ecosystem, the discovery of “Insect Growth Regulators (IGR)” has led researchers to experiment ways to alter the physiology development of insect through reducing their survival period rather than toxically annihilating them [Johnson:2018][Schneider:2004].
The hypothesis of this lab is that if the Manduca sexta is treated with JH, the IGR, levels in its diet, it will not experience the commitment pulse hence it will not grow normally as the control group.


Materials and Methods:
All the instruments, food and test subjects (larvae) were provided by the lab supervisor. Two 4-cell containers, with lids, were selected. One container was for the control group and the other for the treatment group, 3 young larvae were hosted in each container, in their cells. On the top sides of the containers, holes were drilled through to allow air circulation. The Manduca sexta food was kept in a fridge for preservation. 70g of the food was collected and stirred in a square box until it reaches room temperature. On a balance, 3 sets of 10g of food were measured for the ‘control’ group. Each 10g was given 5 drops of distilled water, mixed and put in the Control group container. The 3 young larvae’s were weighted and put in their separate cells with their food in the container. The whole process is repeated for the ‘Treatment’ group, except that 5 drops of IGR were also added to the 10g food. The IGR is the reagent hormone, JH, that was tested on the larvae throughout the lab. The cells for the larvae were numbered 1, 2, 3 to keep track of the individual subject’s growth. 
For every other day, the food preparation and weight measurements were repeated accordingly with fresh new diet but same food. The environment was controlled with keeping the containers in an incubator that was 25℃ and systematically controlled that the light inside was on for 12 hours and off for another 12 hours.
For every checkup, the observations were recorded down on the note book, pictures and video




Results:
The #2 cell larvae for both the control and treatment group did not eat in the first days, therefore they were the smallest and weighing less. But by day 7 of the experiment, they had caught up with the rest and one of the heaviest among the groups. Visually, the larvae from both groups maintained their light green color until day 7, it was the color of one larva from the control group had started to change to yellow and on average the control group more of their food and weighted about a pound more than the treatment group. Through days, the inside back of the larvae became more visible, and there a cliff-like structure that opened and closed at a steady rate. On day 9, while the Treatment group continued to feed and increased in weight, their movement progressively slowed down; the control group also were very less active and some of them like #3 were losing weight and turning more yellow. 
In addition, in the last days of the experiment the larger larvae (#1s) were more aggressive, but overall during check ups the larvae were more active when taken out of their box during refills of their food. Another interesting is that the #3 in the treatment suddenly started changing to black; while it was still growing in size its cuticle started gaining dark spots that increased daily.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if the Manduca sexta is treated with the IGR levels in its diet, it will not grow normally as the control group, was not supported because the treatment group did not transition to pupa stage. This implies that the commitment pulse was not activated. There was no significant difference in the growth of both the control and treatment groups.
The caterpillars were alive throughout the whole experiment with one caterpillar from the control group transition to the pupa stage by day 14. Since the treatment group showed no sign of pupation, this means that the IGR was effective, even though both the control and treatment groups were initially growing at the same rate.
We failed to reject the null hypothesis because our p-value was 0.46. This means there is high chance that our results were due to chance, hence the IGR hormones made no difference. However, this contradicts the observation which showed growth difference between the Control and Treatment groups.
The yellowish color that was observed in the control indicated pupation was stating since there was less movement and the larvae started eating less hence weighing less (fig.1). In comparison on larva (#3) from the treatment was turned black while still growing. On conclusion could be that the larva’s body was rejecting the transition.
The open-close cliff inside the back side of the larvae was critical in identifying if the larva was dead or alive; for example #3, of Control group, did not move at all but with ‘cliff’ active, it was confirmation that the pupation had started for it.
Another observation is that the caterpillars were more active outside the box. This means the larva environment, living inside a container affected their, this logically makes due the lack of abundance oxygen with air circulation and lack of natural sunlight exposure.
In conclusion, with more repeated experiment a better trend on the impact of hormones can be achieved.
