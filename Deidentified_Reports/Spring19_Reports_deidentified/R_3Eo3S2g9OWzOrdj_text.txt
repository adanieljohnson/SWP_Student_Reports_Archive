Title: Additional Juvenile Hormone Effects on Weight of Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
Different hormones in specific amounts will affect organisms in various ways -- some harmful and some productive. A set of 8 manduca sexta were tested in an experiment to find if Juvenile Hormone (JH) given orally in food would affect the amount of growth. To do so, a controll group was given food with two drops of water; whereas, the treatment group was given two drops of 1 Gregulator 1: 1250 (JH). Researchers evaluated the weight differences from the controll and treatment groups. The idea was that the treatment group would have a greater difference in growth from day 1 to 14 than the controll group. The statistical data did not supported the hypothesis and showed that the treatment group did not have a significently greater amount of growth on average. 


Introduction:

Manduca Sexta are a tobacco hornworm that progress through a holometabolous life cycle, which includes a pupation stage, resulting in a moth. The Manduca Sexta’s lifecycle begins as an egg, normally between 1-1.4 mg and through the first to fifth instar larvae stages they grow to typically weigh around 11 grams before transforming to the pupa stage. Normally the life cycle is completed as a moth after around 39-48 days. They begin as small, soft-bodied larvae that take on a vermiform, worm-like, figure. Once the Manduca Sexta has achieved the pupal stage, there is very little movement that occurs and is sometimes enclosed in a sort of cocoon or protective covering. The main factor during the pupation stage is that the Manduca Sexta requires molting where the epidermal skin cells shed the old layer and form a new outer layer, called a cuticle.  When it has completed the mutation, the adult Manduca Sexta emerges from cocoon with functional reproductive organs, wings, and takes on the shape and function of a moth. The entire process of development is controllled by hormones present in the Manduca Sexta’s body. Ecdysterone controlls the timing of molting during development and some of the adult processes and functions. Juvenile Hormone controlls the type of molt that occurs during development. The brain gets signals from nerve pathways that are controllled by hormones, and in return, the brain sends signals to the body to begin the transformation. The Manduca Sextas normally have three main hormones that work together: Prothoracicotropic (PTTH) or Brain Hormone (BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). The PTTH regulated the release of ecdysterone by their prothoracic glands. The Manduca Sexta may be affected by a growth hormone, Juvenile Hormone (JH), which controlls the type of molt during Manduca Sexta development, as well as regulates multiple other developmental functions. Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone must work together or else the Manduca Sexta will die because the two hormones together controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis, which is required for Manduca Sexta survival. Normally, the JH levels remain high but there are two dips, where 20E increases, and during the second rise in 20E, called the commitment pulse, the Manduca Sexta is ready to ready to pupate. Research has shown that Juvenile Hormone is known to delay metamorphosis while regulating embryonic development [Belles: 2005]. In order to test the idea that metamorphosis is delayed and embryonic development is increased, when given 2 drops of 1 Gregulator 1: 1250 (JH) per 10 grams of food, the Manduca Sexta should develop more quickly than the  controll group. 


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca Sexta were used in order to evaluate the effects that the JH had. The eight Manduca Sexta were split into two groups: controll and treatment. Having 4 in each group would allow to have different results to average and find a general trend from each. 80 g of food was weighed out and then split evenly to two groups of 40 g, one for the controll group and one for the treatment group. The 40 g samples were then split evenly into 4 sections weighing 10 g each.  With this food separated out, each group received 10 grams of food that was pre-made in the lab. The controll group’s food had 2 drops of water per 10 grams of food. The treatment group’s food had 2 drops of 1 Gregulator 1: 1250 (JH) per 10 grams of food. The reason each group got two drops was to keep consistency in how wet the food was so that only the JH added was the independent variable. The treatment group received 2 drops of JH in order to test if they would increase or decrease growth prior to pupation. In order to test the results once the experiment concluded, the two-sample t_test was used because there were two distinct groups -- controll and treatment-- to evaluate since they all started at different weights. Due to this, the two-sample t_test would be the most accurate to compare the data.


Results:
Observations showed that, in general, the Manduca Sexta seemed to progressively grow and gain weight up until a certain point where they then lost weight. As they started losing weight, they also stopped consuming food and defecating. In some of the Manduca Sexta, a liquid was projected out of their bodies as well. In general, the treatment group, at an average of 7.2625 g increase, showed a larger difference in growth than the controll group, at an average of 6.3075 g increase, as shown in Figure 1. Based on the two-sample t_test results, the sample was not significently different as the data showed (t-value = 0.968, degrees of freedom = 6, two-tailed p_value: 0.370). 


Discussion:
The Manduca Sexta that were given 1 Gregulator 1: 1250 JH had a larger average growth than the Manduca Sexta in the controll group that received no special treatment. When looking at both groups, the Manduca Sexta all gained weight and then lost weight towards the end of the measurement period. Towards the end of the measurement period, many of the Manduca Sexta expelled a murky liquid. By day 10, all but one of the Manduca Sexta lost weight, as they were eating very little of the food they were given. When this occurred, the treatment group was not taking in any additional JH. Many of them ended up turning a greyish-brown color with little movement. By day 14, all the Manduca Sexta appeared lethargic with a pungent smell expelled from the controll group. Based on the t_test result of greater than 0.5, the experiment failed to reject the null hypothesis. There was not enough of a significent difference to determine that 2 drops of JH had effect on the Manduca Sexta. The hypothesis that the Manduca Sexta that were given JH had a larger average difference in growth than the controll group was not supported from the data collected. The JH allowed the treatment group to grow a slightly greater amount overall, but did not delay the beginning of mutation by very much as all of the Manduca Sexta appeared very similar towards the end of the study. Other studies are now focusing on the synthesis of different forms of JH in order to evaluate the most effective type, structure, and amount of JH that will be beneficial for Manduca Sexta [Belles: 2005]. In order to evaluate the amount of JH that will allow the Manduca Sexta to continue to grow more without being harmed by the JH, more studies should be conducted using varying amounts of drops of JH.
