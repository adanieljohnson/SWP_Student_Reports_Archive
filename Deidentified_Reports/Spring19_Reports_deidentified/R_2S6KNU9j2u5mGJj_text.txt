Title: The aggressive behavior of Betta splendens in warm and cool water temperature

Abstract:
Betta splendens male fish are aggressive fish that will show certain behaviors when in the presence of other males in order to win mates, food, or territory. We studied the aggressive behavior of the betta fish in warm water and cool water to see if the temperature of the water had any effect on the fish’s behavior. We predicted that the fish would be less aggressive in cool temperatures. We found that the fish were significantly more aggressive in the warm water tank versus the cool water tank. These results show us that the temperature of the water does affect the fish’s behavior, so the fish would behave differently in a different environment than it is used to. 

Introduction:
Betta splendens fish show intraspecific behaviors to each other to display aggressiveness. This can be in order to win mates, get food, or claim their territory. A betta fish will perform broadside and facing movements in order to show their aggressiveness. We will be studying the broadside movement of the Betta showing an erect pectoral fin, where the fish’s pectoral fin opens and closes. We will also be studying the facing movement of showing their red mane [Johnson: 2018]. We will be comparing these behaviors at warmer and cooler temperatures. A study found the ideal temperature for betta fish to be 24 degrees Celsius [Kuhn: 1970]. One study found that a higher temperature (31.5 degrees Celsius) will increase behavior in goldfish [Nowicki: 2012]. We predict that the betta will be less aggressive in the cooler water because it will decrease the betta’s blood flow, and the fish will not expend as much energy fighting as it normally would. 

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, get two male Betta splendens fish and put them into separate parts of a tank with water at 19 degrees Celsius. Let the Betta fish look at each other through glass panels in the tank for 5 minutes. During this period, count the number of times the Betta had erect pectoral fins and an exposed red mane and time how long each of these behaviors last for. After the 5-minute period, let the fish rest for approximately 5 minutes while setting up a tank with cooler water (approximately 15 degrees Celsius). Again, let the fish look at each other through glass panels in the tank and measure how long the fish shows an erect pectoral fin or an exposed red mane. Repeat this procedure with 4 different fish (2 more groups). In order to quantify these aggressive behaviors, an erect pectoral fin gets a score of 1, and an exposed red mane gets a score of 2. Multiply this value for the amount of time each of these behaviors was shown by the fish. If the fish showed neither of these behaviors, they would receive a score of 0. To analyze the data, use a paired t-test. 



Results:
The difference in aggressiveness was significant in warmer water than in cooler water (t-stat: 3.6699, df= 5, p=0.014). The Betta fish was, on average, more aggressive in warmer water, where the average aggressiveness score was 290.67 +/- 152.7. The average aggressiveness score in cold water was 106.83 +/- 145.99. Five out of the six fish displayed aggressive behavior in the warm water, whereas only three out of the six fish displayed aggressive behavior in the cold water. The fish in the cooler water seemed like they were too uncomfortable to fight or show any aggressive behavior. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by the data, where we believed that the fish in warmer water would be more aggressive than the fish in cool water. The cool water could have slowed down the fish’s metabolism and made it less likely to expend energy attacking and would rather expend the energy trying to stay warm. Our results are similar to those found in a previous study, where behavior increased with an increased temperature [Nowicki: 2012]. Our fish were less active than they were in the previous week, so doing the experiment a week after they had originally fought could have affected our results because the fish were much more tired this week than they were the week before.

Figure 1. Betta splendens were placed into warm water and cool water, and their aggressive behavior was quantitatively recorded. There was a significant difference between the fish’s aggressiveness in warm water versus cool water  (t-stat: 3.6699, df= 5, p=0.014). *************************************************************************
