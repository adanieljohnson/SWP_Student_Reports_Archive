Title: Effect of 4mM Lanthanum Chloride on Muscle Contraction in a Rana Pipien

Abstract:
In this experiment, the gastrocnemius muscle of three different Rana pipien will be stimulated three times with the same voltage in order to observe a change in muscle contraction and tetanus. The three legs will first experience this voltage without any variable in order to observe the baseline contraction of the gastrocnemius. After these three simulations, the muscle will be injected with Lanthanum Chloride. The means for all three legs will be calculated pre-injection and post-injection. It is hypothesized, that if the Rana pipien’s gastrocnemius muscle is injected with Lanthanum Chloride (calcium channel blocker), then twitch amplitude will decrease significantly, because this variable acts as a calcium inhibitor. Our result was as predicted - the amplitude of contraction significantly decreased as calcium was not able to bind to troponin thus inhibiting the cascade to occur.

Introduction:
Muscles receive information from nerves which are bundles of axons located throughout the nervous system. Every organism has their way of spreading information throughout their bodies and sending messages that are crucial for their existence. These nerves and muscles show their relationship with each other in species such as the Rana pipien. These simple frogs contain a gastrocnemius muscle and a sciatic nerve in both of their legs. The amount of activity each one of these legs experiences is dependent on the somatic neuromuscular system. This system consists of thousands myofibers, motor neurons, and neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. Myofibers are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells. Motor neurons contain axons that extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers, at points called neuromuscular junctions. The neuromuscular junction is the site where impulses arrive causing a release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal. The production of these actions potentials inevitably releases calcium which is responsible for muscle contraction. Also, in order to produce a contraction, a nerve will stimulate the muscle through a process called excitation-contraction coupling. This process can be monitored at the macroscopic level using a myogram. You can record this contraction by attaching the muscle to a force transducer (a sensor that measures force), and observing the amount of force generated. This process will also show us each of the phases the contraction experiences such as the latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase. The latent period is a very short time between stimulation and the start of contraction (less than 10 msec). The contraction phase is when the muscle shortens due to the chemical changes. And the relaxation phase is when the muscle returns to its former relaxed state [Johnson 2018]. This muscle will also experience tetany - the stage of maximum contraction which leads to fatigue. However, what affects the ability of muscles to contract can depend on what each organisms nervous system is faced with. For example, Lanthanum Chloride - a calcium channel blocker - acts as an inhibitor and decreases the force of muscle contraction by 90% [Glusa: 1987]. Calcium is an ion responsible for muscle contraction. Therefore, this leads us to the hypothesis that if Lanthanum Chloride is injected into the gastrocnemius of the Rana pipien, then contraction force will decrease because calcium ions will not bind to troponin, causing tropomyosin to not shift from the actin filament to the myosin head which is necessary for a contraction to be induced.

Materials and Methods:
We first skinned the leg of the Rana pipien’s - you will gently pull the skin off with either your fingers or forceps. After skinning the leg, squirt the leg with Ringers solution to make sure the leg does not dry out and continue to do so as the experiment is conducted. Then we gently snipped the gastrocnemius muscle where it connects lower down the leg so that one side is still attached closer to the thigh and one side is loose using forceps. Using the thread given we tied a tight knot to the detached side of the muscle and looped it around the hook on the machine. We also adjusted the height to make sure there was a decent amount of tension in the muscle as it was hanging. Then, we attached the probes that were attached to the voltmeter through the muscle just enough so that they were not sticking out the other end. After doing this, we applied the stimulus parameter (500mV) to the nerve using a laptop and the downloaded software. We did this three times as the control group for each leg. We wrote down the differences between maximum and minimum amplitudes in order to observe what the twitch force was. After doing this three times, we injected 0.1 mL of 4 mM Lanthanum Chloride using a syringe to the gastrocnemius muscle. We waited five minutes before running this simulation again. Again we noted the difference between maximum and minimum amplitudes in order to view the change in force. Once we calculated the means for each leg before and after the chemical was added and calculated the standard deviation and standard error, a paired t-test was done.

Results:
The main difference that was observed between the pre and post injection groups was the force at which the contraction occurred. The twitch in the post-injection was much slower and had a significantly less force. The mean for pre-injection contraction force was 513 mV and post-injection was 62 mV. The standard deviation for the control group was 27.01 mV and for the experimental group was 32.4 mV. The standard error for the control group was 5.197 mV and the standard error for the calcium blocker-injected group (experimental group) was 5.688 mV (figure 1). The p-value that we calculated was 0.008095 which suggests that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant, df =2, and t-stat = 11.047290. See figure 1 for the graphed results.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported in this experiment – it suggested that the rate of contraction would either completely stop or decrease significantly as calcium would not be able to bind to troponin. The twitch voltage did significantly decrease as the statistics show. The calcium channel blocker - Lanthanum Chloride caused the gastrocnemius muscle to contract much lesser force. This would then prohibit tropomyosin from shifting from the actin filament to the myosin head which is necessary for a contraction to be induced.  When we ran through the simulations we observed that the post-injection voltages barely made it to the hundreds and stayed more along the lines of two digit number. Our paired t-test showed us that this experiment is statistically significant as the p-value was extremely low. Lanthanum Chloride acts as an antagonist and will block calcium’s ability to bind [Glusa: 1987]. This could be used to prevent tetany as that is the state of maximal contraction. In order to avoid a certain muscle from over contracting to the point where it is hardening and stiffening too much, a possible calcium channel blocker such as Lanthanum Chloride could be used in order to avoid this situation from arising. Next steps in this experiment could possibly be seeing how much Calcium Lanthanum it takes for these results to appear – for example, maybe this affect could be viewed at a lower amount and or lower molarity and thus could me more beneficial if this blocker is used in other organisms. What could also be tested is the amount of voltage taken to reach threshold for this contraction and compare that with organisms that haven’t received this treatment.
