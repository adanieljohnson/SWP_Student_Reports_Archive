Title: Effects of Lidocaine on Rania pipiens gastrocnemus

Abstract:
Muscles are responsible for movement of bodies and transportation of substances within the body. Muscle contraction is strongly influenced by the presence, absence, and concentration of ions, specifically Na+ and K+. These ions can be blocked from influencing electrical currents along the membranes of neurons and muscle cells using ion channel blockers. In the experiment, lidocaine was treated to the gastrocnemus and sciatic nerve to test the effects. The data showed insignificance for difference. This shows that other ions are influential in muscular contraction and not all channel blockers inhibit Na+ influence in muscular contraction.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effects of lidocaine, a sodium ion (Na+) channel blocker, on muscle contraction. Muscles are bundles of contractile fibers that are responsible for motion through contracting and relaxing. Contractions are controllled and initiated by electrical pulses that travel down the neural cells of the nervous system. This electrical signal known as an Action Potential is created by the movement of ions, Na+ and K+, across the cell membrane. [Guy: 1986] From the neuron, the same ions create an action potential along the muscle cell membrane [Clausen: 1994]. Using the gastrocnemus muscle, commonly known as the calf muscle, of the Rania pipiens frog, the effects of lidocaine will be tested to determine the role of sodium ions in muscular contraction. Sodium ions have a significent role in muscle contraction action potentials. Therefore, it is hypothesized that if lidocaine is administered to the Rania pipiens leg and blocks the sodium ion channels, the contractions will decrease from weaker action potentials.

Materials and Method:
Three legs of Rania pipiens were degloved revealing the muscles, particularly the gastrocnemus and the sciatic nerve. The severed gastrocnemus was then suspended to measure movement resulting from a pulse. The pulse (2 volts) was emitted by electric prongs that lay under the sciatic nerve. The volts of movement from the leg were measured and recorded. After three runs, the leg muscle was injected with 0.1Ml 25 mmol lidocaine. One drop was placed on the sciatic nerve directly. The test was run again on the inhibited leg. The entire process was repeated twice more on fresh legs. A paired t_test was used to determine the significance of the data between the legs with and without the lidocaine. 

Results:
The average volts of muscle movement from the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus was 0.410 volts (Table 1). The average for the legs with lidocaine was 0.022 volts (Table 1). The standard deviation for volts was 0.278 for the controll group and 0.017 for the treatment group (Table 1). The standard error was 0.527 for the controll group and 0.130 for the treatment group (Table 1). The paired t_test was not statistically significent for volt difference (t_stat=1.947, d.f.= 2, P=0.1909). The p value was much more than the required 0.05.

Discussion:
According to the paired t_test showed that the data was not statistically significent disproving our hypothesis. This discrepancy may be due to the first set of data, the first leg. The calibration for the second leg was significently off causing the readings to look awry. This could explain the errors in the averages. Another possibility could be the channel blockers did not successfully bond to enough Na+ channels to inhibit the contraction. The blockers themselves are chemicals that can, at times, not bind properly to the binding site [Johnson: 2005]. Should the data been proven significent, lidocaine could be used to induce paralysis in certain muscles for medical examination or therapeutic treatment.
