Title: Use of glyphosate herbicide increases chloroplast activity

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to determine if a chemical-free approach to weed and invasive plant control would be more effective than the typical use of herbicides. This was done by observing and comparing three test groups; one group with only chloroplasts in the dark, one group with chloroplasts in the light with the common herbicide glyphosate, and one group of chloroplasts in a “super condition,” containing glyphosate and placed in the dark. It was predicted that the group placed in the “super condition” would prove the most effective at reducing chloroplast activity, but between the two normal test groups it was predicted that the herbicide would prove more effective. The results produced from this experiment were the opposite of those that were expected. The two test groups that contained glyphosate seemed to promote growth and chloroplast activity and the only group that showed any reduction in chloroplast activity was that which did not contain any of the herbicide. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and other organisms convert light energy to chemical energy that is used to fuel activity. It consists of three stages, the first two of which are the light-dependent reactions known as Photosystem II and I. The third stage is the light-independent reaction known as the Calvin cycle. Often in the agriculture industry we see herbicides like atrazine, that accomplish inhibition of photosynthesis by targeting components of PSII and reducing the production of energy needed for growth. [Shimabukuro: 1969]
	One other popular herbicide is glyphosate and is more commonly known as Round-Up. Glyphosate does not interfere with PSII like other herbicides do, but rather, it blocks a specific enzyme pathway called the shikimic acid pathway. The shikimic acid pathway is a metabolic pathway whose three major products are the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, that are essential to plant growth. This pathway is only found in plants and microorganisms and never in animals, making it a perfect target for herbicides. [Hermann: 1999] 
	Though herbicides containing glyphosate prove to have little to no harmful effects on humans since we do not have the enzyme pathway it targets, it is debatable whether we should introduce foreign chemicals into our bodies whether they produce the possibility of harm or not. With herbicide use being so common in the agriculture industry, it is likely that a lot of our fresh produce that we buy has been exposed to or still contains traces of herbicide chemicals from treatment of surrounding weeds. This poses a question about the possibility of alternatives for inhibiting plant growth that are chemical free. Photosystem II and I are essential in the process of photosynthesis. It blatantly stated within the name of their category that they are light-dependent reactions. This begs the question that if light were to be taken out of the equation, would this have the same or greater effect on inhibiting plant growth as glyphosate? 
	We predicted that samples placed in the dark would show a reduction in chloroplast activity but not one of significance when compared against the samples with glyphosate. The samples with our herbicide are predicted to produce a significant reduction in chloroplast activity. However, I believe the samples that will show the greatest reduction in activity will be those that we place in our “super condition” where they will contain glyphosate but also be placed in the dark.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we removed the large central veins from three kale leaves and then ground them using a chilled mortar and pestle and 10mL of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). The kale leaves were ground until they became a thick paste with no large chunks left. We then added an additional 10mL of the grinding buffer and mixed it in with the kale slurry. The slurry was poured and strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a medium chilled beaker. The filtered liquid was placed in a 50mL centrifuge tube and spun at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 15 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Once the centrifuge was complete the supernatant from the tube was poured into a new chilled tube, leaving the pellet of debris at the bottom of the centrifuged tube undisturbed. Twenty-six test tubes were prepared, consisting of a blank and five replicates for each of the five test samples. The blank contained 8mL of water and 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate). The no chloroplasts, chloroplasts in dark, and chloroplasts in light groups contained 6mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, and 2mL of reaction buffer. Finally, the chloroplasts in light with herbicide and the chloroplasts in dark with herbicide groups contained 5mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 1mL of glyphosate.
	Upon completion of preparation, 100 microliters of chloroplasts obtained from the centrifuged sample were added to all tubes (except for the “no chloroplasts” samples) and then mixed immediately. We set the spectrophotometer to read at 600nm, blanked it, and proceeded to obtain our “Time Zero” absorbance data. The blank, no chloroplasts, chloroplasts in light, and chloroplasts in light with herbicide samples were placed under a grow light. The chloroplasts in dark and the chloroplasts in dark with herbicide samples were placed in a dark drawer. Every ten minutes for thirty minutes we blanked the spectrophotometer and recorded the absorbance data.
	To analyze the data, we carried out a series of paired t-tests comparing the total absorbance of the samples after thirty minutes. Three paired t-tests compared the positive control (chloroplasts in light) to each of the three test groups. One test compared the chloroplasts in dark group versus the chloroplasts in light with herbicide group. The final test compared whichever group from the previous test was more effective in inhibiting activity versus the “super condition” group of chloroplasts in dark with herbicide.


Results:
In the first three paired t-tests comparing the positive control group to each of the three test groups, only one produced a significant value. The test comparing the positive control to the chloroplasts in dark proved significant (t-stat= 8.199, df= 4, p-value= 0.0012), while the other two tests comparing the positive control versus the chloroplasts in light plus herbicide (t-stat= 1.434, df= 4, p-value= 0.225) and the positive control versus the chloroplasts in dark plus herbicide (t-stat= 0.5478, df= 4, p-value= 0.613) produced results that were not statistically significant. The paired t-test comparing the chloroplasts in dark group versus the chloroplasts in light with herbicide produced statistically significant results (t-stat= 5.185, df= 4, p-value= 0.00658). The final test compared the chloroplasts in dark group versus the “super condition” group of chloroplasts in dark with herbicide, which also produced statistically significant results (t-stat= 20.804, df= 4, p-value= 0.0000315).

Discussion:
Prior to conducting the experiment, I predicted that the test group that would show the greatest reduction in chloroplast activity would be the “super condition” group of chloroplasts in dark with herbicide, and that the test group with the least reduction in activity when compared to the other two groups would be the chloroplasts in dark. This would leave the test group containing just glyphosate to fall in the middle in terms of reduction of chloroplast activity. However, the data collected and the results from the paired t-tests proved almost the opposite of the predictions to be true. The test group that proved to be most effective in the inhibition of chloroplast activity was the chloroplasts in dark. This can be seen in the graph where there is no visible data for the dark group, but this is because the average percent change in absorbance was below zero while the other groups were above zero (Fig. 1). Thus, proving that the chloroplasts in dark group was the most successful in inhibiting chloroplast activity. With the average percent change over thirty minutes of the “super condition” group matching very closely with the positive control group, and the average percent change over thirty minutes of the chloroplasts in light with herbicide exceeding that of the positive control group, this raises some questions (Table 1). Why did the groups with herbicide not prevent chloroplast activity, and instead seem to enhance it?
	There had been mentions in a few reports that low dosages of glyphosate exposure by means of herbicide drift or contact with treated weeds, could promote plant growth but there was never any real detailed data on the subject. One study conducted set out to provide that detailed data by exposing plants to both high and low dosages of glyphosate and observing the results. They found that in all plant species studied, except for one glyphosate-resistant soybean plant, low dosages of glyphosate exposure stimulated plant growth. This process by which growth occurs in response to stimulation by low concentration toxins is called hormesis [Velini: 2008]. This would explain why we observed growth in the test samples containing our herbicide when we expected decreased activity. In addition to glyphosate induced hormesis, the study observed a glyphosate-resistant plant species. These glyphosate-resistant plants are continuously evolving and becoming more common. As of 2006, there were at least eight known glyphosate resistant species located throughout the world with two known glyphosate-resistance mechanisms [Powles: 2006]. In 2019 after thirteen years, who knows how many more there are now?
	With the popularity of glyphosate as the major ingredient in commercial herbicides, it is concerning that weed species may eventually evolve to the point where they are completely resistant, and we are unable to control them with herbicides that once worked. Major companies like Round-Up that produce glyphosate herbicides would have to change their formulas of several products which will be costly and time consuming.  It previously has been common for those within the agriculture industry to plant glyphosate-resistant crops so that they could use glyphosate to kill the weeds without harming the crops. However, with glyphosate-resistant weed species on the rise, this easy and economically efficient process may soon need to find a replacement. Once glyphosate can no longer be used to kill the weeds and invasive species, there is no point in planting glyphosate-resistant crops. A new alternative to glyphosate and method for best keeping the crops safe will have to be found [Green: 2016].
