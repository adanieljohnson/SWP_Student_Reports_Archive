Title: Effects of caffeine injection on Rania pipien's muscle contraction

Abstract:

Organisms use the neuromuscular system to regulate responses to external stimuli. Therefore, it is important to understand the way this system interacts to external stimuli. We looked more specifically at the effects of caffeine injection and subsequent stimuli on the Rania pipiens frog leg. The expectation was that an increase of caffeine would increase muscle contraction. Our data trends suggest that the alternate hypothesis is supported, and the null hypothesis rejected. This results are in concordance with the idea that more caffeine produces greater muscle contraction by opening ion channels, such that tetany is reached sooner.


Introduction:
This experiment was designed to test the effects of caffeine on the amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle when stimulated by the sciatic nerve. Because caffeine stimulates calcium release, we hypothesize that injecting caffeine into the muscle will increase muscle contraction. This is done by isolating the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of a frog leg, using the foundation of neuromuscular controll to carry out the experiment. The frog species, Rania pipiens, is wide-ranging in North America (AmphibiaWeb). The frog’s neuromuscular system responds to internal or external stimuli that differs from hormone mechanisms in that it is a much  more rapid mode of communication, responding in just milliseconds as opposed to the Endocrine system’s seconds. The skeletal muscles that make up this system are comprised of myofibers that are excited by motor neurons in the gray matter of spinal cord. Neuromuscular junctions catalyze the release of acetylcholine upon nerve impulses so that an action-potential can induce muscle contraction. The physical conditions surrounding a muscle play an integral role in its function, such as its chemical environment or the amount of fluid around the myofibrils. When force is generated by multiple motor units, this is called summation. Tetanus, or tetany, is when this force reaches its maximum potential, which might happen upon profuse stimulation. 

Materials and Method:
The experiment was performed on three legs (trials 1-3). The legs were first dissected to isolate the sciatic nerve from the frog’s inner thigh muscles, being cautious not to free the nerve too closely to the knee joint. Exposed tissues were kept moist with frog Ringer’s solution. We first stimulated each leg with a triple pulse at 1.0V with a width of 5 ms; these were the controll pulses. Next, we injected 0.1Ml of 200mm caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle via syringe. This experiment was performed using the program LabScribe to monitor the stimuli and responses on a voltage-time graph. We then analyzed our data using a paired T-test. 


Results:
For all of our trials, the amplitude of the muscle increased after injection of 0.1Ml of caffeine. The average difference in each response before and after injection was 0.581. We used a paired t_test to analyze our results. We found that there was a significent difference between the controll and experimental trials (P-value: 0.072). The data also shows that the resulting amplitude for the controll groups decreased from trial 1 to trial 3. Additionally, we observed that the gastrocnemus muscle was firm to the touch after the stimuli with the injection. 



Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that injecting caffeine to the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens would increase muscle contraction was supported. Caffeine alters contraction patterns of the skeletal muscles by stimulating the release of calcium by opening calcium ion channels. The influx of calcium is what leads to increased muscle contraction, driving the muscles to reach tetany sooner (Olorunshola). Because we observed that the muscle was hard after the injection, this supports the idea that the muscle reached tetany, whereas it did not before. The decrease in initial controll group amplitude might be explained by the fact that trial 3 group muscles were directly exposed to the air for a longer time period. Further studies might be performed using a smaller dosage of caffeine to examine the threshold of significent difference.
