Title: Impact of Tank Size on the Frequency and Duration of Agonistic Behaviors in Bettas

Abstract:
Behaviors are a response to a specific stimulus that can help a species find a mating partner, get food, but inevitably help an individual or a species survive. Agonistic or aggressive behaviors are also responsible for the fitness of individuals and the overall success of a species. Betta splendens is a fish known to portray many types of agonistic behaviors; one is the presentation of a red mane to fend of interspecific and intraspecific competition. It was hypothesized that male bettas would portray the red mane agonistic behavior quicker and longer in a smaller tank due to the higher probability of the fish seeing each other. Fishes were timed over a five-minute interval with a transparent barrier between them. The time it took for the male to present the red mane and the duration that the betta presented the mane were observed and recorded using stopwatches. There was no statistical difference between for both the time till the first presentation of the red mane and its duration over the time interval and leads to a conclusion that there is no effect of tank size on agonistic behavior. Measuring the levels of testosterone could help minimize variability in data due to the overall difference in behaviors in individuals and only observing one agonistic behavior.

Introduction:
Behaviors are defined as a response to certain stimuli, whatever that stimulus may be. Behaviors between a species, such as courtship rituals or singing can help an individual become more fit by increasing its chances of mating [Ota: 2018]. Aggressive behaviors also help with mating in species or can improve the survival of a species when dealing with competition from neighboring species [Boose: 2018]. It is important to study animal behaviors (ethology) because they can help us understand how certain behaviors evolved and increased or decreased the fitness of an animal [Scopece: 2019]. Studying animal behaviors can also generate a clearer picture of the intersection of behavior and an organism’s anatomy and physiology, especially in sexually dimorphic species.

Betta splendens, also called Bettas or Siamese fighting fish, are animals that have observable agonistic or aggressive behaviors. Bettas have been shown to perform agonistic behaviors between each other (intraspecific) and for other fish species (interspecific). There are two main movements for the agonistic behaviors: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are performed when a fish turns its side toward its opponent. There are three broadside movements: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing (in order of aggressiveness). There are also three facing movements: facing an opponent with the pectoral fins erect, spreading out its gill covers (opercula), and finally protruding the branchiostegal membrane to form a “red mane” like structure. There are also other generic threat-like behaviors bettas perform such as raising the dorsal fin, darkening the skin, and darting [Johnson: 2016].

Previous observations of agonistic behaviors in male betta fish have shown that only when one of the males sees the other, it will swim towards it and start performing the agonistic behaviors [Bronstein: 1984]. We will be observing whether the size of the fish tank will impact the time it takes a betta to see the other male and present an agonistic behavior (specifically the presence of the red mane), and how long that presentation will last during a predetermined time interval. We predict that in the smaller tanks Bronstein the fish will have the probability of seeing each other more, which will result in a quicker first presentation of the red mane, and a longer duration of the behavior as well.  


Materials and Methods:
The tanks used for experimentation are constructed with slots that allow for two barriers to be inserted and separate the tank into two parts. There is a transparent barrier where the fish can see through, and an opaque barrier, one that the fish cannot see through. The square area of the bottom of the small tank was 24 square inches, while the square area of the bottom of the large tank was 105 square inches (the area for one fish in the tank). Between each trial, the fish rested for five minutes to reduce habituation and maximize the agonistic behaviors that were presented. During the resting phase, both fishes were in the same tank, but the opaque barrier was down so the fish cannot see each other. After the resting time was over, the opaque barrier was lifted, now that the two betta males can see each other. For each trial, only one male was being observed, which resulted in three replicates for each of the male bettas for each condition. The time it took for the male to present the red mane and the duration that the betta presented the mane were observed and recorded using stopwatches. Each trial lasted five minutes, and that was the standard time interval used for all experiments for both the small and large tanks. A paired T-test was run to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the time for the first red mane presentation and the duration of the red mane presentation between male bettas in a small tank compared to a larger tank.

Results:
When the bettas were in the small tank, on average it took them 22.7 ± 31.8 seconds compared to 30.7 ± 34.5 seconds in the large tanks (Figure 1). However, the times of the first presentation of red mane between the small and large tanks was found to be not a statistically significant difference (t-stat: 1.84, df: 2, p-value: 0.208). The overall average duration of the red mane presentation in the small tanks were 132.7 ± 116.6 seconds and 101.3 ± 92.1 seconds in the large tanks (Figure 2). But there was found to be no statistically significant difference between the duration of the red mane presentation between small and large tanks (t-stat: 0.984, df: 2, p-value: 0.429). 

Discussion:
From the results, it was determined that our hypothesis could not be accepted. This infers that the size of the fish tank did not affect both the time it took for the betta fish to present the red mane and the duration of the red mane presentation. While we hypothesized that in the larger tanks there would be a smaller probability of the fish seeing each other. However, when the opaque barrier was lifted, the only thing that the fish could focus on was the other fish, while the rest of the environment the fish was seemed normal. This caused the fish to pay attention to the one feature that was different in its environment, the other betta fish, and it has been shown that betta fish produce agonistic behaviors when seeing a shape similar to the side view of a betta fish [Bando: 1991]. 

One of the fishes that were used to calculate the data never presented the red mane, and it is possible that habituation may have a role in that, but it is also possible that this fish could have just been presenting different agonistic behaviors other than the red mane presentation, such as broadside movements [Johnson: 2016]. Researchers that were studying agonistic behaviors in betta fishes quantified the duration of the red mane, but also analyzed testosterone quantities after the trails as well [Chen: 2016]. Testosterone is a hormone that has been shown to increase aggressiveness in many species [Harley: 2019]. Running the same experiment and collecting testosterone levels could eliminate the error caused by the handicap recording one specific agonistic behavior and not considering all the other agonistic behaviors presented and the variability of behaviors between fishes.
