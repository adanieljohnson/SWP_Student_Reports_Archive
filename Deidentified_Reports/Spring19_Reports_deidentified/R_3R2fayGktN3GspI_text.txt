Title: Time of gill flaring of Betta splendins decreases in turbid water

Abstract:
Intraspecific behaviors are important for resource competition, sexual activities, and territorial defense.  When observing intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendins, gill flaring is vital as an initial dominant display of aggression, particularly male-male interactions in different environments.  Environmental conditions can lower aggressive behaviors of Betta fish, particularly turbid environments.  Therefore, we hypothesize that Betta fish in turbid water will have a lower time gill flaring/time in tank ratio than the time gill flaring/time in tank ratio of Betta fish in clear water.  Our hypothesis was supported in that the average time gill flaring/time in tank of Betta fish in turbid water was lower than that of clear water, and the paired t_test gave a p_value of 0.017 showing that the data was statistically significent.  This is due to the low visibility in the tank causing a lack of necessity for Betta males to exhibit aggressive territorial behavior.  A future experiment could take into account different factors like age, color, and size of the fish that were not taken into extreme consideration during our experiment.  This experimental can be further applied to studying intraspecific behaviors to understand possible impacts of environmental change on different species

Introduction:
Intraspecific behavior, behavior in the presence of members of the same species, is vital to study when examining animal behavior.  Intraspecific behaviors are exhibited during resources competition, sexual activities, and territorial defence. In this experiment, Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are studied.  The natural habitat of Betta fish includes ponds, ditches, and drains in Southeast Asia [Johnson: 1973].  Betta splendins are an ideal organism for this experiment because their intraspecific behaviors are vital for visual communication which guides social interactions [Johnson: 1973].  These behaviors are strongly associated with agnostic (aggressive) behaviors [Johnson: 1973].  The popular name, Siamese fighting fish, comes from Bettas tendency to attack conspecifics, particularly males in the presence of other males [Johnson: 1973].  Male-male aggressive displays are most prominent during reproduction, when a male Betta constructs a bubble nest and must protect the territory from other male Bettas [Forsatkar:2017].  One of the most common first displays exhibited by male Bettas to territorial intruders is gill flaring [Forsatkar:2017].  Gill flaring is observed when a Betta fish spreads its gill covers (opercula) [Forsatkar:2017].  Forsatkar’s study found that gill flaring is the most dominant initial display to Betta territorial intruders despite the high energy cost of gill flaring compared to other display behaviors [Forsatkar:2017].  This suggests that gill flaring is a strong agnostic behavior essential for territorial defending in male Bettas [Forsatkar:2017].
	Because of its importance as an initial display, this experiment examines gill flaring in Betta splendins in the presence of other males.  This experiment examines the aggressiveness of Betta males through gill flaring in different environments.  A separate study examines how water disturbances effect behavior of Betta fish [Hurtado-Parrado:2019].  The study looks at how electric shocks cause changes in water conditions (making the water flow faster), which in result causes male Bettas to show less aggressive behavior towards each other [Hurtado-Parrado:2019].  This change in the water environment contributes to less of a territorial response in Betta fish.  Our experiment aims to examine Betta fish in response to changing environments which can cause less of an aggressive territorial response towards other male Bettas.  Looking at changes in water conditions, this experiment looks at the gill flaring behavior of Betta fish in clear water compared to turbid water.  We hypothesize that Betta fish in turbid water will have a lower time gill flaring/time in tank ratio than the time gill flaring/time in tank ratio of Betta fish in clear water.


Materials and Method:
Six adult male Betta fish were obtained.  Two male Bettas were put into a clear water tank with a barrier in between the two.  The barrier was removed and the time of gill flaring for each fish was recorded until the two touched one another.  The fish were then separated and the barrier was put back in and the Bettas were given 5 minutes of rest.  After 5 minutes, each side of the barrier was given eight drops of food coloring to make the turbid water environment.  The barrier was then removed and the time of gill flaring for each fish until contact in the turbid water was recorded.  The same process was recorded for two more pairs of fish.  The order of the fish being placed first in clear water or turbid water was randomized by the flipping of a coin.  The times were then recorded and given as the time gill flared/time in tank until contact ratio for the six fish in both environments.  This ratio allowed us to measure aggressive tendencies between the groups while taking into account fish that were in the tank different periods of time.  The average time gill flared/time in tank until contact ratio was calculated for the clear water and the turbid water.  The average time gill flared/time in tank until contact ratio of the clear water and turbid water were compared using a paired t_test with the critical value of 0.05 significance level.

Results:
General trends are seen in Figure 1 that the average time gill flared/time in tank ratio of Betta fish in turbid water is lower than the Betta fish in clear water.  The average time gill flared/time in tank ratio of Betta fish in turbid water is 0.2250.194 compared to the higher average time gill flared/time in tank ratio of Betta fish in clear water 0.4020.168.  This difference was proven to be statistically significent after conducting a paired t_test (t-value=3.51, d.f.=5, and p=0.017).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported in that Betta fish in turbid water had a lower time gill flaring/time in tank ratio than the time gill flaring/time in tank ratio of Betta fish in clear water.  Further areas of study can emphasize our results.
	In turbid and murky environments, the lesser amount of gill flaring has to do with the difficulty of Betta males being able to see one another.  This takes away from the need for Betta males to show aggressive behaviors like gill flaring to mark their territory.  Agonistic behaviors like gill flaring of one Betta leads to the opponent Betta fish having a choice of response [Alton:2013].  The Betta fish can match or possibly escalate the agnostic behavior which forces the original Betta fish to respond back [Alton:2013].  The clear water allows Betta males to clearly view and match the gill flaring and other aggressive behaviors of opponent Betta males which in turn leads to returned aggressive behaviors, but the turbid water hinders the ability for Betta males to match aggressive behaviors.  Another cause of the lower time of gill flaring had to with it taking additional time for the Betta fish to first see each other in the turbid water when the barriers were released.  A similar study looked at the aggressive behaviors of Longear Sunfish based on the turbidity of water [Hadley: 1969].   This study showed lower levels of water turbidity to have higher mortality rate of the sunfish when placed in the same tank [Hadley: 1969].  Like Sunfish, Betta fish in clear water caused easier recognition of opponents and more aggression which could lead to lower survival rates.  In a larger sense, Betta males can survive better in turbid water because they are expending less energy having to exhibit aggressive behaviors to a smaller amount of other Betta males due to a lack of water visibility.  This energy saved can be used for reproduction and allocation of resources to enhance survival.  This explains why Betta fish are found in turbid water environments like ponds, ditches, and drains.
	The next logical step following this experiment would be to take into account different factors like age, color, and size of the fish that were not taken into extreme consideration during our experiment.  A further experiment could expand on this experiment by testing these more similar fish in clear and turbid waters.  This would allow our experiment to take away external factors and allow us to test more accurately that the turbidity of the water is the only factor impacting time of gill flaring.  Another experiment could test Betta males in different levels of turbidity to see if the time gill flaring/time in tank ratio decreases between varying levels of turbidity.
	Finally, this experiment can be applied to the broader concept of environmental change, specifically climate change and human impact on the environment.  These environmental changes impact the intraspecific behaviors of different species.  Our experiment examines how the environmental change of water turbidity lowers the aggressive behavior of Betta males.  However, we are only examining one species. It would be beneficial for biologists and environmentalists to understand how intraspecific behaviors of different species lead to conclusions about suitable environments before climate change and human interactions dramatically alter environments.  Prior knowledge could save species and prevent extinction.
