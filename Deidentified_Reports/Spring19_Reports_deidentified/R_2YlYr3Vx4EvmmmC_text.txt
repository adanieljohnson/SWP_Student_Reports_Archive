Title: Effects of Sevin on the Contractions in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Raina pipiens

Abstract:
Skeletal muscle contracts in response to a release of acetylcholine from motor neurons that stimulates an action potential leading to the release of calcium ions in the muscle. In this experiment, the gastrocnemus muscles of Raina pipiens were used to observe the effects of acetylcholine on neuromuscular function after they were treated with Sevin, an inhibitor of acetylcholine. These muscles were tested with a stimulation of 1v to the muscle three times both before and after treatment and the results were compared using a paired-t_test. The mean of average response voltages for the controll was 0.946v with a standard deviation of 0.228 and 0.339v with a standard deviation of 0.162 for the treatment. The paired-t_test resulted in a one-tailed p_value of 0.095 at an alpha level of 0.05 meaning we failed to reject the null hypothesis and our results are not statistically significent although they are close to being significent which could indicate that repetition of this experiment may yield is significent results. This experiment did not indicate that Sevin could reduce the strength of muscle contractions in the gastrocnemus muscle of R. pipiens.


Introduction:
Skeletal Muscle in vertebrates and invertebrates consists of thousands of myofibrils which are bound together to form functional groups of muscle fibers. These muscles are innervated by motor neurons extending from the spinal cord that release acetylcholine (Ach) into the neuromuscular junction [Johnson: 2018]. This neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels to generate an action potential that spreads through the fiber, releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which causes a contraction as the muscles shorten [Pestronk: 1976]. In this experiment we will isolate the gastrocnemus muscle of Raina pipiens to observe the effects of acetylcholine on neuromuscular function. Sevin is an insecticide that inhibits acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction [Todd: 2002]. We will test three legs of R. pipiens by stimulating the gastrocnemus muscle with 1v and recording the resulting response voltage before and after an injection of Sevin (an Ach inhibitor). By inhibiting acetylcholine, there should be less action potentials in the muscle because the release of acetylcholine stimulates the firing of action potentials in the muscle that cause the muscle to contract [Johnson: 2018]. Our hypothesis is if we treat the gastrocnemus muscle of R. pipiens with Sevin then the strength of the contraction (as measured by the voltage) will decrease because inhibiting Ach should decrease the number of action potentials.

Materials and Method:
While gently holding the leg above the gastrocnemus muscle, we pulled back to skin in one quick downward motion to expose the muscle. Then, using scissors, we cut the tendon connecting to the gastrocnemus muscle by the foot and tied a string around that tendon. This string was hung from a hook attached to the force transducer to measure voltage exerted by the contracting muscle. After pinning the remaining pieces of the leg down, the BNC connector probes were inserted into the suspended gastrocnemus muscle of the R. pipiens. Throughout the duration of the experiment the muscles were periodically drenched in Frog Ringers to preserve the muscle. The probe delivered 1v to the muscle three times and the resulting voltages of the responses were recorded, these three responses were then averaged. Then, 5Ml of Sevin, an acetylcholine inhibitor, was injected into the muscle from a high angle in three different locations to ensure even dispersion of the treatment. After waiting 5 minutes and administering some gentle massaging of the muscle, the probe delivered 1v three more times and the voltages of the responses were recorded and averaged. This process was repeated on the remaining two R. Pipiens legs. The means of the controll trials for each leg were averaged together and the means of the treatment trials for each leg were averaged as well. The difference in these resulting means of average response voltage for the controll trial and the treatment trials were compared using a paired-t_test to determine a one-tailed p_value.

Results:
After treatment, the muscles appeared to respond with a weaker contraction compared to the strength of the controll responses however the first leg did not respond to treatment at first.
Table 1 shows a summary of average response voltages of the gastrocnemus muscle of R. pipiens following a stimulus of 1v before and after treatment of 5Ml of Sevin. The mean and standard deviation of the three tests for each leg are shown for both the treatment and controll trials. The mean and standard deviation of those averages are also listed. The average of the means of the controll group was much greater than that of the treatment group. Figure 1 depicts a comparison of the mean of three response voltages of three gastrocnemus muscles of R. pipiens at 1v before and after treatment of 5Ml of Sevin, standard deviation bars are shown. Before treatment, the controll tests resulted in a mean of average response voltages of 0.946v with a standard deviation of 0.228. After an injection of 5Ml of Sevin, the treatment tests resulted in a mean of average response voltages of 0.339v with a standard deviation of 0.162. A one-tailed paired-t_test comparing the mean of average response voltages for the controll trial and treatment trial at an alpha value of 0.05 resulted in a p_value 0.095.

Discussion:
We failed to reject the null hypothesis by a small margin so our hypothesis is not support but our results are almost significent because our p_value was only 0.045 more than out alpha value. However, because our p_value shows insignificent results, the results of this experiment are due to chance. Acetylcholine is responsible for creating action potentials that contract muscles when it is released from motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction [Pestronk: 1976]. Sevin inhibits acetylcholine so a treatment of Sevin should have decreased the strength of muscle contractions by decreasing the amount of action potentials in the gastrocnemus muscle [Todd: 2002]. However, this experiment did not indicate that an Sevin could decrease the strength of muscle contractions. Only three R. pipiens gastrocnemus muscles were tested and this limited number of subjects could be a source of error and could explain our insignificent p_value. Repetition of this experiment could also improve accuracy of results. Because our results were so close to being significent, it is possible that doing this experiment again could yield significent results. This research is important because Sevin could be an effective insecticide capable of paralyzing pests that could harm crops while being too weak to harm humans who consume those crops. This chemical would also not harm the crops because plants do not have muscles that require acetylcholine stimulation the way animals do. We inserted the probe directly into the gastrocnemus muscle instead of the sciatic nerve which is the nerve that connects to the gastrocnemus muscle to stimulate it [Johnson: 2018]. To take this research further, the same experiment could be conducted but this time the probe could stimulate the sciatic nerve instead of direct stimulation to the muscle to observe how the effects of an action potential beginning in the nervous system are affected by Sevin.
