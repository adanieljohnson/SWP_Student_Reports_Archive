Title: Impacts of trace amounts of Insect Growth Regulators on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
 Understanding how the endocrine systems works in insects and what hormones are responsible for insect development is important to help artificially regulate  pests in the environment. Recent research has looked at how Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) alter juvenile hormone levels, which are responsible for insect growth and development. Our experiment hypothesizes that minute traces of an IGRs introduced into the Manduca sexta's diet will alter its growth and development compared to a control group. We observed Manduca sexta's in a controlled environment over two weeks, collecting their weights daily. We ran a statistical analysis on daily growth rate using a two-factor t test. After analysis, we determined our hypothesis was not supported and that further experimentation is needed to reject the null hypothesis. Further research on the efficiency of IGRs will help lower the economic cost of pest control while limiting collateral damage of the environment. 

Introduction:
Our experiment investigates the effects of hormones on an insect’s life-cycle. Hormones are important for the lifecycle and growth of insects. Specifically, hormones in insects signal both the timing and type of molt completed by the insect. The effects of the hormones also change with the type of insect being studied. The insect of interest in the current experiment is the Manduca sexta and how one can alter its development. The Manduca sexta begins its lifecycle as eggs transitioning into 5 different stages/instars of larva development. Upon reaching the fifth instar larva stage, the Manduca sexta begins to pupate. After pupation, the insect transforms into an adult. These stages of development directly correlate with the size and growth of the Insect (which are determined by hormones within the insect). Recent research indicates that both juvenile hormone and target of rapamycin are the signaling components that are used by the Manduca sexta to regulate the final body size [Hatem, Wang, Nave, Koyama, & Suzuki: 2015]. Hormone functions in caterpillars (like the Manduca sexta) have been extensively studied by researchers because they have fewer more specific hormones than humans and the hormones have a number of mediated behavioral outcomes due to the specific levels of hormones in their lifecycle [Nijhout, & Laub: 2018]. Caterpillars can be considered pests in the earlier stages of their lifecycles. They impact the environment and are not beneficial to agricultural production. Recent studies have demonstrated how insect growth regulators (IGRs) have altered the growth and survival, of insects considered pest, into adulthood [Tunaz, & Uygun: 2004]. IGRs affect the growth rate and survival of insects by disrupting their hormone production [Wang, & Liu: 2016]. This stimulates the question of how much disruption to hormone production must occur to see a difference in the growth of the Manduca sexta. Knowing this information will allow us to condense the amount of time spent in the early phases of the lifecycle, thus limiting the amount of exposure of the pest stages of the insect to the environment. With this question in mind, we developed an experiment that alters the Manduca sexta’s exposure to IGR through all of its larval stages. We proposed that if you introduce a trace amount of IGRs to impact the juvenile hormone levels of the Manduca sexta, then the hormone imbalance will change the molting process and growth rate of the Manduca sexta. 

Materials and Methods:
We randomly selected eight Manduca sextas in the first instar larva phase and then randomly assigned them into two groups consisting of four caterpillars. One group was assigned to be a control group while the other group was the experimental. The control group experienced no manipulation while the experimental group experienced a manipulation of exposure to an IGR to influence the amount of juvenile hormone. All Manduca sextas were placed into a divided container with two holes drilled into each section. The Manduca sextas were kept in a controlled environment of an incubator for two weeks. Ten grams of food was placed into each compartment holding a caterpillar. The control group was given ten grams of food with three drops of water added. The experimental group was given ten grams of food with an added three drops of juvenile hormone. Observations of the caterpillars were recorded every day for two weeks. We documented their weight in grams and recorded visual evidence of growth through photos. After the data was gathered, we calculated each caterpillar’s average daily growth rate. A two-tailed two sample t-test was then run to determine the differences and significance between the average growth rate of the control group and the experimental group.

Results:
 The control group possessed a mean daily growth rate of .648 grams while the experimental group possessed a mean daily growth rate of .658 grams (Fig. 1). The standard deviation of the weight for the control group was .363 and the standard deviation for the experimental group was .205 (Figure 2). We used a two-tailed, two sample t-test to analyze the results. There was no significant difference between the mean daily growth of our control group and our experimental group, t-stat = .049, df = 6, P = .963. During the last days of observations there was no visible difference between the size of both groups. They all appeared to be around the fourth and fifth phase of the instar larva; some had begun the process of pupa exclusion through molting. Overall the same pattern of daily growth was observed between the two groups. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the introduction of trace amounts of an IGR to the Manduca sexta, then the hormone imbalance will change the molting process and growth rate of the Manduca sexta, was not supported. We recorded a p-value of .963 because this value is greater than .05 we can conclude that our results were not statistically significant; this value indicates that most of the differences between the results of the groups were due to probable chance. We should retain our null hypothesis that IGRs will not change the molting process and growth rate of the Manduca sexta. However, earlier studies have proven that IGRs do impact insect growth/development. The earliest aspect of this affect was observed that linden bugs had slow hatch rate and failed to mature into adults due to being placed on paper towels soaked in an IGR compound [Tunaz, & Uygun: 2004]. Others studies also support these findings, and further IGR compounds have been developed to target specific biochemistry and physiology components of insect development [Tunaz, & Uygun: 2004]. I believe that more IGR needed to be placed in the food to have a significant impact on the experimental group. I believe that if there was more of the IGR in the food then the growth rate of the experimental group would be slower and the caterpillars would die before pupating. More research is needed to determine at what amount, if any, IGRs become effective to alter insect growth and development. Further research is important because it can allow us to decrease the presence of pest to the environment and agriculture through IGR exposure. Knowing the lowest amount of IGR exposure to become effects will allow a more economical treatment with little collateral damage. Further research of insect hormone functioning will allow us have an insight on how to generalize the workings and manipulations of the endocrine system across species.  The understanding of the roles and productions of hormones in insects will give us insights to our own hormone production. Research can create an ability to generalize hormone regulation theories and could allow us to create hypotheses on how to treat over or underactive hormonal systems.
