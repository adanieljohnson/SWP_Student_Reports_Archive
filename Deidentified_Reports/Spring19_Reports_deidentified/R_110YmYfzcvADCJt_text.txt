Title: BLOCKING ECDYSTEROIDAL HORMONES WITH THE IGR AZAGUARD NEGATIVELY EFFECTS OVERALL HEALTH OF MANDUCA SEXTA LARVAE

Abstract:
Abstract
Insects use a variety of hormones to maintain homeostasis and regulate certain biological processes. This study used azaguard, an ecdysteroidal hormone blocker, to determine a direct correlation between two hormones: ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-E), and the biological process of molting in Manduca sexta larva. Among 8 larvae, 4 were given a hormonal treatment for 13 days, and the average lengths and weights of the larvae were compared to find any significent discrepancy between the two groups. This study predicted that if the E and 20-E hormones were blocked using the azaguard, the larvae would be unable to molt and support new internal or external structures, which would lead to a decrease in their growth and development, potentially culminating in death. While a general decrease in the weight of the treatment group was observed, their length and physiology remained similar, leaving it inconclusive as to whether blocking the E and 20-E hormones influences their growth and development through the molting process.


Introduction:
Introduction
The caterpillar Manduca sexta relies on two hormones to regulate growth and development during its larval stage. The first is juvenile hormone and the second is a group of steroid hormones known as ecdysteroids, which are secreted by the prothoracic glands [Johnson: 2018]. Of these two, the ecdysteroids, particularly 20-hydroxyecdysone and ecdysone are the primary hormones responsible for molting, which allows the larva to undergo the morphological transitions necessary for pupation [Gilbert: 2002]. When ecdysteroid levels spike in the larva, it triggers an eclosion, or molt. In this way, the ecdysteroids regulate the timing of eclosions throughout the entire life cycle of the Manduca sexta. In many cases, specific hormonal systems, such as the system for regulating molting in the Manduca sexta, can be manipulated by substances known as “insect growth regulators,” or IGRs, for the agricultural purpose of pest controll. They do so by altering the normal hormone release of the insect, either delaying it or prolonging it, to create abnormalities in the insect that decrease its chance of survival [Johnson: 2018]. While the result of using IGRs is easily observable in overall insect populations and crop conditions, the day-by-day effects and changes that occur within the treated insects are less documented. This study was formulated to provide an in-depth observation of how IGRs affect the growth and development of insects by comparing Manduca sexta larvae treated with an IGR known as azaguard to non-treated larvae. Azaguard blocks the release of ecdysteroidal hormones, which affects the molting and therefore the natural morphogenetic stages that insect larvae usually undergo. Our hypothesis was that if the larvae are treated with azaguard, the independent variable, their ecdysteroid hormones would be blocked and they would be unable to molt, the dependent variable. Inhibiting this process would most likely decrease their overall growth by restricting their ability to support any new external or internal structures, which could potentially lead to death.


Materials and Method:
Method
This experiment was conducted over 13 days using 8 Manduca sexta larvae, all of which were around their 2nd or 3rd instar stage. The larvae were divided into treatment and controll groups, and each group was placed in a 4-celled container with one caterpillar in each cell. Holes were drilled into the sides of the two containers to allow the caterpillars to breathe, and the containers were placed in an incubator at 25℃ with a 24-hour light source. Except for the 11th day, the caterpillars were given fresh food daily and their old food and waste was thrown out. Both groups received 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) feed. The GLM for the controll group was mixed with about 80Ml of distilled water while the GLM for the treatment group was mixed with about 80Ml of the IGR azaguard at a 1: 1 concentration. In addition to being fed, the larvae’s lengths in cm were measured using a standard ruler every day except for the 11th day. Starting on the 6th day, their weight in grams was also measured, except for the 11th day. Once the study was over, their average weights and lengths were compared using a two sample T-Test to determine if the treatment had caused any significent differences in either of the measurements. 


Results:
Results
Both groups saw a drastic spike in length after the second day, which continued to increase for the most part until the 7th day, and then started to gradually decrease. After the 3rd day, the mean length of the treatment group remained slightly smaller than that of the controll group. The average length of the controll larvae over 12 days was 6.68 cm, while the average length for the treatment group over 12 days was 6.12cm. These measurements were compared using a two sample T-Test, which showed no statistical significance in the difference in their weights (t_stat = 1.063676, d.f. = 22, P = 0.299012).
The mean weight of the controll group increased greatly from the 6th day to the 8th, but then followed a general trend down to below their initial measurements. The treatment group saw no drastic increase in weight like the controll group did, remaining consistent from days 6-8 and then decreasing to well below their initial measurements by the final day. The average weight over 7 days for the controll group was 9.52g while the average weight for the treatment group over 7 days was 6.68g. These measurements were compared using a two sample T-Test, which showed that the mean weight of the controll group was statistically greater than that of the treatment group (t_stat = 4.468021, d.f. = 12, P = 0.000384).
On the final day, all the caterpillars showed very little or no movement while in their containers. Control #1 was aggressive to the touch and would convulse when picked up, but none of the caterpillars attempted to crawl away while being measured as they had on the first few days. None of the caterpillars had any poop in their cells, and only controll #1 and controll #4 appeared to have eaten any of their food. 
Within the controll group, all the caterpillars had developed translucent skin, which revealed their beating dorsal hearts. Except for controll #2, which was dark yellow with brown splotches on its skin, all the controll caterpillars were a light green color with a yellow hue.
Within the treatment group caterpillars #3 and #4 were a light green color with a yellow hue and had translucent skin, like that of the controll group. Treatment #2 was also translucent but had a darker yellow color and brown splotches on its skin. Treatment #1 was not as translucent as any of the caterpillars in either group, although the beating heart was slightly visible, and it still had light green color with a blue hue. In the treatment group, the hearts of the caterpillars were beating slower compared to the controll group, with a greater time between pulses and the pulses were less perceptible.  


Discussion:
Discussion
In this study, we found that using azaguard to block levels of ecdysteroidal hormones in Manduca sexta larvae was somewhat effective in regulating their growth. While the lengths of the treatment and controll were not significently different, their weights were. However, this may partially be due more to the fact that the treatment group stopped eating and pooping much earlier in the experiment than to their inability to molt and grow because of the azaguard. By day 5 in the experiment, the treatment group exhibited less movement, less poop, and less appetite than the controll group. Eating so little food for 8 days could have had a larger impact on their final weight than their inability to develop, although their lethargic behavior may have been a result of their treatment. Overall, we could not entirely support or reject our hypothesis for two reasons. Firstly: while the caterpillars significently differed in weight, this measurement was not taken throughout the entire study and the did not significently differ in length, which was taken across the entire study. This data shows that some aspects of the caterpillars’ growth was different in the treatment group compared to the controll group, but it can’t be concluded that these differences occurred because of their inability to molt due to the azaguard. Secondly: none of the caterpillars were observed to be undergoing a molt during the study, meaning that it is uncertain whether the controll exhibited any behavior (i.e. Molting) that the treatment group did not exhibit (i.e. Not molting because of decreased E and 20-E hormone levels from the azaguard). In the end of the study, none of the caterpillars had died, and all of them had undergone similar changes that signaled they were getting ready to pupate. Because the study was terminated before any of the caterpillars pupated, it remains undetermined whether the treatment group would have been physically capable of undergoing pupation or if, hindered by their hormonal imbalance, they would have remained in the pre-pupal stage until they eventually died. This data fails to show whether use of azaguard had any effect on the development of the larvae through their ability to molt.
A previous study by Lawrence Gilbert analyzed the synthesis and effects of different insect hormones, including E and 20-E, on insects such as the Manduca sexta. This study concluded that, among the ecdysteroidal hormones, these two were the primary contributors to the molting process, and that they were affected by factors such as diet, melatonin levels, and PTTH, which is another insect hormone [Gilbert: 2002]. Unfortunately, our study can’t conclusively confirm the results of this study because we were unable to establish a direct correlation between the suppression of E and 20-E with an inability to molt; however, we can contribute that, in addition to regulating molts, the balance of both of these hormones within the Manduca sexta plays a role in its general health and energy level because the caterpillars in our treatment group became sickly and more lethargic compared to those who received no hormonal treatment.
If this study were to be repeated, it should be carried out for a longer period to observe whether the treatment caterpillars would successfully pupate or not. Additionally, the use of length as a measurement of growth should be completely left out because of its inconsistent nature (i.e. some days the caterpillars stretched out more, leading to drastic increases and decreases within the lengths of individual caterpillars from one day to the next). Instead, weight should be used as the primary measurement of growth and should be recorded from day 1. Hopefully, this will provide a more conclusive role of E and 20-E hormones on larval growth.
While it is unknown whether the use of the IGR azaguard will successfully lead to an inability to molt in Manduca sexta larva, it did successfully reduce their movement and appetite. This supports its use in agriculture as a pesticide because it created a condition in which the insects were no longer exhibiting normal behaviors, in this case things like eating crops or travelling from field to field. Additionally, it is unknown whether the azaguard treatment would have eventually led to death, so it is still a possibility that using this IGR as a pesticide would successfully exterminate the undesired insects.
