Title: Color’s nominal effect on the intra and interspecific behaviors of Betta splendins 

Abstract:
Different colors schemes impact the evolution of phenotypic diversity for several species who interact with each other and other species in their environment. Aggression displayed towards certain colors change the rate that these colors develop or disappear. We studied predispositions about color and how they influence aggressive and defensive behaviors between male Betta splendins and members of their own species. We also looked at this trend for bettas in the presence of other fish and compared their levels of aggression with those shown towards the members of its own species. The patterns observed highlight the minimal effect that color morphs have in causing aggressive intra or interspecific competition. 

Introduction:
Intra and interspecific behaviors define how animals respond and interact with members of its own species or members of another species. Researchers study fish behavior by observing their reactions to certain stimuli and conditions. In our experiment, we use Betta splendins because they are known for being aggressive towards members of their own species and other fish species. In fact, they are also known as Siamese fighting fish, and in Southeast Asia, people participate in gambling events where they pit the fish against one another to engage violently [Daugs 1967]. Betta fish are a great study fish for aggression because they display a variety of behaviors towards other fish in their territory, including gill flaring, tail flashing, and chasing their opponent around to exhaust them [Smith: 1945].Our experiment explores how betta fish react in the presence of other fish of a similar size, in this case, Epalzeorhynchos frenatum, also known as the rainbow shark. The different stimulus are the two different fish: a tank with a controll betta and a tank with a rainbow shark. We hypothesize that the betta fish will demonstrate a decreased amount of aggression towards the rainbow shark compared to members of their own species. 

Materials and Method:
We obtained six betta fish, five were experimental fish and one was a controll. We controllled all experimental fish by putting them into the same tank with the same controll betta for five minutes. We added a small amount of We record the amount of gill flair they showed, in seconds, during that five-minute span. Then the fish rested for five minutes in between each trial. We repeated this same process with rainbow shark but alternated which fish the test betta was placed with first. We controllled habituation by alternating the sequence in which the test bettas were exposed to the different stimulus. 

Results:
We found that the test bettas showed an average time of aggression towards the controll betta of 44.5 ± 39.03417 sec/5 min. The test bettas showed an average time of aggression towards the rainbow shark of 10.75 ± 21.5 sec/5 min. The paired t_test we used to compare the two stimuli yielded values of (t=2.83, dF=3, p=.066). The p_value of .066 was insignificent. We had to exclude the data corresponding the second test betta because the times measured  were extreme outliers completely opposite from the trend of our data. Removing this data lowered our p_value significently.

Discussion:
Although our data did show the general trend in aggression that we expected, it was insignificent, making our hypothesis not supported. Our data was not significent because one of the betta fish was hyper aggressive towards the rainbow shark, whereas all the others flared their gills for zero seconds. This unusual event caused the standard deviations to overlap too much to be significent. The insufficient data likely resulted from a combination of the small sample size allowing unusual circumstances to impact the data and the wide variety in aggression levels demonstrated by the test bettas. The trend in our data suggests that the fish may have habituated to the conditions due to the repeated testing, causing them to be less aggressive and produce unrealistic data. Also, the sequence of the stimulus did not seem to affect how the fish reacted. In the future, we could use a much larger sample size, but a more feasible option would be to extend the resting period for the fish in between trials or use fish with a bigger fin size to test whether fin size influences the agnostic behavior of the fish. Testing other intra and interspecific behaviors, such as darting, biting, tail flashing, and dorsal fin flickering among others, could suggest other factors that impact the behavior of rival fish. Our results show that the color of the fish is a nominal factor determining aggressive behavior between members of the same or different species. Another experiment also observed the influence of color on territorial aggression. The study used Amphilophus sagittae, a Neotropical cichlid fish species similar in size and color to the bettas we studied. The study found different results and concluded that the rarer color pattern should benefit from future selection processes because of the behaviors caused by certain color biases [Lehtonen: 2014]. While our study did not suggest the same conclusion, it demonstrated that color was not important to our specific test fish. Yet, our results do show the importance of assessing the frequency of territorial aggression.  Observed biases towards color schemes could affect fitness developments and the rate of diversification among a species. Understanding intra and inter-specific behaviors helps us see how animals may interact among each other and may impact the evolution or selection processes of their opponents.
