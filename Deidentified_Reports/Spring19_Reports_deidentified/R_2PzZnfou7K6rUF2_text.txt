Title: P. Sativum shows increased root:shoot ratios with decreased soil nitrogen levels

Abstract:
This study looks into the resource allocation of nitrogen in P. sativum (field pea) plants.  Plants will change their phenotypes based on the environment around them and their relative access to resources based on phenotypic plasticity.  Root:shoot ratios for both weight and length are an optimal way to analyze the differences in phenotypes of these plants.  We predict that lower levels of nitrogen in the soil will lead to lower root:shoot ratios for both weight and length When placed in different concentrations of nitrogen fertilizer, the P. sativum plants showed a trend where root:shoot ratio would increase as the concentration of fertilizer decreased.  This can be accounted for by the fact that root size in low concentrations of nitrogen increased in order to increase the amount of nitrogen in tissues.  The results of this study provides insight into the best amounts of fertilizer to grow vegetables in based on whether they are root vegetables (less nitrogen) or non-root vegetables (more nitrogen).

Introduction:
Plants are able to grow in all different environments with all different kinds of resources due to a phenomenon called resource allocation.  Resource allocation allows plants to survive in adverse conditions where they may have limited access to necessary resources such as sunlight, water, nitrogen, and carbon [Brown:1997].  With the prevalence of climate change, resource allocation is becoming increasingly important. In today’s constantly changing environment, we will see great changes in plants due to their phenotypic plasticity in order to take in resources and grow at higher rates [Ayres:1993].  Phenotypic plasticity is an extremely important factor in resource allocation as it allows plants to grow differently, for example growing longer roots to absorb more water, in the changing environment. In this study we will look into the resource allocation of P. sativum (field peas) based on the amount of fertilizer they have access to, using field peas due to their fast growth rate and ability to grow well in temperate environments.  Changing the amount of fertilizer alters the amount of nitrogen the P. sativum has access to, which is important because the amount of nitrogen a plant has access to affects both aboveground and belowground biomass production [Sloey:2018].  We hypothesize that with an decreased presence of nitrogen in the soil there should be a higher root:shoot ratio both based on weight and length because the roots will need to be longer in order to absorb more nutrients, making the ratio larger.

Materials and Methods:
We began by obtaining nine planting boxes filled with vermiculite and placed small holes in the boxes (16 holes in each with a 4x4 conformation).  While we set up the planting boxes, we soaked the field pea seeds in water for about 20 minutes and then placed three to four seeds in each hole to ensure growth.  Then we created three different dilutions of MiracleGro®️ fertilizer which is composed of 12% nitrogen, 4% phosphorous, and 8% potassium: 100% fertilizer, 50% fertilizer 50% water, and 25% fertilizer 75% water.  On three of the boxes we poured 250 mL of the 100% concentration, and did the same with the other two concentrations.  We then watered the peas daily for two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks we carefully removed three singular plants from each box, cleaned them off, and measured the weight of the whole plants, the weights of the roots and shoots separately, and the lengths of the longest roots and longest shoots separately to calculate the root:shoot length ratio (=length of longest root/length of longest shoot) and the root:shoot weight ratio (=average weight of roots/average weight of shoots).We performed an ANOVA test for significance.

Results:
The mean root:shoot length ratio as shown in Figure 1 for 100% was 1.49 ± 0.38, for 50% was 1.2 ± 0.15 and for 25% was 0.91 ± 0.13.  The differences here were not significant (Fs=1.028, df=2, P=0.078).   The mean root:shoot weight ratio as shown in Figure 2 for 100% was 1.94 ± 0.50, for 50% was 1.52 ± 0.14, and for 25% was 1.46 ± 0.27. The results here were not significant (Fs=1.775, df=2, P=.248).

Discussion:
The data we received shows trends that would confirm our hypothesis that both weight and length root:shoot ratios would decrease as the concentration of fertilizer increased.  However, the ANOVA test for significance shows that the differences in the data are not significant.  The differences in the length (P=0.078) are more significant than the differences in weight (P=0.248).  A reason that the data trended in favor of our hypothesis could be that in past other studies there is significant evidence that shows that plants grown with higher nitrogen availability have lower root:shoot ratios than those grown with lower soil nitrogen availability because the roots would do more work to absorb nitrogen from the soil which requires more root surface area (thereby increasing root length and weight relative to the shoot) [Hilbert:1990].  A limitation of this study is that the plants only grew for two weeks, lengthening the amount of time for growth could have provided more optimal results,  Additionally, we only had space to grow three boxes worth of plants for each concentration, increasing the amount of plants would provide for more reliable data.  That being said, the general trends of our data were very good despite the data not being significant, and would help to provide insight into the resource allocation of plants in areas that are nitrogen deficient.  In the future, data on resource allocation as a whole could be extremely useful as the climate around us continues to change and resources become less available to plants and we can alter the kind of plants we grow in order to maximize plant growth in agriculture for the population. The results from this study would encourage growing root vegetables in areas with less nitrogen because the trends showed that that increases root growth and  growing non-root vegetables in areas with high nitrogen levels because the trends in our data showed that that increases shoot growth.
