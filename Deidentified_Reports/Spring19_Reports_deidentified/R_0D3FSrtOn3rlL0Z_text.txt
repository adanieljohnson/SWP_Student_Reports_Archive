Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the weight of the Larval Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) play a significant role in the Manduca sexta caterpillars’ growth and development. Within a homeostasis state of a usual caterpillar the JH and the 20E work in harmony to prevent or activate the next stages of the caterpillar’s life cycle. But when the two hormones are altered drastic changes can be observed. This lab focused on how the JH effects the development and growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. Juvenile Hormone was added into the experimental caterpillars’ food source. We hypothesized that when JH was mixed into their food, the weight of the caterpillars would decrease. Although the data showed that there were no significant changes within the weights of the Manduca Sexta’s. The final average weight of the experimental group did not decrease as much as we predicted in comparison to the control’s groups average weight. 

Introduction:
The purpose of the Insect Hormone experiment is to test the effects that occur when Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) are exposed to the Manducta sexta Caterpillars. The IGR’S have been shown to lead to a wide variety of abnormalities within the insects leading to a decrease in their survival rates. This specific experiment focuses on how the juvenile Hormone (JH’s) effect the eight Manduca Sexta larva. JH “plays a key role in the development of” the Manduca Sexta  “from embryo to adult” because it regulates when the stages of molting will occur. [Sandberg, 1975] High levels of JH inhibit the activation of the commitment pulse, “preventing differentiation”. [Sandberg, 1975] Therefore, in the instance where an increase in JH’s is added to the caterpillars’ diets, the molting phases will never occur keeping the specimens in their youthful state. With this excess addition of JH to their diets the larval maturation and its growth cycle will be disrupted. Meaning, if one increases the amount of JH given to the Maduca sexta it will affect that caterpillars the overall weight, causing it decrease. 



Materials and Methods:
During the Insect Hormone experiment we were given eight 11-12-day old Manduca Sexta caterpillars as the specimens for our experiment. At the start of the experiment the caterpillars weighed in between 1.5 grams too 2.5 grams and were split into two groups (four in each). Each group was then placed into their own cell container, featuring four section each, one for each caterpillar. Both groups were placed in a controlled environment at an incubator temperature of 28 degrees Celsius and constant lighting. They were then put on different diets, but both contained 10 Grams of Manduca Sexta food and 60 microliters of a liquid. The first group (the controlled group) contained caterpillar’s 1-4. The control group caterpillars were given 6 drops (60 microliters) of distilled water mixed in within the caterpillar food. The second group (the experimental group) contained caterpillars 5-8. These caterpillars were given 6 drops (60 microliters) of Analog (Precore 1:12:50). Each day for 11 days, we visited the caterpillars and the food was replaced as the Manduca massed. While remeasuring out the food and substance mixed in with it, we also measured the weight of the caterpillars (in grams) and recorded the data and our observations in the groups excel page each day. And then a two-sample t test was used to inspect the data. 



Results:
The control group’s average weight growth was 0.7465 grams per day, while the experimental groups was 0.7425 grams per day. We did a two sample T test in order analyze these results under a different lens. The test suggested that the P-value was 0.475, a number greater than 0.05 meaning that the results were not statistically different. By the results showing insignificance this in return means that the average weight of the control group was also not statistically significant in comparison of the average weight experimental group. 

Throughout this experiment multiple trends surfaced from the statistical results as well as the observations. The caterpillars started out as this vibrant bluish-greenish color and were very active. During week one it was observed that both the experimental and the control groups we’re steadily growing but on average the control group was growing a little bit quicker. The more they grew the more they defecated. During week two our observations shifted and showed that the control group started to slow down in terms of movement and weight gain. The Manduca also started to develop a maroonish and brownish cocoon, while the experimental group semi remained a greenish color. It wasn’t until the last day of our experiment that the experimental (caterpillars 5-8) started to show signs of color change. The final observation was that the cleanliness of the cells dividers was a lot harder to maintain during the second week.


Discussion:
After reviewing the statistical results, we concluded that the alternative hypothesis was rejected, while the null hypothesis was supported. Since we found no statistical evidence at the 0.05 level, we theorize that the increase of JH didn’t affect the weight/growth rate of the Maduca sexta as we anticipated. Although the earlier trends of the data showed the control group growing at a faster rate than the experimental, they both ended up leveling out and didn’t create big enough gap. Typically, the “maximal larval mass is 11.3 +/- 1.5 grams (StDev), and it has been possible to select for strains that vary in body size (mean maximal larval mass) from 5.9 to 16.1 grams” which is similar to our measurements. [Grunert, 2015] We assume this occurred because we might not have used enough JH droplets within the Caterpillar food. During our experiment we notice that the experimental caterpillars were encountering some slight delaying of some of their natural processes such as molting, reaching the commitment pulse, and pupation. This is due to the JH “exerting a repressive effect on the course of development during the larval life” [Sandberg, 1975] We came to theorize this because the control group had begun its molting process before the experimental even began showing signs. So, if one were to redo our experiment in the future and used a higher concentration of (Precore 1:12:50) such as 10 drops instead of six, our hypothesis would then have been accepted.

Figure 1. This figure depicts the averaged growth Rate of the Maduca sexta caterpillars over the 11 days. The blue bar represents the control group and the orange bar represents the experimental group. We obtained this information by simply averaging the change in weight for each day. The error bars depict the ±1 standard deviation of the data.
