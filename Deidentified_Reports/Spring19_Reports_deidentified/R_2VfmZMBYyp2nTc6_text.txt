Title: Effect of Acetylcholine on the Muscle Response of the Gastrocnemius muscle in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system is a vital part of the way in which organisms carry out daily life. The organism being studied is the leg of the Rania pipiens. The focus will be on the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle itself to model properties of neuromuscular controll. It was hypothesized that if acetylcholine is added to the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of Rania pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response will be increased until it reaches the point of tetanus. Three frog legs were isolated, exposing the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve. Acetylcholine was injected into the treatment group and compared to the controll groups receiving no acetylcholine. A t_test was conducted and yielded a p_value of 0.8346. At an alpha-value of 0.05, the average difference between the means of both the treatment and controll groups was found to be statistically insignificent. Researchers identified that as the shock was distributed to the muscle, it seemed to fatigue quicker. This was most likely due to the sciatic nerve, in which the muscle had to distribute a contraction harder than normal. There was no significent difference with the addition of acetylcholine. 

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is a vital part of the way in which organisms carry out daily life. It works as a series of connections between both the nerves and muscles to enable an organism to respond to their environments within milliseconds. The main focus of the neuromuscular system is in the bodies of animals [Johnson, 2018].
Myofibers are the constituent part of the skeletal system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Each myofibers is consistent of multi-nuclear, fused collective cells. They are bound to connective tissue to create functional groups that are a crucial part of muscle function. Motor neurons also play a practical role, in that they extend into the muscle and innervate each of the myofibers at the neuromuscular junctions [Johnson, 2018].
When a nerve impulse arrives at a neuromuscular junction, it causes a release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal. This neurotransmitter then binds to the receptor, which in turn opens sodium channels that create an action potential in a muscle fiber. This action potential then stretches across the fiber, stimulating the release of calcium ions from storage sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The muscle will then shorten by the activates contractile mechanism [Johnson, 2018].
The organism being studied is the leg of the Rania pipiens. The focus will be on the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle itself to model properties of neuromuscular controll. Researchers conducted an experiment to see how acetylcholine impacts the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of Rania pipiens measures by the neuromuscular response.
A previous study conducted by Kroth et al. worked with the sciatic nerve in a bullfrog. They found that acetylcholine function in the tibial posticus significently reduced inn function after day 10, however, during day 3-10 there were slight differences in acetylcholine activity. This was most likely to a term called fatigue, which many organisms face. The experiment researchers studied was the impact of the addition of acetyl choline to limit the fatigue of the muscle and increase muscle response. 
It was hypothesized that if acetylcholine is added to the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of Rania pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response will be increased until it reaches the point of tetanus.


Materials and Method:
The legs of three Rania pipiens were prepared for the experiment, in which each leg would be tested as the controll and experimental group. The controll group received no acetylcholine, whereas the treatment received 0.1 Ml of 10 mg/Ml concentration of acetylcholine. An injection of acetylcholine into the muscle was used to ensure direct stimulation. The treatment group was used to show the difference that acetylcholine had on the muscle’s neuromuscular response. Researchers isolated the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle using forceps and the Achilles tendon was knotted to be propped onto the FT-302 transducer. A probe was connected to the muscle to record electromyograms produced by the Lab Scribe software. During experimentation, the threshold of each of the legs were determined and shocked three times to record neuromuscular response. The controll received the first three shocks at the threshold and were recorded. Acetylcholine concentration was then injected into the muscle (as stated above) and three more shocks were recorded. The treatment was compared to the controll to see if acetylcholine had a significent difference in neuromuscular controll. Qualitative observations were recorded as well. The measurement of muscle twitches was a suitable substitution for neuromuscular response due to its feasibility to measure with electromyograms. A one-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine if there was a significent difference between the means of the controll group and treatment groups. 

Results:
The thresholds for the leg 1, 2, and 3 were 4.4 volts, 9.3 volts, and 5.0 volts, respectively. The mean maxima for the voltage of leg 1, 2, and 3 [controll, treatment] were [1.123 volts, 1.178 volts], [0.918 volts, 0.792 volts], and [1.078 volts, 1.062 volts], respectively. For Leg 1, the treatment’s neuromuscular response was found to be higher than the controll. For Leg 2, the treatment’s neuromuscular response was found to be lower than the controll. For Leg 3, the treatment’s neuromuscular response was found to be lower than the controll. A t_test was conducted and yielded a p_value of 0.8346. At an alpha-value of 0.05, the average difference between the means of both the treatment and controll groups was found to be statistically insignificent. Qualitative observations were also recorded. Leg 1 appeared to twitch the same with both the treatment and controll. Leg one also appeared to be larger when injected with acetylcholine. Leg 2 displayed, when the sciatic nerve was separated from the muscle, high twitching in the muscle. When the electrical pulses were sent, it did not twitch as much. Leg 3’s twitch appeared to be stronger than before, where both toes and muscle twitched a lot.

Discussion:
The hypothesis stated that if acetylcholine is added to the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of Rania pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response will be increased until it reaches the point of tetanus. This hypothesis was not supported, both descriptively and statistically. From Figure 1, we see that there was difference in variation between the treatment and controll, as mentioned in the results section. The error bars also displayed a cross-pattern, which shows that there was no significent difference in the results. This was supported by the p_value at 0.8346. 
Possible reasons for the results were the actual muscle itself. Researchers identified that as the shock was distributed to the muscle, it seemed to fatigue quicker. This was most likely due to the sciatic nerve, in which the muscle had to distribute a contraction harder than normal. There were also issues pre-experimentation. When disconnecting the sciatic nerve, researchers had to pull it off, causing the muscle to twitch several times before starting the experiment. This would cause the muscle to start to fatigue at a quicker rate, leaving the experiment with a less active muscle. Some of the muscles could have reached this stage more or less than the other, causing variation in the results. This could still mean that acetylcholine has an impact on the muscle by increasing its neuromuscular response, but the gastrocnemus muscle’s that researchers used could have impacted its overall pattern. 
Previous research by Kroth et al. worked with the sciatic nerve in a bullfrog. They found that acetylcholine function in the tibial posticus significently reduced inn function after day 10, however, during day 3-10 there were slight differences in acetylcholine activity. Researches who conducted the BIO113 Lab found that there was very little difference with the addition of acetylcholine, however, the idea of fatigue was supported, however, not overtime as the experiment showed. 
Future study could involve isolating the sciatic nerve using a more non-tactile method to limit the amount the muscle moves before experimentation. Also, different concentrations of acetylcholine could impact the muscle response significently if the previous statement were achieved. Determining these factors would optimize the function of the muscle response in Rania pipiens.
