Title: Effects of Nicotine on the Twitch Threshold of Frog legs

Abstract:
The neurovascular system in animals controls their response to stimuli broadly through muscles and nerves. Often, animals other than humans are used to study how different factors can affect that control and how fast it occurs. This data helps us learn more about our own muscle control. A commonly studied frog, the rana pipiens, contains many similarities to humans concerning muscles and nerves. Here we look at the effect of nicotine on the twitch threshold of three frog legs. Our expected result is if we inject the frog leg with nicotine, then the twitch threshold will be lower than that of the control. Our data revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the control group and experimental group, supporting the null hypothesis. This suggests that nicotine does not actually lower the twitch threshold. With these results, we can conclude that more experiments need to be done to find out exactly what the effect of nicotine actually is on the body. It is important for us to study muscle and nerve control because it can help lead to new discoveries that help find important cures to diseases.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow animals to respond to stimuli through the neurovascular system. They do this by using neurons. These neurons then send nerve impulses or waves of electrical and chemical activity through the body [“How does the…” n.d.]. The nerve impulses signal your body to respond to the stimuli. Frog (Rana pipiens) legs are frequently studied to observe how different factors will affect the twitch threshold and amplitude of muscles and nerves because the muscles and nerves of frogs are similar to humans. Frog leg muscles have nerves and muscles that respond to stimuli similarly to humans. By learning more about frog muscles, or any type of animal’s muscles, we learn more about our own muscles. Outside substances such as nicotine can drastically affect animals muscle abilities by causing narrowing of the arteries and reducing the flow of blood to muscles. In order to measure this difference, scientists use electrophysiology recording equipment to manipulate, observe, and measure the twitches. Specifically, in the frog leg we will place the probe from the electrophysiology recording equipment underneath the sciatic nerve and control the stimulus that is applied to the nerve. The sciatic nerve is composed of many nerve fibers and controls some muscle control [Johnson: 2016]. We hypothesized that if we inject the frog leg with nicotine, then the twitch threshold will be lower than that of the control.

Materials and Methods:
We dissected the three frog legs with access to gastrocnemius muscle. We inserted the probe from the electrophysiology recording equipment under the sciatic nerve in order to measure the twitch threshold at different stimulus levels for the control. Then, we injected 0.1 mL of nicotine into the leg, making it the experimental. After waiting one minute, we will reset the twitch threshold (hundredths) and measure the amplitude at different stimulus. We repeated this procedure on the other two legs. The independent variable in our experiment was nicotine and the dependent variable was the twitch threshold. After collecting all the data from the three trials, we used the paired t-test to analyze our data and see if was statistically significant.

Results:
The average amplitude for our control frog legs was 0.26mV and the average amplitude for our experimental frog legs was 0.156mV (Fig 1). The average amplitude for all of our results was 0.2mV. The standard deviation of the control group was 0.09 and the standard deviation of the experimental group was 0.04. This is shown by error bars in Figure 1. We used the paired t-test to see if this data was statistically significant. Our p-value was 0.7, which tells us our data was not statistically significant and could just be due to chance.  Overall, we cannot say our data was significant due to our results not having a statistical p-value under 0.05. 

Discussion:
In this experiment, by using electrophysiology recording equipment we were able to measure the twitch threshold from under the sciatic nerve and find If our hypothesis was statistically significant. Our hypothesis was if we inject the frog leg with nicotine, then the twitch threshold will be lower than that of the control. We found that our data could just be due to chance because it was not statistically significant. In order to be sure, we could conduct more trials since visibly we can see that there was a small change in the experimental group when compared to the control group. Although by just looking at the averages there was a difference, since it is not statistically supported, we have to look at other explanations. Specifically, the nicotine could not have a significant effect on muscles. It is also possible human error, such as the probe being placed in the wrong spot on the frog leg, could have skewed the results. In a study conducted on Rabbit Corpus Cavernosum, it was found that the effect of nicotine on the muscles and nerves was significant. The strips tests revealed that high concentrations of nicotine cause contraction [Nguyen: 2015]. This study goes to show that it is probable that in the procedure a human error was made, and our results did not correctly reflect the effect nicotine has on muscles. Nicotine causes narrow arteries and reduce the flow of blood to muscles. This also furthers our hypothesis. Another experiment worth considering after this is to test nicotine’s effects on the brain. A study in 2009 revealed that if nicotine was as prone to bind to the muscle as the brain, it would be deadly [“Why Nicotine Prefers…” n.d.]. Still, its effects on the brain are large and learning more about them could led to new discoveries. Overall, learning more about nicotine’s effects on different parts of the body will help us learn more about muscle and nerve control.
