Title: The Effects of Caffeine on the Amplitude of the Gastrocnemius Muscle Contractions of Rania Pipiens 

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of caffeine on the amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle contraction of Rania pipiens. It was hypothesized that caffeine, which stimulates the release of calcium, would increase the amplitude of the muscle contractions. To test our hypothesis, the amplitudes of the muscle contractions were measured without treatment. Then, the amplitudes of the muscle contractions after the injection of caffeine were recorded. After a Paired T-Test was used, we observed that there was no significent difference between the Control group and the Experimental Group because our P value was slightly greater than 0.05. Therefore, we concluded that the presence of caffeine did not affect the amplitude of the muscle contractions of Rania pipiens due to too small of a sample size; since our P value was so close to 0.05, increasing the sample size would likely bring significance.  



Introduction:
Rania pipiens, also known as the Northern Leopard Frog, belongs to the subgenus PantheRania and ranges in length from 5 to 11 centimeters. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. These motor neurons extend into a muscle and then branch out to innervate several myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. A nerve stimulates muscle contraction through a process called excitation-contracting coupling, which involves the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (Ach) [Johnson AD: 2018]. After action potentials travel along the axon and depolarization causes acetylcholine to bind to receptors on the membrane of muscle fibers, calcium is released. Calcium activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, and myosin thick filaments use energy from ATP cleavage to walk along actin thin filaments. The movement of millions of myosin heads over and over causes the entire myofiber to shorten, or contract. Re-uptake of Ca2+ back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum allows the muscle fiber to relax once again [Hoock 1995]. It is important to note that a motor unit cannot exert maximal contractile force forever. The state of maximal sustained contraction is known as tetanus, and if a muscle is stimulated for long enough, it will fatigue. Through the fatiguing process, a muscle will run out of ATP and the actin and myosin cross-bridges will separate [Johnson AD: 2018].
In this experiment, we tested how the presence of caffeine, which stimulates Ca2+ release, will affect the amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle. A similar study conducted in 2011 tested how caffeine affected the amplitude and rate of skeletal muscle contraction using the frog sciatic nerve-gastrocnemus muscle model, along with the effects of acetylcholine, atropine, nifedipine, magnesium chloride, and calcium gluconate. The findings implied that caffeine caused a dose dependent significent increase in the force of contraction and duration of contraction of skeletal muscle [Olorunshola: 2011.] Thus, we hypothesized that the presence of caffeine will increase the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing for the gastrocnemus muscle to contract and the amplitude of the contraction to increase.


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we isolated the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from this organism in order to demonstrate basic properties of neuromuscular controll. Three frog legs were skinned and moistened with frog Ringer’s solution. The inner thigh muscles were gently separated, beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. Using a dissecting needle and forceps, the white sciatic nerves were gently freed from the attaching connective tissue. The gastrocnemus muscle was then suspended from a 90 degree angle, and the LabScribe probe used to detect amplitude was placed directly into the gastrocnemus muscle. In the controll group, the frog legs received no treatment, but the amplitude was observed. In the experimental group, the frog legs received an injection of 200 millimoles of caffeine per Liter, and the same variables were measured as described above (amplitude). At each trial, the initial amplitude was set to 1.0 V and the pulse width was 5 ms. Once the data was collected, a Paired T-Test was used to determine if the effects of caffeine were significent or not on the amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle. 

Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the average maximum amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle before injection was 0.603 V. However, the average maximum amplitude of the muscle after caffeine injection was greater, with a value of 1.184 V. Therefore, the average maximum amplitude increased after caffeine was injected into the frog legs. After conducting a Paired T-Test, we found that the P-Value was 0.072225, which is slightly greater than 0.05; as a result, our experimental results were not significently different from our controll group and the relationship between caffeine and muscle contraction cannot be determined from our experiment. 

Discussion:

	The amplitudes of the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens were measured, both with and without the treatment of caffeine. After conducting a Paired T-Test, it was determined that there was no significent difference between the contractions of the frog legs injected with and without caffeine; the controll and experimental groups were not significently different from one another. Therefore, caffeine had no effect on the amplitudes of contractions, and we rejected our hypothesis that the presence of caffeine, which stimulates Ca2+ release, will increase the amplitude. Since our P-value is so close to 0.05, a bigger sample size would most likely have brought significance to our experiment. Specifically, if we had isolated six gastrocnemus muscles and measured the amplitudes of contraction, then we could have accepted our hypothesis because the same size would have been large enough to bring significance. In a similar experiment conducted in 1995, scientists also found that caffeine did not affect single slow muscle contraction of the frog Rania temporaria; the amplitude of contractions evoked by caffeine concentrations were ultimately unaffected after conducting statistical tests, as also proven by the experiment my lab partners and I conducted [Hoock 1995].
