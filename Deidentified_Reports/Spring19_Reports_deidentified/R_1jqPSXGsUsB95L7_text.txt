Title: Effect of Acetylcholine on the Muscle Response of the Gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system is a vital part of the way in which organisms carry out daily life. The organism being studied is the leg of the Rana pipiens. The focus will be on the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle itself to model properties of neuromuscular control. It was hypothesized that if acetylcholine is added to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response will be increased until it reaches the point of tetanus. Three frog legs were isolated, exposing the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve. Acetylcholine was injected into the each leg, after obtaining threshold, to test for a difference between neuromusclular reponse with and without the presence of the neurotransmitter. with A paired t-test was conducted and yielded a p-value of 0.8346. At an alpha-value of 0.05, the average difference between the means of both the treatment and control groups was found to be statistically insignificant. Researchers identified that as the shock was distributed to the muscle, it seemed to fatigue quicker. There was a very incoherent pattern between the treatment and control, which showed no significant difference with the addition of acetylcholine. 

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is a vital part of the way in which organisms carry out daily life. It works as a series of connections between both the nerves and muscles to enable an organism to respond to their environments within milliseconds. The main focus of the neuromuscular system is in the bodies of animals [Johnson, 2018]. Myofibers are the constituent part of the skeletal system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Each myofibers is consistent of multi-nuclear, fused collective cells. They are bound to connective tissue to create functional groups that are a crucial part of muscle function. Motor neurons also play a practical role, in that they extend into the muscle and innervate each of the myofibers at the neuromuscular junctions [Johnson, 2018]. When a nerve impulse arrives at a neuromuscular junction, it causes a release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Acetylcholine then binds to the receptor, which in turn opens sodium channels that create an action potential in a muscle fiber. This action potential then stretches across the fiber, stimulating the release of calcium ions from storage sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The muscle will then shorten by the activates contractile mechanism. This serves to show the impact that Acetylcholine has on neuromuscular response. [Johnson, 2018]. The organism being studied is the leg of the Rana pipiens. The focus will be on the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle itself to model properties of neuromuscular control. Researchers conducted an experiment to see how acetylcholine impacts the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens measures by the neuromuscular response. A previous study worked significantly with the sciatic nerve researchers in Bio114L used. Kroth et al. worked with the sciatic nerve in a bullfrog. Early in the experiment, they exposed fairly fresh tibial posticus to acetylcholine. Tests indicated that the acetylcholine had a significant difference in the function of the muscle for the first ten days. Once the legs were exposed for longer than 10 days, there were abnormalities that suggestively reduced the function of the muscle contraction [Kroth et al:2017]. Not only does this study show that there is a difference in neuromuscular response between muscles exposed and/or not exposed to acetylcholine, it provides evidence that muscles have some type of “fatigue” effect. More exposure to contraction can tire the muscle, even after an injection of acetylcholine. Based off this study, researchers in BIO114L premeditated the impact of the addition of acetylcholine to limit the fatigue of the muscle and increase muscle response. It was hypothesized that if acetylcholine is added to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response will be increased until it reaches the point of tetanus.

Materials and Methods:
The legs of three Rana pipiens were prepared for the experiment, in which each leg would be tested as the control and experimental group. The control group received no acetylcholine, whereas the treatment received 0.1 mL of 10 mg/mL concentration of acetylcholine. An injection of acetylcholine into the muscle was used to ensure direct stimulation. The treatment group was used to show the difference that acetylcholine had on the muscle’s neuromuscular response. Researchers isolated the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle using forceps and the Achilles tendon was knotted to be propped onto the FT-302 transducer. A probe was connected to the attached to the sciatic nerve to record electromyograms produced by the Lab Scribe software. During experimentation, the threshold was a representative number that explained the minimum membrane voltage needed to excite the muscle cells of the Rana pipiens. During the procedure, each of the legs were determined and shocked three times to record neuromuscular response. The control received the first three shocks at the threshold and were recorded. Acetylcholine concentration was then injected into the muscle (as stated above) and three more shocks were recorded. These “shocks” were designed by sending electricity through a probe to equate the three contractions to one another. The muscle was shocked according to the methods above. The treatment was compared to the control to see if acetylcholine had a significant difference in neuromuscular control. Qualitative observations were recorded as well. The measurement of muscle twitches was a suitable substitution for neuromuscular response due to its feasibility to measure with electromyograms. A paired t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the means of the contraction amplitudes before and after injection. 

Results:
The thresholds for the leg 1, 2, and 3 were 4.4 volts, 9.3 volts, and 5.0 volts, respectively. The average difference (AvgTreatment-AvgControl) between the first leg was 0.055, the second leg was -0.126, and the third leg was -0.016. A paired t-test was conducted and yielded a p-value of 0.6371 and t-value of 0.5508 at d.f.=2.  At an alpha-value of 0.05, by established criteria, this difference is considered to not be statistically significant. Qualitative observations were also recorded. Holistically, the legs didn’t act in the same manner. Leg one showed a positive difference between the treatment and the control, whereas legs two and three displayed a negative difference between the treatment and the control. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis stated that if acetylcholine is added to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana pipiens, then the maximum value of its neuromuscular response will be increased until it reaches the point of tetanus. This hypothesis was not supported, both descriptively and statistically. From Figure 1, we see that there was difference in variation between the treatment and control, as mentioned in the results section. By conventional criteria, the difference would be considered not statistically significant at a p-value of 0.6371.  Researchers identified that as the shock was distributed to the muscle, it seemed to fatigue quicker. This was most likely due to the sciatic nerve, in which the muscle had to distribute a contraction harder than normal. There were also issues pre-experimentation. When disconnecting the sciatic nerve, researchers had to pull it off, causing the muscle to twitch several times before starting the experiment. This would cause the muscle to start to fatigue at a quicker rate, leaving the experiment with a less active muscle. Some of the muscles could have reached this stage more or less than the other, causing variation in the results. This could still mean that acetylcholine has an impact on the muscle by increasing its neuromuscular response, but the gastrocnemius muscle’s that researchers used could have impacted its overall pattern. Based on previous research provided by Johnson and Kroth et. al, researchers know that acetylcholine has a significant difference on neuromuscular response when injected in muscles. Our incoherent results indicated a discrepancy within our study and theirs. There was clearly some difference, as we yielded no true pattern with exposure of acetylcholine to the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle. It was determined that there was very little difference with the addition of acetylcholine, however, the idea of “fatigue” was supported by Kroth et al.’s experiment. It was concluded that we needed to study this field more carefully to see what is exactly going on. Future study could involve isolating the sciatic nerve using a more non-tactile method to limit the amount the muscle moves before experimentation. Also, different concentrations of acetylcholine could impact the muscle response significantly if the previous statement were achieved, and possibly changing the muscle every trial to eliminate a fatigue factor. Determining these factors would optimize our knowledge on the function of acetylcholine on neuromuscular response.
