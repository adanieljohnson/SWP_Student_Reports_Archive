Title: Comparing the directionally proportional relationship of intraspecific agonistic behaviors in Betta splendens and turbidity of environments

Abstract:
This lab studies agnostic intraspecific behavior, displays between two of the same species, of Betta splendens. Bettas, a territorial species, commonly partake in agonistic behavior when in the presence of another fish. In a turbid environment, a betta will not be able to detect its surroundings as well due to low-visibility. We hypothesize that if two male bettas are put in the same turbid environment there will be less aggressive behavior than in a clear environment.  We gathered six fish and separated them into three groups of two.  Each set of fish were placed together in a clear water environment and a turbid water environment, with five minutes of rest between the two tanks. Their agonistic behavior was measured through time spent flaring their gills and creating the red “mane.” When the fish started attacking each other they were separated immediately, so in order to obtain even results a ratio was created from dividing the amount of time the gills were flared by the amount of total time spent in the tank. The ratio of agonistic behavior to tank time for the clear water was approximately 0.2 seconds greater than the turbid water. The p-value was 0.017, supporting our hypothesis. Future experiments could observe bettas in the same environments, but rather with a female. 

Introduction:
This lab studies the way an animal sees the world and stimuli around it. Various stimuli may include turbidity of an environment, surrounding ecosystems, or presence of another organism. There are two different types of behaviors an animal exhibits in the presence of another animal; intraspecific and interspecific agonistic behaviors. We will be observing agnostic intraspecific behaviors, display in the presence of other males of their own species, of Betta splendens in this lab. The territorial nature of Betta splendens allow them to be easily excited by another male of their own species, and commonly change color and display agonistic behaviors [Lynn: 2007]. Aggression represents a competition for resources and its benefits vary from intrinsic value and abundance of resources, including females. But there happen to be many costs to aggressive intraspecific behaviors, such as, risk of potential injury and energy depletion. There are two different types of movements a betta can display, broadside and facing movements, with facing being more aggressive. In this experiment we decided to test the relationship between aggressiveness of Betta splendens and turbidity of the environment. Bettas are commonly found in ditches, ponds, or rice paddies, environments that are commonly murkier or more turbid [Bronstein: 1981]. We hope to discover if the behavior of the betta differs in their native environment versus a clear environment. We hypothesize that if two male bettas are put in the same turbid environment, due to the lower visibility and inability to detect each other, there will be less aggressive behavior than in a clear environment. 


Materials and Methods:
We used six Betta splendens and split them into three sets of two. We used two types of tanks in this experiment, one tank was clear water and the second tank had five drops of green food coloring to simulate a turbid environment. In order to gather data on aggressiveness, we observed one specific behavior of bettas, the most aggressive, called the red “mane.” This was made when bettas protruded the branchiostegal membrane located under their opercula. We timed the amount of time the red “mane” was present by stopping and starting a stopwatch. As soon as the bettas started physically attacking each other they were immediately separated and the trail was ended. The total time of a present red “mane” was divided by the amount of time the bettas spent in the tank to get a ratio for comparison. The first set of betta fish had their first trial in clear water. After five minutes of rest, the fish were moved to the turbid water and observed. The second set of betta fish also had their first trial in clear water then were moved to turbid water after five minutes of rest. The third set of fish started in the turbid water then were moved to the clear after five minutes of rest in order to avoid habituation. After the three trials, the ratios were averaged and a paired t-test was run with a 0.05 alpha value.


Results:
The betta fish displayed more aggressive behavior in the clear water than in the turbid water. The ratio of gill flare time to time spent in tank average for the clear water was 0.403 +/- 0.184 seconds. The average for the turbid water was 0.242 +/- 0.174 seconds.  The average ratio for clear water was about 0.2 second greater than the turbid water, as seen in Figure 1. A paired t-test was run from the raw data and there was a significant increase in the ratio (t=3.51 df=5 p=0.017). 


Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis. The average ratio of gill flare time to tank time p-value was significant. Betta splendens display agonistic intraspecific behaviors in the presence of another male of their species. This lab found that if they bettas are placed in an environment with lower visibility then they may have a better chance of survival. The bettas in the turbid water did not display as aggressive behaviors as the bettas in the clear water. When a betta feels threatened for their own territory, especially by another male of their own species, they commonly display very aggressive behaviors like the gill flare. If a betta can not see its surroundings as well, and thus detect other fish around them, they will not feel as threatened and thus save energy and not run of the risk of losing their life in a fight with a larger fish [Lynn: 2007]. We believe this is why bettas commonly reside in dark, murky waters like ditches, ponds, and rice paddies. It it more beneficial to the life of bettas to reside in turbid water than clear in order to save energy and prevent agonistic behaviors. In future experiments, we could explore how bettas act in turbid water with another female present in the tank to see if it changes their behavior.
