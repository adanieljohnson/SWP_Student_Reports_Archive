Title: Increases in Levels of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta Larvae Lead to Developmental Effects which Prevent Pupation 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a type of insect which progresses from larvae to adult via metamorphosis during pupation. Manduca sexta employs two hormones of interest during this metamorphosis: ecdysone (E20) and juvenile hormone (JH), the latter of which and its effects on pupation are the primary focus of this experiment. JH levels in juvenile Manduca sexta were increased in order to determine its effects on growth and development. PreCore 1:1250 solution was added to the diet of the treatment group, and it was determined that the hypothesis, that increased levels of JH would prolong the fifth instar stage of larval development such that the larvae would not pupate, was supported. While three out of four of the control group larvae had begun pupation by the termination of this experiment, none of the four treatment larvae showed signs of pupation at the end of the 12-day experimental period. The treatment larvae increased in weight more than the control larvae (t-value =1.549, df = 6, p= 0.17), and in length more than the control larvae (t-value = 1.53, df = 6, p-value = 0.18). Thus, it was determined that increasing levels of JH in the treatment group larvae caused a lack of commitment pulse which not only caused the larvae to molt into a “sixth instar,” but also prevented the 

Introduction:
treatment larvae from pupating.


The Manduca sexta is a species of insect which follows a homometabolous growth cycle. This growth mechanism consists of four life stages: an egg stage followed by a larval stage with five growth instars,  a pupation, and finally, the emergence of the adult organism, as shown in Figure 1 (Johnson: 2018).

This particular species produces two hormones of interest which greatly impact the growth and development of the larvae: ecdysone (E20) and juvenile hormone (JH). E20 mediates the timing of the molt in larvae (Johnson: 2018), while JH determines whether a larvae molts into another instar, or larval stage, or if it molts into a pupa (Johnson: 2018).
	
While each hormone is secreted independently of each other, E20 and JH work together in the maturation of larvae to adult. The concentrations of E20 and JH relative to each other determine when a larva moves from the fifth larval instar to the pupal stage. During this critical period, the concentrations of JH and E20 are very low and close together, with a sudden decline in JH followed by a very small spike in JH levels known as the commitment pulse (Sanburg: 1975). The presence of the commitment pulse causes the larva to pupate, thus beginning its metamorphosis into an adult (Nijhout: 1974). Research done by Sanburg  and Nijhout sparked an interest in exploring the effects of JH on the commitment pulse and subsequent pupation. Researchers in this experiment aimed to build upon Nijhout’s findings that JH was related to the pupation of the Manduca sexta larvae. Thus, researchers chose to manipulate the levels of JH in juvenile Manduca sexta in order to more fully understand the role of JH on development, specifically the pupal transition from larva to adult. This experimental design will involve administration of additional JH to a treatment group of Manduca sexta larvae to increase their levels of JH relative to an untreated control group. It is hypothesized that increasing the levels of JH in Manduca sexta larvae will prolong the larval stage to the extent that the larvae will ultimately fail to pupate.




Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, eight Manduca sexta larvae were arbitrarily divided into two groups of four larvae each; one group was designated as the control and the other was designated as the group to receive treatment. The control group was fed ten grams of appropriate diet prepared according to the package instructions, and the treatment group was fed ten grams of appropriate diet with six added drops of PreCore 1:1250 solution, which was the source of JH used in this experiment. Each larva was weighed and measured each day, and each measurement was recorded. Researchers chose to track weight and length of larvae because both measurements are easily obtained and weight and length are both optimal proxy measurements for development. Additionally, case studies like that of Nijhout (1974) show that Manduca sexta typically mature to certain sizes, so there exists credible literature to which the present experiment can be compared. All larvae were kept in identical conditions of a 12 hour light, 12 hour dark schedule at a constant temperature. The statistical test used to determine the extent of correlation between increased levels of JH and effects on the growth of the larvae was a two-tailed T-test. 
	
The transformation of the data from raw data to summarized data involved determining which measurements to statistically analyze. The raw data, which was the weight and length of each larva each day, was averaged per day, and the days on which each group of larvae were longest and heaviest were determined. Then the difference between this weight or length and the weight or length of the larvae on the first day was calculated and statistically analyzed via a two-tailed T-test.

Results:
In general, the treatment group gained more weight and increased in length more than the control group. By the 12th day, two of the four control group larvae were fully pupated, and one was partially pupated. In comparison, by the 12th day, none of the four treatment group larvae had begun to pupate. Treatment group larva T7 began to look less pigmented than the other treatment group larvae on the seventh day, and continued to be more white than blue throughout the course of the experiment.
	

Overall, a noticeable data trend was that the daily growth, both in length and weight, of the control group increased until about the seventh or eighth day, then began to decrease again, while in general the daily growth of the treatment group increased throughout the course of the experiment. This is why weight change from the first day to the heaviest or longest day, on average, was decided upon as the measurement to statistically evaluate in order to have an appropriate comparison between the groups.
	

In Figure 2, the weight change for the control group larvae from the first day of the experiment to the day on which the larvae were heaviest, on average, was plotted.

In Figure 3, the change in length for the control group larvae from the first day to the day on which the larvae were longest, on average, was plotted.

In Figure 4, the change in weight for the treatment group larvae from the first day to the day on which the larvae were heaviest, on average, was plotted.

In Figure 5, the change in length for the treatment group larvae from the first day to the day on which the larvae were longest, on average, was plotted.

The statistical test chosen for this experiment was a two-sample t-test in order to compare data between the control group and the treatment group. This test supported the general trends described above, such as the increased weight gain by the treatment group as compared to the control group (t-value = 1.549, df = 6, p-value = 0.17). Additionally, the observation that the treatment group increased in length more than the control group was supported by statistical values (t-value = 1.53, df = 6, p-value = 0.18).

Discussion:
Prior to the start of the experiment, it was hypothesized that increasing the levels of JH in Manduca sexta larvae would cause the larvae to fail to pupate. While three out of four of the control group larvae had begun pupation, which was evident by the presence of a dark brown, hard cuticle, none of the four treatment group larvae showed any signs of pupation by the conclusion of the experiment. Additionally, the statistical analysis of the change in weight and length support the hypothesis, as p-values for both weight and length were greater than 0.05, which implies that the difference in growth between the control group and the treatment group was statistically significant. 
	
In the control group, since JH levels were not manipulated, it can be assumed that standard hormonal levels for a juvenile Manduca sexta were present, as shown in Figure 6.

As shown by Figure 6, point B indicates the commitment pulse, which is characterized by low levels of JH and E20 relative to prior hormone levels. Thus, since three out of four of the control group larvae had begun pupation by the termination of the experiment, the commitment pulse occurred in the control group larvae. The increased levels of JH in the treatment group larvae prevented the commitment pulse from occurring, which in turn prevented the larvae from pupating. This conclusion can be used to explain another general phenomenon observed during the course of the experiment: the treatment group larvae were statistically larger in length and weight than the control group. Since the treatment group was exposed to high levels of JH throughout the course of the experiment and thus never experienced a commitment pulse, the larvae continued to grow and thus molted into a “sixth instar” instead of molting into a pupa, which explains why the treatment group was larger. 
	
Additional literature exists supporting these results, most notably another experiment concluding that increasing levels of JH in fifth instar Manduca sexta larvae was successful in extending the larval period and thus preventing the start of the pupation stage (Nijout: 1974). Such findings support the results of the present experiment: Increasing JH levels will prevent the pupation of the Manduca sexta larvae.
	
Although the hypothesis was supported, there are still further directions of study which attract interest, such as how manipulated levels of not only JH but also E20 would affect a larva’s maturation from juvenile to adult? The next step in the exploration of the role of E20 and JH on the life cycle of the Manduca sexta could be to critically examine not only the nature of each hormone and its impact on the organism but also how these hormones work together to facilitate growth and development of larvae. Certainly the results of the present experiment invite further studies into the effects of E20 and JH on the maturation and life cycle of the Manduca sexta larvae.
