Title: The Effects of Precor on Manduca Sexta Metamorphosis

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta, more commonly known as Tobacco Hornworms, are caterpillars with 4 stages of life which are: Egg, Larvae, Pupa and Adult. For their lifecycle to go from egg to reproductive adult, it takes 2 to 3 weeks [Bollenbacher, 1981]. The two most impactful hormone groups to their life cycle are Juvenile hormones (JH) and Ecdysteroid. The hypothesis for the experiment is that a group of Tobacco hornworms who are fed with a diet consisting of precor, a substance that mimics the Juvenile Hormone, will grow larger than those not having precor in their diet. The experiment fails to reject the null hypothesis, which is that both groups would be statistically the same, due to a p-value of 0.25445563; calculated by using a 1-tailed T-test for significance for the caterpillars’ weight. Although the null hypothesis is not rejected, the experiment can be further improved by using higher concentrations of precor or by having a larger sample size to eliminate potential outliers.

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta, more commonly known as Tobacco Hornworms, are caterpillars with 4 stages of life which are: Egg, Larvae, Pupa and Adult. For their lifecycle to go from egg to reproductive adult, it takes 2 to 3 weeks [Bollenbacher, 1981]. The two most impactful hormone groups to their life cycle are Juvenile hormones (JH) and Ecdysteroid. Juvenile hormones are naturally secreted in Manduca Sexta which allows them to grow and pupate. The Juvenile hormone also determines the type of molting that the caterpillar will undergo [Vince, 1977]. The Ecdysteroid hormone pushes metamorphosis, regulating the timing for the transition to adult for the caterpillar. The commitment pulse is the signal for the caterpillar to pupate as it has the adequate size and storage of nutrients. Juvenile hormones and Ecdysteroid work inversely together where can only be high concentration of one but not both at a given time [Johnson, 2016].
	Precor, commercially marketed as methorprene, mimics the effects of Juvenile hormones and is considered an Insect Growth Regulator. Precor is naturally found in the Blue floss flower which is considered a natural weed worldwide, native to Mexico [Johnson, 2016].
	The hypothesis for the experiment is that the caterpillars treated with precor will grow larger than those not treated. This is due to the correlation between high levels of juvenile hormones and caterpillars not going through pupation. Therefore, it was assumed that if the caterpillars didn’t pupate, they would continue eating and growing until death. The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference between the precor treated caterpillars and those not treated.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, all caterpillars were kept in the same incubator with a temperature changing setting that was done to replicate a regular day, with 24 hours of constant light for eight days. 
Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars were obtained and separated into 2 groups of 4 caterpillars. Two bins with 4 rearing jars were also obtained and each rearing jar was numbered 1-8. The first bin numbered 1-4 was designated for the control and the second bin was for the experimental group. 
Each group was fed one of the following diets: Control Diet: 40g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) food were measured. The 40g were divided equally into 4 balls of 10g each. 10 drops of water (approximately 100 µL) of distilled water were added to each ball of GLM food. The mixture was then stirred and compacted into a single clump. The mixtures were then put into a control worm’s individual container. 40g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) food were measured. The 40g were divided equally into 4 balls of 10g each. 10 drops of water (approximately 100 µL) of distilled water were added to each ball of GLM food. 10 drops of diluted precor (approximately 100 µL, concentration 1:1250) were also added to each ball of GLM food. The mixtures were then stirred and compacted into a single clump, being placed into an experimental worm’s individual container.	
For 8 consecutive days (counting the preparation day as the first), all the caterpillars were measured in length (cm) and in weight (g). Each day their jars were cleaned, and a new mixture of food was made.


Results:
Both the control and experimental groups had 2 outliers. For each group the caterpillar with the highest and lowest weight were outliers after calculating both their means and standard deviation as seen in Table 1. On the eighth day, caterpillar 8, or the 4th experimental caterpillar died, but length and weight were still recorded. The data for length (cm) was not used due to the inconsistencies while recording as some caterpillars would extend or shorten in a defense mechanism.

Discussion:
The groups hypothesis, caterpillars treated with precor will grow larger than those not treated, was not supported with the data from the experiment. A p-value of 0.25445563 was calculated by using a 1-tailed T-test for significance for the caterpillars’ weight, meaning that there was no statistical significance between the two groups. With the data provided we can only say that we are approximately 75% sure that the difference between the groups isn’t due to random chance alone, which isn’t enough with an α value of 0.05
	Although our data was not statistically significant, our results are still applicable to the real world. Due to many people considering the Tobacco Hornworm as a pest, our data shows that other methods of dealing with them are potentially better as our data shows a diluted (1:1250) precor solution has no statistical effect on the hornworms. If the experiment were to be continued or redone, a larger sample size would be used to compensate for any outliers in the data. If precor or the JH hormone is the desired independent variable again, then the precor mixture would be done at a higher concentration with the same ratio of drops per drops of water. Juvenile Hormones are known to control pupation and molting, therefore a higher concentration assimilating natural plants would cause an effect [Vince, 1977].
