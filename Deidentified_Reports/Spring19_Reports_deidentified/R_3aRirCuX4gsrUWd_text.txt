Title: Effects of Different Hormones on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects that IGRegulator, gentrol and azaguard have on each other. This was done by breaking the lab into 2 separate parts. The first part tested the effects of gentrol and azaguard by feeding the hormones to 2 manduca each. The control group was given food with only water in it. The caterpillars were then weighed every day for a week. The results were different for both experimental groups, but both were significantly less than the control group. For the second week, the same procedure was used, but the experimental group was tested using IGRegulator hormone. Unfortunately, two of the manduca sexta died for this part of the experiment, but the other two experimental showed significantly higher increase in mass than the control. Thus, both hypotheses were supported.

Introduction:
The manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepdoptera. It goes through a holometabolous life cycle, meaning that it undergoes a metamorphosis from larvae to adult. To go from larvae to adult, the larvae must first pupate, which is prompted by a change in hormones within the insect[Reinecke, 1980]. The experiment performed by the groups over the past few weeks focused on the effects that specific hormones, such as IGRegulator, azaguard, and gentrol, have on the growth of manduca sexta. All three of the listed hormones are considered IGRs, or insect growth regulators, which means that they impact the development of many insects by either inhibiting or enhancing physiological regulatory processes. For example, during the larvae stage of a manduca worm, the juvenile hormone prevents the transformation, or pupation. Thus, the manduca sexta remain stuck in the larvae stage of development. During the first week of the experiment, my group tested the effects of azaguard and gentrol on the growth of new manduca on which no experiments had been conducted. Since gentrol and azaguard are both considered growth inhibitors, the group hypothesized that the resulting weight and length of the manduca sexta should be similar to the initial size and length. My group wanted to determine what would happen to manduca sexta when fed 10g of food, mixed with 5 drops of either the azaguard, gentrol, or tap water. To successfully discover this, the group needed to understand the effects that both hormones have on the manduca sexta. When the manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to the IGRs, azaguard and gentrol, the development and growth of the insects would be inhibited. 
For week two of the experiment, the group decided to test the effects that IGRegulator would have on the growth and development of the manduca sexta. My group determined how 8 drops of juvenile hormone in the food of the manduca sexta would affect the weight and length of the manduca sexta. Unfortunately, for this portion of the lab, we were unable to use new manduca sexta caterpillars, so it was difficult to determine what was a result of this new variable and what was a result of the conditions from the previous week. For example, two of the manduca in the lab died over the course of the second week, but it was unclear whether this was a result of the IGRegulator or the azaguard. To be able to understand completely the results and outcomes of the experiment, the group needed to understand and predict the effects of the IGRegulator, and the hormones from the previous week, on the insect’s growth and development. A concentration of IGRegulator in the food of the manduca sexta caterpillars will result in an increased weight and length in the caterpillars. 


Materials and Methods:
To perform both parts of the lab, the group needed to gather the listed materials: two 4-cell containers, 2 lids, sharpies, “hole” tool, manduca sexta food, spoon, square container, electronic balance, transfer pipets, reagent, the hormones (IGRegulator, azaguard, gentrol), and tap water. After the materials were grabbed, the group prepared the containers. Using the the black plastic took and the orange puncture tool, two holes were created on the side of each cell, through which the manduca sexta could breathe. Next, the cells on the container were labeled properly. Next, the group measured out 10 g of manduca sexta food for all 8 caterpillars. 5 drops of either the tap water, azaguard or gentrol were added to the correct food and mixed completely. Four of the manduca sexta were fed food with tap water. Two were fed food with azaguard, while the other two were fed food with gentrol. Next, the food was placed into the properly labeled cells in the container. After the containers were set up correctly, the group found 8 manduca sexta of similar size and determined their mass and weight. Then, they were placed into their correct cells. Throughout the following week, the group checked on them every day and replaced the food source when necessary. 
For week two of the experiment the same procedure was followed, except this time there was 4 control foods and 4 food with the IGRegulator in it. Additionally, the same 8 caterpillars from the week before were used, so the group did not need to select new caterpillars and determine their size. For this part of the experiment, the caterpillars that were fed the food with the gentrol and azaguard were fed food with the IGRegulator in it, while the control caterpillars remained the same for both parts of the experiment.  

Results:
For the experiment performed during the first week of the lab, the mean change in the mass of the caterpillars that ate food with water, or the experiments control, was 6.31 grams. For the caterpillars fed azaguard, it was 0.42 grams, and for the gentrol, it was 4.65 grams. Both the gentrol and the azaguard were fed only to 2 different caterpillars, while the control was done on 4 different caterpillars. The group used the two-sample t-test to analyze and compare the data. For all pairings of the Tukey-Kramer Test, it was determined that the mean of all three results were significantly different from each other.
The average change in mass for the control caterpillars was 3.4825 g while the average change in the caterpillars fed IGRegulator was 6.55 g. The standard deviation for the control caterpillars mass was 0.964274339 and the standard error was 0.981974714. For the IGRegulator fed caterpillars, the standard deviation was significantly higher, 1.739482682, as was the standard error, 1.318894492. The average change in length for the manduca sexta was 0.925 for the control and 1.25 for the IGRegulator. The difference in change in length between the two was not significant enough.


Discussion:
My group’s hypothesis, that when the manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to the IGRs, azaguard and gentrol, the development and growth of the insects would be inhibited, was supported. The change in mass for the manduca sexta that Additionally, when other labs were performed on manduca sexta using other growth inhibitors, it showed similar results. This could indicate that an imbalance with any known hormones that act as inhibitors results in a significant difference in the size, weight and overall look of the larvae [Johnson, 1989]. 
For the second half of the lab, my group hypothesized that a concentration of IGRegulator in the food of the manduca sexta caterpillars would result in an increased weight and length in the caterpillars. Unfortunately for this portion of the lab, manduca sexta caterpillar 3 and 7 both died within the week, leaving us only with the collected data from 2. For this portion of the experiment, the weight of the larvae fed the hormones increased at an average significantly higher than the control caterpillars. However, for the two caterpillars that did survive, the change in mass could indicate that the effects of the juvenile hormone did force them to grow at a faster rate without allowing for pupation, because unlike the controls, they were not pupating. Thus, we can also conclude that a continuous high rate of JH forces the manduca sexta to remain in the pupation stage longer. A similar study was conducted by Kenji Kiguchi and Lynn Riddiford. They also came to the conclusion that an increase in JH, or IGRegulator because it mimics the same effects, results in a significant change in mass but prevents larval pupation [Kiguchi, 1978].
