Title: Rana Pipien Lab

Abstract:
In this lab, we will isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg and demonstrate basic properties of neuromuscular control.

Introduction:
In this lab, we will isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg and demonstrate basic properties of neuromuscular control. Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to internal and external environments. But the neuromuscular system is different because it responds within milliseconds. These nerves are unique in animals. The skeletal muscle in the vertebrates consist if thousands of myofibers. They are bound together by connective tissue that forms a functional group. The Independent variable is the amount of stimuli or amplitude put into the frog leg. The dependent variable is the reaction of the muscle or the fatigue endured in the gastrocnemius. The null hypothesis is that no reaction will happen in the muscle when an amp is put into it.

Materials and Methods:
Each group is given a Rana pipiens legs to be put in he dissection pan. Using forceps, grab the skin on top of the leg and pull itg down to the side of the foot. After that is done moisten the leg with Ringer's solution. Use a dissecting probe when the leg is moist to separate the inner thigh muscesand make sure it is not the nerve. Free the sciatic nerve from the thigh using a dissecting needle and forceps so it is not damaged. Moisten again with Ringers as needed so the leg does not get dried out.Tie a string around the free muscle and hang it at 90 degrees on the stand. Poke the probe into the muscle lightly that is hanging up. Use pins to hold down the leg part that is in the pan so it does not move around when shocked. When done setting up apply each stimulus amplitude level to the muscle. Observe what occurs and record the number in a table from the myogram. Once you have completed all levels of amps, remove the probe from the gastrocnemius and do the same with he sciatic nerve.


Results:
In the table that show muscle response to different stimulus amplitudes the amplitude of the stimuli applied to the muscle did not show anything until .3 amps. Then the mV decreased as we went up in amps. For the stimulus applied to the sciatic nerve the amps at .2 showed change and the mV stayed around the same amount. In the stimulation rate vs observation chart we noticed that at 25 amps the muscle was at complete tetany and most stimuli after that the frog leg was fatigued. Frogs work fro about 0 to 50 so that they can function. The graph shows 


Discussion:
The hypothesis tested that the sodium channel blocker, 25 mL of lidocaine would inhibit the frog legs reaction to getting shocked. The experiment had places where it could have went wrong when placing the prongs into the leg could change how the shock is delivered, the amount of lidocaine put in each time could have been off which affects the result of the leg.
