Title: Insect Growth Regulators Affect the Ability of the Manduca sexta to Pupate and Increase the Growth Process

Abstract:
Hormones work in tandem in various tasks in organisms, especially in the development through the various life stages. In this study, we look at the effect of changing the level of ecdysterone, a developmental hormone, on the Manduca sexta using insect growth regulators (IGRs). The hypothesis was that the lowering of ecdysterone levels would not affect the growth of the larvae, but it would not allow the larvae to pupate. The data showed that there was a significant difference in the weight and length of the treated larvae in comparison to the control, but they did not pupate, thus partially disproving our hypothesis. This supports the idea that ecdysterones affect the growth pattern of the Manduca sexta. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, or tobacco hornworm, is an insect that goes through a metamorphic development process, or a holometabolous development. In nature, M. sexta eats plants in the Solanaceae family, and can grow up to 12 grams in weight. After reaching the 5th stage of larvae development, the M. sexta pupate in the soil. After going through metamorphosis, adults emerge as moths, and feed on flower nectar [Kanost: 2016].
Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) are substances that negatively affect physiological regulatory processes. These processes would normally determine when different physiological milestones in the insect’s life. These IGRs are not toxic in nature, so the insect is not killed from them; rather, they lead to abnormalities that do not allow the insect to progress naturally, and therefore, survive. The main types of IGRs can either mimic a hormone, causing the process to happen more, or block a process from occurring [Johnson: 2018].
Whether an IGR is mimicking or inhibiting a hormone, the hormone that are being mimicked or inhibited affect the development of the insect. The two main hormones in all insects that control timely development are ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Ecdysterone is released from the prothoracic glands and determine the timing of the molting stages; juvenile hormone is released from the corpus allata and control the type of molting. Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone work together to control the progression of the insect’s development [Johnson: 2018].
In the Manduca sexta, for the first four instars of larvae JH is high. In the fifth instar, the JH drops drastically, and 20E raises slightly, signifying the commitment pulse which is the go-ahead to pupating. As the larvae reaches the pupating stage, ecdysterone stays very high, and after metamorphosis, both ecdysterone and juvenile hormone fluctuate throughout the adult stage [Johnson: 2018]. The main IGRs that would affect the M. sexta would either mimic JH or inhibit 20E receptors from picking up ecdysterone. The purpose of this experiment was to determine what physiological differences, if any, occurred with the inhibition of ecdysterone. Based off the background information, we hypothesized that if the ecdysterone was kept constantly low, the Manduca sexta would develop at a normal rate, but not be able to pupate.


Materials and Methods:
To set up the experiment, eight M. sexta larvae were separated into 2 groups, one control group and one experimental. Each larva’s initial weight and length was recorded, then put into a plastic container with four sections. Oxygen holes were punched into the container to allow for proper respiration. The control group was fed 10 grams of pre-made feed with 10 drops of water. The experimental group was feed 10 grams of pre-made feed with 10 drops of AzaGuard, a 20E inhibitor. The larvae were then placed into an incubator on a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark schedule. The weights and lengths of caterpillar were recorded daily for 14 days, along with observations of pupation. A two-sample t-test was run on the weight and length data to determine if there was a significant change in the respective categories with the addition of the 20E inhibitor.

Results:
At the end of the 14 days, the average length of the control M. sexta larvae was 46.5 millimeters, with a standard deviation of 14.364, while the average length of the experimental larvae was 56.25 millimeters, with a standard deviation of 7.6757. The average weight of the control M. sexta larvae was 2.03 grams, with a standard deviation of 1.2001, while the average weight of the experimental M. sexta was 3.87 grams, with a standard deviation of 1.8496. We ran a two-sample t-test on the average weights and lengths, and there was a significant difference between the two groups in both weight and length (Weight: t-stat = 4.819284, df = 28, P = 2.27 X 10-5; Length: t-stat = 3.892018, df = 28, P = 0.00028). After day 6, the average weights of the larvae were fairly constant, with a little more fluctuation in the experimental group (Fig. 2). The same trend occurred in the length of the larvae, until the final day for the experimental group, when the average length dropped significantly (Fig. 1).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the Manduca sexta larvae would develop at the same rate as the control, but not pupate, was partially disproven; the larvae develop at a faster rate and a larger size, but they did not pupate. The average weights and lengths showed a significant difference at the .05 level, suggesting that AzaGuard did affect the development of the M. sexta larvae. It is known that ecdysterones affect the timing of the molting stages and specific developmental milestones. A study shows that ecdysterones are integral to the pupation process, specifically the formation of the cuticle that is part of the pupa [Sedlak: 1979], suggesting that if the ecdysterone levels are low, the cuticle could not form properly, if it formed at all. 
A modification of the study could be done to determine if the M. sexta would ever pupate. One option is to lengthen the time of the study. M. sexta can take anywhere from 15-18 days to be developed enough to begin pupating [Johnson: 2018]. With the inhibition of ecdysterone, the timing would theoretically be longer. Lengthening the study to 21 or 24 days would give an extra week to see if the larvae would ever pupate. Another experiment is to determine the minimum concentration of inhibitor necessary to stop pupation by creating more experimental groups with different concentrations of AzaGuard in their feed. Decreasing the concentration of inhibitor would allow the concentration of ecdysterone to increase and, theoretically allow for pupation at lower concentrations.
