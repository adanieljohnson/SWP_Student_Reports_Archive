Title: The Presence of a Female Beta splenden and The Cause of an Increase of Aggressive Behaviors of Male Betta splendens

Abstract:
Individuals needing to fight for and defend things such as territory and resources is a common theme throughout the wild and among many different species. Male Beta splendens often show acts of aggression towards other male members of the same species in an attempt to defend their resources and increase their reproductive success.To better understand these interactions, this experiment was designed to test what the presence of female Betas does to the average aggression levels of males. It was hypothesized that if there was a presence of females, then the male Beta fish will exhibit more acts of aggression towards each other than if a female were not present. 3 male Betas were tested twice for average levels of aggression with the presence of a female. The average difference in “aggression score” was used to find a p-value in order to test for significance. The data for the difference in “aggression score” was found to be insignificant and did not support the group’s hypothesis. This could be since the male Betas tested were consistently at low activity levels, leading to the data being skewed. More studies on the interactions between males with the presence of females need to be done in order to further understand the behaviors between members of the same, and different species,

Introduction:
Animals are known to interact with other animals in very different and specific ways. Observing how animals act in certain situations to members of their own species is key to understanding how animals behave in terms of levels of aggression towards other members of their species as well as how they might interact with other animals. The male Beta splenden often show acts of aggression towards other male members of the same species. They sometimes alter the way in which they behave towards other organisms depending on external factors such as physical surroundings, and resource availability. Any lack of resources or surroundings necessary for survival will lead to acts of aggression towards other organisms who themselves hold claim to these amenities. [Dzieweczynski, Earley, Green, Rowland: 2005]  Male Beta fish communicate through signals and movements directed towards other individuals. Often, having an audience other than those involved in the signaling will affect the behavior of the signaler [Matos, Ricardo, McGregor: 2002] In this experiment, we will be focusing on the different effects that the presence of a female Betta fish has on the aggressive behaviors of male Beta fish. We will be observing and objectively quantifying the levels of aggression that male Beta fish exhibit in different situations. The group hypothesized that if there is a presence of females, then the male Beta fish will exhibit more acts of aggression towards each other than if a female were not present.  

Materials and Methods:
The group first acquired three male Beta fish, as well as two female Beta fish; the male Betta fish were labeled 1,2,3 and 1,2 for the female Beta fish. A special fish tank that split the tank into three sections with glass was used to physically separate the fish. For the first test, each male observed for 5 minutes with another male present and all acts of aggression for both fish were recorded to gain a control for the experiment. Males 1 & 2 were then each provided with a female for their section of the tank, and again were observed for 5 minutes – acts of aggression were recorded using a 1-3-point scale during both the experimental and control groups. 1 being the least aggressive behavior, and 3 being the most aggressive behavior. The behaviors that were looked for in order of increasing level of aggression goes Pelvic fin flipping, tail beating, and tail flashing (for broadside movements) and then erect pectoral fins, spreading of gill covers, and red mane (for facing movements). [Johnson: 2018] Each male was tested twice, male fish 1 with 2, male fish 1 with 3, and so on. Each act of aggression was recorded and tallied up to get an overall “aggression score” for each male. The averages for the males with a female, and without a female were then used to compare the two groups. The group used a two-tailed paired t-test to compare the average difference between the control and experimental group. A p-value was used to compare to the critical value of .05 to see if the results were significant. 

Results:
From Fig.1 it can be concluded that the average aggression score for males without the presence of females (3.3 ± 2.49) and for males with the presence of females (11.8 ± 13.04) was not significantly different due to the p-value compared to the critical value of .05. (p = .38, DoF=2, t= 1.09)  

Discussion:
The group’s hypothesis that the Beta splenden males would be more aggressive with the presence of females was not supported by the data. On average, the male Beta splendens were less aggressive with the presence of female Beta splendens when compared to males that were not in the presence of females. The data comparing the average differences between aggression scores before and after being introduced to females was found to be insignificant. This could be since both males have a female of their own and it was not necessary for them to fight in order to protect their female from other males. In other studies done on the behaviors of Beta fish, it was found that when an audience of a female was presented, males usually increased the intensity and frequency of displays of communication towards the female, but often decreased the number of acts of aggression towards other males. These acts of communication towards the females are often confused with acts of aggression such as gill flairs and flashing. [Doutrelant, McGregor, Oliveira: 2001] This would explain the increase in “aggression score” that was found with the presence of a female in terms of the male having been simply communicating with the female, and not necessarily being aggressive to the male. Some possible sources of error for this experiment include the relative activity levels of the fish that were tested. The male Betas that were used displayed relatively low levels of activity and therefore did not react often with the presence of other males. One of the males also failed to produce any acts of aggression when being observed, throwing off the average difference in aggression score. This experiment is important to understanding the interactions between organisms of the same species, further experimentation should be done in order to test how these organisms might interact with different species. It is reasonable to believe that members of other species can and will display similar acts of aggression towards other males of a similar species due to the possible impediment of their reproductive success. A future experiment where only one female is introduced instead of both males having a female could be done to better understand the behaviors of male Beta fish when females are present.
