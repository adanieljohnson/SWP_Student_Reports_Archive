Title: Decreased interspecific agnostic behavior by Betta splendins in response to Epalzeorhynchos frenatus

Abstract:
Animal behavior is a critical area of study in understanding how species utilize their resources for optimal success. One important aspect of behavior is the aggression levels a species shows, one of the most prevalent of these is the agnostic behavior of Betta splendins.  Betta agnostic behavior is very prevalent towards other bettas as it is related to territoriality in relation to mating as the use of agnostic behavior to maintain mating is beneficial as it increases the ability to pass one’s genes to the next generation. Our study looks at how this agnostic behavior is translated to fish similar in size of different species as other species do not have this reproductive threat and thus there is less benefit in agnostic behavior. Epalzeorhynchos frenatus or the rainbow shark is of similar size and other qualities and served to be a good experimental stimulus. When measuring how much a male betta flares their gills during each 5-minute interaction with a stimulus we found a trend that the bettas were insignificently more agnostic to other bettas as opposed to rainbows shark. Further testing could provide further evidence of the trend and allow us to identify if the rainbow shark is a reasonable tank mate for Betta splendins in the aquarium setting. 

Introduction:
The behavior of animals is a topic of study commonly used by biologist to tell us more about the function and purpose of an animal. This study, commonly known as ethology, is used to tell us how an animal functions and why an animal utilizes its energy on a certain behavior [Johnson:2016]. One species commonly studied is the Siamese fighting fish, otherwise known as Betta splendins is a popular aquarium fish that originated in southeast Asia and is commonly studied by ethologist in relation to their territorial aggression. When in the presence of other betta fish, bettas are known to display various aggressive or agnostic behaviors in order to maintain their territory. One main example of agnostic behavior is when a fish is facing an opposing fish and flaring out its opercula which covers the gills [Johnson:2016]. Research has shown that the aggression of male betta fish is heightened towards other males when they are in the presence of a female audience as opposed to a male audience, telling us this territoriality has a relation mating [Matos:2002]. This increased aggression towards other male bettas is a useful use of energy by the betta as it allows them to protect their ability to mate, thus protecting their ability to pass their genetic information on and “succeed” in life. The environment and presence of other fish is a key factor in determining the agnostic behaviors of betta fish, one potential study of particular interest is how male bettas respond to the presence of other species in their territory in order to study if other factors play a role in betta territoriality. One species that is of similar size and native area is the rainbow shark, Epalzeorhynchos frenatus. Studies show that Dionda dioboli, of the same family as rainbow sharks shows agnostic behaviors said to be like the agnostic behaviors of other members of the Cyprinidae family, showing the rainbow shark will also provide some similar agnostic behaviors to bettas [Phillips:2009]. We can use the rainbow shark as an experimental stimulus to analyze the agnostic behaviors of male bettas, this situation takes away the positive gain of being able to reproduce as a result of the energy used in agnostic behaviors, reducing the benefits of the behavior while maintaining the costs will allow us to confirm the motivations of aggressions in betta fish. As a result of this decreased benefit of agnostic behavior towards the rainbow shark we hypothesize that male betta fish will show less agnostic behaviors in the presence of the rainbow shark when compared to the agnostic activities the same bettas display in the presence of another betta. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment we obtained 6 male betta fish, 5 to be experimental specimen and one to serve as the controll treatment, and one rainbow shark to serve as the experimental treatment. We then isolated the controll and experimental treatment fish in two different spaces of equal size in a tank. The experimental fish were then placed into the environment with the treatment fish for 5 minutes, during this period the amount of time the experimental fish flared their gills was recorded in seconds. All experimental betta fish were placed in the tank with both treatments, however, care was noted to ensure that the treatments did not occur in the same sequential order and fish were exposed to controll and experimental stimulus in varying sequence, in order to controll for sequence of stimulus potentially affecting behavior. Additionally, all fish were given 5 minutes of isolation after each trial in order to allow for rest and controll for habituation to the presence of other fish. We then used the values for seconds per 5 minutes to run a paired t_test to analyze how the different stimulus affects betta agnostic behaviors. This t_test will be looking for a significent difference between the two trials defined as a p_value of less that 0.05. 

Results:
Our results provided one outlier which was excluded from the data as it was clearly an extreme that showed an opposite trend to the entire body of data. After excluding the outlier, we found that the experimental bettas spent an average of 44.5 ± 39.03 seconds per 5 minutes flaring their gills at the other betta. The same experimental bettas spent an average of 10.75 ± 21.5 seconds per 5 minutes. The paired t_test comparing the change in activity of the experimental bettas (provided a p_value of 0.0659 with a t-value of 2.835 and 3 degrees of freedom.) 

Discussion:
The results of our experiment did not support the hypothesis that male Betta splendins would be more aggressive to other male bettas as opposed to their aggression to rainbow sharks. Our data did show the trend as expected, however there was great variance in the aggression levels of the fish making our results inconclusive. The trend is likely due to the connection between aggression and territoriality for mating in the male bettas [Matos:2002]. The bettas were likely less aggressive to the rainbow shark as they did not identify the rainbow shark as a threat to mating. The inconsistent levels of aggression may be connected to how bettas approach a stimulus. Bettas have shown to approach opponents in a methodical way of approach, aggression, retreat and then return [Bronstein: 1983]. It may be likely that in this initial period of approach some fish mistakenly distinguished the rainbow shark as a threat to their territory and initially provided agnostic behavior before retreat. An additional aspect that may alter the data could simply be that some of the experimental bettas had been used in many tests from multiple classes, allowing them to habituate to tank mates and reduce agnostic behavior. Overall, the test was not a conclusive answer and further testing with fresh fish would be beneficial to see if the current trend remains. If the trend were to be later supported, it could allow us to identify the rainbow shark as a potential tank mate for bettas in the aquarium setting. If this trend were to be confirmed significently it would tell us that bettas are indeed aggressive as a means to conserve their ability to mate and the ability to reproduce is worth the energy used in agnostic behaviors. Additional studies could be used to confirm that the betta fish are indeed non aggressive to other species and allow us to alter how the aquarium world views betta fish and their potential tankmates. Studies could be spread to other species than only than the rainbow shark and allow us to find a collection of fish to place in an aquarium with bettas.
