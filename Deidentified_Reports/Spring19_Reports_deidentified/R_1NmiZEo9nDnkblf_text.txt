Title: Effect of lidocaine on function of Rania pipiens leg muscles

Abstract:
Understanding basic neuromuscular function of animals and the mechanisms which affect it is instrumental in the development of effective pharmaceuticals and other biochemical agents. In this experiment, our lab group sought to determine the impact of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on the function of leg muscles in Rania pipiens. We accomplished this by measuring the voltage generated when a 1.0 amp current was applied to the sciatic nerve of each leg before and after treatment with a lidocaine solution. In our final results, the voltage of the controll legs was nearly double the voltage of the lidocaine-treated legs on average, and we found a p_value of 0.0429. This is indicative that our results were statistically significent and that lidocaine has a clear negative impact on the function of leg muscles in Rania pipiens.


Introduction:
In animals, voltage-gated ion channels are essential in determining the sodium permeability of the plasma membrane, facilitating the action potentials, and allowing the excitation of nerve and muscle cells [1]. Specifically, it is the presence of sodium ions outside the cell and potassium ions within the cell which creates an electrical potential and enables this process. Disturbing this electrical potential in some way likely has a negative impact on the efficacy of muscles cells to properly relax and contract as it would hinder the neuronal signal received by them and consequently limit the function of the muscle as a whole [2]. In this experiment, we sought to determine the impact that lidocaine, a known sodium channel blocker, has on the function of Rania pipiens leg muscles. If there is not a statistically significent difference in our data, then it is likely that lidocaine does not have a notable impact on the function of Rania pipiens leg muscles. However if, as we hypothesize, there is a statistically significent difference, then it is a direct result of its role in inhibiting voltage-gated sodium ion channels to negative impact muscle function.


Materials and Method:
To start, our lab group was given three Rania pipiens frog legs for the experiment.  Each leg was carefully degloved and moistened with a Ringer’s solution. These legs acted as controlls. Each leg was carefully dissected until the sciatic nerve could be isolated. Once isolated, the electric impulse apparatus was placed underneath the sciatic nerves. Using the LabScribe software, a given stimulus of 1.0 amps was applied to each leg and the subsequent voltage generated would be measured. Three trials would be done for each leg and the results averaged. After this, the experiment would be repeated, with each frog leg being directly injected with a lidocaine solution. The trials were repeated and the results were collected. A paired t_test was used to analyze our results.





Results:
The average voltage prior to the lidocaine treatment was 0.866 volts, with a standard error of ±0.394 volts, while the average following the lidocaine treatment was 0.485 volts, with a standard error of ±0.387 volts. From these results of the experiment, a paired t_test was conducted from the data. The test yielded a p_value of 0.0429, a statistically significent result.


Discussion:
According to our raw data and the statistical tests we conducted, our results appear to be statistically significent in nature, with the lidocaine treatment clearly impairing the neuromuscular function of the Rania pipiens frog legs. Because the experiment was in a controllled setting, and there is an apparent lack of nontrivial unforeseen variables which may have impacted our results, there is likely little experimental error. Thus, the statistical difference, similar to our hypothesis, is likely a consequence of the effect of lidocaine on inhibiting the movement of sodium ions through voltage-gated ion channels. This in turn, creates a less substantial action potential which provides a less prominent neuromuscular response. In future experiments we may further investigate the effect of different channel blockers on the neuromuscular  response, such as calcium or potassium, to see the extent to which they may positively or negatively impact muscle function.
