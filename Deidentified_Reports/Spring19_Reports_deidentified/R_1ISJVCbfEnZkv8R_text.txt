Title: The Effect of Low Ambient Temperatures on Intraspecific Behavior in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Intraspecific behaviors are displays between the members of a single species. Betta splendins exhibit aggressive intraspecific behaviors in the form of interactions called facing and broadside movements. The purpose of this experiment was to understand the effect of low ambient temperatures on the intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendins. It was hypothesized that if water temperature was lowered then Betta splendins would demonstrate lower rates of aggressive intraspecific behavior. A controll group was set up with two pairs of male fish in room-temperature water to determine the duration of aggressive behavior in a five-minute period. The procedure was repeated for the same four fish in an experimental 11-degrees Celsius aquarium. Experimental groups demonstrated lower aggressive display durations than the controll group. The data was found to be significent as the controll durations were higher. 

Introduction:
Ethology often relates to either intraspecific or interspecific behaviors. Interspecific behavior describes the interactions between different species while intraspecific behavior describes the behavior only exhibited between members of the same species. A model organism for intraspecific behavior is the Siamese fighting fish: Betta splendins. Betta splendins is a model organism as they exhibit agnostic behavior when near each other and do so in obvious and colorful displays including exposing their branchiostegal membranes (red mane), broadside movements, and facing movements. These behaviors are nearly immediate when male Betta splendins are near each other. [Johnson: 2017]. A previous study evaluated the metabolic rates of Phodopus sungorus during hibernation (when core body temperature drops significently). The study concluded that metabolic suppression can be attributed to active down regulation of thermoregulatory controll during hibernation [Heldmaier & Ruf: 1992]. Being ectotherms, Betta splendins cannot maintain their own body temperature and are subject to the ambient temperature. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of low ambient temperature on Betta splendins and its effect on intraspecific behavior. It is hypothesized that if ambient temperature is reduced then intraspecific agnostic behaviors will decrease in duration.  

Materials and Method:
To test this hypothesis, four male Betta splendins were obtained. For the controll group, the four male Betta splendins were placed in 4 separate small divisions of an aquarium filled with 17-degrees Celsius water. The fish were separated with opaque plastic barriers so that they could not see each other. The partition was then removed from between the first pair of fish. Once able to see each other, the fish started to display the aggressive red mane behavior (defined as the extension of the red branchiostegal membranes) and a timer was started (one for each fish) to determine the duration of the behavior in seconds. The timer was stopped if the fish stopped displaying the red mane and restarted if it were to show it again. After five minutes, the fish were then separated, and the opaque partition replaced. The fish were then allowed to rest for five minutes. This procedure was consequently repeated for second pair of fish in the controll group. For the experimental group, the same two pairs of fish were utilized to ensure consistent data collection. After sufficient rest, the four fish were placed into 11-degrees Celsius water and allowed to acclimate for 10 minutes. The same procedure used for the controll group was then used for the experimental with the lower water temperature. The data was then averaged and statistically tested for significance using a paired t_test utilizing an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
The controll group had an average aggressive display time of 204.8 ± 39.64 seconds and the experimental group had an average aggressive display time of 56.41 ± 50.12 seconds (Figure 1) (t=5.2, d.f.=3, p=1.4E-2). The controll groups often displayed aggressive behavior. The experimental group infrequently displayed aggressive behavior and were more sedentary than controll groups. 

Discussion:
The biological hypothesis in this experiment was supported. The average duration of aggressive behavior in the experimental groups was lower than that of the controll group and statistically significent. An explanation for these results is that a decrease in ambient temperature also decreased the metabolic rate of the Betta splendins. A decrease in metabolic rate may explain the decrease in intraspecific behavior of the experimental group. In water, fish are subject to the changing ambient temperatures of the water they live in therefore if the temperature decreases their metabolic rates will decreased causing a reduction in all activity. It is advantageous for the fish to not display aggressive behavior or to fight in lower temperatures as it conserves necessary energy that is not as readily available as it is at higher temperatures. These findings are consistent with a 1985 article that studied the activity levels of ectothermic beetles in various ambient temperatures. The article indicated that at lower temperatures the beetles demonstrated lower rates of activity when compared to rates of activity at higher temperatures [Morgan: 1985]. Future areas for study could include calculating the specific metabolic rates of Betta splendins at various temperatures while monitoring intraspecific behavior.
