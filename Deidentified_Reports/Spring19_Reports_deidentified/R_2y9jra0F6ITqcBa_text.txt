Title: Impact of purple color on the rate of photosystem II in purple vs green lettuce leaves

Abstract:
The purpose of our study was to search for a difference in the rate of photosystem II in both purple and green lettuce leaves. This purple coloring is contributed to a group of pigments called anthocyanins. As the functional role of anthocyanins is rarely studied, our purpose was to determine whether this increased presence of anthocyanins in purple lettuce results in a catalysis or inhibition of the oxidation or reduction reactions in photosystem II. We used a DCIP decolorization assay to determine whether this purple coloring resulted in a different rate of photosynthesis and used a paired t-test to determine whether our results were significant (p = 0.245). Due to error in our centrifugation process resulting in the loss of anthocyanin pigments prior to beginning the assay, our control (plus chloroplasts green lettuce) and experimental (plus chloroplasts purple lettuce) groups resulted in nearly identical average percent changes of absorbance. Emerging with statistically insignificant results, a difference in the rate of photosystem II between purple and green lettuce leaves was not discovered.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants synthesize energy. Photosynthesis occurs in three stages; the first two being light dependent reactions which use photons of two different wavelengths to generate reducing power in the form of NADPH. These light dependent reactions create the photon gradient used to drive the synthesis of ATP and include photosystem I and photosystem II. Photosystem II, the first protein complex in the light dependent reactions, provides the electrons for the remaining steps in photosynthesis. Our experiment aims to identify a different rate of activity for photosystem II within purple lettuce compared to green lettuce. The reddish-purple color of purple lettuce can be contributed to the presence of anthocyanins, a reasonably small group of pigments in the flavonoid family [Neil: 2007]. The functional role of anthocyanins is relatively understudied; however, a small variety of literature on the topic of the function of anthocyanins is accessible in order to unravel a unified hypothesis. Studies propose a photo protective function, in which anthocyanins act as a shield to protect from high light exposure [Steyn: 2002].. We will use a DCIP decoloration assay to determine whether the increased presence of anthocyanins in purple lettuce compared to the very low number in green lettuce catalyze or inhibit oxidation or reduction reactions in Photosytem II, searching for a difference between the two colors of plants.


Materials and Methods:
Exercise 1: First, we packed a mortar and pestle, two medium sized beakers, and six 50 mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. Next, we rinsed four medium sized purple lettuce leaves and blotted off any excess moisture. When the mortar and pestle were cold, we wiped them dry, and added the four large, clean purple lettuce leaves and 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). We grinded the purple lettuce until it was a thick paste, and added an additional 10 mL of cold grinding buffer. We mixed and strained the entire volume of the purple lettuce slurry through three layers of cheese cloth into a chilled beaker. Next, we washed and dried the mortar and pestle, and repeated the previous steps with four medium green lettuce leaves. We transferred 200 microliters of the filtered purple lettuce liquid into a microtube labeled “Sample of A (purple)” and 200 microliters of the filtered green lettuce liquid into a microtube labeled “Sample of A (green)” and stored both mictotubes on ice. We transferred the remaining purple liquid to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “A (purple)” and the remaining green liquid to a centrifuge tube labeled “A (green)” and spun both at 200xG for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius, being sure to include a balance tube. We poured both supernatants out of the centrifuge tubes marked “A (purple)” and “A (green)” into the second pair of chilled centrifuge tubes and labeled them “B (purple)” and “B (green)” leaving the pellets of debris at the bottom of each respective “A” tube. Next, we removed 50 microliters of the liquid from the 50 mL tubes marked “B (purple)” and “B (green),” and placed them in microtubes labeled “Sample of B (purple)” and “Sample of B (green” and stored them on ice. We centrifuged both 50 mL tubes containing the chloroplast suspensions (tubes “B (purple)” and “B (green)”) at 1,000xG for ten minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. We poured both supernatants into clean 50 mL tubes marked “C (purple)” and “C (green)” without disturbing the pellet. Next, we added 20 mL of grinding buffer to each pellet and suspended them by stirring gently with the transfer pipet. We transferred 200 microliters of these re-suspended pellets into microtubes labeled “Sample of B pellet (purple)” and “Sample of B pellet (green)” and stored them on ice. We removed 200 microliters from the tube “C (purple)” and “C (green)” and placed them in microtubes labeled “Sample of C (purple)” and “Sample of C (green)” and stored them on ice.   Exercise 2:  We labelled ten large test tubes as followed: 1- blank, 2-4- “no chloroplasts,” 5-7- “plus chloroplasts (purple),” and 8-10-“plus chloroplasts (green)”. For tube 1, we added 100 microliters of the green sample, 8 mL of water, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. For tubes 2-4 we added 6 mL of water, 2mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. For tubes 5-7, we added 100 microliters of the purple sample, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction. Finally, for tubes 8-10, we added 100 microliters of the green sample, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. We placed all ten test tubes in a tube rack, and turned on the spectrophotometer to read 600nm. We added 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts from exercise 1 to the blank tube and tubes 5-10. We mixed each tube immediately after adding the chloroplasts and then transferred them to spectrophotometer cuvettes. We blanked the spectrophotometer at 600nm using the blank and immediately measured all samples at 600nm. We continued reading the absorbance of samples at 600nm at 10, 20, and 30 minute increments, recording the results. We calculate the percent change in absorbance and plotted it over time increments. To compare our results, we used a paired t-test.


Results:
In order to determine a statistically significant difference between the activity of photosystem II in purple lettuce and green lettuce we used a paired t-test (p = 0.245). The graph representing absorbance over three ten minute increments of no chloroplasts, plus chloroplasts (purple lettuce), and plus chloroplasts (green lettuce) showed similar patterns of decrease in absorbance with time. The data for no chloroplast revealed the lowest percent change (95.435), while plus chloroplasts (purple lettuce), and plus chloroplasts (green lettuce) showed very similar patterns of absorbance decrease and percent changes of 89.19 (purple) and 88.537 (green). When looking at the graph as a whole, the positive control (chloroplasts added from green lettuce) and the experimental (chloroplasts added from purple lettuce) hardly vary, pointing us towards our discussion.


Discussion:
At the first time mark (T0) our negative control (no chloroplasts added), our positive control (chloroplasts added from green lettuce), and our experimental (chloroplasts added from purple lettuce) showed similar average absorbance of around 3.6. With increasing ten minute increments, the percent change of the absorbance of the purple lettuce was ever so slightly higher than that of the green lettuce, by a factor of about two. However, after comparing the average percent change of the absorbance of the purple lettuce compared to that of the green lettuce, our p-value (p = 0.245) showed no significance. In failing to reject the null hypothesis, our data reports that photosystem II does not work at a higher or lower level in purple lettuce than it does in green lettuce. The high p value causes us to revisit our methods, specifically the centrifugation process. In centrifuging the purple and green lettuce chloroplast suspensions, it is likely that we lost a majority of the anthocyanins; therefore, we were not able to accurately assess the role of anthocyanins in photosystem II and the possibility of an inhibited or catalyzed process. However, data from prior experiments have shown that fluorescence measurements of red plants mimic those of green plants; concording with the very similar absorbance we observed for both purple and green lettuce species. Additionally, this data points towards the role of anthocyanins as photoprotective light screens as previously mentioned [Steyn: 2002]. Literature speaking of the protective role of anthocyanins extends to the shading effect of anthocyanins having the result of causing a lower photosynthetic CO2 assimilation; however, a higher quantum efficiency of photosystem II. [Nielsen 2011]. The possibility of anthocyanins playing a role in a higher quantum efficiency prompts us to look towards future, more in-depth experiments. Due to our likely loss of anthocyanins within the centrifugation process and the inadequate literature on the functional role of anthocyanins in photosystem II, we cannot confidently conclude that anthocyanins do or do not have a functional role in photosystem II which would lead to a significant inhibition or catalysis of the process. Following our experiment,we are left wondering if the absence of statistically significant results is due to the possibility of losing these anthocyanins during the centrifugation process, or due to the fact that they simply have little to no effect on the process of photosystem II. Therefore, in order to better asses the role of anthocyanins in purple lettuce for future experiments we would need to ensure that the anthocyanins are not removed from the pellet sample in the centrifugation process, or explore other options for testing the role of anthocyanins.
