Title: The Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibitor on the Growth Rate of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
This study sought to understand the effects of inhibiting Ecdysterone (20E) – one of two important growth hormones in several insects – on the growth rate of Manduca sexta caterpillars. It was hypothesized that inhibiting 20E would affect the rate of growth of the caterpillar, although it was not specified if it would add to or detract from their growth. The hypothesis was tested by monitoring/observing four experimental and four control caterpillars for 14 days and calculating their growth rate. The experimental group had its food treated with 20E inhibitor while the control had their food treated with distilled water to clear out any differences in texture. Though the data proved to be inconclusive due to its insignificance stemming from the two-tailed p-value, there is likely a correlation because the insignificance was caused by an outlier in the control group. This study should be repeated on a larger scale before any conclusions can be drawn.

Introduction:
When certain genes are expressed, they code for hormones which are created by endocrine glands and are then pumped throughout the body via the bloodstream where they trigger a response within cells [Australian Pituitary Foundation: 2014]. Two types of hormones/steroids found in Manduca sexta (M. sexta) caterpillars are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). This experiment sought to study the effects of inhibiting 20E, an ecdysteroid, prematurely—though both hormones are crucial to the caterpillar’s development. Without specific 20E levels, M. sexta cannot grow or become moths [Kenneth 1971]. JH affects the timing of molting while 20E affects the type of molt [Johnson: 2018]. The amount of each hormone is essential because certain levels of both trigger specific stages of the caterpillar’s pupation until eventually becoming a moth. M. sexta caterpillars have five instar larva stages before becoming a pupa and finally emerging as an adult moth. Specific levels of both hormones trigger these instar stages [Bollenbacher: 1981]. Each instar phase serves to allow the caterpillar to shed its exoskeleton so that it can continue to grow. To trigger the pupa stage, JH levels drop while 20E levels jump slightly [Nijhout 1976]. Without both phenomena, the caterpillar will not pupate and will remain a caterpillar. If the 20E hormone is inhibited prematurely, then it will affect the rate of growth of the caterpillars.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were weighed. The weights were recorded as the weights for day 0. One caterpillar was then placed in each cell of the two trays after punching air holes in each cell to ensure air flow. In each cell a ball of 20g of treated caterpillar food was placed in the corner. The control group’s food was mixed with 7 drops of water while the experimental group’s food was mixed with 7 drops of 20E inhibitor. All other condition were kept the same between the caterpillars. The caterpillars were checked, weighed, and observed daily for two weeks and food was replaced food as necessary (whether it was dried out or there was none left). Cells were also cleaned as necessary to prevent buildup of waste. The collected average growth rates per caterpillar data in control versus experimental group was analyzed using a two-sample t-test using the two-tailed p value.

Results:
It was found that the growth rate of the experimental group was less than that of the control growth rate. However, while not reaching the same peaks and extremes, the control growth rate and the experimental growth rate followed a similar trend [see Figures 1 and 2] of keeping a positive rate of growth until about day six at which point the rate of growth went negative before finally leveling out around day 12. These graphs support the observations made. It was also observed that the experimental group did not visibly grow nearly as much as control caterpillars 1-3 which grew to become very plump and large. Control 4, who shall be deemed “Freddie” from here on, barely grew with its net weight fluctuation being 0.0g. It never grew or lost more than 0.1g. Compared to the other caterpillars, Freddie was an outlier. The mean average rate of growth was not statistically significant than that of the control group (t-stat = 1.92, df = 6, P = 0.103). When Freddie’s data was omitted as an outlier, the data was statistically significant (t-stat = 4.10, df = 5, P = 0.0093).

Discussion:
Since the results of the lab were insignificant, it means that they are invalid; the experiment failed to reject the null hypothesis: inhibiting 20E does not affect the growth rate of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The alternate hypothesis in therefore rejected. While the 20E was inhibited, the caterpillars still managed to follow the same trend of growth as the control group, just not to the same extremes. The results run contrary to those found in another study where the inhibition of ecdysterone was seen to inhibit growth of M. sexta caterpillars [Kenneth 1969]. The lack of 20E affected nothing more than their size while their development continued; however, they did not visibly increase in size. Because JH was not treated, the caterpillars continued along the normal developmental path just without the necessary weight gain required to survive pupating into a moth [Safranek: 1980]. The control group, whose JH and 20E worked together as normal, followed a normal path of development and two caterpillars became pupa just as the experiment was ending. A possible source of error is that Freddie was an outlier. A runt, Freddie severely altered the data collected and the data becomes statistically significant if its data is omitted with less than 1% insignificance. Had this been the data collected, the alternative hypothesis would have been supported and the ecdysterone could be said to play a significant role in the development, specifically molting, of M. sexta. This conclusion would have been further supported because ecdysterone plays an important role and affects the development, and molting, of other insects as well [Raabe: 1987][Shinbo: 1989][Hoffmann: 1994]. Due to this finding, another experiment should be run using the same procedure with, perhaps, more test subjects to obtain more accurate results. It is likely that the results would be significant, and the alternative hypothesis could be accepted if this experiment was repeated.
