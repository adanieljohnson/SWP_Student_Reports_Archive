Title: M. sexta Growth is not Significantly Affected by Precor

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta’s molting (also called the five larval instars) and caterpillar growth phases are determined by the levels of two major hormones in its system: the juvenile hormone (JH), and the ecdysterone hormone (20E). Insect growth regulators (IGRs) occur both naturally and lab settings; IGRs affect the caterpillar’s growth rates by increasing or decreasing either 20E or JH levels in the Manduca sexta systems. Our hypothesis is that if Precor (an IGR that mimics the functioning and therefore increases the levels of JH in the Manduca sexta) is fed to these caterpillars, then they will grow larger than those caterpillars that aren’t fed this IGR. Manduca sexta were separately reared with 4 being the controll group (C0) and 4 being the experimental group (T1); the experimental group was fed Precor in a 1: 1250 ratio with food while the controll group was fed distilled water with food. Based on the data collected and our paired t_test, there was no significent difference found between the controll group or the experimental one’s growth based on weight nor length. This raises discussions of further studies that need to include bigger groups of data.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta’s molting (also called larval instars; there are five of them) and caterpillar growth phases are determined by the levels of two major hormones in its system: the juvenile hormone (JH), and the ecdysterone hormone (20E). JH is a long-chain organic molecule found in the corpus allata located on the caterpillar’s body, and it controlls the type of molt phase the Manduca sexta goes through. The 20E hormone is located in the back of the head and thorax and controlls the timing of the caterpillar molting, both before and during adult eclosion [Johnson: 2018]. High levels of the juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars causes the caterpillar to continue to grow until about the fourth larval instar, and then the JH levels decline to allow for preparation of pupal and adult eclosion. The decline of JH in the M. sexta systems during the final instar allows the animal to undergo pupal commitment, and when it is at a low level, 20E causes the M. sexta’s body to prepare for eclosion [Kingsolver: 2007]. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) occur both naturally and in the lab; IGRs affect the caterpillar’s growth rates by increasing or decreasing either 20E or JH levels in the Manduca sexta systems. Our alternate hypothesis is that if Precor (an IGR that mimics the functioning and therefore increases the levels of JH in the Manduca sexta system) is fed to these caterpillars, then they will grow larger than those caterpillars that aren’t fed this IGR.

Materials and Method:
Each caterpillar was reared separately. We prepared and fed each caterpillar 10g of the GLM diet, with ~100Ml per 10g food of either distilled water (C0) or Precor in the 1: 1250 ratio (T1) mixed in to create desirable consistency. We then weighed each caterpillar and measured their length roughly every 24 hours, cleaned out each rearing compartment and recreated their food in the same amount and consistency for each caterpillar daily. When not being measured, all eight caterpillars were kept in an incubator with 24 hours constant light at 28ºC, undisturbed. The two-tailed t_test was used on the data, with an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
There were some trends noted, even though each group had the relative same amount of data. Each group had two large caterpillars, one abnormally small caterpillar, and one average-sized caterpillar (see Figures 1, 2). Based on this data and our paired t_test, which showed a value above 0.05 (0.058), there was no significent difference found between the controll group or the experimental one’s growth based on weight nor length. The only difference seen was that one caterpillar (8, group T1) died in between measurements on the 7th and 8th days. Both groups also had caterpillars that seemed to shrink in size before growing rapidly.

Discussion:
This experiment rejected our alternate hypothesis. It supported our null hypothesis and raised questions about other similar experiments prepared on this subject matter. It is possible that the concentration of Precor was too diluted to mark any significent differences in the growth rate of these caterpillars; it is also possible that these caterpillars varied too much in size from the beginning to show any changes present based on the independent variable manipulated. It is also a known fact that many IGRs are seen as growth inhibitors and can lead to insect death. Precor and other IGRs are known insecticides, although not in the concentration (1: 1250) used in this experiment. IGRs can lead to complications that can reduce insect survival [Tunaz, Uygun: 2004]. There could have not been enough air holes, or they were placed in undesirable areas of the containers (where they could be covered accidentally) during incubation periods. Any number of small mistakes could have made this experiment’s results go awry, or the insignificance of the results was simply due to the fact that Precor at this concentration did not have any effect on the Manduca sexta, either positive or negative. In a further study, if this same experiment were to be conducted again, I would prefer there to be a larger sample size of caterpillars; at least 6-10 for each group. There could possibly be multiple test groups with different concentration ratios of Precor (both higher and lower than 1: 1250), although one would stay the same as was used in this experiment.  In conclusion, this experiment shed light on the absence of effects from this particular IGR on the M. sexta and leads to further experiments and discussions.
