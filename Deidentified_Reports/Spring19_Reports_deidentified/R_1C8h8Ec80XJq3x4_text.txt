Title: The Effects of Gentrol on the larvae of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to see how Gentrol affected the larvae of Manduca sexta which grows up to be a pest. Gentrol acts as an IGR which mimics JH which inhibits pupation in the larvae of Manduca sexta therefore stopping it from becoming a pest. We hypothesize that this will stop pupation and cause the larvae to grow larger in size than normal larvae.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm is a pest which begins its life as an egg. It becomes a pest when it becomes a moth, however, it is fine in its larvae stage. Larvae produce a lot of JH, or Juvenile Hormone, which helps them grow, but when it drops, they begin to pupate. Gentrol is an IGR, or an Insect Growth Regulator, which can be used to describe a hormone that interferes with a larvae’s ability to pupate (Williams, 1967). IGRs can be used as a third generation pesticide (Williams, 1967). Gentrol is similar to JH in that it inhibits pupation. The null hypothesis is that if we feed Manduca sexta Gentrol, then noting will change, but if something does change, that is our alternative hypothesis.

Materials and Method:
1.	Gather materials:
a.	Two boxes that are divided into fourths
b.	16 Manduca sexta larvae
c.	Food for larvae
d.	Gentrol
e.	Markers
f.	Scale and ruler
g.	water
2.	Weigh and measure each of the larvae, and put them into a separate compartment of the box, which are numbered to ensure that the larvae don’t get mixed up.
3.	Divide out 10 grams of food for each larvae and add 6 drops of Gentrol to 8 of them, and 6 drops of water to the other 8, and give them to the larvae.
4.	Continue to feed the larvae everyday with the same amount of food and liquid and make sure that the larvae receive the same type of liquid every time.
5.	Weigh and measure the larvae on day 7 and day 14, and then dispose of them by freezing.


Results:
                                                                                                                                                          .                                           .

Discussion:
The results of the experiment support our hypothesis. The p_value for the difference in the average lengths is 1.09 x 10-5 which shows that they are statistically significent. The p_value for the difference in the average in weights is 8.99 x 10-9 which also shows that these results are statistically significent. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that Gentrol does affect the growth of Manduca sexta larvae by making them grow much larger than they are supposed to be due to the fact that their pupation is inhibited.
