Title: The Effect of Novocaine On the Amplitude of Gastrocnemius Muscle Response in Frog Legs

Abstract:
Rana pipien frog legs are comprised of two main parts, the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve; both are involved in the process of muscle contraction.  The gastrocnemius muscle is a voluntarily controlled muscle and also coordinated to contract based on stimuli from the sciatic nerve.  In the experiment, the gastrocnemius muscle is treated with novocaine, a common anesthetic.  The leg is monitored and tested at varying stimuli to see the affect the nerve blocker has on the magnitude of response.   It was hypothesized that if novocaine is injected into the muscle, then the response will be lower.  3 Rana pipien legs are tested, all three are tested before a novocaine injection to determine a threshold.  After the threshold is determined, the novocaine is injected and the stimulus is applied.  The control groups had an average response at 0.153 v, 0.222 v, and 0.235 v.  The treatment groups had an average response at 0.05 v, 0.034 v, and 0.136 v.  The P-value was 0.047 making the results significant.  The hypothesis was supported, the novocaine blocked the sodium channels, limiting the significance of the action potential fired, creating a lower average response.      

Introduction:
In all animals, there are 3 main types of muscle, smooth, cardiac, and skeletal.  Skeletal muscle is a voluntary muscle group, operated within our control, or controlled through the peripheral nervous system [Picture: 2016].  Frog legs contain two main parts that control the muscle contraction, the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle.  The gastrocnemius muscle is considered a skeletal muscle, meaning it is voluntarily controlled and monitored by motor neurons [Johnson: 2018].  External stimulus causes the release of neurotransmitters and fires action potentials.  Sodium channels exist in the muscle fiber and become opened when nerve impulse causes the release of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.  The opening of the sodium channels causes the action potential to continue down the muscle fiber and eventually release calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The calcium ions eventually bind to troponin, opening up the myosin binding sites on the actin. [Brian: 2009].  Action potentials occur in the muscle fibers and eventually lead to muscle contraction and response [Johnson: 2018].  Based on the information about how muscle fibers work and the neuromuscular junctions, we decided to introduce a chemical blocker to observe how the amplitude would change.  Specifically, the chemical procaine, more commonly known as novocaine, was introduced directly to the gastrocnemius muscle.  Novocaine, considered a local anesthetic, blocks nerve transmission by inhibiting the function of the sodium channels [Perkins: 2005].  As we know, sodium channels are required to be active during an action potential.  Furthermore, the injection of novocaine will reduce the reception of impulses sent by the nerve in that specific area [Perkins: 2005].  We hypothesized that if novocaine is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle, then the response of the muscle at a certain stimulus will be on average lower than the control group muscle.  The independent variable in the experiment will be the novocaine added to the frog leg.  The dependent variable will be the amplitude of the response from the frog leg.  External conditions will be held at a constant, such as adding ringer solution or keeping the stimulus constant for each individual leg.  


Materials and Methods:
In order to discover the effect of a novocaine injection on the amplitude of response, 3 different frog legs were obtained.  First, each leg was skinned, and the gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the bone.  During this step, the sciatic nerve is isolated from the upper part of the leg and exposed to the electronic stimulator.  Then the gastrocnemius muscle is suspended in the air by a string that is tied around the tendon.  Meanwhile, all skinned frog legs are soaked with ringer's solution every 5-10 minutes to assure optimal contractions will occur.  Once the leg is suspended, and the sciatic nerve is over the electronic stimulator, various stimuli are applied to determine a threshold.  When the threshold is determined, the stimulus is increased by .1 amp and the response is recorded.  After the responses are recorded, the gastrocnemius muscle is injected with 0.1 milliliters of novocaine and allowed to sit for 5 minutes.  The 5 minutes allows the novocaine to spread throughout the entire muscle and begin it’s main function.  After 5 minutes has passed, the threshold that was determined from the previous step is tested and also increased by .1 amp.  Once again, the muscle response is recorded.  The exact same procedure is repeated for the other two frog legs and the various responses are recorded.  A two-paired t test was used in the experiment to P and T value.       


Results:
For control groups (no novocaine) 1-3, a average response occurred at 0.153 v, 0.222 v, and 0.235 v (Fig 1).  Each of the control groups had a standard deviation of 0.007, 0.008, and 0.04 respectively.  The treatment groups (novocaine injections) had an average response at 0.05 v, 0.034 v, and 0.136 v (Fig 1).  The standard deviation for each of the treatment groups was 0.004, 0.004, and 0.006 respectively.  Based on the data, the P-Value was 0.047 and  T-Value was 4.453.      

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that the if the novocaine is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle, then the response of the muscle in volts will be on average lower compared to the gastrocnemius muscle with no novocaine injection.  After the experiment was completed, the hypothesis was supported as the muscles with novocaine injection had on average a lower response in volts.  The most likely explanation for this result was that the novocaine blocked some of the sodium channels and limited the action potential.  Therefore, when the stimulus was kept constant between the control and the treatment groups, the treatment group would not generate as large of a response [Perkins: 2005].  Based on our data and calculated P-value, a significant difference does exist between the control and treatment groups.  Throughout the experiment, external factors were attempted to be controlled, such as properly skinning the legs, separating the sciatic nerve, and keeping tension on the string.  Although the hypothesis was supported, error is possible at all steps of the experiment.  One of the major errors that can occur is not keeping ringer solution on the frog legs at all times.  Ringer solution is typically a solution with multiple salts dissolved that creates an isotonic environment [Rogers: 2009].  Failing to reapply the ringer solution on the muscle every 5 minutes may not allow for the muscle to reach its maximum possible contraction.  Another possible error could occur after the novocaine has been injected into the gastrocnemius muscle.  If the novocaine is injected and then the stimulus is applied before the chemical has circulated throughout the entire muscle, then there may not be any observed effect of the novocaine or a less substantial effect.  Another error could occur while injecting the novocaine into the muscle.  At least one time, when the needle was injected, it went all the way through the muscle and poked out the other side.  Luckily, this error was caught before the novocaine had been pushed out of the chamber.  However, if injecting the novocaine is not done with precision, the treatment group data can be completely inaccurate.  For example, fatigue may be the main factor in altering the data as opposed to the novocaine.  While on the topic of fatigue, it must be noted as an external factor that has the potential to alter the results.  Because the experiment uses real frog legs, the muscles can’t contract at maximum force forever, as the muscle will eventually run out of ATP.  When the muscle runs out of ATP, the actin and myosin cross bridges will disconnect, which is different than the relaxation stage of contraction [Johnson: 2018].  Although the experiment yielded a significant difference, there are always further experiments that could be done to understand more about the subject.  One experiment that could be done that would yield more data to the effects of novocaine in muscle contractions is changing the amount of novocaine injected.  In this experiment, 0.1 mL of novocaine was injected each time.  As a further experiment, injecting 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mL of novocaine into different legs would tell researchers a lot about local anesthetics and the optimal amount of novocaine for a small response.  It also has the potential of determining if too much novocaine is detrimental to the leg and if a certain amount of novocaine will actually inhibit muscle function for a longer period of time than intended.  Further experiments in all of these areas could allow for more precise data regarding the function of novocaine in the muscle, the time takes to work, and when novocaine is is at its optimal function.
