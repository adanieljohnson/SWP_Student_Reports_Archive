Title: Examination of Photosystem II Activity Using DCIP Analysis in Spinacia oleracea in response to Varying Salinity Concentrations 

Abstract:
This experiment studies the PSII activity in Spinacia oleracea in response to varying salinity concentrations.  It is hypothesized that  an increase salinity will decrease PSII activity which will decrease overall photosynthesis.  A DCIP assay was run for spinach leaves in deionized water, 3.5% salinity, and  7.0% salinity. The average absorbances from each of these assays were analyzed through an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test. The ANOVA test gave a p-value of 0.002301, but this value was not significant as the Tukey-Kramer test revealed that  improper comparisons were used which caused a significant p-value when in reality none of the results were statistically significant. Analysis of the Tukey-Kramer test showed that this experiment did not support the hypothesis that as the salinity of a solution increases, photosynthesis decreases.

Introduction:
Over the last several decades California has been struggling to adapt to the increasing soil salinity and irrigation water salinity levels that have been tainting their cropland [Letey: 200]. Rising salinity levels are of great concern because many plants are sensitive to salinity and their production can be limited by non-conducive salinity levels [Shrivastava: 2014]. In order to study a microcosm of this phenomenon occurring in California, the photosystem (II)’s (PSII) activity of spinach leaves in different salinity solutions was evaluated. PSII is part of the light dependent reactions in photosynthesis. In PSII energy from absorbed photons of light causes electrons from water to pump free protons across the thylakoid membrane to generate a proton gradient. These electrons generated from the water splitting enzyme in PSII travel through a multisubunit complex to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. This formation of NADPH is necessary because the NADPH molecule plays an integral rule in creating glucose molecules from carbon dioxide. To measure the activity of PSII, a DCIP decolorization assay was employ. In this assay DCIP replaces NADP+ as the electron acceptor. DCIP is naturally a dark blue compound. However, when it is reduced to DCIPH2 its bonds are reorganized to conjugated C=C bonds which make the molecule colorless. This color loss provides a way to measure DCPIP reduction to DCIPH2 directly as a decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm [Johnson: 2016]. A prior experiment conducted a study analyzing the effects of salinity on photosynthesis in maize. The results from this study found that the presence of salt decreased the activity of PSII reaction centers which in turn negatively affected the oxygen-evolving complex and reduced electron transport [Kan: 2017]. Based off of this information, it is hypothesized that a salinity solution will create a hypertonic environment in the chloroplast stroma which will cause water to move from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma. As a result, there will be little to no water for the water splitting enzyme to split therefore no electron in PSII for light to excite and not electron to reduce DCIP to DCIPH2. Therefore, an increase salinity will decrease photosynthesis which will decrease DCIP reduction which in turn will keep DCIP as a dark molecule and there will be a smaller change in absorbance. 

Materials and Methods:
Exercise 1: Enriching Chloroplasts: 
The centrifugation preparation method was taken from Dr. Johnson’s methods [Johnson: 2016]. In this preparation method ground spinach leaves were suspended in a pH buffer and then three different samples of this suspension were centrifuged at varying levels. These centrifuged samples were then analyzed under a microscope to determine which sample had the highest density of spinach chloroplasts. This sample was then used for the experiment [Johnson: 2016]. 

Exercise 2:
For this experiment 100 microliters of the selected spinach chloroplast sample from exercise one was placed in three different solutions of deionized water, 3.5% salinity, and 7.0% salinity. 130mM DCIP and 100 mM phosphatase reaction buffer were added to each of these solutions. There was a total of three replicates of each solution. The absorbances of these solutions  were analyzed at ten minute intervals for a total of thirty minutes starting at time zero. The absorbances were read using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm.  Percent change was calculated between each reading and the initial Time Zero reading. The averages for the 3.5% salinity solution and the 7.5% salinity solution were determined by calculating the percent change from Time Zero to Time 30 minutes for three trials, and then averaging these trials. The average percent change for the deionized water solution was similarly determined by calculating the percent change from TIme Zero to Time 30 minutes, but this done only averaging two of the three trials.  An excel plot was used to graph change in average percent absorbance  versus time. The results were then compared using ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test. 


Results:
By the end of the experiment the 3.5% salinity solution had the greatest average percent change in absorption with an 82.6% change, the deionized water had the second greatest average percent change in absorption with an 82.3% change, and the 7.5% salinity solution had the lower average percent change in absorption with an 76.7% change (Figure 1). The second trial for the deionized water solution, test tube number 2, was eliminated as an outlier. Test Tube 2 had an average percent of 45.1% which was drastically lower than the 81.8% for Test Tube 1 and the 82.7% for Test Tube 3. However, Dixon’s Q Outlier Test was applied to statistically confirm these results. The Qcalc for Test Tube 2 was greater then the Qcrit; therefore it was confirmed that Test Tube 2 was an outlier and its data was rejected and removed from statistical analysis and graphing. An aNOVA test was run to further compare these results. The p-value of the aNOVA test was 0.002301. A Tukey-Kramer test was also conducted and all comparisons were calculated to be insignificant except the comparisons listed in Table 1. 

Discussion:
The trends of Figure 1 show the average percent change in absorption did not support the hypothesis that as salinity of a solution increases, photosynthesis decreases since the 3.5% salinity solution had a higher change in absorbance than the deionized water solution. Even though the aNOVA test gave a significant p-value this only means that the change in absorbances at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes for all three trials were different from each other and not due to random chance. However, when this analysis was broken down using the Tukey-Kramer test to look at the individual groups that were being compared, not all of these groups were comparable. The only groups that showed statistical significance between their numbers were non-comparable groups such as the ones listed in Table 2. As a result, it was these improper comparisons that caused the aNOVA test to report a significant p-value when in reality none of the results were statistically significant. These results were unexpected as prior research showed that salinity in maize decreased the activity of photosystem (II) [Kan: 2017]. However, further research revealed that the rate of oxygen evolution in spinach is half of that of the rate of oxygen evolution in Zea mays (maize) [Hardt:1978]. As a result, this discrepancy between the way salinity affect photosynthesis in maize versus spinach leaves could be a result of the different rates of oxygen evolution in these species. Different results more consistent with prior experiments might have been achieved had similar salt concentrations used in past experiments been used in this experiment. Instead of looking into these concentrations, the varying salinities used in these solutions was based off of the average ocean salinity, which might have not been the best standard to base this experiment. Ifuture experiments, the tested salinity concentrations will need to be better adapted to the baseline salinity concentrations within the spinach leaves, and a wider range of salinity  concentrations should be evaluated.
