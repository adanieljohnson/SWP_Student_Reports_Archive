Title: The effect of envoronment size on the agonistic behaviors of male Betta splendens

Abstract:
Studying animal behaviors helps researchers observe how organisms respond to various stimuli. Betta splendens is a species of fish that is known to exhibit agonistic behavior in the presence of other male bettas to assert their dominance through a variety of displayed behaviors. It was hypothesized that the betta would show more aggressive behavior in the smaller tanks. This experiment observes the effect of environment size on the aggressive displays of male betta fish. Using different size tanks, each betta fish was observed for five minutes and observations about the timing of their red mane behavior was recorded. Though the statistical tests revealed no statistically significant data, the observations supported our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Animals display a range of behaviors, whether embedded in their genotype or learned, in response to various environmental stimuli. Ethology is the study of animal behavior where researchers use observational study to further understand how certain behaviors may have evolved. This experiment uses patient observation to observe what variables affect the agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens, or betta fish. These organisms display a variety of agonistic intraspecies behaviors to assert dominance to other bettas, such as the expansion and flashing of their fins, facing and facing behaviors, lowering of the head, darting, and biting [Bronstein: 1984]. In this experiment, we chose to explore the question to whether the size of the environment has an impact on the agonistic behaviors of male betta fish. Specifically, we looked at the behavior of red mane: an agonistic behavior exhibited by male betta fish by extending the gills from their branchiostegal membrane, located on the side of their heads. We hypothesize that the male fish exhibit more aggressive behavior in smaller tanks rather than larger ones. 

Materials and Methods:
Before the experiment, we obtained a large tank, split into two 10 inches by 10.5 inches sections. In addition, we used a smaller tank split into two sections, 4 inches by 6 inches each. Each section within the tanks was separated by a clear piece of glass. First, two male betta fish were placed the separate sections of the small tank. The behavior of one fish was observed for each trial, and their agonistic behaviors were quantified as the time leading to the first red mane agonistic behavior as well as the overall net duration of that behavior over five minutes. After five minutes, we placed an opaque divider between the sections to let the fish rest for five more minutes. Next, we replaced one of the fishes with a new male and repeated the steps taken to observe their behavior. This was repeated for observations for three trials total before repeating all steps with a bigger tank. A one tailed paired t-test was used to test the results for significance. 

Results:
Graph 1 reveals that the male fish took longer, on average, to show the red mane behavior in a large tank (30.6 seconds) compared to when they were in the smaller tank (22.6 seconds). The paired t-test revealed no statistical significance (t-stat = 1.84, df = 2, P = 0.21). Graph 2 shows that the males exhibited red mane behavior for longer in the smaller tank (132.6 seconds) than those in the large tank (101.3 seconds). The statistical test showed no statistical significance for the duration of the red mane behavior between groups (t-stat = 0.98, df = 2, P = 0.43). 

Discussion:
The data collected supports the initial hypothesis that male betta fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior in the smaller tanks. Though the data is not statistically significant, our findings support the idea that size of the environment affects the agonistic behaviors of the males. Both the shorter time before the first red mane behavior and the longer duration over five minutes can be concluded as more aggressive behavior in the small tank versus the larger one. An explanation for these findings is that in the smaller enclosures, it was easier for the organisms to see encounter each other through the glass. However, one of the trial males exhibited no agnostic behavior throughout the study, though it was observed having seen the other fish. This brought up the question into whether all male betta fish exhibit agonistic behaviors when confronted by the threat of another male, as usually expected. It also begs the question as to what other factors impact the bettas decision to show agonistic behavior and to whether they can distinguish when a threat is significant enough to need that type of behavior. Another experiment conducted about the agonistic behaviors of bettas found that males who resided in the same tank longer produced a defensive advantage between the pairs [Bronstein: 1984]. The duration of time of the fish in each tank could have been accounted for in our experiment when switching pairs of males between tanks.
