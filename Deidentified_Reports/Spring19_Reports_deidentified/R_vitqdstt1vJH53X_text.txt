Title: Increased JH Effects in M. sexta did not correlate to increased mass

Abstract:
Manduca sexta is an organism typically used to study hormone signaling in insects, primarily juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E). In our experiment, the effect of increasing JH levels by adding an IGR to the Manduca sexta diets was studied. An IGR is an insect growth regulator, and JH is a hormone that certain IGRs can mimic. Researchers hypothesized that this would prevent the experimental group from beginning to pupate and remaining in the instar stage. Two drops of an IGR that mimicked JH were added to each 10g (one serving) of the experimental group’s food and not added to the control group’s food. The results were not statistically significant as the p-value was above 0.05 (t-stat = 0.882018, df = 6, P = 0.205853). By the end of the experiment, both the control group and experimental group were sick yet still showing signs of beginning the process of pupation.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta is type of caterpillar often used to study hormones and their signaling. The Manduca sexta is commonly called the Tobacco Hornworm. The two main hormones associated with Manduca sexta are juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E), which regulate molting during the development of insects [Johnson: 2018]. When an insect is ready to pupate, neurons secrete a hormone that releases prothoracicotropic hormone, which triggers 20E release from the prothoracic glands [Meyer: 2016]. Juvenile hormone is also released by insects prior to them molting. It is secreted by the corpora allata and called the juvenile hormone because it prevents insects from their development of adult characteristics [Meyer: 2016]. When a Manduca sexta is about to pupate, there are visible changes to its outside appearance. The caterpillar will start to turn a yellow-brown color from its previous blue-green. Its skin may start to peel, indicating the molting process is imminent, and the Manduca sexta may even begin to form a cocoon. In our lab, the researchers wanted to see the effects of juvenile hormone (JH) on the pupation of the Manduca sexta. JH regulates the type of molting during the development of insects. By adding an IGR that mimics JH to the Manduca sextas’ diets in small amounts, the researchers could ascertain if it would affect their pupation. An IGR is an insect growth regulator, and JH is a type of IGR [Johnson: 2018]. When insects are in their last instar and about to molt, the corpora allata shrinks and stops producing juvenile hormones [Meyer: 2016]. When there is this very low amount of juvenile hormone, E20 simultaneously starts being produced more. This condition is called the commitment pulse and must happen for a Manduca sexta to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. In our experiment, the researchers believe this would prevent the commitment pulse from happening by adding juvenile hormone. Adding this hormone means the caterpillar will molt into more instars instead of becoming a pupa because juvenile hormone regulates the type of molting that occurs in an insect and when it molts. The researchers hypothesize that the experimental group that ingests the IGR will not pupate over the two week-long experiment while the control group Manduca sextas will start to pupate, which we will gage based on the observable physical differences that occur during pupation. We also believe that at the end of the experiment, the control group will appear healthier and seem as if they are maturing properly while the experimental group will be bloated and sick.


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta who had not yet pupated were placed in plastic four-cell containers, with one Manduca sexta in each cell. The researchers needed Manduca sextas in this stage of development because one of the measures of our experiment is whether they start to pupate. Keeping each Manduca sexta in a cell by itself allows us to dismiss any confounding variables that could come from the interaction of the Manduca sextas with each other. Two holes were two holes in each cell to ensure that the Manduca sextas would not suffocate. Each container and cell were labelled to keep track of each Manduca sexta. The control and treatment groups were stored in separate containers, with four Manduca sextas in each group. The researchers fed each Manduca sexta 10g of food per day unless they had not eaten their food from the day before. The treatment group’s diet had two drops of IGR added to each 10g of food while the control group’s diet has two drops of water added to each 10g. Researchers added water to the control group’s diet so that every Manduca sexta would be receiving food with the same amount of moisture in it. The control group’s and treatment group’s food was prepared separately as well. Every day over the course of the two weeks, one member of our lab group checked on the Manduca sextas. This person weighed each Manduca sexta and input these values in our log. They next used a spoon to remove the Manduca sexta excrement from each cell. Lastly, they fed any Manduca sextas who had run out of food or were about to run out. If more than half of the food  was left, that Manduca sexta’s food was not replaced. The statistical test used was the two sample t-test because the means of two groups of data were being compared.


Results:
The Manduca sexta larvae all ended the experiment with higher weights than their beginning weight in the experiment. The treatment group had a larger change in weight over the course of the experiment, but it was only marginally larger (one gram bigger on average) than the control group (Figure 1). The Manduca sextas did start to lose weight during the experiment, but they all initially gained weight during the first week. By Day 12, all of the Manduca sextas were losing weight, and this continued through Day 14. A p value less than 0.05 is significant, and this group’s p value was greater than 0.05, so the mean of the experimental group was not statistically different from the control group (t-stat = 0.882018, df = 6, P = 0.205853). I used Days 1-12 to calculate the values in the previous sentence because of inconsistencies in the data rather than the full fourteen days because this better reflected the weights of the Manduca sextas throughout the experiment. Our highest mass of any Manduca sexta was 13.36 g, which was on Day 8. In our control group, two Manduca sexta died, and no caterpillars died in the experimental group. 



Discussion:
Because the results were statistically insignificant, there is no shown correlation between JH and Manduca sexta not pupating. Our null hypothesis was not rejected because our p-value was not low enough to show that our results had a very small risk of being by chance. The average weights of the control group and experimental group were also too similar to support our hypothesis. The control group of Manduca sexta started to pupate as predicted, but the experimental group also started to pupate at the same rate. The control group was sicker than the experimental group (based on its higher number of caterpillar deaths), and both groups were bloated and sick by the end of the experiment. Because both groups were sick, our experiment did not have the intended results. We may have had some unknown human error, or it is more probable that the amount of JH added (2 drops of IGR per 10g of food) was not significant enough to have an effect on the Manduca sexta’s development. If I were to redo this experiment, I would choose to put a higher level of IGR in the Manduca sexta’s food because I believe the level of IGR was not high enough to produce an observable difference in the control group versus the experimental group’s development. The control group and experimental group ended up being too similar in their results with this very low dosage of IGR. Further research into this subject has been done, and I believe that our results would have been much more significant if the researchers had used a high concentration of the IGR. The amount of JH was not large enough to stop the commitment pulse from occurring, which happens when there is rising 20E but extremely low JH [Johnson: 2018]. This commitment pulse is necessary to the pupation of the Manduca sexta, and the added JH failed in preventing this stage. Other experiments on the same subject have resulted in statistically significant data, showing that our results came from either human error, not enough JH to make a difference, or both. One particular study on the Cotton Bollworm confirms that JH works to suppress the commitment pulse in insects and even identified two Juvenile hormone binding protein genes that are influenced by the addition of extra JH in the insect [Jiang: 2019]. This study delved into the underlying causes for the process researchers were trying to show in this experiment. This Cotton Bollworm study shows that JH and insect growth is a topic that has a lot of depth and can be studied in many different ways. This study is from 2019, so right now so much is being researched about JH and further inquiry into this topic will reveal more to the scientific community about insect hormones.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This graph shows the average masses of the experimental group and control group. The M. sextas’s Day 1 weights were subtracted from the Day 12 weights to find their average masses. The experimental group and control group’s bars are both close to eight grams, showing that the two groups yielded similar results. The error bars show the standard deviation of the M. sextas’s mass over the course of the experiment. This information was calculated with a two sample t test.
