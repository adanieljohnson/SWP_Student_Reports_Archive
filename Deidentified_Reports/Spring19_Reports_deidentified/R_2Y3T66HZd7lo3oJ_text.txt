Title: How IGRs impacts Manduca sexta caterpillars during development 

Abstract:
Hormone function is an essential element regarding development of insects. The regulation of hormone functions assists in the process of completing molting and continuing to the next stage of life. This study examined the effects of the insect growth regulator (IGR), precor, when exposed to Manduca sexta caterpillars. Eight caterpillars, four control (fed water) and four treatment (fed precor), were observed for 14 days. The data displayed no significance regarding the IGR, precor, affecting the length and mass of the Manduca sexta. An excessive amount of precor will negatively affect the caterpillar meaning the weight and length would be below average and ultimately, lead to death. The results failed to support the hypothesis stating that the IGR, precor, would lead to morality and development abnormalities. There is no statistical significance regarding the data.

Introduction:
This experiment investigates the impacts of hormones on the Manduca sexta caterpillars during development. Hormones are an essential part of development as it triggers growth. Identifying and understanding hormonal control and their effects on developmental plasticity and physiology is crucial as it gives insight regarding biological evolution. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) affect the physiological regulatory process of insects as it mimics hormones associated with development. IGR’s have been reported for mortality and developmental abnormalities, especially regarding the larva stage [Thompson: 2005]. Manduca sexta is classified as having a holometabolous life cycle. The caterpillar undergoes the passings from one life cycle to another through molting. Molting permits the Manduca sexta to experience morphology and change in size. This is crucial as when analyzing the development of the Manduca sexta, as it presents where growth occurs. The Manduca sexta’s growth can be easily manipulated using IGRs; furthermore, making it the insect of choice when analyzing evolution of growth rate and physiological control [Kingsolver: 2007]. In this experiment, the caterpillars will be treated with an IGR called precor and further evaluated regarding length and weight measurements in order to reflect on their development. Precor is a mincing juvenile hormone (JH) which is a form of an insect growth regulator. Precor and JH acts as a growth regulator by controlling the type of molting during the stages of development. When present, it typically delays the caterpillars from becoming pupae. With the presence of an IGR, the caterpillars will develop abnormalities leading to death faster than the caterpillars that were not fed caterpillar food containing the IGR, precor. It is our hypothesis that an excessive amount of the IGR, precor, would negatively affect the caterpillar, meaning the weight and length would be below the average control caterpillars and ultimately, lead to death.

Materials and Methods:
Eight, eleven-twelve day-old, Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing 0.59-1.2 g and recording a length between 30 and 40 mm long were selected and divided into two groups of four. One group being the control and the other being the experimental group. Each caterpillar was separated and placed in a plastic container containing small breathing holes in the lids. Each container was labeled the caterpillar’s designated number and which group it was in. The control group was fed 10 grams of caterpillar food with six drops of water while the experimental group was fed 10 grams of caterpillar food with six drops of precor, an IGR. All the caterpillars were kept in the same condition in a refrigerator at 25 degrees Celsius. The refrigerator was on a 12 hour light cycle; the caterpillars are under artificial light for 12 hours and then no light for 12 hours. The caterpillars were observed, measured (millimeters), and weighed (grams) every day in the evening for two weeks. Plastic surgical gloves were utilized when handling the caterpillars. The caterpillars were weighed on a standard lab balance. The caterpillars received new food everyday along with six drops of water of precor depending on which group they were classified as. This was done in order to avoid the food from drying up. The waste produced by the caterpillars was disposed of every day. Statistical analyses consisted of two sample two-tailed, one for length and one for weight, in order to determine the p-value to see if there was any significance regarding the data. In addition, the statistical analysis included the means and the standard deviation. 

Results:
Initially, the treatment group surpassed the weight and length of the control group which increased significantly and then leveled, whereas the control group maintained consistent with both length and weight. This resulted in the control group weighing more and having longer recorded lengths in comparison to the experimental group by the end of the experiment (Fig. 1 & 2). The treatment group weighed more and was longer until the last three days where the control group reported to be longer and heavier. The average weight for the first day was 6.45 g +/-1.06 g for the treatment group and 0.64 g +/-0.034 g for the control group (Fig. 2). The average length for the first day was 35 mm +/-4.35 mm for the treatment group and 31 mm +/- 1.26 mm for the control group (Fig. 1). The average weight for the final day, day 14, was reported as 6.45 g +/- 1.06 g for the treatment group and 9.83 g +/-7.28 for the control group (Fig. 2). The average length for the final day, day 14, was reported as 65 mm +/- 26.16 mm for the treatment group 65 mm +/-1.14 mm for the control group (Fig. 1). We completed a two-sample t-test to analyze our results in order to find significance. There was no statistical significance regarding the weight (t-stat=1.26, df=22, P=0.219). In addition, there was no statistical significance regarding the length either (t-stat= 1.35, df=22, P=0.192).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that an excessive amount of IGR would negatively affect the caterpillars, meaning that the weight and length would be below average and ultimately, lead to death, was not supported. There was no significance proving our hypothesis that the IGR, precor, would lead to morality and development abnormalities. Although our results failed to support this, various scientific journals did find relevance when investigating the effects of IGRs. It is proven that IGR’s like Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone have an impact on the development of insects. It has been reported that IGRs affects the mortality and developmental abnormalities, especially regarding the larva stage. [Thompson: 2005]. There are two days missing in our 14-day experiment, leaving there only to be 12 data points. This was an error regarding our experiment as it negatively affected the trends shown. The statistical tests revealed that we reject the alternative because the p-value was greater 0.05. It is critical to investigate the impacts that precor and juvenile hormone (JH) have on insects as since they are growth regulators. With the presence of precor or JH, the insect will be unable to successfully morph from a pupa to an adult. This breaks the life cycle of the insect, furthermore, preventing infestation [Nijout: 1982]. In addition, hormones are an important part of development as it triggers growth. Identifying and understanding the effects of hormonal control and the impacts it has on developmental physiology is vital as it gives insight regarding biological evolution. Overall, it is crucial to investigate the effects of hormones on insects as it has a monumental impact on understanding biological development.
