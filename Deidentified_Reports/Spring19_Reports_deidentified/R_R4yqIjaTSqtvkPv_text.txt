Title: Effects of Caffeine Injection on Amplitude Voltage and Muscle Contractions of the Rana pipiens Frog Leg

Abstract:
The study of neurotransmission in organisms is a critical topic of physiological biology. Neurotransmission is the root of bodily function, as its basic systematical functions transcend to stimulate other physiological responses such as muscle contraction. The impact of neurotransmission on living organisms allows for a greater understanding of how the body carries out motor functions is impacted by varying levels of stimulants, such as caffeine, specifically in the scenario of the Rana pipiens frog leg. In this experiment we will be investigating the stimulus response, work, summation, and tightness in muscles and manipulating the gastrocnemius muscle by changing voltage amplitude to the sciatic nerve from a frog leg to investigate the elements of the neuromuscular control. We predicted that when the caffeine was injected into the frog leg, then the amplitude of the twitches would increase significantly. The resulting data demonstrated a statistical difference between the amplitude of the twitches of the frog legs that were injected with caffeine and the control group. Based on our observations and results, it can be inferred that there is a correlation between caffeine and muscle contraction.

Introduction:
In this experiment we will be investigating the stimulus response, work, summation, and tightness in muscles and manipulating the gastrocenemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a Rana pipiens frog leg to investigate the elements of the neuromuscular control. The gastrocenemius muscle primarily supplies the muscles of the lower leg in the sciatic nerves supplies sensation to the skin of the foot [Weber A: 1968] [Herz R: 1968]. The neuromuscular control functions to allow for an organism’s response to the internal and external stimuli of the environment. The neuromuscular system is composed of skeletal muscle composed of cylindrical shaped myofibers found together by connective tissues to form functional groups [Johnson: 2018]. The skeletal muscles are stimulated by motor neurons that stimulate axons to extend into the muscle to stimulate neuromuscular junctions. With the release of acetylcholine (Ach) is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, eventually opening sodium channels to augment an action potential by releasing calcium this network to system results in a muscular contraction, that summarizing the detailed process of neuromuscular control. Caffeine stimulates calcium release in muscle, causing tetany. Calcium plays the role of triggering muscle contractions, because when the calcium is pumped into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it binds to troponin on the actin filaments which then twists the tropomyosin to allow for the myosin head to bridge to the actin sites. This allows the actin and myosin filaments to slide past each other, which causes the contraction of muscles. In this investigation we will be observing the result of changing the amplitude of the voltage in the frequency of the stimulus when applying shock to stimulate the frog leg’s nerve prior to and after the injection of caffeine. These muscular contractions can be measured by a contraction curve called a myogram [Ebashi S: 2009] [Endo M: 2009] [Ohtsuk I: 2009]. We predict that when the amplitude and the frequency of the stimulus increases, it will result in more twitches, thus resulting in faster, more frequent muscle contractions in the leg. The independent variable is the change and amplitude and frequency while the deep and it wearable is the amount of muscle contractions. 

Materials and Methods:
Three Rana pipiens frog legs were selected for experimentation, where the skin was removed to expose the gastrocnemius muscle. The gastrocnemius muscle was suspended to a 90-degree angle upwards and metal pins were used to hold down the bones in the leg to allow for proper stimulation. A LabScribe-stimulating device was adjusted to 5 milliseconds in pulse width with an amplitude of 1.0mV in order to find the threshold voltage. After inserting the LabScribe stimulating pins, the frog leg was stimulated prior to caffeine injection as a means to serve as a control measurement. The muscle was injected with 1mL of caffeine and then was stimulated. The remaining two frog legs underwent the same stimulations. A paired T test was used to measure the difference in the amplitude of the contraction from before to after caffeine injection.

Results:
The amplitude of the Rana pipiens frog leg muscle increased after injection of 0.1mL of caffeine. It was determined that the threshold voltage for the muscle and the sciatic nerve was of a 0.4V value. It was observed that temporal summation began at 4Hz and was increased at 5Hz. Incomplete tetany was marked at 10 Hz but complete tetany was reached at 25Hz and continued through 50Hz. An increased force was noticed at 25Hz. Some fatigue became visible at 50Hz and at 100Hz more fatigue was witnessed. The degrees of freedom of the paired T- test was 2 and the P-value 0.353. The results were displayed in a bar graph with included standard deviation with averages deriving from pre-caffeine-injection and post-caffeine-injection. The graph displayed an evident trend of concordance between caffeine injection and amplitude, as the post-caffeine-injection trials resulted in higher amplitudes than that of the trials conducted pre-caffeine-injection.

Discussion:
The injection of caffeine stimulates higher levels of calcium release to the extent where muscle contractions occur so frequently that tetany is attained. More specifically, caffeine has antagonistic effects to those of adenosine, stimulating neurotransmitter release instead of inhibiting it [Kalmar JM: 1999] [Cafarelli E: 1999]. Adenosine, an endogenous metabolite, inhibits neurotransmitter release and neuronal firing rates by binding to receptors of the central nervous system, therefore the antagonistic effect would be an increase in neurotransmitter release as displayed by the effects of caffeine on the frog muscle [Kalmar JM: 1999] [Cafarelli E: 1999]. The results of the investigation supported our hypothesis because the amplitude increased in concordance with the injection of caffeine. We reject the null hypothesis for all trials at the .05 level that there is a statistically significant in that muscle contractions increased in concordance with the increasing amplitude. In previous investigations, it was found that caffeine causes dose-dependent increases in the force and duration of the contradiction of the skeletal muscle [Kolawole: 2011] [Archie: 2011] [Olorunshola: 2011]. Considering such, our hypothesis accurately depicts the direct effects of caffeine. We should study the physiological effects of caffeine, as it pertains to impacting other realms of study such as psychiatry; muscle contractions increase blood pressure, thus raising one’s heart rate and has the potential to provoke anxiety. To further the investigation, a potential, larger-scale experiment, such as working with the stimulation of a different nerve under different conditions to see if the same results apply.
