Title: Quality of Water has No Effect on the Aggressive Behaviors per Second of Betta splendins

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to determine if there was a significent difference in the aggressive behaviors of betta fish (Betta splendins) in clear water versus murky water. Betta fish are known to demonstrate certain aggressive behaviors when in the presence of other Betta fish so we tested to see if there is a difference in rate of aggressive behaviors shown in the two different treatments. We hypothesized that in murky water, the fish would exhibit a lower rate of aggressive behaviors per second than in clear water. This was tested by observing the number of aggressive behaviors a certain fish performed in both treatments in a total of three trials and then this value was divided by the number of seconds that each trial lasted. The results showed that there was no significent difference between the rate of aggressive behaviors shown in either condition. 

Introduction:
Through a combination of both evolution and their surrounding environment and upbringing, all animals have developed a certain set of behaviors that they utilize when presented with a certain context. These behaviors can consist of ways to act in order to attract mates or ways to act when in the presence of another of the same species to protect the individuals territory or partners or any other possible scenario. The understanding of both the evolution and the actual meaning of such behaviors is important to us because it can help us to understand the minds of any species which could be important to us since we lack any other clear way to understand the organisms around us. Ultimately this could help us to further understand ourselves. 
	Betta fish, a fish found in murky river water in southeast Asia, exhibit a clear pattern of behaviors when presented with a certain stimulus, but they are most famous for their extremely aggressive behaviors. It is known that they have two types of aggressive behaviors - broadside movements and facing movements - each category has three tiers of behavior that are organized in order of aggression that they communicate. For broadside movements, the least aggressive is pelvic fin flickering, moving it’s pelvic fin vertically, then tail beating, making sudden movements with the caudal fin towards the opponent and finally tail flashing, which consists of closing and opening the caudal fin. For facing movements, the least aggressive is facing the opponent with the pectoral fins erect, then spreading of the gill covers or opercula and finally protruding the branchiostegal membranes, which will create the appearance of a red mane [Bones: 2017].
	With these behaviors in mind, our lab group wanted to experiment with how different water quality would affect the frequency of aggressive behaviors, measured in behaviors per second, because the aggressive behaviors in betta fish are triggered by visually identifying another fish and differing water quality essentially changes their ability to spot each other [Thompson: 1966]. Specifically we wanted to investigate how frequently they would make behaviors in clear water versus in murky water which would replicate their natural habitat despite the fact that it impaired their vision. I hypothesized that the fish would exhibit fewer aggressive behaviors per second in murky water. 


Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis, we simulated murky water by adding soil to one container of water in no specific quantity, just enough that there was little visibility in the water, and filled another container with just clear water as a controll. Then we labeled three male betta fish as 1, 2 and 3 and rotated two of them in and out of the respective container in the following sequence. First was Fish 1 and Fish 2 in clear water, then F2 and F3 in clear water and finally F3 and F1 in clear water. Then we repeated the procedure in murky water, again starting with F1 and F2, then F2 and F3 and finally F3 and F1. Each time, the fish were placed together in the container with no barrier separating them for a period of five minutes (300 seconds) or until it was no longer safe to have the two fish together and in that case the amount of seconds was recorded so the rate could still be calculated. After each trial, the fish were all three separated for another five minute period so they did not become habituated with each other. 
	The aggressive behavior totals were calculated by counting how many times each behavior was observed and then multiplying each level of behavior by a certain constant to account for the differing levels of aggressiveness of the behaviors. The least aggressive behaviors were multiplied by 1, the middle tier by 2 and the most aggressive by 3. In each trial, one fish was focused on and the other was there purely as an opponent but it’s actions were not counted for the data which lead to the following sequence of fish that were focused on: F1 in the first trial of both clear and murky, F2 in the second trial of both, and F3 in the third trial of both. The total amount of aggressive behaviors was then calculated and divided by the total number of seconds that each trial lasted for to calculate aggressive behaviors per second. The values of the two treatments were taken and used in a paired t_test to determine if there existed a significent difference in the two. 


Results:
The experiment found that there is no significent difference between the number of aggressive behaviors per second between betta fish in clear water versus murky water (t_stat = 2.6229, d.f. = 2, P-value = 0.1198). The average aggressive behaviors per second for clear water was 0.14 +/0.07 and the average aggressive behaviors per second in murky water was 0.01 +/- 0.01. As can be seen in Figure 1, both groups had means that were quite far apart but a standard error that was very large so they could not be considered significently different. 


Discussion:
These results did not support the hypothesis because the p_value on the paired t_test was 0.1198 which is above the alpha value of 0.05 so was fail to reject the null hypothesis that the two treatments are the same. This result contradicts a study that found that betta fish were slightly less aggressive in obscured water although our experiment also showed they were on average less aggressive just not significently [Kiryakoza:2016]. The most likely reason for this seems to be that the water was almost too murky so the fish had a hard time detecting each other and then reacting. Additionally, it should be mentioned that these fish have lived their entire lives in clear water so their natural habitat of murky water would to them actually be unnatural, in other words they could have been less comfortable and maybe focused less on defending their own territory and fighting other fish. The experiment may have worked better if betta fish that had previously lived in murky water were then transferred to clear water and then were compared or if there had been less soil placed in the water. In this experiment, the amount of soil placed in the water was not measured so in the future multiple trials could been conducted, each with a differing amount of soil that is measured. In such an experiment, we would be able to definitively determine if the water from this experiment was in fact just too murky and that is what caused there to be no discernible difference between the two conditions.
