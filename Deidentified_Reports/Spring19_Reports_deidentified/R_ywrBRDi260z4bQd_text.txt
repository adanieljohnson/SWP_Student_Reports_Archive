Title: The effect of the insect growth regulator Gentrol on the growth and development of [Manduca sexta]

Abstract:
This study aims to study the change in growth and development of [Manduca sexta] when treated with Insect Growth Regulators. It was hypothesized that if [Manduca sexta] are treated with Gentrol, the individuals will experience inhibited growth in length and mass compared to a control group treated with DI water. Vertebrate growth and development is controlled primarily by hormones, so many Insect Growth Regulators use hormones that prevent development to treat pests. The treatment group experienced a greater change in length and mass than the control group. This is likely due to the control group entering the Pupa phase of the life cycle where there is extreme morphological change while the treatment group stayed stuck in the larval stage where more growth occurs. 


Introduction:
The test subject of this experiment is [Manduca sexta], an insect in the order Lepidoptera. These organisms undergo a Holometabolous life cycle consisting of egg, larvae, pupa, and adult stages. There is a major body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis. [Johnson: 2018]. All insects and vertebrates control growth, development, and behavior using hormone and neuron signaling. Hormones are received by the brain as inputs, the brain then sends output signals to different organs or tissues in the body to create a response. In order to control unwanted insect populations, substances called insect growth regulators (IGRs) can be used to disrupt processes of development regulated by insect hormones. IGRs often mimic Juvenile Hormone in order to stop the life cycle from progressing [Staal:1975]. This experiment used Gentrol, an IGR that contains a mimic of Juvenile Hormone to prevent development. It was hypothesized that if [Manduca sexta] are treated with Gentrol, the individuals will experience inhibited growth in length and mass compared to a control group treated with DI water. 


Materials and Methods:
Two plastic containers with four compartments each were obtained. One was labeled as Gentrol #1-4 and one as control #1-4. 10g of food was put in each compartment and 10 drops of treatment were mixed in. One [Manduca sexta] (that was treated with IGR/Precor/Control the previous week) was placed in each compartment after their mass and length was recorded. They were then placed in the incubator and monitored each day for seven days. If the food became dried out, it was replaced. At the end of the period, mass and length were measured again. A one-tailed t test was used for statistical analysis. 





Results:
The Gentrol treatment group had a higher change in length than the control group. The control group experienced an average decrease in length over time. There is significant difference between the change in length between the control and treatment groups. (p=0.016)
The Gentrol treatment group experienced a larger change in mass than the control group. There is significant difference between the change in mass between the control and treatment groups. (p=0.015)


Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis that if [Manduca sexta] are treated with Gentrol, the individuals will experience inhibited growth in length and mass compared to a control group treated with DI water. In the experiment, the Gentrol treatment group experienced a larger change in length and mass than the control group. This is likely because the Gentrol was inhibiting them from developing to the next stage of the life cycle and they experienced prolonged time in the fifth-instar stage [Tunaz:2004]. Gentrol uses a Juvenile Hormone mimic, and when JH is applied during the prepupal stages prevents pupation [Kiguchi:1978]. The control individuals were not stopped from progressing into the Pupa stage, so they did not have as much change in length and mass, though they were still developing. During pupation, there are extreme changes in body composition and morphology. A 1980 study showed [Manduca sexta] gain weight at the slowest rate during the fifth instar and gain weight at the fastest rate during the first instar [Reinecke:1980], which can account for the greater weight/length changes in the worms prevented from progressing along the life cycle. This study could be improved by measuring the individuals each day instead of only at the beginning and end of the seven day period. This would allow the experiment to track the rate of growth and the changes to growth rate over time instead of just from beginning to end. This could allow for a better understanding of exactly what stage of life each individual is in so growth patterns could be better understood. It could also be improved by using test subjects at the start of their life cycle becuase the ones used in this experiment were given Precor, IGR, or DI the previous week. Continuing the experiment over a greater length of time could also produce a pattern of results that showed more parts of the life cycle of [Manduca sexta].
