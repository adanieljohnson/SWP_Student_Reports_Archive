Title: Manduca sexta and the effects of azadirachtin hormone inhibiting growth and maturity.

Abstract:
In this study, Manduca sexta is a caterpillar that undergoes a holometabolous life cycle eventually turning into a moth. Ecdysterone is a growth hormone that regulates the developmental stages in its life cycle, so scientists have questioned how to block the hormone in order to regulate the reproduction of the pests which harm environmental and economic aspects. Azadirachtin, the blocking hormone of ecdysterone, and water were used on the experimental and controll groups and their masses were recorded every day in order to see the physical impacts on the caterpillars growth. The results were significent, according to the p_value of 0.00424, in which the controll group had the greatest average change in mass in a 10-day period in comparison the experimental group. All caterpillars in the controll group had pupated while none in the experimental group had finished their larva stages. The study showed that azadirachtin had a significent impact on the growth of the caterpillar and the stages it experiences in its life cycle. The hypothesis states that when azadiractin is used as a blocking hormone, then the pupae will grow in mass and size because the hormone that regulates molting will not controll its next life cycle stages of maturity. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is a pest know to feed off the leaves of various plants, harming the production of crops for farmers. The caterpillar follows a holometabolous life cycle meaning that it has four major life stages: the egg, larvae, pupa, and adult all within a short and observable period of time. When the insect is at its larva stage, the hormones ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone impact its developmental stages leading up to the commitment pulse, indicating the larvae is ready to pupate. So, scientists question what happens to the growth of these larvae when one of these hormones is blocked, such as ecdysterone, which regulates the timing of molting during insect development. The hormone azadirachtin blocks ecdysterone, and according to previous research, low concentrations of azadirachtin results in defective pupae where pupation could still occur [Schlüter: 1985]. This is important to know because if there is a solution to figure out how to controll the growth or rate of the caterpillar’s development, it can help farmers in regulating the health of their crops. Azadirachtin acts as an independent variable in this experiment as it tests whether or not the dependent variable of the mass of the caterpillars will increase. Our hypothesis states that if the Manduca sexta receives azadirachtin blocking hormone, then the insect will grow in mass and size as larvae because they will not contain the hormone ecdysterone to regulate when they have reached the commitment pulse and are matured to molt.



Materials and Method:
In this procedure there were a total of eight caterpillars, four caterpillars in the controll group and four caterpillars in the experimental group. The four caterpillars in the controll group were treated with 10 grams of food with five drops (0.25 Ml) of water each from a pipette. The four caterpillars in the experimental group were treated with 10 grams of food with five drops (0.25 Ml) of azadirachtin solution each from a pipette. The azadirachtin blocked the hormone 20E which enables viewers to see the growth rate of the experimental group in comparison to the controll group. The caterpillars were checked every 24 hours to measure their mass, clean their living spaces, and to give more food with either water for the controll group or the azadirachtin solution for the experimental group. The caterpillars were maintained in an incubator where they had 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark which was in a 25-degree Celsius temperature. Because the two groups were split into a categorical and measurement variables, the statistical test used was a one tailed two-sample t_test.

Results:
By the end of the trial, all caterpillars in the controll group were alive and all caterpillars in the experimental group, except caterpillar labeled three, were alive. The controll group was the categorical variable and the experimental group was the measurement variable, because of this the statistical test was the one tailed t-sample t_test. On day 10, all of the caterpillars in the controll group had pupated but the caterpillars in the experimental group remained in the larvae stages. In both the controll and experimental groups, the caterpillars declined in their masses after 10 days. The final masses of the controll groups varied in large compared to each other while the masses of the experimental groups remained very similar besides the mass of experimental caterpillar labeled three. The mean change in mass of the controll caterpillars was 5.07 g +/- 1.41 g and the mean change in mass of the experimental caterpillars was 1.38 g +/- 1.30 g (Figure 1). The average of the controll group compared to the experimental group was statistically significently different (t-value = 3.85, d.f. = 6, one-tailed p-vale = 0.00424). 

Discussion:
Based on the results found, the hypothesis was not supported because the controll group that contained the hormone ecdysterone grew to larger masses in comparison to the experimental group. The data found is statistically significent; however, the stated hypothesis does not interpret the data discovered. The p_value shows how the data was significent because it was below 0.05. Since the data was significent, it rejects the null hypothesis because the controll group grew in larger mass and size compared to the experimental group. Since the hypothesis was not supported, it can be interpreted that when ecdysterone is blocked by azadirachtin it prevents normal development into the pupal stage. This happens because it reduces levels of prothoracicotropic hormone activity in the brain which helps signal molting synthesis. [Barnby: 1990] When ecdysterone is blocked, its concentration levels can never rise after the 4th larva stage, so the caterpillars cannot grow in mass or size past the 4th larva stage when the prothoracic glands become less receptive. [Barnby: 1990] When ecdysterone doesn’t reach its concentration peak, it cannot reach its second peak to trigger the commitment pulse indicating it is ready for pupation. If the caterpillar is ready for pupation, there is a significent release of 20E from the prothoracicotropic hormone, but this is blocked by azadirachtin which caused the experimental group to remain their size. As additional volume of azadirachtin was given to the dry food or to moisten the new food, the organisms appeared to eat less which had an effect on the rate of growth of the organisms. This is because azadirachtin has a direct effect on the production of typsin which helps with the utilization of dietary nitrogen. [Timmins: 1992] Azadirachtin inhibits the production of a digestive enzyme, so this suggests that it reduces the growth rate of the Manduca sexta because it also acts as an antifeedant along with a growth inhibitor. [Timmins: 1992]The data does not support the hypothesis, but it does show that azadirachtin blocking hormone is a pesticide. Azadirachtin acts as a pesticide because it will block endocrine routes for the process of growing in mass and size and that it caused the organisms to digest less as the blocking hormone disturbs herbivore proteinases. This is important because it proves how crops may be regulated if they contaminate their fields with this growth blocking hormone. According to previous research, there are good results in insect controll when they obtain seed extracts containing azadirachtin under field conditions. [Schmutterer: 1988] This shows how caterpillars will not reproduce and spread throughout crops if they are properly taken care of. Because the data is so significent, a new hypothesis to test for future procedures could be to test the concentrations of azadirachtin on varying groups of caterpillars and test to see their changes in mass.

Figure 1: The effect of the water and azadirachtin hormone on the average change of mass of Manduca sexta. The caterpillars consuming water had a significently larger increase in growth (5.07 g +/- 1.41 g) compared to those consuming azadirachtin (1.38 g +/- 1.30 g). The standard deviation remained nearly equivalent for both sets of data with only a difference of 0.11 g in standard deviation.*************************************************************************
