Title: Energy Allocation of Raphanus sativus Growing Under Different Colored Light

Abstract:
Plants require many biotic and abiotic factors in order to be successful. One of these factors is sunlight so that photosynthesis can occur. When the wavelength of sunlight is altered, the plants must allocate their resources differently in order to survive. This experiment monitored and compared the root to shoot (R:S) ratio of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus plants under red and green light in order to see which allowed the plants to grow more. We hypothesized that red light would allow the plants to grow more, and thus result in a larger R:S ratio for weight and length than green light would. The data for weight was not statistically significant (p = 0.13), and the data for length was statistically significant with a (p = 0.009).

Introduction:
This labs examines the differences in root and shoot growth of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus plants under green and red light. Plants need a variety of nutrients and specific conditions in order to thrive ecologically and evolutionarily. Some of the requirements they have are sunlight, water, and specific minerals from the soil. Some of these, such as minerals in the soil are a result of other organisms and are considered biotic factors, while others such as sunlight and wind are abiotic factors. In order to obtain these resources, plants must interact with their environment, but they also must remain rooted while they do so. This leads to resource limitation, and in this particular experiment the limitation is sunlight of different colors. Light at different colors such as green or red has a change in wavelength, which affects the way plants absorb the light. Plants do not absorb light well at green wavelengths because they contain chlorophyll. When green light reaches the chlorophyll, it is reflected rather than absorbed, and this is what gives plants their green color and also explains why plants cannot successfully grow in just green light. Plants absorb red wavelengths the best because these are the wavelengths that can be absorbed by the chlorophyll [Kami: 2010]. When plants are unable to effectively absorb light, it inhibits their ability to photosynthesize, and therefore becomes a limitation. Because of this limitation, the plants must allocate their resources in their roots and shoots depending on how much sunlight is absorbed so that they can survive. These differences in roots and shoots lead to variation within a species. The model organism for this experiment is a radish plant because of its manageable size, availability, and reproducibility since it is a common plant in this area. We hypothesize that the R:S ratio for radish plants grown in green light will be smaller since chlorophyll cannot absorb the light at that wavelength, and plants grown in red light will have a larger R:S ratio. 


Materials and Methods:
The experiment began by planting four pots of radishes, each with 12 seeds. Two pots were placed under green light, and two were placed under red light. Each pot was watered with 100mL of water every day for two weeks. After two weeks, 10 plants from each condition were separated and cut so that the roots and the shoots were divided. Each root and shoot for every replicate in red or green light was then measured for mass and length. All of the data was recorded and statistical tests were done by means of one-tailed, unpaired t-test. 


Results:
The R:S ratios for length were 0.530 +/- 0.240 under red light and 0.030 +/- 0.011 under green light. The R:S ratios for weight were 0.048 +/- 0.049 under red light and 0.961 +/- 0.410 under green light. These results are summarized in Figure 1. We ran an unpaired t-test and found (t = 1.14, df = 18, p = 0.13) for weight and (t = 2.57, df = 18, p = 0.009) for length. 


Discussion:
Based on our data, our hypothesis was partially supported. The p-value for weight shows that the data was not statistically significant, but the p-value for length shows that it was statistically significant. The R:S ratio for weight in the green light was smaller than that for the red light, but the R:S ratio for length in green light was larger. These results suggest that this is because of energy allocation. Since chlorophyll cannot absorb light at green wavelengths, it allocates its sources to its roots in order to obtain nutrients due to the fact that is not getting sufficient light energy. This caused the roots to grow longer, making the R:S ratio larger. The weight of the roots and the shoots in green light was lower, which led to a lower R:S ratio. Although the length R:S ratio showed significant difference, the experiment as a whole could have been improved by using different wavelengths that plants can absorb better as a comparison to green, which is reflected. In a related study done on lettuce plants, biomass and photosynthetic ability were measured on plants growing under green, red, and blue light. The blue light showed an increase in these parameters, and red and green light showed a decrease [Muneer: 2014]. This experiment emphasizes that both red and green light have negative effects on the growth of plants, and therefore a comparison between other wavelengths would provide further information about potential positive effects. Further studies could include monitoring plant growth under wavelengths closer to blue and violet and seeing if there is an overall positive effect compared to when they are grown in natural sunlight. Studies done on rice leaves further support that blue light provides the most ideal conditions for plants due to the effects on photosynthesis, which is similar to the outcome of the radishes and lettuce [Matsuda: 2004]. Similar studies to this could be done on a variety of different species of plants in order to see if certain plants have an affinity for a specific wavelength of light. These studies could help botanists and agriculturalists utilize the best conditions for plant success, as well as attempt to filter out practices that are not beneficial. Limitations to this experiment included a maximum time of two weeks and the set up of the experiment. The light for the plants was covered by colored sheets of plastic, but the green covered seemed to barely change the color of the light, at least visibly. If the cover was not green enough, it may not have drastically changed the wavelength that the plant was receiving the light, and therefore may have skewed the information.
