Title: Effect of nitrogen access on P. sativun root:shoot ratios

Abstract:
This study looks into the resource allocation of nitrogen in P. sativun (field pea) plants.  Plants will change their phenotypes based on the environment around them and their relative access to resources based on phenotypic plasticity.  Root:shoot ratios of both weight and length are an optimal way to analyze the differences in phenotypes of these plants.  When placed in different concentrations of nitrogen fertilizer, the P. sativun plants showed a trend where root:shoot ratio would increase as the concentration of fertilizer decreased.  This can be accounted for by the fact that root size increased in order to increase the amount of nitrogen in tissues.

Introduction:
Plants are able to grow in all different environments with all different kinds of resources due to a phenomenon called resource allocation.  Resource allocation allows plants to survive in adverse conditions where they may not have access to necessary resources such as sunlight, water, nitrogen, and carbon [Brown: 1997].  With the prevalence of climate change, resource allocation is becoming increasingly important. In today’s constantly changing environment, we will see great changes in plants due to their phenotypic plasticity in order to take in resources and grow at higher rates [Ayres: 1993].  In this study we will look into the resource allocation of P. sativun (field peas) based on the amount of fertilizer they have access to.  Changing the amount of fertilizer alters the amount of nitrogen the P. sativun has access to, which is a crucial resource for plant growth.  We hypothesize that with an decreased presence of nitrogen in the soil there should be a higher root:shoot ratio both based on weight and length because the roots will need to be longer in order to absorb more nutrients, making the ratio larger.

Materials and Method:
We began by obtaining nine planting boxes filled with vermiculite, placing small holes in the boxes (16 holes in each with a 4x4 conformation), and then placing three seeds in each hole to ensure growth.  We created three different dilutions of MiracleGro®️ fertilizer: 100% (1000 Ml of just fertilizer), 50% (500 Ml of fertilizer and 500 Ml of water), and 25% (250 Ml of fertilizer and 750 Ml of water).  On three of the boxes we poured 250 Ml of the 100% concentration, and did the same with the other two concentrations.  We then watered the peas daily for two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks we carefully removed three singular plants from each box, cleaned them off, and measured the weight of the whole plants, the weights of the roots and shoots separately, and the lengths of the roots and shoots separately to calculate the root:shoot length ratio and the root:shoot weight ratio.We performed an ANOVA test for significance.

Results:
The mean root:shoot length ratio (Fs=1.028, d.f.=2, P=.078) for 100% was 1.49 ± 0.38, for 50% was 1.2 ± 0.15 and for 25% was 0.91 ± 0.13.  The mean root:shoot weight ratio (Fs=1.775, d.f.=2, P=.248) for 100% was 1.94 ± 0.50, for 50% was 1.52 ± 0.14, and for 25% was 1.46 ± 0.27. 

Discussion:
The data we received shows trends that would confirm our hypothesis that both weight and length root:shoot ratios would decrease as the concentration of fertilizer increased.  However, the ANOVA test for significance shows that the differences in the data are not significent.  The differences in the length are more significent than the differences in weight with p_values of 0.078 and 0.248 respectively.  The p_value for length was nearly significent which indicates that reperforming the experiment with a larger sample size could ,ake the results significent.  A reason that the data trended in favor of our hypothesis could be that increasing tissue nitrogen concentration is found to be primarily related to an increase in allocation to roots, meaning that the roots would do more work to absorb nitrogen which requires more root surface area (thereby increasing root length and weight relative to the shoot) [Hilbert: 1990].  A limitation of this study is that the plants only grew for two weeks, lengthening the amount of time for growth could have provided more optimal results,  Additionally, we only had space to grow three boxes worth of plants for each concentration, increasing the amount of plants would provide for more reliable data.  That being said, the general trends of our data were very good despite it not being significent, and would help to provide insight into the resource allocation of plants in areas that are nitrogen deficient.  It helps to show what kind of plants could be expected to grown in different areas where access to nitrogen is different.  In the future, data on resource allocation as a whole could be extremely useful as the climate around us continues to change and resources become less available to plants and we can alter the kinds of plant we grow in order to maximize plant growth in agriculture for the population.
