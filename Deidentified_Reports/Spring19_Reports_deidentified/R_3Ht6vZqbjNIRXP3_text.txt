Title: Resource allocation in Medicago Sativa in the presence of the Rhizobia bacteria

Abstract:
The purpose of the research was to determine the effect of the Rhizobium bacteria on the root:shoot length ratio of alfalfa. It is known that Rhizobium and alfalfa have a biological symbiotic relationship. Rhizobium fixates nitrogen while the bacterium depends on the plant for energy. Alfalfa needs nitrogen to grow and, due to this requirement for nitrogen, the roots of the plants without the bacteria will be longer than those with the bacteria. This difference in root length is a result of alfalfa’s necessity for important resources. The experiment preformed did prove that root:shoot was effected by the presence of rhizobium. 

Introduction:
The Rhizobia bacterium is a diazotroph. This means that it can take nitrogen from the air and turn it into a form that is useful to plants and other organisms (Rice:2005). This conversion of nitrogen in air to a usable form of nitrogen is known as nitrogen fixation. Legumes such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa) benefit from this process by rhizobium. Alfalfa needs carbon, hydrogen and oxygen like most plants but unlike others they need copious amounts of nitrogen. If the soil does not contain the needed amount of nitrogen, then the plant will die or try to find more within the soil. This searching for nitrogen within the soil causes the plant to grow longer roots which means that the shoots of the plant will be shorter. This process is known as resource allocation. This means that a plant will expend more resources in one area of the plant and reduce the amount it uses elsewhere. How these plants use their limited resources determines how well it can survive. This shifting of focus from other areas of the plant to focus on one area is known as a trade-off. This ability to do this in plants is known as phenotypic plasticity (Johnson:2016). Alfalfa relies on the rhizobia bacterium to produce nitrogen as the bacterium relies on the alfalfa plant to produce needed amino acids that it uses for energy. The Rhizobia bacterium forms nodules on the roots of the plant. This is known as a biological symbiotic relationship because both organisms benefit from this process and neither one is harmed. An experiment by Hamdi Zahran determined that the fixation of nitrogen by rhizobium was far superior to other systems of nitrogen uptake by the alfalfa under extreme conditions (Zahran: 1999). In the lab, we tested this relationship between rhizobia and alfalfa by examining how the plants allocated in the presence or absence of the rhizobia bacteria. Our hypothesis is that due to this symbiotic relationship and considering plant allocation, that the root to shoot ratio of the alfalfa with the rhizobium bacteria will be smaller than that of the alfalfa without the bacterium.

Materials and Method:
About a hand.f.ul of alfalfa seeds that were soaked in water to soften the outer coat so that planting in vermiculite would be effective. The experimental plants were prepared with the rhizobium bacteria mixture. This mixture contained two types of the rhizobium bacteria. When the rhizobium was placed in the experimental pots, the bacteria was placed directly on the seeds and covered in a layer of vermiculite. The controlls were prepared without the bacteria. Two pots were prepared as controlls and two were prepared as the experimental. All of the seeds were then watered with 50Ml of miracle grow to get the plants started. Then the plants were watered every other day with 200Ml of water for two weeks. To analyze how the plants allocated we analyzed the root and shoot length to then determine the root to shoot ratio of each plant. We separated three to four plants from the vermiculite and the clusters. The plants were then gently washed with water and patted dry on a paper towel. The roots and shoots were separated at the junction and the measurements were recorded. A two sample one tailed t_test was performed to determine the significance of our findings.

Results:
The mean root to shoot length ratio for the controlls is 4.66  1.14. The mean root to shoot length ratio for the experimental group was 2.08  0.616 as shown in Table 1. The values are graphed with error bars in Figure 1. As seen in Figure 1, the root:shoot length ratio for the controlls were higher than that of the experimental groups. A two sample two tail t_test was performed to determine the significance of the data. The results of the two sample one-tailed t_test are as follows: p_value was 5.15E-16, degree of freedom of 58, and a t-value of 10.931996. This p_value indicates a significent difference between the groups measured.

Discussion:
As determined by the experiment and the statistical test preformed it was determined that the presence of rhizobium had a significent effect on the root to shoot ratio of the alfalfa. The p_value from the t_test determined that the null hypothesis could be rejected, and the alternate hypothesis supported. The possible reason why the roots were longer in the controll group was because of the plant’s need for nitrogen in the roots. The plant then used its resources to find more nitrogen within the soil. This necessity and choice for longer roots caused the shoots to be shorter. The experimental group however had the bacterium to supply it with enough nitrogen so that it could focus its growth on the shoots rather than the roots. Barbara Symanowicz and their team found that fertilizing alfalfa with NPKFe1Mo1 increased the nitrogen fixated by rhizobium in the roots of the alfalfa (Symanowicz: 2018). In further research, it would be a good idea to explore adding substances such as the ones mentioned by Symanowicz with the alfalfa and the rhizobium and determine its effects on plant allocation and the nitrogen fixation of the bacteria. Farmers can use the information presented by this experiment to help them increase yield when growing alfalfa.
