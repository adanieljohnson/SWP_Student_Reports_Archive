Title: The Effects of Sevine Solution on Frequencies at which Muscle Tetany is Achieved in Frog Muscle

Abstract:
Muscle contractions are initiated by a chain of events following the bonding of acetylcholine to the
acetylcholine receptors in neuromuscular junctions. Following acetylcholine release
acetylcholinesterase breaks down the acetylcholine in the receptors reverting them to how they
were before being activated however when exposed to an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor this
enzyme is not present to clear these junctions. It was hypothesized that a muscle injected with
this inhibitor would show signs of fatigue at lower frequencies than muscle without the inhibitor.
The observed effects were not significent and the hypothesis that muscle exposed to the ​inhibitor
would have lower frequency levels at which it would achieve tetany was rejected.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles, like the gastrocnemus frogs, are formed through strands consisting of bundles
of myofibers which are multicellular fibers of muscle cells. These muscle cells act through
stimulation of motor neuron which releases the chemical acetylcholine from synapses into the
junction containing muscle cell membrane folded causing a high surface area. In this junction,​
acetylcholine interacts with its receptor to open sodium channels before being eventually cleared
by acetylcholinesterase. The opening of these sodium channels causes a depolarization within
the muscle cell leading to a change in the cells DHP receptor which prevents Ca2+ ions from
escaping the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As a result, once a depolarization occurs the chain of
events leads to a release of Ca2+ into the muscle cell which directly leads to the initiation of
muscle contractions. [Johnson: 2016] Sevine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which prevents
the clearing of acetylcholine receptor sites by greatly limiting the presence of the enzyme that
breaks down acetylcholine. The corresponding reaction is a continued supply of Ca2+ in muscle
cells leading to continued contraction. [Panenic: 1999] Due to this information we hypothesized
that frog legs once exposed to sevine would exhibit a lower frequency threshold before achieving
tetany.

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were dissected which consisted of removing the skin and exposing both the
sciatic nerve, separating the gastrocnemus from the bone and severing the Achilles tendon. The
base of the gastrocnemus was then tied to a piece of string and suspended from the
electrophysiological recorder. The leg was pinned and finally,​ the electrode needles were placed
below the sciatic nerve. The nerve was stimulated beginning with two Hz and then by
progressively higher frequencies (2 Hz, 4 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 25 Hz, 50 Hz) until tetany was
reached. This was repeated three times, once for each leg. Each gastrocnemus was then
injected with one Ml of 2% sevine solution. The 1 Ml was spread throughout the muscle in
various injection sites. Each leg, once injected, was tested again following the same procedure as
when untreated. A paired t_test was then performed for the data.

Results:
The results for all trials were consistent as leg one reached tetany at 50 Hz before sevine treatment and the remaining legs reached tetany at 25 Hz with and without sevine treatment (fig 1). Additionally, leg one when treated with 2% sevine solution reached tetany at 25 Hz. In accordance with the performed paired t_test,​ the results were insignificent. (d.f.=2, t_stat=1, p value=0.4226) The first frog leg exhibited visible contractions for both the controll and the treatment tests. The second and third legs failed to show strong visible contractions for their treatment test after having contracted normally for the controll tests, however, they gave recording for the contractions that were exhibited.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that frog legs treated with 2% sevine solution would reach tetany faster was
rejected. Due to the paired t_test results,​ it was suggested that 2% sevine does not have a high
correlation with lowering the frequency at which tetany is achieved in the gastrocnemus of frogs.
This was suggested through the p_value of 0.42265. While sevine and other acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors are known to be toxic in organisms as they lead to an excess of acetylcholine the short
nature of the experiment means that should not have played a role in the lack diversity in results.
[Panenic: 1999] The lack of diversity in results means that it may be beneficial if the experiment
was recreated to use smaller increments of frequency and to perhaps bypass making many trials
at low frequencies as the leg can only withstand a certain amount of simulations due to it being
removed from its organism. Additionally, these smaller increments would allow for a researcher to
differentiate between where tetany is achieved for each individual leg between the values of 10
and 25 Hz where the frequency jumped occurred leading to tetany in nearly all subjects. Also if
results were still not definitive the sevine concentration or the amount of solution injected could be
increased to see if a result was visible then.
