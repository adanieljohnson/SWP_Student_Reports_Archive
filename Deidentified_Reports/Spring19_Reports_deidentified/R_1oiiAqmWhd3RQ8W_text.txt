Title: Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibition in Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Hormones play an important role in all plants and animals, because they send signals throughout the organism that help cause specific reactions. One important hormone for the specie we studied, the Manduca Sexta, is the hormone ecdysterone. It regulates the timing of molting in the larval stage of the Manduca Sexta. Whena caterpillar does not have a sufficient amount of ecdysterone in its body, it is incapable of growing to its final larval stage and cannot pupate, making it smaller. If the amount of the hormone ecdysterone in a Manduca Sexta is inhibited, it’s mass will be smaller than a Manduca Sexta with normal ecdysterone levels. After observing a control and experimental group for 13 days, we discovered that our hypothesis was true because our experimental group had a much smaller average mass than our control group. This meant that ecdysterone was crucial for the development of the  Manduca Sexta and without it, the caterpillar is incapable of reaching its full size and reaching its pupation stage. 


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is an insect that begins as a big green caterpillar, known as the Tobacco Hornworm, and pupates into a moth after approximately three weeks. But the larval caterpillar is not able to pupate and turn into a moth without the help of hormones. One of the hormones involved in larval development is Ecdysterone, and it regulates the timing of molting. When the larva is physically ready to pupate, there is a spike in Ecdysterone that signals for the body to form a pupa. According to research done on the biochemical nature of ecdysterone in the Manduca Sexta, “The periodic increases in ecdysteroid titer critical to insect development reflect to a large degree the episodic activation of the prothoracic gland by PTTH that has been released from the corpus allatum. PTTH release occurs in particular diet time windows, after the organism integrates a variety of factors such as time since last molt, nutritional status, and physical size” [Gilbert: 2002]. In this experiment, we want to see what happens if the amount of ecdysterone in a larva’s body is reduced or inhibited. In another lab focusing on the impacts of specific hormones and the time of their release, it was discovered that, “ICG also leads to larger body size but a longer development time, because the secretion of PTTH and ecdysone occurs later and at a larger size allowing more time for the larva to accumulate mass. Increasing the critical weight increases both body size and development time, because the cascade of events leading to pupation starts later and at a larger size” [Davidowitz: 2005]. Since ecdysterone controls the time of pupation, we think inhibiting ecdysterone will prevent the larvae from pupating and keep their masses smaller. If the amount of the hormone ecdysterone in a Manduca Sexta is inhibited, it’s mass will be smaller than a Manduca Sexta with normal ecdysterone levels.


Materials and Methods:
In this lab we used 8 Manduca Sexta larva: 4 in the control group, and 4 in the experiment group. Since our focus was to see the differences in weight between the two groups, we weighed and monitored them in individual containers every day for 13 days. We had several control factors that included a 24 hour light cycle, placing them in incubators at 20 degrees Cecius, and 10 grams of food each. The experimental group had 5 drops of ecdysteroid inhibitor, or aza guard, in their food, while the control group had 5 drops of water in their food. 


Results:
After 13 days of observation we calculated the average mass of each caterpillar over the 13 days and then averaged that number out in order to compare the differences between the control and experimental groups. The results showed a clear difference between the two groups, with the experimental group having a much smaller average mass than the control group. In fact, the control group was able to develop much more effectively that our 2nd control caterpillar pupated on the 6th day. The one-tailed p-value was less than 0.05, meaning it was insignificant. 


Discussion:
This experiment showed how important hormones are in the development of Manduca Sexta larva and their transition from caterpillar to moth. When ecdysterone was inhibited from the larvae via their diet, their masses were much smaller on average and they did not reach the stage in development where they could pupate. Ecdysterone is very important in the development of insect growth, as seen in the lab researching the effects of ecdysterone amounts on regenerating legs on coackroaches. It says, “All the 14 regenerates treated with ecdysterone developed a recognizable cuticle within 14 days, and 8 developed setae. Doses as low as 2.5 p,g per milliliter of medium were 100 percent effective. None of the 14 control regenerates produced cuticle or setae,”[Marks: 1970]. Without ecdysterone, insects struggle to grow in weight, as seen in the Manduca Sexta, or regenerate body parts, as seen with the cockroaches. Another research project found out the importance of the Larva stages, specifically the 5th and 6th larva stages, when there caterpillar should begin pupating. Their lab showed that “Individuals with six instars consistently exhibited slower growth rates during early larval development than individuals with five instars” [Kingsolver: 2007]. So the larvae that reached the 6th instar are like our caterpillars who had their edysterone inhibited, because they had slower growth rates and could not reach pupation. When any hormone in an organism is altered there will be obvious effects, because they play important roles in the body communicating when to make changes.
