Title: Increase of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca Sexta to manipulate developmental cycle

Abstract:
Non-toxic pest controll is becoming increasingly more desirable for businesses such as agriculture and for the general population. Pesticides pose harmful threats to the environment, aquatic life, and humans. Hormones influence insect development and by controllling these hormones was can manipulate the life cycle of pests, such as Manduca Sexta, a type of moth. By focusing on manipulating hormones such as Juvenile Hormones (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), for our purposes JH, we can modify the development of these insects, specifically delaying the commitment pulse or inhibiting it completely so that the larvae never become adult moths. We increased JH levels by adding PreCore, a JH mimic, into the diets of these insects. There were two groups, controll and treatment, with each group containing three caterpillars. They were fed every two days with the treatment group receiving PreCore in their food and the controll group receiving distilled water. Our data was not statistically significent; therefore, our hypothesis was not supported. Further studies could include experimental groups containing more subjects or the addition of more growth hormone, JH, to potentially cause a greater effect in the developmental cycle such as delaying or not allowing the commitment pulse to occur. 

Introduction:
In this experiment the focus in on Manduca Sexta, a type of moth. The Manduca Sexta have a lifecycle of approximately 39-44 days. In this lab, we are looking specifically at two types of hormones that influence the insect’s development. These hormones are essential for physical changes in the insect including molting, which is the transition into an adult. Molting is when the old outer layer of skin is shed and replaced by a new outer layer of cuticle. Insect molting and metamorphosis are governed by the ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone (JH) with ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) orchestrating the molting process and JH determining the nature of the molt [Riddiford: 2003]. We are analyzing JH and 20E. These two hormones working together are vital for life and they work hand-in-hand to controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis in M. Sexta. At different stages in development, the levels of these hormones fluctuate, but it is important to note that both of these hormones are always present, just in different concentrations at any given period during development. One of the most important stages in development is known as the commitment pulse. This is the larval-pupal transformation of Manduca sexta which results specifically from exposure to ecdysteroids in the absence of juvenile hormone, this is the commitment pulse. This is followed by a larger exposure to ecdysteroid and then a reappearance of juvenile hormone [Weeks,Truman: 1986]. The commitment pulse is produced when the insect’s body has determined that it is large enough and has enough nutrients to pupate and transition into an averagely sized moth. In our particular experiment, we are manipulating JH by increasing its level using PreCore. PreCore is an insect growth regulator (IGR) and it mimics JH. We are looking to determine the effects of increased JH in the development of M. Sexta., especially its effects on the commitment pulse. Will the commitment pulse be delayed or occur prematurely due to the manipulation of JH? Will the size of the insect be influenced in any way if a major developmental hormone is manipulated? In order to study the effects of PreCore, we will be adding six drops of PreCore to the diet of the treatment group of the insects. If we add PreCore to the diet of the insect subsequently increase JH levels, then the growth of the insect will be affected by causing the insects to reach the commitment pulse later and pupating into larger sized adults. Our independent variable is the PreCore and the dependent variable is the resulting weight of each insect. The significance of this study has to do with the growing desire to be able to controll the population of pests in a non-toxic manner. These insect growth regulators (IGRs) are beneficial because they are non-toxic insecticides that do not adversely harm the environment. These IGRs can be used for agricultural or everyday purposes. 

Materials and Method:
Caterpillars were divided into two groups of three. One group was the treatment and the other group was the controll. Each caterpillar was weighed in grams using a standard lab balance, and the weight was recorded. In order to separate the caterpillars two containers each containing four cells were used. One caterpillar was placed in each cell, with one cell left to spare in each of the two containers. On day one each caterpillar was fed 10g of food which was placed in the cell with the caterpillar. The food was weighed using a standard lab balance. After the food was placed in the cell, six drops of water were added to the food of the controll group caterpillars using a pipette. Then six drops of Precor, a JH mimic, was added to the food of the treatment group. Weights of the caterpillars were taken every two days a recorded. The food was also changed to a fresh 10g with the addition of water or Precor depending on the group. The statistical method used was a 2-sided t_test, which means that we are comparing data from two different groups, the controll group and the treatment group. 

Results:
The mean for the mass in grams of the controll group of caterpillars was 6.75 and the means for the mass in grams of the treatment group of caterpillars was 6.17. The standard deviation of the mass in grams of the controll group was 3.29 and the standard deviation of the mass in grams of the treatment group was 3.12. In order to present our data summarized instead of raw, we calculated the mean percent change in weight of the controll and treatment groups. The mean percent change for the controll group was 791% (Fig. 1). whereas the mean percent change for the treatment group was 834% (Fig. 1). The standard deviation of the percent change for the controll group was 273% (Fig. 1). and the standard deviation of the percent change for the treatment group was 303% (Fig. 1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. Based on the results of the two-sample t_test it was determined that the mean of the mass of the controll group was not statistically significent different than the mean of the mass of the treatment group (t_stat = 0.474, d.f. = 40, P = 0.6379). When observing the physical characteristics of the caterpillars on the last day that we recorded their weight, the difference in their size based on the judgement of the naked eye was not inherently visible. Both the controll and treatment group appeared to be roughly similar in size. In conclusion, the two groups appeared to show very similar growing patterns despite the addition of growth hormone into the treatment groups food. 

Discussion:
Based on the data collected, we accept the null hypothesis, that there is no statistical difference between the controll group and the treatment group. Our hypothesis stated that, if we add PreCore to the diet of the caterpillar, which is, in turn, increasing the levels of JH, then the caterpillar’s growth will be affecting by delaying the commitment pulse and causing the caterpillar to turn into a larger adult. However, this hypothesis could not be supposed based on the mean weight of the controll group and the treatment group. The commitment to pupal differentiation required ecdysteroids in the absence of JH [Weeks,Truman: 1986], however, in our treatment group JH was not absent due to the addition of PreCore, therefore, this statement cannot be fully true. It is possible that the increased level of JH in the caterpillar’s diet was not a significent enough amount to delay the commitment pulse and cause the caterpillars to mature into larger adults. The p_value was high, which supports the conclusion that the data is not statistically significent, and no conclusive statement can be drawn from the increased JH levels in the caterpillar’s diet. In another experiment that manipulated 20E instead of JH, found that “larvae of different ages were induced to molt prematurely by feeding the ecdysteroid analogue RH5992. Glands became competent to make pupal proteins between 24 and 32 hours after the last larval ecdysis” [Ismail: 2000]. A flaw in this experiment could be the number of caterpillars that we had. The experimental groups were so small in number that even if there was one outlier all the data would be skewed. If we were to retest this exact hypothesis under all the same conditions an improvement would be to make the experimental groups larger so that it would be clearer if there was an effect on the caterpillar’s development when JH levels are increased.
