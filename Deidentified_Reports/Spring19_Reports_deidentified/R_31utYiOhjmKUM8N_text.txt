Title: Effects of Caffeine Injection on Amplitude Voltage and Muscle Contractions of the Rania pipiens Frog Leg

Abstract:
The study of neurotransmission in organisms is a critical topic of physiological biology. Neurotransmission is the root of bodily function, as its basic systematical functions transcend to stimulate other physiological responses such as muscle contraction. The impact of neurotransmission on living organisms allows for a greater understanding of how the body carries out motor functions is impacted by varying levels of stimulants, such as caffeine, specifically in the scenario of the Rania pipiens frog leg. In this experiment we will be investigating the stimulus response, work, summation, and tightness in muscles and manipulating the gastrocenemius muscle by changing voltage amplitude to the sciatic nerve from a frog leg to investigate the elements of the neuromuscular controll. We predicted that when the amplitude and the frequency of the stimulus increases, it will result in more twitches, thus resulting in faster, more frequent muscle contractions in the leg. The resulting data demonstrated a statistically significent effect of the caffeine injection, as the muscle contracted more when the stimulus was applied. Based on our observations and results, it is suggested that there was a joint concordance between caffeine injection and muscular contraction.

Introduction:
In this experiment we will be investigating the stimulus response, work, summation, and tightness in muscles and manipulating the gastrocenemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg to investigate the elements of the neuromuscular controll. The gastrocenemius muscle primarily supplies the muscles of the lower leg in the sciatic nerves supplies sensation to the skin of the foot (Medical Terminology). The neuromuscular controll functions to allow for an organism’s response to the internal and external stimuli of the environment. The neuromuscular system is composed of skeletal muscle composed of cylindrical shaped myofibers found together by connective tissues to form functional groups (Johnson). The skeletal muscles are stimulated by motor neurons that stimulate axons to extend into the muscle to stimulate neuromuscular junctions. With the release of acetylcholine (Ach) is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, eventually opening sodium channels to augment an action potential by releasing calcium this network to system results in a muscular contraction, that summarizing the detailed process of neuromuscular controll. In this investigation we will be observing the result of changing the amplitude of the voltage in the frequency of the stimulus when applying shock to stimulate the frog leg’s nerve. These muscular contractions can be measured by a contraction curve called a myogram (UCSD). We predict that when the amplitude and the frequency of the stimulus increases, it will result in more twitches, thus resulting in faster, more frequent muscle contractions in the leg. The independent variable is the change and amplitude and frequency while the deep and it wearable is the amount of muscle contractions. 

Materials and Method:
Exercise 1:
To begin the experiment, each lab group will receive a frog legs that is to be placed in a dissecting pan. The skin of the leg is to be pulled down using for steps and is moistened with frog Ringer‘s solution. A dissecting probe is then used to gently separate the inner thigh muscles, revealing the sciatic nerve (white). Each groove is then to gently free the nerve from it connected tissue by using dissecting needles and four steps. A LabScribe-stimulating device is then to be adjusted to the paper pulse amplitude, number of pulses, frequency, and pulse width as directed by your lab TA. Next, initiate stimulus amplitude by adjusting the LabScribe to desired voltages and determine the threshold voltage. At this point we can test the muscles response to direct stimulation at different, higher stimulation voltages.

Exercise 2:
For this particular exercise, action potentials will be used to stimulate the muscle from the nerve attached to the muscle. The post amplitude will held to be reset .001V and ample pipe the 7 Ml controll. Exercise one will need to be repeated but while stimulating the Gastrocenemius muscle throughout the sciatic nerve with single stimulus pulses of increasing amplitude. The results of each voltage attempted should be recorded. Then the threshold voltage will need to be determined and this can be accomplished by increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1V increments

Exercise 3:
We will now stimulate the muscle by using the same action potential is used in the previous exercises. In this exercise, the nerve will be stimulated at different levels of stimulus frequency instead of amplitude. The stimulus frequency will need to be set to 2HZ and the number of pulses needs to be set to zero. The pulse amplitude should also be set to the lowest value at which strong contraction still occur, which will be approximately in the range of 0.4V to 1.0V, however, the pulse width should be kept at 5ms. Given the indicated measurements, stimulate the nerve for five seconds then move the data. Continue increasing the stimulus frequency to you 4Hz, 5, 10, 25, 100Hz and record data.

Exercise 4:
Here, we will disconnect the sleeve electrodes from the stimulator output and connect electrodes to the stimulator. Set the following values: display time to 20 seconds, stimulus frequency to for each 4Hz, number of pulses to zero, and pulse amplitude to a value between 0.4V and 1.0V. Stimulate the nerve for five seconds and record data at 4Hz. Now record data at a stimulus frequency of 50 Hz at this level, you should continue stimulation of the nerve until the face of the muscle contraction drops to an amplitude of 25% of the max for force at the beginning of the tetanic contraction. Disconnect the BNC device connector and reconnect it to the pin electrodes. Now apply stimulation to the muscle for three seconds at the same measurements mentioned above. Now disconnect BNC device and reconnect to sleeve electrodes. Perform another three second stimulus to the muscle. Finally, indicate the site of stimulation in the stimulus voltage that generated each response and save data. 

A paired two-T test was used to measure the difference in the amplitude of the contraction from before to after caffeine injection.


Results:
The amplitude of the Rania pipiens frog leg muscle increased after injection of 0.1Ml of caffeine. It was determined that the threshold voltage for the muscle and the sciatic nerve was of a 0.4V value. It was observed that temporal summation began at 4Hz and was increased at 5Hz. Incomplete tetany was marked at 10 Hz but complete tetany was reached at 25Hz and continued through 50Hz. An increased force was noticed at 25Hz. Some fatigue became visible at 50Hz and at 100Hz more fatigue was witnessed. The degrees of freedom of the paired T- test was 2 and the t-value was 0.03975.

Discussion:
Caffeine stimulates calcium release in muscle, thus causing the muscle to contract and reach tetany. The results of the investigation supported our hypothesis because the amplitude increased in concordance with the injection of caffeine. We reject the null hypothesis for all trials at the .05 level that there is a statistically significent in that muscle contractions increased in concordance with the increasing amplitude. In previous investigations, it was found that caffeine causes dose-dependent increases in the force and duration of the contradiction of the skeletal muscle (Kolawole, Archie, Olorunshola). Considering such, our hypothesis accurately depicts the direct effects of caffeine. We should study the physiological effects of caffeine, as it pertains to impacting other realms of study such as psychiatry; muscle contractions increase blood pressure, thus raising one’s heart rate and has the potential to provoke anxiety. To further the investigation, a potential, larger-scale experiment, such as working with the stimulation of a different nerve under different conditions to see if the same results apply.
