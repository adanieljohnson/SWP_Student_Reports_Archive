Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Pupation of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
A study was conducted about the role of increases of juvenile hormone towards inhibiting pupation of the Manduca Sexta. The researchers strategically had a experimental group that received JH in their food and controll group with only water to test how 6 drops of JH alter growth for the caterpillars in early larva stages. Each day, a team member monitored the progress of the 2 groups and recorded the resulting weights to measure how the manduca sexta have changed over the course of the experiment. After 12 days of experimentation, researchers discovered that the juvenile hormone was a key player in halting metamorphosis for adult insects. Once completing a sample t_test, the researchers found their data to also be statistically significent and consistent with their hypothesis. Through the researchers experiment, they have found useful information towards understanding life cycles of Manduca Sexta’s and their lack of pupation based on inhibitory factors such as the juvenile hormone. 


Introduction:

Juvenile hormones play key roles in the development process for Manduca Sexta species. As juvenile hormones are created by the corpora allata glands, they serve to inhibit growth that aids in adult characteristics for insects in which they will remain in the nymph or larva stage [Subramanian, Shankaraganesh:2016]. When it is the last larval stage, the corpora allata gland begins to stop production of the juvenile hormone which normally allows for growth as an adult or pupa. During an experiment in 1974 by Nijhout and Williams from Harvard University, they tested how the cessation of juvenile hormone secretion triggers pupation for manduca sextas. The experiments main objective was discovering the underlying cause for metamorphosis which the researchers believed represented declining levels of juvenile hormone in the insects.  Without the implementation of JH, pupation directly occurs, allowing for metamorphosis. This experiment also tested how the corpora allata activity and juvenile hormone titre contributed to the larva’s ability to maintain the critical weight of 5 grams.  As a result of this experiment, the researchers concluded that when a 5th instar larva reaches a weight of 5 grams, the corpora allata activity and juvenile hormone deactivates. Also, as the larva continues to increase in weight, the juvenile hormone declines and begins to release PTTH instead of pupation [Nujhout,Williams: 1974]. Within the current study, researchers determined how 6 drops of juvenile hormone in their food affects the weight of two groups of manduca sextas in comparison to a controll group that were treated with only water.  Based on understanding of how juvenile hormones disturb metamorphosis, an increase would essentially prolong the immature stages of the insects. The researchers predicted that if manduca sextas are exposed to an excess of juvenile hormone, their life cycles will not progress, causing them to remain in their juvenile stages for weight. 


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, the researchers ensured that each manduca sexta caterpillar lived in uniform environments, experiencing same room temperature and conditions such as being placed in an incubator daily. There were two controll groups which were placed in containers where 6 drops of water were positioned in their food. As for the experimental group, these manduca sexta caterpillars had food with 6 drops of the juvenile hormone. Each of the groups were given 10 grams of food and the necessary treatment such as water drops for the controll group and 6 drops of JH for the experimental group. For each caterpillar,  the initial weight was measured (in grams) and those values were recorded in our Excel spreadsheet. The team members on their scheduled day, measured each caterpillars weight, recorded values and observed any changes between the experimental and controll group. After collecting this information, the team member took the necessary steps such as cleaning the containers , resupplying their food or adding new drops of JH. The experiment continued for 12 days in which the same steps were followed as above. On the final day, the final weight of each caterpillar was measured and then each of the groups and the respective containers were disposed. After the study, the group collaboratively completed a 2 tailed, 2-sample T-Test to determine the statistical significance of the experiment. 



Results:
As a result of the study, the researchers discovered the changes in weight between the controll and and experimental group. While the controll group received only water in their food, the experimental group had 6 drops of JH in which each day, the researchers tested their changes in weight. Over the course of the 12 days of the experiment, each of the caterpillar showed considerable growth.  For the initial values, each of the masses for the caterpillar were below 4 grams, however by the final day, most of the caterpillars weight increased or were not measured based on its own termination. After analyzing the raw data, the group calculated the final mass values - initial mass values and placed the data into Figure 1. From calculating those changes, the group also calculated the average values of each groups overall weight changes, where the controll groups average is 8.895 while the experimental group had an average of 3.193. The difference between those averages indicate that the experimental groups excess of juvenile hormone led to lack of pupation into the adult stage. Based on caterpillars from groups 3 and 4 dying before the end of the experiment, it is another indicator that JH halts metamorphosis process for Manduca Sexta insects. After conducting a sample t_test, our data resulted in (2.660 , 1, 0.037). 


Discussion:
Overall, the researchers hypothesis which was that the increase of JH will directly cause no pupation for the Manduca Sexta insects was supported through the data of the experiment.By producing statistically significent data, the p value of 0.037 indicates that the experiment was only 3% due to chance.  As found by Nijhout and Williams, our researchers found that the lack of JH for the controll group allows for normal pupation while increased levels led to limited growth and maintenence of the caterpillars juvenile stages. From this experiment, we concluded that it requires up to or less than 6 drops of JH for the manduca sexta to remain immature in weight. According to past research studies, this could be equivalent to about 3.3 JH to halt adult metamorphosis [Kiguchi, Riddiford: 1978]. Also as within Nijhout and Williams data, they found that once the larva attains 5 grams in weight, the secretion of JH stops and the CA activity is deactivated which helped us understand reasoning for the lack of mature growth in our caterpillars. For future references, researchers suggest completing the daily observation and laboratory tasks at the same time to avoid confounding variables and potentially skewed data. 
The researchers concluded that their hypothesis was supported in reference to how the 6 drops of JH to each experimental group led to the least amount of overall change of growth compared to the untreated controll group.
