Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone Analog on Manduca sexta Weight

Abstract:
The study of hormonal influences on organisms is a critical topic of physiological biology. The impact of hormones on living organisms allows for a greater understanding of how growth cycles can be impacted by varying levels of such hormones as the juvenile hormone and its analogue, specifically in the scenario of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. In this investigation we observed the effect of the juvenile hormone analogue on the weight of a Manduca sexta caterpillar during its development. We expected that an increase in the juvenile hormone analog will decrease the weight of the caterpillar because the juvenile hormone levels will be too high to mature normally. This investigation was explored through the manipulation of the caterpillar’s food intake with the addition of the juvenile hormone analogue to the experimental group’s food over a period of seven days with a collection of the caterpillar’s weight measured on each day. The resulting data demonstrated no statistically significant effect of the juvenile hormone analogue on the caterpillar’s weight. This lack of significance was jointly demonstrated in our observation of similarities in the caterpillar’s color and length, thus suggesting that there was not a difference in growth and increased weight between the two groups.

Introduction:
The signaling systems in animals interact with both hormones and the nervous system, which also apply to insects. Occurring within the endocrine system, hormones and neuron-based signaling control insects’ growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes (9). The endocrine system is a series of glands that produce and secrete hormones that the body uses for a wide range of functions. These control many different bodily functions, including: respiration, metabolism, reproduction, sensory perception, movement, sexual development, and growth (Medical Terminology: 2013). Hormones are important chemical components in both insects and mammals that stimulate specific cells or tissues (Medical Terminology: 2013). The Manduca sexta undergoes four stages in order to complete its development: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. One particular hormone, the juvenile hormone, that is very important in the regulation of the type of molt during the development of a larva to a pupa and furthermore helps to regulate multiple functions in adult insects (Johnson: 2018). In addition to the juvenile hormone’s importance in the growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillar, is ecdysterone which regulates the timing of the caterpillar’s molting during development, as this hormone works hand in hand with the juvenile hormone to complete the caterpillar’s development into a pupa. (Johnson: 2018). The goal of this experiment is to observe the effect on weight with the addition of juvenile hormone Analog to the diet of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. As previously mentioned, juvenile hormone is a key hormone in the development of growth in the caterpillar whereas the juvenile hormone analog mimics the effect of the juvenile hormone. The purpose of this lab experiment is to test if an increase in the juvenile hormone analog will decrease the weight of the caterpillar because the juvenile hormone levels will be too high to mature normally. The dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillar whereas the independent variable is the juvenile hormone analog.

Materials and Methods:
A total of six Manduca sexta caterpillars were divided into two groups: control group and experimental group. Both groups were separated based on their grouping into four individual plastic containers with small holes in the side for air and stored in an incubator held at a temperature at 25 degrees Celsius. The caterpillars were observed over a period of seven days and were fed once over the experimental time period. The control group was fed 10g of Great Lakes Manduca food with seven drops of water while the experimental group was fed 10g of the same food except with seven drops (7 microliters) of the JH analog. A two sample T-test was used to measure the average difference between each caterpillar’s weight from the control group to the experimental group.

Results:
The mean of the weights of the control group caterpillars was recorded to be 7.38 grams and the mean weight of the experimental group was 5.93 grams. The degrees of freedom of the test was 4 and the t-value was 1.204455. The one tailed p-value was 0.147403 while the two-tailed p-value was 0.294806. Neither p-value was not lower than 0.05 as the one tailed value was not statistically significantly greater than or less than that of the other group and the two tailed value was not statistically significantly different. Because of such results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for both groups. When the caterpillars were observed on the final day, they appeared similar in color and length, though there were some caterpillars of larger sizes, the results were not direct nor strong enough to identify a correlation between the two caterpillar groups and their varied foods. Overall, the control and the experimental caterpillars had a difference of growth.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that an increase in the juvenile hormone analog will decrease the weight of the caterpillar because the juvenile hormone levels will be too high to mature normally, was not supported. It was observed at the .05 level that there was no statistically significant effect of the juvenile hormone analog on the Manduca sexta caterpillar weight. There is room for ambiguity in regard to the potential of a lack of effect of the analogue on the caterpillar’s development, thus supporting why the caterpillar’s weight was not increased by the juvenile hormone analogue. In previously conducted investigations, it was found that the initiation of metamorphosis in the Manduca sexta, where weight would increase, is stimulated by the disappearance of juvenile hormone and other key hormones related to the caterpillar’s growth such as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and ecdysteroids (Browder: 2001).This being said, the addition of an analogue that mimics the juvenile hormone would create an opposite effect by un-affecting the weight of the caterpillars. This is so because as the previous investigation states, the juvenile hormone must disappear in order for metamorphosis to occur, thus resulting in a lack of change in the weight of caterpillars; this contradicts our hypothesis. Considering the failed hypothesis, perhaps if this experiment were to be re-conducted, the juvenile hormone should be manipulated in a similar manner of increased intake but instead of measuring weight, a different variable should be measured, such as length. The comprehension of the role of the juvenile hormone (whether the real hormone or the analogue) in the growth cycle of the caterpillar’s and its effects are significant in our understanding of how hormonal manipulations can result in varying findings.
