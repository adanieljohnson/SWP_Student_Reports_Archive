Title: Raphanus sativus resource allocation not significantly impacted by herbivory

Abstract:
This study focused on the impact of herbivory on resource allocation in Raphanus sativus (radish) plants. It is generally accepted that plants can alter resource allocation patters to increase growth rates of various parts in response to environmental conditions. Resource allocation was measured using root to shoot ratios (R:S) of length and mass. It was hypothesized that with increased herbivory, R:S for both length and mass would decrease. Four pots of radish plants were grown for two weeks. On day six, young parts of the shoots were snipped off plants in the experimental group to mimic herbivory. After two weeks, the mass estimated to have been snipped from the experimental replicates was accounted for before R:S values were calculated for length and mass. Two-sample, one-tailed t-tests were run on the average R:S values for length and mass. All data proved to not be statistically significant, and the experimental group showed a slightly higher root to shoot ratio for both length and mass. It was accepted that herbivory does not impact resource allocation (root to shoot ratio) in Raphanus sativus. It should be noted that the young plants were likely not given enough time to develop and alter resource allocation significantly.

Introduction:
In response to variations in their environment, individual plants can alter general resource allocation strategies to increase growth rates of certain part of the plant body. The extent of this phenotypic plasticity differs between plant species and allows plants to respond to resource limitations in different environment [Johnson: 2018]. The two main structures of a plant body are the roots below ground and the shoots (leaves and stems) above it. Roots are responsible for nutrient/water absorption from soil while shoots are mainly responsible for light-dependent photosynthesis. Plants can compensate for decreasing nutrient bioavailability by increasing the growth rate of a relevant structure over time to ensure survival. The behavior of other species in a plant’s environment can affect nutrient availability or ease of uptake and plants can alter allocation patterns to address this [Johnson: 2018]. A measure of resource allocation is the relative biomass in the roots verses the shoots- communicated as root to shoot ratios (R:S) of mass or length [Johnson: 2018]. As one common biotic factor affecting plants is herbivory by primary consumers, this experiment explored the question how does herbivory impact plant allocation in Raphanus sativus? Raphanus sativus, commonly known as the radish, was used as a sample organism as it grows quickly and is a relatively small plant. As herbivory affects plant shoots, it would be expected that plants with phenotypic plasticity would allocate resources to regrow lost shoot material relatively quickly. Some studies have even found that there is a tendency for overcompensation in some species when subject to herbivory, causing areas of thicker foliage in nature and higher yields for farmers with certain crops exposed to herbivory [McNaughton: 1983]. A recent study specifically found that an increase in herbivory on Melaleuca quinquenervia trees caused a doubling in branch biomass over four years [Pratt: 2005]. With all this information in mind, it was hypothesized that increased herbivory would decrease root to shoot length and mass ratios in Raphanus sativus. 

Materials and Methods:
At the beginning of a two-week period, a small handful of radish seeds were planted in each of two trays each containing two pots of Miracle Grow soil. One tray was designated as the control group and the other was designated as the experimental group. All the plants were left to grow in a greenhouse in natural light for six days while being watered every other day.  On the sixth day, after they had grown several inches out of the soil, each shoot in the experimental group had one side of its most recent branching cut off. For each pot in the experimental group, the total mass of all cuttings was weighed and recorded (for later calculations). The plants were left to grow for another eight days. Then, root and shoot ratios based on mass and length were measured. Six replicates from each group (three from each pot) were removed from the soil and dried. Roots were consistently separated from shoots where the green of the plant stem began. Rulers were used to measure each shoot length from the base of the shoot to the tallest point and to measure root length. Roots and shoots were all separately weighed as well. For the experimental group, the total shoot mass cut from each of the two subgroups/pots on the sixth day was divided by the total number of shoots present in each respective pot to arrive at an estimate of the average mass that had been removed from each of the three replicates sampled from each of the experimental pots. These masses were added to the final shoot masses of the experimental replicates to account for the very recent loss of shoot mass. R:S by mass and length were then calculated and two-sample, one-tailed t-tests were run on the length R:S and mass R:S.

Results:
The control group had an average length R:S of 1.05 ± 0.387 while the experimental group had an average of 1.28 ± 0.243 (Figure 1). Mass R:S values for the control and experimental groups were 0.066 ± 0.027 and 0.078 ± 0.041 respectively (Figure 2). For length R:S, the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 1.24 , df = 10, P = 0.122). For mass R:S the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.639 , df = 10, P = 0.268). Qualitatively, the human eye could not detect any distinct differences in structure sizes or health during any part of the experiment. 

Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis that herbivory would decrease root to shoot ratio in radishes. Not only were all results seen to be statistically insignificant, but the trends show that both mass and length R:S were greater for the plants exposed to herbivory, meaning that there was no apparent change in resource allocation to shoots to increase growth and compensate for herbivory. Given the relatively small differences between the control and experimental mean R:S values and considering the raw data that did not show any extremely long roots in the experimental group, there is little to suggest that herbivory causes allocation to roots rather than shoots. It is known that resource allocation involves altering growth rates over time, and eight days was likely not a sufficient growth interval in which to see any significant allocation pattern alteration [Johnson: 2018]. 

In previous studies on radish allocation, a similar method of mechanical herbivory was completed, and the results showed a significant resource allocation towards shoot regrowth especially for a singular round of herbivory. However, the method involved removing and studying small leaf areas of developed radishes, more authentically mimicking the herbivory radishes face from insects like small beetles [Jackson: 1980]. Snipping off larger pieces of the young radish shoots in this study may have been too much of a shock to the plants to allow for significant allocation towards shoot regrowth to be seen (especially in just eight days). This design could be altered to involve smaller cuttings and/or older plants facing herbivory for a longer period. The very systematic, unnatural mimicry of herbivory was generally a limitation of this experiment. Given the resources, live radish consumers would ideally have been used, especially considering that while there is little known specifically about insect secretions on plants, there have been recent studies to suggest that herbivore saliva (especially mammalian saliva) at moderate levels of herbivory can contain growth factors that mobilize photosynthate and carbohydrate reserves in plants, leading to increased shoot biomass after a season of herbivory [Liu: 2012]. If this study was modified to be completed over a longer period with frequent simulated herbivory and groups subject to natural herbivory by different species, it could elucidate the extent of the role herbivores play in plant allocation. In some of the limited studies done specifically on radish growth under natural herbivory, it was found that when subject to beetle herbivory early in life, radishes did not show significant compensatory growth patterns but turnips (a similar plant) did, and radishes facing herbivory later in the growing season were slightly more capable of compensatory growth [Taylor: 1968].  This again suggests that radish plants, specifically, need to be more developed to show allocation pattern changes and confirms that there is diversity in plant phenotypic plasticity and radishes do not have much plasticity compared to other plants. 

The results of the experiment described in this report suggest that one cannot just expect to see resource allocation in the face of herbivory especially in very young plants. So, professionals like farmers should take care to protect their vulnerable seedlings that could die from herbivory early in development. This study and others suggest that while some species (like the trees previously mentioned) may overcompensate for herbivory, many species including Raphanus sativus may compensate but do not seem to overcompensate. Therefore, it should not be assumed that there is a general benefit in allowing all crops to be subject to herbivory. In general, resource allocation analysis can be used by ecologists to study grazing patterns and deduce if certain areas of vegetation have recently faced more herbivory than others (even without the obvious appearance of shoot damage). However, this study confirms that not all plants at all stages display consistent phenotypic plasticity, so this is not a full-proof method, and a species' specific resource allocation patterns should definitely be investigated before R:S analysis is used in the field.
