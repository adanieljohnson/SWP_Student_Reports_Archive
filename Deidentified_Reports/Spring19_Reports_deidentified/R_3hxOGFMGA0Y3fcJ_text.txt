Title: Effect of growth and development of precor IGR on 4th Instar Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Using the Manduca sexta larvae in this study we tested the effects of the Insect growth regulator (IGR) precor, that mimics the effects of Juvenile Hormone in the insect. We wanted to test the effects and interference it may have on the development of the larvae starting at the 4th instar period if we introduced precor into their diet. We hypothesized that the effect of precor would stunt the growth and development of the larvae by artificially keeping JH levels at a high level, inhibiting the commitment pulse from happening. In the commitment pulse, normally JH drops to a very low level as hormone 20E experiences a small rise. This commits the larvae to begin pupation. We fed each of the larvae in the test group food consisting of 6 drops of water and 4 drops of precor, the control group received food only with water. Then we monitored their behavior, appearance and weight each day over the course of 14 days. Our hypothesis was not supported by the results of our experiment, the P value was well over 0.05 not showing significance in weight gained as a result of the precor. However we did observe the pupation of all three of the control group larvae while none of the test group were able to reach that stage. 

Introduction:
The field of using chemicals other than regular pesticides against insect nuisances has been emerging and refined. These chemicals are not toxic to its target, and therefore are not toxic to the greater environment into which they are deployed. This makes them better alternatives, if proven effective, over conventional pesticides as they would not release toxic chemicals that can have unintended consequences on the environment that they are used in. Instead these type of chemicals interfere with the normal biochemical and physiological aspects of an insects development and growth. These are called IGR’s or insect growth regulators. Many of these interfere with an essential hormone for regulating growth called Juvenile Hormone or JH. The way they interact are classified into two categories: JH mimics and JH antagonists [Baker: 1985]
. Meaning they either interfere with the production and uptake of JH or they mimic the hormone. [Baker:1985]. In our experiment we will be using Manduca sexta larvae to test the effects of a JH mimic called precor. The Manduca sexta has a holometabolous life cycle, the same as all moths, butterflies, honeybees, wasps and others [Johnson:2018]. This makes this specific insect valuable to conduct experiments on due to its biological similarities. 
It is known that the levels of JH decrease to a very low level during the first days of the 5th larval instar period of their life [Vince:1976]. This correlates with a surge in another hormone ecdysone (ecdysterone, 20E). This simultaneous absence of JH levels and 20E surge is thought to be responsible for the forming of the pupal cuticle. (Baker:1985) Known as the commitment pulse these mix of signals indicate that the larvae is ready to pupate [Johson:2018]. So in our experiment we will use precor, the JH mimic over a 2 week period on larvae in the 4th instar and observe its results on the development and life cycle of the larvae. During this time we will control for things like sunlight, moisture of environment and food, food texture, and temperature. It is our hypothesis if we introduce 4 drops of precor along with 6 drops of water into our experiment groups food, it will stunt their growth and development compared to the control group. Our experiment will be measured by the weight of the larvae over the 2 week period and before they pupate. 


Materials and Methods:
6 of the Manduca sexta larvae were used in this experiment. We chose 3 of them to be in the control group, placed in one plastic bin where they each had their own section. Then the other 3 were the test group in the same storage method. The 3 of the test group would receive 4 drops of precor in their food along with 6 additional drops of water. While the control group received the same food but with 10 drops of water in order to keep the texture and the moisture of the two groups food the same. They were all stored in a constant temperature and moisture in the same housing during this time, and also received food and drops of water or precor at the same time as well. We first took their initial weights and then every day for the 2 week period would weigh and record that data once a day. Their food was replaced as needed but always in the same moisture and texture conditions as specified. We also observed the changes in their behavior or appearance during this time. At the end of the 2 week period we took their final weights and recordings and disposed of them. For the statistical test we applied a two sample T test, and compare the weights gained for each of the groups on average. Along with calculating the P value and standard deviations of the weights gained. However all of the test subjects died, so we decided to take in their highest recorded weights of each group before they pupated, in the control group, or expired, as in the test group. 

Results:

In table #1 it can be seen that the highest weight of the control group occurred well before that of the control group. In a general trend the control group seemed to gain weight very quickly and then plateau and decrease. The test group on a trend slowly gained weight throughout the entirety of the experiment. While also taking measurements of their weights we also recorded observations such as color and any activity we could discern. In the control group they quickly started to turn more brown from their initial bright blue and green colorings while in the test group they stayed the original color throughout the experiment. Activity could also be observed in the control group through the form of their waste and some food particles being flattened out in their small sections. It is also worth noting that members of the test group seemed to have died by the end of the experiment. 


Discussion:
I believe that our hypothesis was not supported by the data an observations that were collected in our experiment. I hypothesized that giving the precor to the Manduca sexta larvae that were in the 4th instar stage would stunt their growth and development as measured by weight compared to a normal group of larvae. However in our results we showed that instead of stunting the growth it caused the larvae to gain even more weight then the control group that received no precor in their diet. As seen in Figure 1 the net weight gain for the test group was 7.63 g with a standard deviation of 0.986 and the control group was 4.90 g 0.408, however our P value shows this was statistically insignificant. So this was not enough to show significance in weight alone. Conversely though the treatment of precor did so something to stunting their development as the test group did never pupate despite 100% of the control group larvae doing so. In addition to this at least 1 of the test group died, while the other 2 seemed very lethargic. The control group exhibited the behavior of wandering that commonly occurs after the commitment pulse while this was not observed in the test group.  One explanation for this seemingly odd result could be that the Precor- mimicking the JH hormone in the larvae could have prevented the commitment pulse from happening. The required conditions for the commitment pulse that lead to pupation are thought to be the new low level of JH along with an increase in 20E hormone [Baker:1985] [Johnson:2018]. By keeping the artificial levels of JH high in the larvae, this could have prevented this altogether. In a different study [Vince:1976], they observed the levels of JHE an enzyme that they tested to have an active role in the dissipation and breakdown of JH in the larvae during the end of the 4th instar peiod and at the beginning of the 5th instar. They found that levels of JHE peaked at this time, when the larvae would begin pupating. This suggests that it is essential in the course of the normal biochemical processes of the larvae that the high JHE and low levels of JH seems to be essential in the process of maturation and pupation of the larvae. They found the low levels of JH and surge of 20E to be presumably responsible for reprogramming cells so that the “pupal cuticle”, or the epidermis layer starts to be synthesized. [Vince:1976] So we can presume that without those specified levels of low JH, in our case constantly high levels of JH, that this process never happens. Which could explain why our test group continued to grow and grow and never pupate or start to show signs of it. So that is why our data and observations we recorded could have not supported our hypothesis of stunting growth. The larvae kept on growing because they never received the commitment pulse that signals to them that they are sufficiently large, and nutrient rich enough to undergo pupation. The next logical step for this study would be to possibly monitor the time to pupation and life span of the larvae if under the same doses of precor over a longer period of time, to see if the test group would ever begin to pupate maybe much later. Also a larger sample size would help in later experiments as just 3 did not show significance of the precor making the test larvae that much bigger then the control. These results are interesting in general in the sense that if the practical application of an IGR is to kill or interfere with the insects so that they are no longer pests, precor does seem like a viable option. If the larvae do not reach pupation as they did not in our test group, then they could not be pests as adults, or they could not reproduce and create more pests.

Table #1 Average weight of the Manduca sexta by time. This graph represents the average weight of each group at each interval that we took measurements over the 2 week period. 

Figure 1: This is the average weight gained at its highest before pupation. 
	The control group larvae gained less net weight at their highest before pupation. While the test group receiving precor gained a larger amount. Results were not uniform however. The P value for this data is 0.98 and St dev control ( 0.408) and test ( 0.986). It is worth mentioning that the highest gained weight for the control group was significantly earlier in the time period then the test group.
