Title: IGR Hormone negatively affects the pupation of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, has a life cycle of about one to two months, making it a useful organism to study. In this experiment, the organism was used to study the effect of certain hormone changes on the organism's life cycle. The hormone used was IGR which was a synthetic hormone inhibiting the effect of Juvenile hormone. Juvenile hormone affects the start of pupation of the caterpillars. The hormone was added to the treatment group's food. The organisms were carefully observed and monitored for a two-week period. Both the treatment group and the controll group significently grew in size with a mean increase of 11.143 grams for the treatment group and 9.72 grams for the controll group, but only the controll group showed beginning signs of pupation by the end of the two weeks. The controll group showed signs of pupation with the lack of intaking food and brown coloration at the end of the experiment. A two-sample t_test was done and the p_value was found not to be significent (p=0.366), so the null hypothesis was not rejected. Although we observed a difference in the treatment group’s growth, that the data did not support our hypothesis which stated added IGR hormone would prevent the pupation of the Manduca sexta. 

Introduction:
This experiment tests how hormones affect insect maturation and growth. The subject used in the experiment was the Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm. It has a 29 to 48-day life cycle to reach full adulthood making it a good organism to study life cycle changes (Byron, 2017). The caterpillars experience a holometabolous life cycle which is when its structure undergoes a complete reorganization to mature into an adult (Johnson, 2018). The two hormones responsible for their development are Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone (Johnson, 2018) . In this experiment, we affected the Juvenile Hormone by adding synthetic IGR to the pre-pupated caterpillars' food. IGR stands for insect growth regulators and imitates the Juvenile Hormone. Juvenile Hormones in pre-pupated Manduca sexta drop very low prior to the initiation of pupation. We tested the hypothesis that if IGR is added to the pre-pupated caterpillars' food, they would stay in their pre-pupation caterpillar stage longer than normal. We would expect this because it would prevent the caterpillars from entering the 5th larval instar which is where Juvenile Hormone decreases significently to allow for pupation. By adding synthetic Juvenile Hormone in the form of IGH, the caterpillars will not recognize when to enter pupation. This experiment provides evidence on how hormones affect the pupation stage of the Manduca Sexta. This could lead to advances in pest controll and provide useful information on how lack of pupated Manduca sexta affects the environment.

Materials and Method:
To conduct this experience, we used 2 cell containers with lids divided into four squares for the Manduca sexta controll group which contained 3 caterpillars and the treatment group which also contained 3 caterpillars. Each container was labeled specifically as treatment group or controll group and a number was assigned to each of the caterpillars. A hole was poked into each of the containers to provide adequate oxygen to the caterpillars. 6 Manduca sexta around the same body size and weight were collected and placed into the labeled containers. Next, the food was prepared using a spoon and square container to mix it in. A balance was also needed to weigh the specific amount of food given to each caterpillar. Transfer pipets were used to measure the correct amount of water and reagent (IGR) added to the food. 10 grams of caterpillar food was measured out and placed into each of the controll group's living squares. Water was added as needed to dilute the food and make it easier to consume for the caterpillars. Then, 10 grams of food was measured out for the 3 treatment caterpillars, and 5-7 drops of IGR was added to their food using a new transfer pipet. Once the food was prepared and dispersed, the caterpillars would be checked and weighed daily throughout the week. Each day, the caterpillars would be weighed, as well as record any observational changes seen, and add food if necessary. The treatment group and controll group's average weight difference were compared at the end of the two-week experiment using a bar graph and a 2-sample t test. 

Results:
During the two-week duration of the experiment, the controll and treatment groups of Manduca sexta significently increased in size. One in each group began turning a brown color most likely indicating the beginning of pupation. To compare increase of body weight of the two treatment groups, we added all the controll groups' weights and calculated the mean and standard deviation. The values calculated to be 9.72 for the mean and 6.51 for the standard deviation (Figure 1). The same was done for the treatment group. The mean calculated to be 11.1433 and the standard deviation was 1.6688 (Figure 1). This calculated data of the treatment and controll group was used to perform a two-sample t_test. The one-tailed p_value calculated was 0.366165.

Discussion:
This experiment was designed to study the effects of hormones when added to the Manduca sexta's food source, specifically the synthetic IGR hormone. We hypothesized that the added IGR hormone would cause the treatment group to mature faster but prevent them from entering the pupation stage. During the duration of the experiment, the treatment group caterpillars did grow faster and did not enter the pupation stage, however the change was not statistically significent enough to support our hypothesis. The p_value of 0.366165 was not significent, because it was not less than the alpha level of 0.05 and led to failing to reject null hypothesis. The IGR hormone sped up growth in the treatment group by inhibiting the level of juvenile hormone and keeping it low but allowed the caterpillars to continue to gain weight. A study published by the Journal of Economic Entomology also studied the effects of added synthetic hormone to diamondback moths and found similar findings. They found that adding high concentration of the synthetic hormone named OTFP, "delayed molting and pupation, increased pupal weight, and decreased JHE activity..."[Duan:2016] The controll group nor the treatment group really began pupating, so I believe if the duration of the experiment was longer, we would've seen more significent data. If the experiment were to be redone, it should be done longer at least as long as the average life cycle for the Manduca sexta. The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, affects many crops once it matures into its adult form. Studying how hormones can be altered before pupation could help with needed pest controll for certain crops.
