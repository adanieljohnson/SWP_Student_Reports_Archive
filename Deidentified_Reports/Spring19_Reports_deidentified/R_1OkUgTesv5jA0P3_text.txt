Title: Growth in Manduca Sexta when exposed to increased levels of JH

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to study the effects of juvenile hormone on the growth of the Manduca Sexta. We hypothesized that if juvenile hormone, which is already produced within the caterpillar, was added to the food that the caterpillar, it would continue to grow past its pupation stage and eventually reach a size that its body could no longer support. We tested this hypothesis by splitting eight caterpillars into two groups of four. One group was fed normal food while the other was fed normal food with and 2% of juvenile hormone mixed in. We recorded the weight and refed that caterpillars every day. After about a week and a half of testing we came to the conclusion that our hypothesis was correct because the treated group continued to grow when the controll group reached its pupation stage. 


Introduction:
Insects need both JH and 20E to survive and develop. 20E is a hormone that is produced by the prothoracic glands and works together with JH which is produced with the corpus alata to controll the growth cycle of Manduca Sexta (Tobacco Hornworm). “The role of juvenile hormone (JH) in regulating the timing and nature of insect molts is well-established. Increasing evidence suggests that JH is also involved in regulating final insect size.” (Mirth, 2014). If the concentration of 20E and JH are altered, the process of growth, molting, and metamorphosis are impacted in a way that does not allow the tobacco hornworm to pupate. We hypothesis that if we add %2 of JH hormone to 10 grams of food specially made to meet the nutritional needs of the tobacco hornworm, it will continue to grow but never reach a pupation stage. 


Materials and Method:
For this experiment we took eight caterpillars and split them evenly into two groups. one was our controll group which was fed ten grams of the pre made tobacco horn worm food that had no added hormones. The other groups was also fed ten grams of the tobacco hornworm food but they had an added 2 %of JH hormone. This is equivalent to about 12 drops of the hormone solution in a 40 gram sample of the food. The JH hormone acts as a non-lethal pesticide. It will allow the caterpillar to grow but never pupate. Eventually they will grow to a size that there organs will no longer be able to support. Over the course of about a week we will continue to feed the caterpillars, check their weight, and clean out there boxes everyday to see if the food with 2% JH has any significent effect on the growth of the Tobacco Hornworm. It is important that each hornworm is given the same amount of food so that conditions and doses are identical between all eight worms. There boxes consist of a medium sized square box that is split into four sections. Each section of the box has 2 holes punched into the sides to allow fresh air to cycle in and out of the box. The boxes are placed inside an incubation fridge to maintain a constant ideal growth environment. 


Results:
These results show that the treated group of the tobacco hornworms grew larger than the controll group. The first figure shows the average growth of the caterpillars over the course of eleven days. The second figure shows the average weight gain of the caterpillars. The second figure shows that the treated group gained on average almost a third more than the controll group. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was that adding a JH hormone solution to the food of the Tobacco Hornworm would cause the caterpillar to continue to grow past its pupation stage and that it would grow quicker and larger than our controll caterpillars. Given the data we gathered, we fail to reject our hypothesis. The first graph shows a comparison between the daily average growth of the caterpillars. Although the treated caterpillars grew at a slightly higher rate, they continued to grow when our controll caterpillars started to decrease in weight. The decrease in weight that occured in our controll group was most likely the result of the caterpillars beginning to transition into the pupation stage of their life cycle. The sudden drop in the weight of our treated group was most likely the result of an error by one of the lab members or a faulty scale. It is possible that one of our group members was not able to feed the caterpillars when they went to go check on them or that the scale that was used was not correctly calibrated. The second graph shows the average overall change in weight experienced by the caterpillars. The data shows that overall the treated caterpillars on average experienced a greater change in weight than the controll group of caterpillars. In future experiments we could test how an increase of the hormone 20E would affect a tobacco hornworms in a similar environment. It would also be possible to test how a spike in JH would affect other kinds of insects.
