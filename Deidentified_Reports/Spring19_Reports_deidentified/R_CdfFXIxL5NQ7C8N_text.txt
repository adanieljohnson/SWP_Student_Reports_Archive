Title: Turbid Water Decreases the Intensity of Aggressive Behaviors in Betta splendins

Abstract:
When competing for resources, mates, or territory, many organisms often display aggressive behavior. In this experiment, we will be observing the intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendins by specifically looking at a common initial aggressive action: gill flaring. Based on previous studies, environmental conditions are seen to affect the level of aggressive behaviors of these fish. To test this, we compared the gill flaring of two male Betta fish, each placed in two different water conditions: clear and turbid. We quantified the level of aggression by timing the amount of time the fish flares its gills and dividing it by the total time the fish spent in the tank. We hypothesized that the Betta fish will show more aggressive behavior in the clear water where the two males can better see each other. The results supported this hypothesis as the paired t_test showed statistical significance between the two conditions. This experiment can help many ethologists better understand the effects of climate change on intraspecific behavior and give them information on how to help preserve the world’s biodiversity. 


Introduction:
Animal behavior includes all the ways animals interact with other members of their species, with organisms of other species, and with their environment. This experiment focuses on the intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish. The Betta splendins are an ideal organism to study as they are extremely aggressive when competing for territory, mates, or resources. Betta fish are naturally found in ditches, streams, and rice paddies in Southeast Asia [Johnson: 1973]. At rest, they are inconspicuous, dull grayish brown or green fish. However, in the presence of another male, Betta fish exhibit certain aggressive behaviors that can be easily observed. Typically, access to critical resources is achieved through aggression. That being said, threatening or agnostic behaviors can cause the nearby fish to respond in several different ways including fleeing or even escalating by showing a more intense agnostic behavior. A specific behavior that many betta fish exhibit when threatened is gill flaring when the fish spreads its gill covers [Johnson: 1973]. In an experiment conducted by Forsaktar, gill flaring, an energetically costly action, was seen to be the dominant initial behavior towards both male and female intruders during the Betta fish’s reproductive phases. The results of the study suggested that gill flaring is an intense reaction in order to immediately defend their territory [Forsaktar: 2017]. Due to the variety of individualistic aggressive behavior in Betta fish, the intensity of aggression displayed by an individual is a culmination of its internal state and the state of the surrounding environment [Forsaktar: 2017]. 
Environmental conditions play a large role on the type and intensity of behaviors displayed by many organisms, including Betta splendins. It is important to have an understanding of how the behavior of organisms may change in response to an environmental stimuli. With this knowledge, ethologists can better predict the consequences that may arise from a change in the environment. In a separate experiment, Betta fish behavior was observed and compared in different water conditions. Water disturbances, caused by an electrical shock were seen to have an aversive effect on the Betta fish as many were seen to hide from the fast flowing water and display less aggressive behaviors [Parrado: 2019]. Our experiment similarly compares betta fish behavior in different water conditions by observing the aggressive interactions between male Betta fish in two different environments: clear and turbid waters. It is hypothesized that the Betta fish will show more aggressive behavior in the clear water where the two males can better see each other.


Materials and Method:
Six male Betta fish were obtained and placed in separate tanks divided by an opaque wall. To account for habituation and possible energy loss from aggressive behaviors, the order of which environment (clear or turbid) each pair of betta fish was first placed in was randomized by a coin flip. The first pair of Betta fish were placed in the same clear water tank and observed for 5 minutes. Two observers watched the first fish while the other two observers watched the second fish. The trial was immediately stopped if the fish made contact with each other to avoid injury of the fish. Using a separate timer for each individual fish in the tank, the amount of time that gill flaring was observed was recorded for each fish. The fish were then separated back to their respective tanks and given 5 minutes to rest. Next, the same pair of Betta fish were placed in the “turbid” tank simulated by adding 8 drops of green food coloring into the water. The fish were again observed for 5 minutes and the total time of gill flaring was recorded for each fish. The same procedure was then conducted for the other two pairs of Betta fish, randomizing which environment the fish were put in first via coin flip. To quantify the aggressive behaviors, the ratio between the observed gill flaring and total time spent in the tank was calculated for each fish in each environmental condition to normalize the data. After the results were gathered, a paired t_test with a critical value of 0.05 was used to calculate the statistical significance of the average gill flaring ratio observed in the two different environments.


Results:
Figure 1 illustrates that the average time of gill flare: total time in tank was greater in the clear water conditions than in the murky water conditions. The average time of gill flaring: total time in tank in the clear water was found to be 0.403 with a standard deviation of 0.168. Further, the mean time of gill flaring: total time in tank in the turbid water conditions was found to be 0.225 with a standard deviation of 0.194. The results were found to be statistically significent after running a two-paired t_test (t-value=3.51, d.f.=5, p_value=0.017).


Discussion:
Overall, the results did support our hypothesis that the Beta fish in the clear water conditions would exhibit more aggressive behaviors quantified by the amount of time flaring its gills: the total time in the tank. These results can be explained by referring back to the natural habitat of Betta fish: rice paddies, ditches and streams. These are all environments with mild-turbidity. Turbid water conditions lower the total visibility that the Betta fish have, thus lowering the likelihood that they are able to recognize another Betta fish in their area. Betta fish often match the aggressive behaviors of the other Betta fish if they feel threatened. In the turbid water, a delayed response of gill flaring was observed as it took the fish time to initially see each other. Without the immediate initiation of gill flaring, Betta fish do not feel as threatened and do not need to engage in constant aggressive behavior. This allows the fish to better conserve their energy and instead focus it on finding resources or reproduction.
	Additional research that should be pursued following this experiment could focus more on trying to controll the differences in age, color, and size of Betta fish placed in these two environmental conditions. By keeping the fish characteristic relatively constant, one can be more certain that the water conditions are the main contributor to the difference in aggressive behaviors observed. This experiment can also be applied to the aggressive behaviors displayed by other species of fish. A similar study conducted by Hadley observed the aggressive interactions of Longear Sunfish in varying levels of turbid water. The results led to the same conclusion of this experiment that the more turbid the water conditions were, the less aggressive behavior was seen [Hadley: 1969]. Overall, the lower turbidity of water allows more recognition of perceived threats and thus more displays of aggressive interactions. This experiment helps many ethologists obtain a better grasp on the effects of climate change on intraspecific behavior. By having a better understanding of how species interact in different environments, steps can be taken to prevent large-scale damage on populations in changing environments. This could help our goal to preserve biodiversity and minimize extinction.
