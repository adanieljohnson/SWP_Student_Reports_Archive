Title: Affect of Nitrogen on the Root to Shoot ratio in Filed Peas 

Abstract:
The main objectives of this lab were to measure the effects that the presence of nitrogen in soil had on the growth of field peas (Pisum sativun). Since in the epiretinal group, there is an abundance of nitrogen, we hypothesize that the roots will be shorter. The roots will not need to grow as far to obtain the nutrients needed in order to flourish. After running our experiment, the data showed that the average root to shoot ratio for the controll was larger than that of the experimental​, supporting the claim that the nitrogen filled soil reduced the need for the plant roots to grow as large as the controll. 

Introduction:
The field pea (Pisum sativun) is native to the Southern Regions of the United States. These plants are tough, growing in hot soil with little nutrients, and thriving in doing so [Horton: 2014]. In regards to the nutrients that are needed to help the plant grow, nitrogen is one of the most vital in a plants life, as well as making up 78% of the Earth's atmosphere [Tajer: 2016]. How would a lack of or abundance of this nutrient help or hinder the plant's growth? We know that the roots of the plant are designed to grow and "find" nutrients in order to help the plant grow. But would an excess amount of one nutrient eliminate the need to grow as much? Also, how would the excess fo nitrogen affect the growth of the shoot, the section of the plant that you see sticking out of the ground? The dependent variable for this experiment will be the root to shoot ratio, and the independent variable will be the amount of nitrogen added to the soil. The field peas are so well designed for this experiment due to their ability to grow in extreme conditions. Will these easier environments warrant better growth?  

Materials and Method:
To start this experiment, we obtained two groups of filed pea seeds that were then planted into two separate containers. One of these containers contained only regular soil with some miracle grow mixed in, while the other contained that same with the addition of nitrogen excess. These seeds were planed and then left to grow for one week, with regular watering occurring throughout the week. The plants were then obtained and measured with a ruler (cm) in order to obtain the root to shot ratio for these particular plants. The plants were measured with the seed included in the shoot portion of the measurement in order to maintain consistent​ with our measurements We selected 10 plants at random to measure when it came time to obtain the length of both the roots and shoots. There were only two groups, both with the "extreme" conditions of growth. The controll is normal plant soil, and the other is super soil, with an excess of nitrogen to hopefully enable more growth for the field peas. To be more tedious and get more accurate results in future experiments, we could have had multiple experimental groups, each with an increasing amount of nitrogen in the soil. This would lead to more accurate measurements and more accurate results as to the effect of nitrogen on field pea growth. 

Results:
After concluding the experiment, we retrieved the data and saw that the average root to shoot ratio for the controll group (.8145) was greater than that of the experimental (.5905). The same trend was true over all the raw data, with no controll group plant having a root to shoot ratio less than that of the equal experimental. We also received a two-tailed p_value of .007334 which is less than.05. The test that was ran was the two-tailed t_test with 18 degrees of freedom. 

Discussion:
Our data supported the hypothesis that was stated earlier, the nitrogen-rich soil led to a reduced root to shoot ratio. This is the case for a variety of reasons, but the most obvious and only correlation we can make from this particular experiment is that the increase of abundance of nitrogen led to the root not needing to travel far in order to obtain the nutrients in order for the plant to go. Again, a better form of this experiment could be done with varying amounts of nitrogen in multiple experimental groups. The next step in this study would be to possibly go to another extreme of the soil nitrogen level and plant the field peas in a soil mixture that has little to no nitrogen. I would be willing to guess that the roots, in this case, would be extremely large if they were able to grow at all, but the shoots would not grow very much at all. Field peas are known to be great at growing in hot, non-nutrient rich environments, but taking it to a level of this extremem might show how much nitrongen is needed to have the plant grow at all.
