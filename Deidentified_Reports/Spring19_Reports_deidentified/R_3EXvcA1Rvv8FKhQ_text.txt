Title: Effect of colored screens on the duration of Betta splendens aggressive displays

Abstract:
In the intraspecific interactions between male Betta splendens, the fish have both broadside and facing displays of aggression, the most aggressive being the spreading of the branchiostegal membrane also known as a red mane. We hypothesized that the fish would respond aggressively to a red plastic covering as it is the same color as the betta’s red mane display. We observed the duration of the bettas’ red mane displays while exposed to blue, clear and red plastic covers. After running three ANOVA tests we found that there was only a significant difference in the red mane duration of the bettas while they were in the red covered tanks. This was likely due to the fact that whichever fish was in the middle compartment did not react to whichever fish was in the right compartment while the red screen was up. This could be the result of low visibility or habituation in the betta fish.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior, it aims to explain the physiological purpose for behaviors and how the have shaped evolution. Betta splendens (Siamese fighting fish) are common aquarium fish. In the presence of their own species the Bettas have broadside and facing movements used to signal aggression. The broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. The facing movements include extending pectoral fins, spreading of the opercula and protruding the branchiostegal membranes, also known as red mane [Johnson: 2018]. While displaying at one another, male betta fish tend to follow each other’s movements. When one turns to display a facing movement, the other tends to turn to display a broadside movement. [Simpson: 1968]. The purpose of this experiment is observe the behavioral response of Betta splendens to various colored screens wrapped around their tanks in order to determine if the fish react aggressively to color. We hypothesized that the betta fish will respond the aggressively to the red screen due to the fact that the bettas display the “red mane” as an aggressive response to other betta fish.


Materials and Methods:
Each group of fish was divided into three compartments with one fish in each. The fish were labeled based on their color, teal, red + yellow, and red + blue. The compartments will be separated by an opaque plate and a clear glass plate. A baseline observation of each betta was made by observing their movements while in isolation. After the observations were made, we wrapped the entire tank in a clear plastic as our control group. One of the opaque plates was removed and the interaction between the teal and the red + yellow was observed for five minutes. We recorded the amount of time before the initial reaction, and the number of times the bettas red maned during the five minutes. After a five minute rest period, the same process was repeated for red + yellow vs. red + blue, and the teal vs. red + blue. After the observations were recorded, the same tests were done with red plastic wrap and blue plastic wrap covering the tank. An ANOVA test was used to test the statistical significance of the data.


Results:
We ran three separate ANOVA tests, one for each of the different colored plastic wraps. For the blue plastic wrap ANOVA, there was no significant difference between the three betta fishes’ red mane durations. For the clear wrap, there was also no difference between the red mane durations of the three fish. In the red plastic wrap test, the ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference (P= 0.000606) in the average red mane duration between the three betta fish. Further testing showed that there was a greater significant difference between the red mane duration of the red + purple vs. red + yellow fish, and between the red mane durations of the red + yellow vs. teal fish.  


Discussion:
The significant difference between the betta fishes’ red mane durations in the red tank was likely due to the fact that in each trial, whatever fish was in the middle compartment did not react to the betta fish in the compartment next to it. This could be because the betta fish in the middle could not see the fish in the compartment next to it due to the low visibility caused by the red plastic wrap. The betta in the compartment next to the right one still reacted as it was able to see the middle betta because it was in front the white opaque barrier used to separate the middle and left compartments. The other possibility is that the betta fish in the middle compartment habituated to the other betta fish and no longer needed to perform a broadside or facing display. When exposed to its own reflection or another betta fish for a long enough period of time, bettas tend to show signs of habituation of aggressive display. This was demonstrated in the experiments performed by Baenninger, and by Harman and Shirley Peeke [Peeke: 1969].
