Title: Caffeine has an Effect on Neuromuscular Function in Animals

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system of animals is action of neurons and muscles working together to elicit action potentials in response to stimuli. These action potentials lead to muscle contractions that allow for movement or resistance. Calcium ions are integral in the contractions of muscles. In order to further observe the effect Ca2+ has on muscle contraction, researchers isolated the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens and, using the same legs as a control and treatment group, tested the amplitude of contraction before and after injecting the muscles with caffeine using a myogram. Because caffeine is a stimulant, the anticipated data was that the caffeine would cause contractions to occur at a higher amplitude. Through the use of a paired t-test, it was discovered that there was a statistically significant difference in the amplitude of contraction between the two groups in addition to the caffeine inhibiting the Ca2+ ions to unbind, causing the contraction phase to be prolonged even after the removal of the stimulus. 

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effect of caffeine on the neuromuscular system when exposed to different stimuli. The neuromuscular system consists of the interworking of neurons and muscles to respond to stimuli with muscular contractions. Skeletal muscles consist of many myofibers which are multinuclear cylindrical cells. They are innervated and activated by motor neurons. When nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal. This process results in the release of Ca2+ from its storage site in the sarcoplasmic reticulum which initiates the contraction of muscle fibers, causing them to shorten [Lab Manual: 2018]. In this experiment, researchers manipulated the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens by introducing it to caffeine and observing the effects throughout different stages of muscle contraction. In a similar experiment, Weber and Herz investigated the influence of caffeine on a muscle in a Rana pipiens and found that, with various mM concentrations of caffeine, there was an immediate release of Ca2+ and a more intense muscle contraction [Tallis: 2015]. The Rana pipiens is a good subject because their neuromuscular system is close in nature to that of humans. Additionally, their small size provides for easily visible twitches. The intensity of these twitches was measured using a myogram. Myograms exhibit the three stages of muscle contractions: latent phase, contractile phase, and relaxation phase. The latent phase occurs between the time of introduction to the stimulus and the time the muscle begins to contract; the contractile phase is the period of time it takes the muscle to reach maximum contraction; and the relaxation phase is the time it takes for the muscle to decline from its peak contraction and return to rest. Because caffeine is a stimulant, the muscle contraction’s intensity will be greater when caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemius of a Rana pipiens. 

Materials and Methods:
Three fresh frog legs were obtained in order to test the effects of caffeine on the muscle contractions of the isolated Rana pipiens gastrocnemius. In order to prepare the specimens for a myogram reading, the skin was removed from the leg, the inner thigh muscles were separated to expose the sciatic nerve, and the gastrocnemius was freed from the bone by severing the Achilles tendon. A string was then attached at the tip of the muscle where there was a small piece of residual tendon in order to suspend it from the force monitor on the myogram device. Each of the legs were used as an experimental and control group. Before testing the muscles, their thresholds were determined. The threshold of a muscle is the lowest stimulus voltage needed to elicit a visible twitch. For the control group, each of the frog legs were tested for latent phase, contractile phase, and relaxation phase, as well as the amplitudes of their contractions according to the myogram. The myogram was attached to the muscle by inserting electrodes. For the experimental group, the same legs were injected with 0.1 mL of 200mM caffeine solution and the same phases of the muscle twitches were observed at 1 volt. Average latent, contractile, and relaxation phases, as well as the amplitudes of contractions for both the control and treatment groups were recorded to oberve the difference, if any, in intensity of amplitude. These data were compared using a paired T-test to determine if the data is significantly different. 

Results:
The average amplitude for the control Rana pipiens legs were 0.284 +/- 0.140 volts, and the average amplitude for the 0.862 +/- 0.234 volts (Figure 1). The t-value was 9.35, the p-value was 0.011, and the degrees of freedom were 2. The differences in amplitude between the control and treatment groups were statistically significantly different. Following the injection of caffeine, the muscle became rigid and took much longer to elongate. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported in that the group that received an injection of caffeine had a significantly higher amplitude of contraction than the control group. In a similar study on males, researchers found that caffeine increased excitability in skeletal muscles of humans. Additionally, they found that caffeine allows muscles to maximally contract and maintain contraction, indicating that it may be responsible for diminishing the decline of Ca2+ in the muscle, not allowing it to relax after fatigue [Kalmar: 1999] This explains the rigidity of the muscle following the removal of the stimulus, as the muscle remains in a state of tetany, or constant contraction, for a longer period of time since the caffeine inhibits the return of Ca2+ to its storage site. Because the p-value of 0.0011 indicated the data was significantly different between the control muscles and those injected with caffeine, this experiment supports the hypothesis that caffeine does have an effect on skeletal muscle contractions. Because the degrees of freedom were only 2, a way to increase the validity of this experiment in the future could be to introduce more types of skeletal muscles from other species which have similar neuromuscular functions to humans. For example, a similar experiment observed the effects of caffeine on the soleus of rats and found the same results that the caffeine prolonged and intensified the contraction of the muscles [Fryer: 1989]. If both rat and Rana pipiens muscles were used in the experiment and their data combined, it would be interesting to see whether the control and treatment groups remain statistically significantly different among different species.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Average amplitude measured in volts of the gastrocnemius muscle contractions of Rana pipiens. The average amplitude of the control group muscles was 0.284 +/- 0.140 volts, and the average of the muscles injected with caffeine was 0.862 +/- 0.234 volts. As a result of a paired t-test, these data yielded a p-value of 0.011, indicating that they were statistically significantly different. Additionally, the t-value is 9.35 which supports the hypothesis that there is a large difference in the contraction of the muscles when injected with caffeine. Finally, the degrees of freedom were 2. This value was low given that there were few subjects tested. *************************************************************************
