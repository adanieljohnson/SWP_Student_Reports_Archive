Title: Effects of altered Juvenile Hormone levels on Manduca sexta development

Abstract:
Insect growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes are regulated by hormone-based and neuron-based signaling. Therefore, it is important to understand the more specific roles that these hormones play given by what might occur if they were deviated from their naturally occurring balances. We looked more specifically at the effects of altered hormone levels on Manduca sexta. The expectation was that an increase of a Juvenile Hormone (JH) analog would result in a decreased average weight. Although our data trends suggest that the alternate hypothesis is supported, there was not a significent difference given by statistical testing. This result shows that imbalance created by the amount of JH analog used in this experiment was compensated for by the Manduca sexta’s other regulatory processes. 

Introduction:
This experiment analyzes how insects use hormones to maintain homeostasis. Hormones are created by Endocrine Glands as a mechanism of chemical communication, functioning to regulate complex processes like growth, fertility, and metabolism. The Manduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm. Manduca are valuable for hormone experimenting because their lifecycles have been previously tracked and studied, and scientists are therefore able to make predictions or note abnormalities in their development [Bryon: 2017]. Prothoracic glands secrete a family of steroid hormones known as ecdysteroids, referred to collectively as Ecdysterone or 20E, which regulate the timing of molting during insect development. Juvenile hormones are produced by the corpus allot glands, and regulate the type of molt during development. Because the absolute concentration of these two hormones in the concentration ratio is what determines their effects on the Manduca’s development, it is expected that an imbalance of either hormone will alter the developmental stage. Previous experiments have shown that the absence of JH leads to death. Increasing juvenile hormone levels in Manduca sexta using a JH analog will delay maturation, leading to a decrease in their average weight because they are unable to mature normally. 

Materials and Method:
Six Manduca caterpillars in the beginning of the 5th instar larva stage were separated into 2 groups of 3, with a controll group and an experimental group. Each group was placed in their own plastic container with individual compartments labeled 1-3. Air holes were poked into the sides of each individual compartment for air flow, and the containers were kept in a light cycle incubator at 25 degrees Celsius for 7 days. Both groups were fed daily, as well as containers cleaned. They were also weighed using a standard lab balance and recorded. The controll group was fed a diet of Great Lakes Manduca food with 7 drops of water to every 10g of food (70M), while the experimental group was fed the Great Lakes Manduca food with 7 drops of a JH analog to every 10g of food (70M). Our independent variable was therefore the Manduca’s diet, and our dependent variable was their weight. ). A one-tailed two sample 

Results:
The mean difference between initial and final weight of the controll caterpillars was 7.38 and the mean difference between initial and final weight of the experimental caterpillars was 5.93 (Fig. 1).   We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean weight of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 1.204, P = 0.1474). However, visible observations on the final day show a difference between the groups. The controll group was visibly larger and much more active, while the experimental group caterpillars were extremely lethargic. Additionally, the controll group appeared plump and bright green, while the experimental group caterpillars were leaner and a faded green color. The controll group also ate all of their food and the experimental did not. Overall, although the controll group always weighed more than the experimental group (Fig. 1), the data shows that this is not a significent difference.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the Manduca’s average weight would be decreased in the experimental group, was not supported. We observed no significent difference at the .05 level suggesting that the amount of JH analog distributed does not affect their developmental patterns. Further research might be done to test whether higher levels of JH analog will make a significent difference [Wigglesworth: 1954]. It is possible that we did not use enough JH analog to have an effect, and likely that the experimental group did not ingest all 7 drops of JH analog each day due to the fact that they were not eating all of their food. Given that most of the Manduca were in the very beginning of their 5th instar larva stage, we anticipated that they would pupate in approximately 5 days. However, neither of our groups pupated. It should therefore be noted that even our controll group did not pupate at the expected rate given by its average life cycle, suggesting the environment of our experiment may have played a role in altering their development.
