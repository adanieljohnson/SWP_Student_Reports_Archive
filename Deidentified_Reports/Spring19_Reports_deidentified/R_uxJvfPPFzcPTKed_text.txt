Title: The Significance of Ecdysterone in the Life Cycle of a Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta are insects that have a metamorphosis cycle leading to their transformation into a moth. In order for this to occur, they must experience a drop in juvenile hormone and ecdysterone, followed by a small peak in ecdysterone known as the commitment pulse. This commitment pulse initiates their transition into pupation. In order to observe how significent this pulse is in the life cycle of the larvae, we introduced our treatment group to a substance that acts as an ecdysterone blocker to compare them to a controll group that received normal food. We expected that the treatment group would remain in the larval stage and fail to pupate if introduced to the ecdysterone blocker. Over the course of about ten days, we observed the two groups’ behaviors and physical appearances. Our data showed no significent differences, although their physical states suggest that the blocker affected their growth rate and drive towards pupation exceptionally. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an animal that undergoes metamorphosis and transforms from a caterpillar larva into a moth. Hormones are endocrine-secreted chemicals that serve important roles in the development and growth of insects and mammals. Two of the hormones that allow the Manduca sexta to metamorphose into moths are ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Molting is a characteristic of insects’ reaching adulthood. The onset of this metamorphic molt must be precisely controllled because it terminates the growth phase of the larva and determines the size of the adult insect’s body [Nijhout: 2015]. Before molting occurs, the Manduca sexta goes through five instar larva stages. During fifth stage, there is a significent drop in juvenile hormone and ecdysterone levels, followed by a small peak in ecdysterone known as the commitment pulse. Under normal conditions, juvenile hormone levels remain low while ecdysterone simultaneously rises. This process initiates pupation and the Manduca sexta’s transition into adulthood. Our purpose in carrying out this experiment is to observe the effects on the insect’s pupation pattern if introduced to a substance that acts as an ecdysterone blocker. Adding ecdysterone blocker to the subjects’ food will hinder the commitment pulse from occurring and cause the Manduca sexta to remain in a larval stage.

Materials and Method:
In order to carry out this experiment, we obtained eight Manduca sexta larvae using four as a controll group and four as our experimental group. Each of the larvae were divided into two containers based upon which group they belonged to and divided into individual cells within their containers. Each larva in the controll group received approximately 10 grams of untreated food each day, while those in the experimental group each received 10 grams of food treated with the ecdysterone blocker. In order to evenly distribute the blocker, we weighed 40 grams of food and added approximately 40 milliliters of the blocker, then mixed it evenly and distributed ten grams to each larva. Each following day, we observed the larvae’s behaviors and recorded their masses in order to compare the differences between the controll and treatment groups over the course of 12 days. A two-sample t_test was then used to determine the differences in weight gain between the larvae that received an ecdysterone blocker in their diet and those that did not. This statistical test encompasses data from the first 10 days, as one of the subjects in the treatment group died on the 11th day. 

Results:
The mean change in mass of the larvae in the treatment group was 1.21 grams and the mean change in mass for the controll group was 2.44 grams. This represents a standard deviation of 0.7383484 for the treatment group and 2.7657067 for the controll group (Figure 1). The t-value was 0.861115, the one-tailed p_value was 0.211124, and the two-tailed p_value was 0.422247. The changes in mass between the two groups were not statistically significently different. After the first day, the controll group ate much more than the treatment group. The controll group was also much more active and was much larger than the treatment group. The same trend followed the next day, and one of the larvae lost mass. On the third day, two of the controll group subjects had begun to change into a brownish color, a sign of moving towards pupation. The same trends followed on the fourth and fifth days, and each of the controll subjects had become darker in color while the treatment group remained bright green. On the sixth day, all of the larvae in both groups had become very inactive. The controll group continued to get lighter in color, and the treatment group remained significently smaller. On the seventh day, two of the larvae in the controll group had entered into full pupation stage as evidenced by their dark brown color and molted skin. Each of the larvae had begun to lose weight. The next day, the other two controll group subjected pupated. One of the larvae in the treatment group was deceased. The other subjects in the treatment group were not active and had not produced much waste. In the final days, another treatment group larva was deceased, and the controll group subjects lost a little weight but were very active. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported in that the treatment group was hindered from pupating because of the ecdysterone blocker. We introduced this blocker through the Manduca sexta’s diet and compared the effects to a controll group that received untreated food. Those in the treatment group became progressively less active each day, leading to two of their deaths. It is unclear whether their being unable to pupate caused their death, or if they stopped eating the food and starved as we noticed that they were not eating much or producing much waste each day in comparison to the controll group. Cells in the Manduca sexta change their commitment individually in response to ecdysone (Riddiford: 1978). This makes sense that the treatment group did not pupate because they were not able to experience a commitment pulse due to the ecdysterone blocker they were introduced to in their food. Although there was no statistically significent difference between the two groups, their behavior and failure to pupate and other studies’ results indicate that the ecdysterone blocker does have an effect on the larvae. A more advanced study that would have interesting results would be to introduce both juvenile hormone and ecdysterone blockers to the treatment group to observe their effects on the larvae.
