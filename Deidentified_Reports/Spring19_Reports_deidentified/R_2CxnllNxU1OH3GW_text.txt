Title: The Effects of Martin’s IGR on Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillars exhibit 7 developmental stages in their lifetime most of which are controlled by the shifting of hormone levels. Two hormones that strongly affect these developments are Juvenile Hormone, which chooses the type of molting that is to occur based on its level and Ecdysteroid which is associated with the timing of molting. It was hypothesized that maintaining abnormally high levels of JH in caterpillars would lead to greater growth in the specimens than a control group of caterpillars The effects of JH on Manduca sexta was evaluated through the dividing of two groups of caterpillars and feeding half of the caterpillar's food mixed with five drops of Martin’s IGR per 10g while the other group was fed food that was mixed with five drops of water per 10g. The effects that were observed showed no significance. These results confirmed the rejection of the hypothesis that the IGR would positively affect the growth of Manduca sexta specimens.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta caterpillars undergo several distinctive stages during their life in which several key developments occur. Two specific hormones that influence these changes are Juvenile Hormone (JH) which controls the type of molting occurring and is secreted by the corpus allata and then Ecdysteroids which control the timing of molting and are released by the prothoracic glands. Fluctuations in hormone levels in insects, specifically the Manduca sexta, are related to the changing of larval as well as the initiation of pupating and the metamorphosis to adulthood. The Juvenile Hormone levels in Manduca sexta caterpillars generally remain elevated at early larval stages and as the organism approaches the 5th instar larva the levels rapidly decrease which is followed by a slight increase in the levels of Ecdysteroids which is known as the commitment pulse. Ecdysteroids are the hormones associated with the initiation of molting in Manduca sexta as they signify the commitment pulse which signifies that the organism is large enough to begin pupation. IGRs were first observed to have an effect on insect development and survival when linden bugs exposed to paper towels containing juvabione, expressed poor reproductive rates and failed to mature correctly [Tunaz: 2004]. JH in Manduca sexta specimens is associated with the repression of development meaning several key developments as the organism proceeds to later larval instars may be missed [Sanburg: 1975]. This experiment involves exposing a treatment group of four Manduca Sexta to food containing Martin’s IGR and then a second control group that was not exposed to any IGR. It was hypothesized that increasing JH levels in Manduca sexta would ultimately prevent pupation and result in larger caterpillars than those who were not exposed to Martin's IGR and grew naturally.​

Materials and Methods:
Two biomes were created by making two air holes in every compartment of each biome all of which housed a single Manduca sexta. The first biome included four caterpillars which were fed a diet of 10g of caterpillar food with 5 drops of water allowing the food to be the same texture/consistency as the food containing IGR. The second biome had each caterpillar provided with 10 grams of food however as opposed to water, the food was given five drops of Martin’s IGR which was mixed in thoroughly. The caterpillars were stored in an incubator at 28 °C  on a 24 hour light/dark cycle and were measured in millimeters with a rule and weighed in grams using a scale daily in addition to their food supply being replaced by a new ten grams of food when the current supply grew dry. The weights (g) and lengths (mm) of the caterpillars were recorded over a period of 14 days and then two one-tailed two-sample t-tests were performed to determine whether the differences between control and treatment group weight were statistically significant and again to determine whether the difference between the lengths was significant.

Results:
The averages for growth across the two experimental groups was consistent considering a significant difference was expected and there was little to no clear change. The average weight and length for the control group at the conclusion of the experiment was 79.75 +/- 7.365 mm (fig 1) and 11.99 +/- 3.109 g (fig 2) whereas the treatment group had an average weight of 8.55 +/-2.445 g and a length of 70 +/- 6.245 mm. In accordance with the performed two-sample t-test, the average length for the control group was not significantly different from the average length of the treatment group (df = 28, t-stat= 0.031, one-tailed p-value = 0.123182). The average weight of the control group compared to the treatment group also failed to yield a significant difference (df = 28, t-stat= 0.71, one-tailed p-value = 0.487732). The caterpillars during the experiment remained fairly constant in terms of color and appearance with an exception being one specimen in the treatment group appeared to be a lighter shade of green than the other caterpillars in the later days of the experiment as well as the general population all turning light brown by the last day. Additionally, the caterpillars in the treatment group began to decrease in both weights during the final two days of the experiment.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that there would be a significant increase in both length and weight in caterpillars treated with Martin’s IGR was rejected. Due to the lack of significance in the statistical tests, the results suggest that JH levels do not have a direct correlation with caterpillar size. Also according to a previous experiment changes in JH levels and exposure to IGRs cause the formation of developmental abnormalities and do not have any direct relationship to specimen size except for the fact that the developmental issues can lead to specimen fatality. [Sanburg: 1975]. Additionally, IGRs have been shown to reduce general insect survival through the inhibition of, and overproduction of hormones lending validity to the idea that as opposed to causing stimulated growth, the IGRs caused fatal abnormalities in some specimens. Finally, the lack of a drop in the JH levels of the caterpillars meant that a commitment pulse was never signaled; this led to a pause in development for the caterpillar which was in the process of moving through its life cycle causing metamorphic segmentation and ultimately death. Sources of error likely were a result of the imprecision in measuring IGR to add to the food considering the 10 drops varied in size and led to a significantly imprecise measure over the course of the two weeks. The study could be modified to include different IGRs and possibly JH blockers to see the effects of manipulating the hormone levels in different ways. This study and additional studies evaluating the effects of hormone treatment and level manipulation in insects are relevant and pertinent as they offer insight as to what alternative pesticides may be affective.​
