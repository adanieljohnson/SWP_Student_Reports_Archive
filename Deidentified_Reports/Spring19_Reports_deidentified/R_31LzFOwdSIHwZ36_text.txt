Title: Growth and Resource Allocation of Pisum sativun is Negatively Affected by Surplus of Supplemental Nitrogen 

Abstract:
	Pisum sativa, commonly known as the field pea, will exhibit phenotypic variation dependent on its environmental factors. It was hypothesized that addition of 75.6 grams of supplemental nitrogen to the experimental group would result in resource allocation to the shoots, providing a lower root-to-shoot ratio. Two groups of the Pisum sativa seedlings were grown in a controllled environment. The controll group was grown in a regulated soil and the experimental group was grown in the soil mixed with the nitrogen supplement. The controll group grew to average size, whereas the experimental group did not experience growth outside of the dormant seed stage. The data collected resulted in a p_value = 4.02, t-value = 11.59, Df = 10, and STDEV ± 0.1238. The data was not found to be significent, and did not support the hypothesis. 


Introduction:
	Plants in different ecosystems exhibit different phenotypes. The phenotypic variation within plant species results from the combination of environmental factors present in different ecosystems. In order for a plant to survive in its environment, it must be able to obtain a sufficient amount of resources that allow it to create the necessary energy for survival. The processes that allow the plant to acquire its resources require the disposal of energy. Thus, in order to be successful, the plants must allocate their energy wisely. For example, nitrogen is often the most limiting nutrient and plants differ in how they acquire nitrogen and how they allocate it between roots and shoots including the stems and leaves [Johnson: 2018]. Pisum sativun, more commonly known as the field pea, is a plant species that can be used to observe energy allocation. In an experiment completed with Cassia nictitans, the partridge pea, energy allocation was observed between groups that had altered amounts of sunlight. Plants grown under moderate shade (30 or 55 percent) produced more dry matter and seed and had greater dimensions than plants in full sun or dense shade (92 percent) [Harshbarger: 1971]. Researching the effects of energy allocation in plants that are produced by different environmental factors can contribute to agricultural production. Determining the phenotypic effects produced on crops by various nutrients, such as nitrogen, can give vital information for the most efficient ways to grow crops. Nitrogen is a necessary nutrient for plants, and as stated previously, it is the most limiting resource for plants. We predict that when 75.6 grams of supplemental nitrogen is added to the soil, the Pisum sativun species will exhibit allocation to its shoots, resulting in a lower root-to-shoot ratio.


Materials and Method:
A random number of Pisum sativun seeds were sown in two separate soil containers: the first included a regulated soil brand and the second included the same soil, mixed with the supplemental nitrogen. Both sets of seedlings were then grown in a controllled greenhouse environment. The two seedling groups were watered every other day. Exactly two weeks after the seeds were sown, three random seedlings were harvested from the controll group. These three seedlings were all weighed. After obtaining a total mass for each seedling, the shoots and roots of the plants were separated at the junction of the root and the shoot. Care was taken to ensure that each plant was cut at approximately the same location. The mass of each of the shoots was then obtained, and the mass of the roots were calculated by subtracting the shoot mass from the total mass. The shoots and roots of each plant were then measured, in millimeters, and the root to shoot ratio was calculated. A Two-Sample T-test was used to compare the two sets of data.


Results:
No general trends were observed in the data. The controll group was observed to grow to an average measure, whereas the experimental group seeds were found to be covered in mold. The experimental group was observed to show no growth outside of the dormant stage of the seed, as shown in Figure 1. The experimental and controll group were not statistically different from each other, as the T-test values concluded that the data was not of significent difference. The data produced from the controll group resulted in a p_value = 4.02, t-value = 11.59, Df = 10, and STDEV ± 0.1238.


Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis. It is probable that the amount of nitrogen that was used in the experiment negatively affected the growth of the seeds and caused them to mold. Research has shown that variable amounts of nitrogen can have various effects on the growth of plants. In a research experiment completed on green soybeans, it was found that when a large quantity of nitrogen was supplied to the plants directly at the root level, the nitrogen supply to the root was delayed [Nishioka: 2008]. The delay of nitrogen to the roots can be related to stunted growth of the plants, since nitrogen is a necessary and limiting resource. Another experiment was completed on poplar trees supplied with different amounts of nitrogen. The two groups of plants used in this experiment exhibited phenotypic variation that was concluded to be from the variable amounts of nitrogen [Li: 2012]. The results of this experiment suggested that if we were to adjust our level of nitrogen, the results of our experimental group would have had a high possibility of supporting our hypothesis. To better understand the effects of nitrogen levels on plant growth, a follow-up experiment could be performed with multiple experimental groups that are each supplied with a different amount of nitrogen. The information obtained from such experiments would provide essential information about plant growth and nitrogen-based fertilizers for the progression of the agricultural field.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The average difference in Root-to-Shoot ratio between the controll and experimental groups. The data for the controll group was averaged from three randoMly selected seedlings grown in the controll soil. No growth was observed from the experimental seeds, so the averaged data was equivalent to 0.
