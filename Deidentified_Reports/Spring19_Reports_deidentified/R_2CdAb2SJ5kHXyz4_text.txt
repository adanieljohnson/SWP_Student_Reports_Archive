Title: The Effect of Increased Juvenile Hormone Signaling through the Introduction of IGR on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
We investigated the role of JH on the development of the M. sexta by incorporating a synthetic IGR hormone that would increase JH activity to investigate the hypothesis that this would affect caterpillar growth. After feeding a control group five drops of water, and an experimental group five drops of IGR, for two weeks, a two-sample T-test was utilized to determine if our data was significant. By taking the growth of each caterpillar group over the course of the experiment, we were able to compare how the increased expression of JH affected the growth of the treatment group in comparison to the control group. We measured growth through the caterpillars’ increase of mass in grams. The averaged growth of the three caterpillars in the treatment group was 5.34 grams, while the averaged growth of the three caterpillars in the control group was 5.89 grams. The p-value came out to be 0.400527, and upon the completion of our analysis, we were not able to conclude that the experimental group’s growth was affected by the addition of IGR into their food. If the experiment were to be repeated, we would introduce the IGR to the caterpillars at an earlier stage of their development to get a better idea of how increased JH levels affects M.sexta growth in order to create a potential pesticide.

Introduction:
In most organisms, a transition from their juvenile state to their adult state is triggered by hormone signals [Johnson: 2018]. Although hormone signaling varies species to species, the basic mechanism remains the same. In this lab, we focused on hormone signaling in insects. Our test subject was the Manduca Sexta. The M. sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera which includes all moths, butterflies and skippers [Johnson: 2018]. The Manduca Sexta is used in many studies pertaining to hormone regulation because the different instars separated by molts makes it easy to see how the manipulation of hormone levels can change progression from pupa to adult moth [Zhou: 2001]. This phenomena can be seen in previous studies in which JH was applied topically to the M.sexta during its fourth instar, resulting in a significantly smaller pupae and developmental anomalies such as shortened wings and an unfused proboscis [Kiguchi: 1878].  During its larval stages, the M. sexta presents itself as a bright blueish green caterpillar with diagonal white stripes and singular horn on its last abdominal segment. Upon maturation, the M. sexta emerges from its pupa as a large brown moth with large orange spots on its body. The process by which the M. sexta completely changes form from caterpillar to moth is metamorphosis. This process is highly regulated by the release of hormones that signal when it is time to enter different stages of the M. sexta’s life [Johnson: 2018]. The two main hormones that work together in most insects are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) [Johnson: 2018]. JH is a family of insect hormones that are made up of a long chain of organic molecules [Johnson: 2018]. JH regulates the type of molt during development and works in conjunction with 20E to control many other functions within developing and adult insects [Johnson: 2018]. Within the M. sexta, these two hormones specifically control growth, molting, and metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. The absolute concentration and concentration ratios of the two hormones, along with the M.sexta’s developmental stage, determine the effects of the hormones [Johnson: 2018].  The M.sexta’s developmental stage consists of five larval instars separated by molts [Johnson: 2018]. Throughout the first four larval instars, JH levels stay consistently high [Johnson:2018]. During the end of the fourth larval instar JH levels begin to decline and eventually drop below the 20E hormone levels for the first time [Johnson: 2018]. During the fifth larval instar, JH levels drop very low and there is a slight rise in 20E [Johnson: 2018]. This rise in the 20E hormone is known as the commitment pulse [Johnson: 2018]. This commitment pulse is easily recognizable as it results in a black pulsing line going down the caterpillar’s back. This signal is produced when the M.sexta larvae is large enough, and has stored enough energy and nutrients in order to successfully pupate and complete metamorphosis [Johnson:2018].  During our experiment, we investigated the role of JH on the growth of the M.sexta as it progressed through its larval stage. Since the larval stage was the focus of our study, we terminated the experiment before the M.sexta was able to complete its transformation from a caterpillar into a moth. We hypothesized that if we increased JH expression in the M. sexta by means of an IGR hormone, the growth of the M.sexta caterpillars would be affected during their larval stages. We expect the growth of the M.sexta to be affected, because with the amplified JH expression, it will be harder for the 20E to rise above the increased JH levels and trigger the commitment pulse. This study could potentially lead to knowledge on M.sexta hormones, and potentially other insect hormones, that would allow for the production of a natural pesticide. 

Materials and Methods:
We set up the experiment by creating two identical habitats for our control and experimental caterpillars. We determined that each of our experimental caterpillars would receive five drops of IGR for every ten grams of food. Our experimental caterpillars received five drops of filtered water to their food in place of the IGR hormone to decrease the chance of any confounding variables within our experimental procedure. Our dependent variable was identified as the caterpillar’s growth. We measured this according to mass in grams. The initial set-up of our caterpillars’ habitats included two plastic containers that had dividers sectioning it into four separate compartments. One container was for the control caterpillars while the second container was for the experimental caterpillars. We set these containers up by punching four airholes on the side of each compartment. We clearly labeled each container stating whether it was experimental or control, as well as the individual compartments 1-3 so we could easily identify each separate caterpillar. When selecting the caterpillars for this experiment, we chose ones that were small, but as similar as possible in size based on their weight. Before putting each caterpillar in its new habitat, we weighed it and recorded its initial mass in grams.  The starting weight of our chosen caterpillars ranged from 1.76 grams to 2.53 grams.   The food for this experiment was generic Manduca Sexta food. We prepared this for our experiment by scooping out a large portion of the food and mixing it with a small amount of water to moisten it. Once we had mixed the food to a good consistency, we separated it into six ten-gram portions. After creating the portions, we added five drops of IGR hormone to three of the portions, and five drops of filtered water to the other three. After mixing in the IGR and water as well as we could so that it was evenly distributed in the food, we rolled each portion into a ball. Each ball of food was placed into a different compartment of the habitat with a caterpillar. Upon completion of the initial setup, our caterpillars were placed in an incubator set at 25˚C where they remained for the duration of the experiment unless they were being weighed. We collected data on our caterpillar’s growth for the next two weeks. Each day we had someone come in to record the mass in grams of each caterpillar. We also took pictures to document their growth. If the caterpillars seemed to be running out of food, we would make more using the same procedure as the first time.  We also tried to keep the habitats clean by removing any feces from the container.  Upon the completion of our experiment, we evaluated our data by taking the average change in weight from the start of the experiment to the end of the experiment for each individual caterpillar. We then averaged the weights of the caterpillars in each group together to come up with two final averages on which our analysis was based; we evaluated the average change in mass for the caterpillars treated with the IGR, and the average change in mass for the caterpillars in the control group treated with water. These two averages were evaluated in comparison to one another by using a two-sample T-test to come up with a p-value that stated whether we were able to accept our hypothesis. This p-value was evaluated using a 0.05 alpha level.

Results:
The average change in weight for the experimental group of caterpillars was 5.34 grams with a standard deviation of 2.4 and the average change in weight for the control group of caterpillars was 5.89 with a standard deviation of 3.0 (Figure 1). One caterpillar from our control group and two caterpillars from our experimental group died before the completion of the experiment. However, we did factor these caterpillars’ weights into our analysis because they did not die until the very end of the experiment and we had already collected a significant amount of data on their growth. We performed a two-sample T-test on our data to see if our data was significant. The calculated p-value from our T-test is 0.400527.

Discussion:
From our averaged data, it seems that the control caterpillar group had a greater increase in mass over the course of our experiment than the IGR treatment group. However, in terms of our original hypothesis, we were not able to determine that IGR hormone, or an increase in JH expression, affects the growth of the experimental caterpillars because our p-value was much larger than the 0.05 that would make it significant.   Caterpillars died in both the control group and the experimental group, and there is no indication to what the cause of dead could have been. However, the third caterpillar in the experimental group seemed a lot sicker than the remaining caterpillars in the control group. This could suggest that all the caterpillars in the experimental group were less healthy than those in the control group because of the added IGR hormone. There are many factors that could have introduced error into our experiment resulting in insignificant results. One factor is the maturity of our caterpillars at the beginning of the experiment. Previous successful studies on insect hormone regulation began hormone manipulation much earlier, even beginning at the process of oogenesis [Swevers: 2009]. Since our lab is later in the week, the caterpillars left over from the previous labs were more matured and much larger. This could have affected our results because the IGR did not affect JH levels in the caterpillar until it had already begun to mature. We do not know for certain, but the caterpillars we chose for our experiment could have already been in their second or third larval instar by the time the IGR was introduced into their system. In order to more accurately determine the effects of the IGR on developing M.sexta, we would want to introduce the IGR into their diet as soon as they hatched from the egg. We could expand this farther if we wanted to and even introduce the IGR hormone to the M.sexta embryo.  Other sources of error include certain limitations to our experiment that could not be helped due to the limited number of resources, and the short time frame. Our experimental and control groups were very small, making it very difficult to distinguish a prominent trend in growth. While there were replicates of each treatment, the groups were very small, and we only ran the experiment one time so there are no other statistics to compare our current data to. Finally, our experiment was not able to be carried out to its completion due to some of the caterpillars dying before the conclusion of the experiment.  We know that JH levels can be manipulated to significantly alter the pupal stages of the Manduca Sexta, and even result in a deformed adult moth [Kiguchi: 1878]. Therefore, future studies pertaining to the effect of JH levels on growth and size should follow through the end of the M.sexta’s life span in order to fully observe the affects. These studies could farther investigate the hormone signaling and how we can manipulate it to create a pesticide, or keep the M.sexta caterpillars small enough to be unproblematic.
