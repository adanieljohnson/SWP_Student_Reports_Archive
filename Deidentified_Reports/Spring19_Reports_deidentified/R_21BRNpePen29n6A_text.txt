Title: The Effect of Caffeine on Muscle Contractions When Stimulated On The Sciatic Nerve

Abstract:
The following experiment was designed to determine the effect of caffeine (Ca2+) on the strength of a muscle contraction in a Rama pipien frog’s hind leg. The hypothesis of this experiment is that when the frog legs are injected with the caffeine, they will be more alert and susceptive to the stimulant and the muscle contraction will be stronger. This experiment will be performed by testing the muscle contractions with prongs and a sensor that will be plugged into a computer to supply the experimenters with readings. The results that were obtained produced a P-value that supported the hypothesis. This supplied the experimenter’s with support for their theory that caffeine boosts the alertness of muscles, even though this was in contrast with other similar studies.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system allows for very fast responses by the body to maintain homeostasis and perform various functions. An example of this is when the brain sends nerve signals to a muscle commanding it to perform a certain function. This is what causes muscle summation, the force generated by multiple muscle motor units combined to produce muscular tension. A good way to see this is in the hind leg of a Rama pipien frog. In this species it is very easy to separate and see the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle. There are also ways to alter the way nerve signals and muscles interact. The way this experiment will test will be the application of caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant that is known to increase alertness, which could impact the way a muscle responds to stimuli. Our hypothesis is that if caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle, the then the muscle contractions will be stronger, supporting the theory that caffeine boosts alertness in muscles.



Materials and Methods:
First, the lab station was prepared as well as the frog legs. This included plugging the sensor into the computer, separating the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle, inserting the sensor prongs into the frog legs and more). Then the experimenters obtained a control measurement with 5 trials of all three frog legs without injecting them with anything. Then this data was recorded. Then we injected the frog legs with caffeine at the site of the gastrocnemius muscle. The frog legs were then tested for 5 more trials as they were now the test group. We kept the legs moistened with Frog Ringer’s Solution during the whole process and we recorded the last of the measurable data. After this, we cleaned up the lab station and conducted a Paired T-Test on the results. 

Results:
For the control group, all 3 frog legs had lower voltage levels as the time went along. For the test group, however, only frog legs numbers 1 and 3 went down as the pulses proceeded. Frog leg 2 actually increased. In terms of observations on the frog leg itself, it became very hard and dense after it was injected into the muscle with caffeine and the 5 trials were done. A Paired T-Test was done for each individual leg and produced values that supported the experimenter’s hypothesis. The muscular contraction thresholds were all significantly higher in voltage with the addition of caffeine.

Discussion:
For starters, we can tell that the common trend of the voltage recorded lowering with each trial is most likely caused by fatigue in the muscle. The muscle is becoming overworked and exhausted due to its lack of ATP and not having an energy source. Next, the change in form of the muscle from being soft to being hard and dense is because of a property called tetany where the muscle is being overworked. This occurs in multiple different ways from multiple different causes but in this experiment, it is clear that it is caused by the injection of caffeine. The results of the three T-Tests performed all supported the hypothesis.  Caffeine is the cause of a greater contraction threshold in the muscle of the Rama sapiens. In terms of expanding this experiment, I would always like to expand on the number of trials that were conducted, the number of test subjects, and, in this case the concentration levels, however I believe that the most interesting way of expanding here would be to do the same experiment, except moving the prongs from draping the sciatic nerve, to being inserted directly into the gastrocnemius muscle. This experiment did not produce results in line with those of  a similar experiment by Montreal Children’s Hospital Research Institute and Meakins-Christie Laboratory at McGill University. All in all, the experiment was very interesting as it proved that the caffeine had a significant effect on the muscle contraction threshold and presented many different directions that could be taken in terms of further study.
