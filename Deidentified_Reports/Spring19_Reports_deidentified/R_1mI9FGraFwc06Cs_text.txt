Title: Color’s marginal effect on the intra and interspecific behaviors of Betta splendens 

Abstract:
Studying the resource allocation of animals helps us understand the significance of higher or lower levels of aggression. Different colors schemes impact the evolution of phenotypic diversity for several species who interact with each other and other species in their environment. We studied how color influences aggressive and defensive behaviors between male Betta splendens. We used a male betta’s response to his own species as an index for aggression. Also, we used a separate species to see whether the bettas responded differently and what resources they valued the most. We did not find significant support that the bettas would show less aggression towards the other fish species. The patterns we observed highlight the minimal and almost non-existent effect that color morphs have in causing aggressive intra or interspecific competition. Our results also demonstrate the complexity in determining what factors cause aggression. Overall, the study did enhance our comprehension on the plasticity of territorial fish and the importance of mating. 

Introduction:
Intra and interspecific behaviors define how animals respond and interact with members of its own species or members of another species. Studying aggression levels are beneficial because they can show us what resources animals prioritize, such as food, water, territory, and mates. In our experiment, we use Betta splendens because they are known for being aggressive towards members of their own species and other fish species. Their different aggressive behaviors are also well documented in ethology, making it easier to analyze the significance of what behavior they display [Daugs 1967]. In fact, in a study that tested reinforcers of aggression, betta fish displayed aggression towards their mirror image and their fighting movements increased when food was placed between them and the mirror [Hogan: 1970]. Betta fish are a great study fish for aggression because they display a varying level of aggression towards other fish in their territory [Smith: 1945].  Our experiment explores how betta fish react in the presence of other fish of a similar size, in this case, Epalzeorhynchos frenatum, also known as the rainbow shark. We tested the bettas aggression towards a different species to see whether they display more aggression towards another species or their own. This observation also will attest to what resources cause their aggression because food and territory will be at stake for the fish. The different stimulus are the two different fish: a tank with a control betta and a tank with a rainbow shark. We hypothesize that the betta fish will demonstrate a decreased amount of aggression towards the rainbow shark compared to members of their own species. 

Materials and Methods:
We obtained six betta fish, five of the betas were experimental fish and one betta was a control. We controlled all experimental fish by putting them into the same tank with the same control betta for five minutes. We added a small amount of food into each tank and maintained opaque slides in between each section of the tank so that the fish could not see each other in between trials. We record the amount of gill flair they showed, in seconds, during that five-minute span. Then the fish rested for five minutes in between each trial with the opaque slides placed back in the tanks. We repeated this same process with a rainbow shark but alternated which fish the test betta was placed with first. We controlled habituation by alternating the sequence in which the test bettas were exposed to the different stimulus. We recorded the time that the test bettas showed aggressive behavior (gill flair) in sec/5 min. We used a paired t test to compare the average time of aggression towards the control betta and the rainbow shark.

Results:
We found that the test bettas showed an average time of aggression towards the control betta of 44.5 ± 39.03417 sec/5 min. The test bettas showed an average time of aggression towards the rainbow shark of 10.75 ± 21.5 sec/5 min (Fig. 1). The paired t-test we used to compare the two stimuli yielded values of (t=2.83, dF=3, p=.066). The p-value of .066 was insignificant. We had to exclude the data corresponding the second test betta because the times measured  were extreme outliers completely opposite from the trend of our data. Removing this data lowered our p-value significantly.

Discussion:
Although our data did show the general trend in aggression that we expected, it was insignificant, making our hypothesis not supported. Our data was not significant because one of the betta fish was hyper aggressive towards the rainbow shark, whereas all the others flared their gills for zero seconds. This unusual event caused the standard deviations to overlap too much to be significant. The insufficient data likely resulted from the wide variety in aggression levels demonstrated by the test bettas. The trend in our data suggests that the fish may have habituated to the conditions due to the repeated testing, causing them to be less aggressive. However, it is more likely that the fish were able to recognize the species of their opponent and the threat posed towards their own gathering of resources. Recognizing their own species can cause bettas to be more aggressive since they fear losing a potential mate to a rival [Daugs: 1967]. Also, the sequence of the stimulus did not seem to affect how the fish reacted. In the future, we could extend the resting period for the fish in between trials or use fish with a bigger fin size to test whether fin size influences the agonistic behavior of the fish. Testing other intra and interspecific behaviors, such as darting, biting, tail flashing, and dorsal fin flexing among others, could suggest other factors that impact the behavior of rival fish [Smith: 1945]. Another experiment observed the pigment (carotenoid) trade-off between male betta fish to see how it affected the sexual preference of conspecific females. While their study focused more on the influence of this pigment to immune and antioxidant defenses, their results about color are relevant to our study. They found that the pigments coloration predicts female sexual preference and improves their immune system. This is relevant because their results suggest that female bettas prefer redder fish [Clotfelter: 2007]. Some of our bettas were the same color as a rainbow shark, so color is largely irrelevant to our study. But, knowing that female bettas prefer certain colors can help us better analyze our results. A male betta would not necessarily know this information on female preference, but if he feared that a different color male might steal his mate, he may display fighting movements. Also, observing what type of aggression a male betta shows to a male betta of the same color—versus a different color—could show which resources they prioritize. Our study showed that food was not as important as territory because none of the fish went after the food or showed aggression when their opponent went to eat. The aggression we observed occurred when the fish encroached on another’s territory. This could be interpreted as protecting their territory, but also fending off a rival that could steal his mate. Mates allow animals to reproduce, making them the most important resource for biological fitness. Our experiment suggests that the fish could recognize the other fish’s species, teaching us that the fish use aggression when there is a threat to their chances of mating. This observation allows the understanding of variety and plasticity when discussing the characteristics of territorial aggression.
