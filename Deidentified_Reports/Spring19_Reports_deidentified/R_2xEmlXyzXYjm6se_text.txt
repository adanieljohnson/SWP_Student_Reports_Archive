Title: The effect of salt water on root to shoot ratios in Secale cereale.

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to understand the effect salt water has on the root to shoot ratios of Secale cereale. It was hypothesized that salt water would increase the root to shoot ratios of plants when compared to control plants watered with tap water. Control groups had average root to shoot ratios of 0.647 ± 0.147 (weight g) and 0.493 ± 0.070 (length cm). Treatment groups had an average root to shoot ratio of 3.667 ± 1.296 (weight g) and 1.465 ± 0.389 (length cm). Length ratios: (t=7.77, df=18, p=3.68E-7). Weight ratios: (t=7.32, df=18, p=4.22E-7). The data was significant, and the null hypothesis was rejected. 

Introduction:
In the wild, plants face factors that affect their life and growth while depending on their available resources to thrive. These factors can be broken down into two major categories: abiotic and biotic. Abiotic factors are “stimuli [that originate] from non-living sources” [Johnson: 2018]. Examples of these factors include sunlight, thermal radiation, and wind. Biotic factors, on the other hand, come from living sources or organisms. Examples include fungi, bacteria, and animals. These stimuli make inter-plant interactions competitive as resources such as sunlight or nutrients may be scarce and make competition necessary. In order to do this, plants may out compete other species causing certain species to be removed from a given location. In order to compete for scarce resources, plants will allocate their limited resources in a specific pattern that allows them to effectively overcome abiotic factors. [Johnson 2018]. A previous study looked into the root to shoot ratios of lettuce when affected by the presence and absence of a nutrient solution. The study found a positive correlation between root to shoot ratios and the presence of nutrient solution. [McLaughlin et al.: 1997]. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect salt water has on root to shoot ratios of Secale cereale. Secale cereal is a great model organism due to its fast growth and resilience to environmental factors. It is hypothesized that if Secale cereale plants are watered with 3% salt water then the root to shoot ratios (in length and weight) will increase when compared to the root to shoot ratios of Secale cereale watered with regular tap water.

Materials and Methods:
To test the hypothesis, roughly eighty Secale cereale seeds were obtained. For the control group, two planting pods were fully filled with vermiculite and 200 mL of tap water was added to the pods. Additionally, 100 mL of miracle grow plant nutrition solution was added to the pods. Sixteen holes were then poked in the vermiculite and at least two Secale cereale seeds were added to each planting hole. The plants were then labeled and placed in a greenhouse where they grew for one week. The plants were watered daily with 100 mL of regular tap water. These steps were repeated for the treatment groups. The treatment plants were also left to grow for a week in the greenhouse but were watered daily with a 3% salt water solution rather than regular tap water. At the end of the growing week, the plants were taken from the greenhouse and removed from the vermiculite via water bath. Ten treatment plants and ten control plants were then isolated for analysis. The individual Secale cereale plants were then cut at the seed to separate their roots from their shoots. After ensuring the plants were dry and free from debris, the plant roots and shoots were individually weighed (with their mass recorded in g) and measured (with their length recorded in cm). The masses and lengths of the plants were then recorded as a ratio of root length or mass divided by the shoot mass or length. These root to shoot ratios were then recorded and averaged with their accompanying standard deviation. The treatment and control root to shoot ratios were then subjected to a two-tail two-sample t test to determine statistical significance with a 95% confidence interval.

Results:
The control group had an average weight (g) root to shoot ratio of 0.647 ± 0.147 and an average length (cm) root to shoot ratio of 0.493 ± 0.070. The experimental group had an average weight (g) root to shoot ratio of 3.667 ± 1.296 and an average length (cm) root to shoot ratio of 1.465 ± 0.389. After running a two-tail two-sample t test on the length root to shoot ratios, statistical results were as follows: (t=7.77, df=18, p=3.68E-7). Statistical testing results on the weight root to shoot ratio were as follows: (t=7.32, df=18, p=4.22E-7). The control group had average ratios below zero while the experimental had ratios above zero. 

Discussion:
The biological hypothesis of this experiment was accepted, and the null hypothesis was rejected. These conclusions were indicated by a p-value of 3.68E-7 (length) and a p-value of 4.22E-7 (weight), which were lower than the alpha value of 0.05. This indicates there was a significant difference between the root to shoot ratios for both length and weight in treatment plants. These results are easily explained by the need for the treatment plants to acquire water in order to facilitate growth. In order for the plants to grow, resources must be allocated to the roots rather than the shoot so that the plants can acquire more water. This allocation of resources to the roots is not necessary in the control plants as they do not face water scarcity and receive all the water they need from the daily watering. These outcomes are consistent with those of a 1997 study that found various species of dune plants would allocate resources to their shoots, thus lowering root to shoot ratios, when buried in darkness. This is so that the shoots can grow out of the ground and acquire more sunlight (a scarce resource) [Brown: 1997]. This past study corroborates the data and results collected in this experiment. There were no obvious sources of error, but some possible human sources of error include the variability in times at which plants were watered and with the accuracy of how much liquid was delivered to each pod of plants. Future experiments in this area could focus on the effect of salt water on buried plants to see how they would allocate their resources when faced with a lack of water and sunlight.
