Title: Nitrogen-Rich Soil Environments Yield Rye Plants with Smaller Root:Shoot Ratios

Abstract:
In order to stay fit for survival in a dynamic world, organisms must be able to adapt to countless environmental factors. Plants adapt to their surroundings using resource allocation, especially crucial with their lack of a muscular system, and chemical properties of the soil they are rooted in are one determinant of this strategical, energetically-favorable growth. As Nitrogen is a key nutrient that plants require for photosynthetic activity among other functions, its absorption through roots should affect the development of the plant. It was hypothesized that plants growing in Nitrogen-rich soil would have smaller root:shoot ratios than those with less access to Nitrogen due to the allocation of resources to the part of the plant growing above ground, with less abundant access to key nutrients. Testing a group of 10 rye plants watered with Nitrogen-rich Miracle-Grow compared to 10 controllled with standard water, it was found that those in the highly nitrogenous environments had significently lower root:shoot ratios than the controll group. These results supported the hypothesis that plants with more access to certain resources, plants will dedicate their energy to growing parts necessary for retrieving others less available resources.

Introduction:
The biological processes of organisms are driven by an overall goal of energetic favorability, so, logically, these organisms strive for the most efficient physical structure to be fittest for their functions and environment. This maximization of favorable qualities is easily measured in plants, whose physical structure efficiency manifest in simple length and mass. Plant fitness may also be measured in reproductive potential [Bennett: 2012]; however, in this experiment, Secale cereale, commonly known as rye, was studied using size measures. Rye plants made an ideal subject due to their temperate growing conditions and long thin structure, conducive to straightforward length measurements. Nitrogen was chosen to be varied for the experiment, as a crucial nutrient in plants; the element is an integral component of chlorphyll, the organelle responsible for photosynthesis, and the plant respiratory system as a whole [Reich: 2006]. It is absorbed via the roots, so according to the rules of resource allocation, plants with more access to the nutrient should devote their energy and resources to growth of other plant parts, like the stem and leaves, that are responsible for the absorption of less abundant resources, such as sunlight or CO2. Because of this, it was hypothesized that the root:shoot ratio would be decreased in rye plants growing in soil with a high Nitrogen content compared to a controll group with relatively normal levels. 



Materials and Method:
To conduct the experiment, the plants were consistently grown and watered over a 2-week period. Rye seeds were collected and distributed evenly among 4 pots with constant soil content, about 1.5 inches below the surface and placed in the same controllled greenhouse conditions. Over the following weeks, the 4 pots each were watered once a day with 100 Ml of fluid. The controll group pots received 100 Ml of tap water while the experimental group was watered with 50 Ml of tap water and 50 Ml of Miracle Grow, a soluble plant food with 24% total Nitrogen content. After the two-week growth period, 10 plants from each group were selected and, after careful extraction from the soil to preserve roots, the roots were separated from the shoots at the seed on each plant and both the roots and shoots were massed and measured for length. The root:shoot ratios for each group were calculated based on average mass and average length, respectively, and to analyze data an unpaired, one-tailed student t test was conducted.

Results:
The Nitrogen-treated group of rye plants yielded significently lower root:shoot ratios than the controll water-treated group with average r:s of weight at 1.10.28 (t value=2.97, d.f.= 18, p value=0.004) and of length 1.080.27 (t value=2.31, d.f.=18, p value=0.017) for the latter and 0.810.09 and 0.870.12 for the former. 

Discussion:
The results supported the posed hypothesis, with significent p values for both sets of data, 0.004 and 0.017 for r:s by weight and length, respectively. Rye plants treated with Nitrogen-rich Miracle Gro had a lower average root:shoot ratio than rye plants watered normally. This is likely a result of the principles of resource allocation; since there was nowhere close to a shortage of the soil nutrient Nitrogen, the plants dedicated more of their resources, growth, energy and otherwise, to the parts of the plant above the ground, necessary for the absorption of other important environmental factors. The study was completed with minimal sources of error as the conditions were held constant for both the controll and experimental group and the technique for data collection was supervised and had been practiced before. This being said, the results obtained supporting resource allocation definitely call for further study on the subject, possibly varying different resources or studying different organisms adapting. One study conducted showed that even age affected photosynthetic traits of wheat and rye plants, likely a result of adaption over time [Jaikumar: 2013]. Resource allocation was clearly demonstrated in rye plants as a response to Nitrogen content in soil, which affected the plant structure and can be generalized as a topic to many organisms and environments.
