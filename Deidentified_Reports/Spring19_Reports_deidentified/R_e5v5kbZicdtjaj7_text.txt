Title: Growth of Manduca Sexta caterpillars when exposed to juvenile hormones

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to examine how the introduction of juvenile hormones to the Manduca Sexta caterpillar affected its growth. They hypothesis that we tested was if juvenile hormone is increased with insect growth regulators, then the growth of the M. Sexta caterpillars will be slowed. We injected juvenile hormone into the food of 3 caterpillars and water into the food of 3 different caterpillars. We then went in every other day and recorded the length of the caterpillars. Our results showed that the juvenile hormones do slow the growth of the M. Sexta caterpillars ultimately supporting our hypothesis.

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta goes through different larvae stages that are controlled by hormones. Two of these hormones are juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E). JH remains constant throughout the larvae stages, and when 20E begins to spike, this indicates that it is time to move on to the next larvae stage [Johnson: 2018]. Once the larvae is ready to pupate, JH drops off and 20E spikes [Johnson: 2018]. This time is known as the commitment pulse. “During the final larval instar of the M. Sexta the presence of JH inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)” [Nijhout: 1974]. This is significant because if PTTH is not present, then 20E will not be produced and the commitment pulse will not occur. JH is a long chain organic molecule produced mainly by a pair of glands known as the corpus allata [Johnson: 2018]. 20E is a family of steroid hormones that is secreted by groups of cells in the back of the head and thorax called prothoracic glands [Johnson: 2018]. The hypothesis that my group is testing is: if JH is increased with insect growth regulators (IGR), then the growth of the M. Sexta caterpillars will be slowed. It is important to run an experiment like this because pests are important to learn about, particularly farmers. Farmers should know how certain chemicals affect certain species because they do not want toxins they put on their crops to kill non-pests. 

Materials and Methods:
We took 3 caterpillars and placed them in a control container, and a different 3 caterpillars and placed them in a treatment container. The control group was given 10 grams of food with 5 drops of water while the treatment group was given 10 grams of food with 5 drops of IGR. This was done to see how the IGR will affect the growth and development of the caterpillars. The containers were placed in the same fridge and measurements of their length were taken every other day. We then used a one-tailed t-test to find our p-value and determine if our results were significant.

Results:
The results from our one-tailed t-test gave us a p-value of .03. This value is significant because the p-value is less than .05. The average percentage growth for the control group was 55% while the average percentage growth for the treatment group was 45.58%. The standard deviation for the control group was It can be observed from figure 1 that the control group on average had a greater percentage growth when compared to the treatment group. The standard deviation for the control group was .050 while the standard deviation for the treatment group was .040. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that an increase in JH with IGR would slow the growth of the M. Sexta caterpillars, was supported. We rejected the null hypothesis because our p-value was less than .05 making our results significant. Based on our results, we were able to determine that the percent change of growth of caterpillars who were given JH is smaller when compared to caterpillars who were just given water. If this experiment were to be performed again, we could increase the amount of caterpillars that we tested on or we could also test to see how JH affects the weight of the caterpillars. This experiment is important because it is helpful for different groups of people such as farmers to know how a hormone such as JH would affect the growth of certain species. This can be useful when trying to deter certain species from messing with crops.
