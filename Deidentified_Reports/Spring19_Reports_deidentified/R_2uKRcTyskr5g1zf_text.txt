Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Length and Weight of Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The life cycle of Manduca sexta is regulated by the hormones PTTH, JH, and 20E. Increasing the level of Juvenile Hormone (JH) delays the caterpillar’s development from the larvae stages into the pupa stage. Here we look at the effects of the hormone on the caterpillar’s growth in terms of its length and weight. We expected to find that the treatment group would grow to be longer and gain more weight as the caterpillars remained in the 4th instar larva. However, our data showed no significent difference in the change in length or weight of the caterpillars in each of the groups from day 0 to day 12. This suggests that the growth of the caterpillar follows a regular pattern even when the caterpillar is given excess juvenile hormone and prevented from making the appropriate transition into the next phase of its life cycle.

Introduction:
The insect life cycle is regulated by interactions between several hormones known as insect growth regulators (IGRs). The hormones Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH), Juvenile Hormone (JH), and 20-Ecdysterone (20E) play essential roles as IGRs in the life cycle of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. The four stages of a typical life cycle of the Manduca sexta are egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. If the balance among the regulating hormones is changed, the insect will not be able to make a healthy transformation through the stages of its life cycle. Particularly, exposing the caterpillar to excess levels of juvenile hormone will affect its life cycle because consistently high levels of JH will not allow the organism to recognize the commitment pulse, a slight increase in the caterpillar’s natural level of JH, that stimulates transition into the 5th and final instar larva [Johnson : 2018]. Increased levels of JH have also been found to delay the onset of pupation in Leptinotarsa deceMlineata [Koopmanschap : 1989] , causing the insect to become “stuck” in the larvae stages. Thus, increasing the levels of JH in Manduca sexta would delay or prevent pupation, causing the caterpillar to continue growing in weight and length when the controll caterpillars begin pupating.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing about 1 to 2g and 3-5cm long were divided into two groups of four. Each group was given a different diet. The controll group was given standard food mixed with 1 drop of water per gram of food. The treatment group was given food mixed with 1 drop of Precor 1: 1250 JH/2g of food. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 25 degrees Celsius on a 12-hour light / 12-hour dark cycle. The caterpillars’ weights and lengths were recorded daily for 12 days and the caterpillars were fed as necessary (about once every other day). The mean difference between weight and length at days 0 and 12 was calculated for the treatment and controll groups and a two-sample t test was used to compare these means, with the null hypothesis that the difference in the mean weights and lengths of the controll and treatment groups would be zero. 

Results:
The mean overall difference in weight (day 12 – day 0) was 6.46g +/- 1.46g for the controll group and 8.575g +/- 1.32g for the treatment group (Fig. 1). The mean overall difference in length (day 12 – day 0) was 3.4cm +/- 1.29cm for the controll group and 4.25cm +/- 1.24cm for the treatment group (Fig. 2). We used a two-sample t test to analyze the results. The treatment caterpillars were generally larger than the controll caterpillars, but the difference in weight change between the two groups was not statistically significent at α = .05 (t = 2.149, d.f. = 5.940, p = .0757). The difference in length was also not statistically significent at the same α level (t = .95, d.f. = 5.990, p = .378). By the end of the experiment, some of the controll Manduca sexta were turning brown and developing a harder outside shell as they began to pupate, whereas the treatment group remained bright green.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the Manduca sexta would continue growing while they were “stuck” in the 4th instar larva was not supported. In fact, some of the caterpillars in the treatment group even started to lose weight around day 8. We observed no significent difference in the change in weights or lengths of the caterpillars at the .05 level, suggesting that while Juvenile Hormone affects the life cycle of the Manduca sexta, it does not impact their growth. The effects of excess JH on the insect life cycle have also been shown in the delay of pupation in the Leptinotarsa deceMlineata in the presence of consistently high levels of JH [Koopmanschap : 1989]. Normally, pupation is triggered by the commitment pulse, which is a slight increase in the level of JH in the insect, but when the level of JH is kept above the commitment pulse, the insect is unable to detect the slight increase in its production of the hormone. Throughout the majority of the larvae phase, the Manduca sexta weight and length increase, but then decrease slightly at the end of the larvae stage as the caterpillar prepares for pupation. Although the caterpillars that received excess JH could not detect when to transition into the pupa phase, they still followed the same growth pattern (in terms of length and weight) as the controll caterpillars that were able to detect their commitment pulse. Understanding how various hormones affect the insect life cycle could help develop method of pest controll that are less harmful to the surrounding environment.
