Title:  Martins IGR Showed Minimal to Insignificent Effects on Growth of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta was chosen for this study due to its identifiable visual contrast between larva and pupa stages, as well as a relatively short and observable lifespan. The objective was to evaluate how Martins IGR affects growth in caterpillars. If Manduca sexta are fed a normal diet with additional drops of Martins IGR, then they will be longer and heavier compared to those fed a standard diet. Each Manduca received the same food, with drops of Martins IGR added to the experimental and drops of water added to the controll. Every day, for 2 weeks, weight and length were recorded. After analyzing the data for both weight and length of the caterpillars, there was no statistically significent difference between the controll group and experimental group. The one-tailed p_value for length was 0.123 and 0.488 for weight. Thus, the alternative hypothesis for this experiment was rejected. However, this does not necessarily indicate that the Martins IGR had no effect on Manudca sexta. A possible source of error is that the time frame was not long enough for the caterpillars to pupate, thus we did not see the effects of continued JH production in the experimental groups.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect with a larval stage that typically last 13-18 days when raised in constant laboratory conditions [Johnson: 2018]. At the end of this stage the larva stops eating and begins to pupate. This organism was chosen due to its identifiable visual contrast between larva and pupa stages, as well as a relatively short and observable lifespan. The Manduca will almost go through the full extent of their larva stage in the duration of the experiment. Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone that promotes growth in a larva but also inhibits other hormones from initiating the pupa stage; when JH levels decrease it allows the halting of growth and beginning of pupation [Nijhout: 2006]. Specifically, JH inhibits the secretion of ecdysterone (20E) , since 20E is only activated once there is no JH left in the hemolymph. This hormone signals the caterpillar to stop eating and begin the early stages of pupation [Nijhout: 2006]. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are synthetic chemicals that interfere with the life cycles of various insects by affecting hormones (such as JH), and can cause infertility, low egg hatch rates, and failure to mature. It is hypothesized that if Manduca sexta are fed a normal diet with additional drops of Martins IGR, then they will be longer and heavier compared to those fed a standard diet. 

Materials and Method:
The caterpillars were randoMly divided into two equal groups of 4 and placed into separate rearing containers, one controll and one experimental. It is important that breathing holes are poked into each compartment to avoid suffocation the specimen. A special tool was used to support the container structure while holes were poked, so that the containers did not bend or break. The caterpillars were stored in an incubation fridge. Each Manduca received 10 grams of food in ball form, with 5 drops of Martins IGR added to the experimental and 5 drops of water added to the controll. Drops were added to food balls using standard pipettes. Every day, for 2 weeks, weight(g) and length(mm) were recorded. An electronic scale and cm ruler were used. Caterpillars were all fully stretched at time of measuring length by manually uncurling and elongating their bodies. Food was replaced and containers were cleaned about every 1-2 days during a recording session, as to maintain the same living conditions for each caterpillar. A one-tailed T-test was then used to analyze the controll versus experimental data. The statistical test determined whether there was a significent difference in data between the two groups.

Results:
After analyzing the data for both weight and length of the caterpillars, there was no statistically significent difference between the controll group and experimental group. The general trends seen were that controll and experimental groups increased in weight and length over time. Experimental length was greater than controll until around day 11, yet at the same time each groups’ standard deviation overlapped for much of the study (Fig.1). The only other noticeable trend was that at day 12 the experimental group began to slightly decrease in weight until the end (Fig.2). Despite these trends, there was no statically significent difference in mean weight of the groups (t_stat=0.03, d.f.=28, P=0.488). For mean length, there was also no statically significent difference between both groups (t_stat=1.18, d.f.=28, P=0.123). A p_value of &lt;0.05 denotes a statistically significent difference between two data sets, and ours were much greater. 

Discussion:
Our results showed that, over the 15-day period, no statistically significent difference was shown between both the weight and length of controll and experimental groups. Thus, the alternative hypothesis for this experiment was rejected. However, this does not necessarily indicate that the Martins IGR had no effect on Manudca sexta. A possible source of error is that the time frame was not long enough for the caterpillars to pupate, thus we did not see the effects of continued JH production in the experimental groups [Johnson: 2018]. If the controll groups had begun to pupate we would have seen their growth stop, while in theory the experimental group would keep growing [Nijhout: 2006]. This could possibly shift our weight and length data to show a significent difference in the last few days. The original hypothesis insinuated that the Martins IGR would increase the caterpillars’ growth so that they would be larger than the controll. This is incorrect since JH production after the critical weight is reached only inhibits the transition to a pupa, it does not necessarily force the caterpillar to grow exponentially [Nijhout: 2006]. If the experiment were lengthened to evaluate Martins IGR’s effect on pupation, then useful information on preventing Manduca sexta maturation could be gathered. This information would be beneficially in determining if Martins is an effective pesticide by causing failure to mature in insects. The next step in this study would be to examine other insect species with similar life cycles. The broader implications of this study are that this mechanism is similar to other insects, if Martins IGR prevents pupation in other insects it could become a very widely used pesticide. It could also provide a pathway for more environmentally safe pesticides if further research is done.
