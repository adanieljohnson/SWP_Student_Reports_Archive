Title: The effect of high temperature on spinach photosynthetic rate

Abstract:
Photosynthesis, acts as the lifeline for most plants in the world, plays crucial role in energy production. Therefore, it is important for us to understand the role of photosynthesis and how it functions inside plant cells. In this experiment, we would focus mainly on monitoring photosynthetic rate through DCIP as alternative electron acceptors. As DCIP reduction leads to color change, we are able to measure the activity of Hill reaction, thus we are able to estimate the rate of photosynthesis in spinach chloroplasts. Our hypothesis is that spinach chloroplast will have a largest decrease in absorbance at room temperature (21.7 oC) compared with 30 oC and 45 oC environments. By filtration and centrifugation, we are able to extract spinach chloroplasts from the leaves. And we add substrate solution with DCIP indicator into the chloroplasts solution to allow reaction to happen. Spectrophotometer is used to examine the absorbance of samples under different temperature environment (21.7 oC, 30 oC, 45 oC) with same light condition with 15 minute interval. The resulting data (p values: p1=0.000021 (15oC), p2=0.001151 (30 oC), p3=0.021 (45oC), p4=0.038 (60 oC).) suggests solution with chloroplasts under 45 oC environment heated for 15 minutes has the largest percentage change of 86.5%. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis, acts as the lifeline for most plants in the world, plays crucial role in energy production. Therefore, it is important for us to understand the role of photosynthesis and how it functions inside plant cells. As a complex process, photosynthesis happens in multiple steps. Totally three stages happen in photosynthesis, light-dependent reaction, light-independent reaction, and oxidation. The first two stages, light-dependent reactions use absorbed photons of two different wavelengths to generate reducing power in the form of NADPH. The light-independent reactions, also known as Calvin cycle, use ATP and NADPH to create 6 carbon complexes. Temperature influences leaf photosynthetic rates in both short and long‐terms. In the long term, a shift in growth temperature causes a shift in the optimum temperature of leaf photosynthesis, which allows the plants to perform more efficient photosynthesis at their new growth temperature [Berry & Björkman 1980].

For this experiment, we will use DCIP as our alternative electron acceptors that are easier to measure than the production of oxygen. By measuring the activity of this Hill reaction, we are able to estimate the rate of photosynthesis in spinach chloroplasts. DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) also acts as color indicator since oxidized DCIP is a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light at 600 nm, while reduced DCIPH2 reorganizes the bonds to conjugated double carbon bonds, making the molecule colorless (represented as decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm), so that our experiment could be monitored by spectrophotometer at 600 nm.

Our hypothesis is that spinach chloroplast will have a largest decrease in absorbance (highest efficiency) at room temperature (21.7 oC) compared with 30 oC and 45 oC environments.


Materials and Methods:
Part 1:
Pack a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 ml size), and 3, 50 ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle are cooling, remove the large central veins from 6 medium-sized spinach leaves. Throw away the veins, and rinse the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. Blot off any excess moisture from the leaves. When the mortar and pestle are cold, wipe them dry, then add the spinach leaves. Add 15 ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Grind the spinach until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. Add an additional 15 ml of grinding buffer, mix with the spinach slurry and wait 3 minutes for buffer to wash out chloroplasts. Strain the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Transfer the remaining green liquid to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spin it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC. Be sure to include a balance tube in the centrifuge. Pour the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube. Leave the pellet of debris at the bottom of tube “A”.
We will be using sample A in part 2

Part 2:
Label 19 test tubes as shown below, and place them in a tube rack. Turn on the spectrophotometer, and set it to read at 600nm. Prepare 5 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes except bank and no chloroplast. Note that you only need to make one replicate of the blank.

Begin the assay: add 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts you prepared in Part one to the blank tube, and to Tubes #4-18. Mix each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts. Transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. blank the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using blank. Then immediately measure the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm. These are your Time Zero data points. Place samples blank/ #1-8 at room temperature, #9-13 in an 30 degrees celsius warm water bath, and #14-18 in a 45 degrees celsius warm water bath. After 15 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer with blank. Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. After recording absorbance, be SURE to put the samples back in their respective temperatures. After 15 more minutes (30 minutes total) blank the spectrophotometer. Then measure the absorbances a second time for each sample. After another 15 minutes (45 minutes total) blank the spectrophotometer and measure absorbances one more time for all samples. After another 15 min (60 total) blank the spectrophotometer and measure absorbance. Record the results.  Check for significance using ANOVA.


Results:
Observed from Figure 1,, heat-treated samples all have reduced absorbance comparing with time zero samples. Among all samples, solution with chloroplasts under 45 oC environment heated for 15 minutes has the largest percentage change of 86.5%, chloroplasts treated under room temperature (21.7 oC) has a change of 59.3% ~ 38.0%, chloroplasts under 30 oC environment has a change of 72.1% ~ 56.8%, and chloroplasts treated with 45 oC heat bath has a change of 86.5% ~ 53.3%. Running ANOVA tests on each temperature condition separately, and we got the following p values: p1=0.000021 (15oC), p2=0.001151 (30 oC), p3=0.021 (45oC), p4=0.038 (60 oC).

Discussion:
According to the data and the ANOVA tests, the data is significant enough, suggesting that different temperature environments lead to different chloroplasts activity is supported. However, our hypothesis that room temperature environment produces the largest chloroplasts activity isn’t supported by the data. From Figure 1, we could assume that comparing with room temperature environment (21.7 oC), heating environment (30 oC and 45 oC) would increase the chloroplasts activity, thus increases the photosynthetic rate. As suggested by Figure 1, 45 oC environment would produce the largest percentage change in the first 60 minutes compared with those of 21.7 oC and 30 oC environments. This finding is contradicted with the article which suggests temperature above 36 oC for 2 minutes would irreversibly inactivate Hill reaction in barley chloroplasts [Nolan:1976]. Such situation occurred may be explained by following reasons. Firstly, our experiment use water bath as heating tool, apart from the volume of chloroplast solutions, we also treated these samples with ice before experiment. Therefore, the heating of the solution may spend more time than we expected, and the actual temperature of solution may be lower than the recorded 21.7 oC, 30 oC, and 45 oC during the experiment. Secondly, in this experiment we use spinach leaves instead of barley leaves as source of chloroplasts. Different plant species may have different optimal photosynthesis temperature and that may explain why the optimal temperature we found is higher than recorded in Nolan’s article. Thirdly, if we took closer look at the trends in Figure 1 we could find that room temperature chloroplasts have a concave down parabola trend, 30 oC chloroplasts have a mild decreasing trend in absorbance as time passes, and 45 oC chloroplasts have an increasing absorbance from 15 minutes to 60 minutes suggesting that a decrease in Hill reaction is happening. Such situation may be explained by the article saying that high temperature would reduce the Hill reaction activity. As a result, our 45 oC chloroplasts may undergo irreversible cell destructions as experiment continues. According to the article [Yamori, Noguchi, & Terashima :2005], long term temperature change could alter the optimal photosynthetic temperature for spinach. Therefore, longer experiment may show different trends (as one article uses 6 hours to heat the chloroplasts). The experiment may be improved by conducting experiments with a larger sample population and experiment for longer time period for more informative trend.
