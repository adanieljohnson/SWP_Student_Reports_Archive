Title: The Effects of Growth Hormones and Temperaure on the Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The biggest factors in the growth of the Manduca sexta are Insect Growth Regulators (IGR), such as Precor. In our experiment we predicted that the caterpillars that were given the hormones would grow at a slower rate than the controlls. To test this experiment and hypothesis, both hormones were administered to different test subjects for 13 days to assess the growth of the caterpillars. Our results showed that the caterpillars who were given excess IGR and Precor had a smaller average growth than those who didn’t. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a holometabolous insect more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. Holometabolous organisms have four stages of life: the egg, larva, pupa, and adult stage. In the transition from larva to adult, the two hormones that trigger this change are Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone (JH). In earlier larvae instar stages Juvenile hormone exists in high concentrations while  Ecdysterone is present at lower concentrations. However, at the time of the commitment pulse,  Ecdysterone spikes while Juvenile hormone exists in low concentrations.. This allows the Manduca sexta to begin pupation. The growth hormones that were administered are growth inhibitors, as they mimic the effects of JH, causing the prevention of pupation. According to the National Pesticide Information Center, the hormones can cause the larvae to “stay in this juvenile stage until they die” (“Insect Growth Regulators”). Our hypothesis is, therefore, that the presence of excess IGRs will result in a decreased average growth in our experimental group when compared with the controll. 


Materials and Method:
We first began by setting up our enclosures. We took two, four-chambered, plastic containers and poked two breathing holes in each cell using the appropriate poking tool. We then labeled each cell with numbers 1-8. Afterward we weighed out 10 grams of food for each of the caterpillars in the controll group. We repeated that step for the experimental group, adding 10 drops of precor hormone to 2 cells and 10 drops of an IGR labeled “1G Regulator” to the remaining 2. Then, we took the masses of each caterpillar and placed them in their respective cell. We then returned for 14 days, recording their masses, listing any observations, and refeeding them as necessary. On days 7-14 we kept the feeding technique the same, but places the caterpillars in a 32 degree Celsius incubator instead of the standard 25 degree Celsius incubator to examine the effects of temperature on the growth of the Manduca sexta. Once all data was collected we averaged the growth for both the experimental and controll groups and ran a 2-sample t_test comparing them.

Results:
There were no caterpillars that began to pupate. Only subjects 4 (1G Regulator), 5 (controll), and 7 (controll) survived to the end of the experiment. All groups were active, with the IGR treated groups growing less and being slightly more inactive. 


In these figures you can see the average growth for both the experimental and controll groups. Error bars are based off the standard deviations of respective groups.

Discussion:
From the data collected we can gather that the effect of excess IGRs are that it prevents pupation and decreases the growth of Manduca sexta.. The statistical test show that that P-value is above .01, which is a reasonable number at which to fail to reject the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis. You can also see in the data itself that the average growth was lower in the experimental groups than the controll group because it received excess IGRs, causing the caterpillar to not pupate. To further this research it would be interesting to start giving the groups Juvenile Hormone to see if their growth would advance. Tempurature had no discernable effect on the growth of Manduca sexta, as the data from every day in the temperature experiment shows the same rate of growth before and after the effect of temperature.
