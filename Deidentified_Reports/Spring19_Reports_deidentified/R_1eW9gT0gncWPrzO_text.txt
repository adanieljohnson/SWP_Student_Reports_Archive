Title: Effects of Gentrol on Growth and Development in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, or, M. sexta, is commonly known as the Tobacco hornworm as it feed on the leaves of a tobacco plant during its larvae stage, making it a pest to tobacco farmers. This would therefore make M. sexta a pest during its youth. It could then be expected that treating it with a hormone that could affect its growth and development, in this case, gentrol, could be a good way to regulate its presence in tobacco fields. Gentrol acts as a mimic of a hormone whose decrease is imperative to the caterpillar metamorphizing, juvenile hormone (JH).  Therefore, when treated with gentrol, the internal environment of the caterpillar will be under the impression that it is continuously being flushed with gentrol. It was found that this treatment increased both the weight and the lengths of the caterpillars drastically when compared to the weight and lengths of the control group. These differences had p-values, 1.46*〖10〗^(-7) and .004599, that were evaluated as statistically significant, therefore supporting the idea that gentrol would affect the growth and development of these caterpillars.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, or as it will be referred to in the rest of this paper, M. sexta, is commonly known as the Tobacco hornworm as it feed on the leaves of a tobacco plant during its larvae stage. The hormonal mechanisms responsible for the growth of the caterpillar are reliant on a form of energy known as NADPH, which is obtained through the leaves of the tobacco plant. [Vandock: 2013] This is imperative for the function and survival of the caterpillar as the NADPH-reliant hormone, 20-monooxygenase (20-ME) is responsible for the conversion to the molting hormone, 20-ecdysone (20-E) [Vandock: 2013] which in turn fuels the process of pupation.  After M. sexta undergoes metamorphosis, it transitions to a Carolina Sphinx moth. However, in order to undergo this process of metamorphosis, the caterpillar’s internal environment must change. One of these changes includes regulation of the growth and development hormones, 20E, and the juvenile hormone, or JH. [Johnson: 2019] In specific, JH and 20E work together to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the caterpillar [Johnson: 2019]; therefore, it is plausible that when altering the concentration of one or treating the caterpillars with another hormone, the caterpillar’s rates of molting, growing, and metamorphizing may be altered. For this experiment, M. sexta has been treated with gentrol, a mimic of JH, by adding it to their food. This comes to raise numerous questions about the effects gentrol will have on M. sexta’s growth and development: Will gentrol increase the length of the caterpillars over time? Will gentrol increase the weight of the caterpillars over time? Will gentrol allow the caterpillars to molt on their normative biological schedule? This last question refers to the necessity for JH levels to drop before pupation, [Johnson, 2019] and therefore metamorphosis, occurs, but if treated with a mimic of the JH hormone, this drop in hormone levels may not be achievable. In response to these questions, it is plausible to assume that the gentrol treatment will allow the caterpillars to exhibit a property of indeterminant growth, or they will continue to grow larger and larger throughout this experiment without reaching pupation. The purpose of this experiment is to analyze the effects of gentrol, the independent variable, on the growth and development, the dependent variable, of M. sexta.  

Materials and Methods:
We weighed and measured eight M. sexta larvae using a scale (in g) and ruler (in mm) and record. Next, using two containers with four compartments in each, we punched holes using the hole punching tool so that there are two in each compartment. We then, placed the caterpillars in their respective compartment so that there is one caterpillar per compartment. Next, we numbered the outside of the containers using numbers that correspond to those used when recording weight and length. Then, we measured out 80 g total of caterpillar food. Using an empty Tupperware container, we placed the food in and added a total of 48 drops of gentrol using a transfer pipet. For clarification, this will end up being 10 g of food with 6 drops of gentrol per caterpillar. We combined the gentrol and food until the mixture is seemingly homogenous; it was noted that the mixture should be solid and smooth. We then measured out 10 g of the mixture and placed it in each compartment until every caterpillar had food. We resealed the containers and placed caterpillars in the incubator. We went on to check the caterpillars daily to ensure they have enough food for the week and that their compartment is relatively clean. After each week the caterpillars will be re-weighed and re-measured and these measurements will be recorded. This was carried out for two weeks total. Upon termination of the experiment, we compared the treatment group to the control group by formation of table and graphs. Finally, we used a two-sampled t-test in order to determine if the null hypothesis (gentrol has no effects what-so-ever on the growth and development of M. sexta) was accepted or rejected. 

Results:
After the total two weeks it was found that the gentrol had a statistically significant effect on the growth and development of M. sexta. The averages of the weights for the gentrol treatments was 9.16875 while the control was 5.22375 (Figure 1). Once a t-test was run on these data, the resulting p-value was 1.46*〖10〗^(-7) (Figure 1). This is much smaller than .05, therefore, these results were determined to be statistically significant. The averages of the lengths for the gentrol treatments was 45.625 while the control was 27.625 (Figure 2). The p-value for these data was .004599 (Figure 2), which is not as small as that of the weights, but it is still smaller than .05 so therefore, it is statically significant. These data are also shown in the graphs below. The caterpillars also had not reached pupation by the determination of the experiment. 

Discussion:
Statistically significant differences were observed in weights and lengths between the control group and the gentrol treatment; therefore, it can be deduced that the null hypothesis was rejected, and the alternate hypothesis was supported. This is a result of the function of gentrol once it became a part of the internal environment of the caterpillar. As mentioned before, gentrol is a mimic of the JH hormone in M. sexta, therefore, by imitating JH, developmental issues will occur in the caterpillar’s adult growth stages. [Goodman, et al.: 2012] In fact, when treated with gentrol, these issues are observed across many species of arthropods. Bed bugs, for example, the common house hold pest, when treated with high doses of gentrol showed impaired development into and throughout their adult life. [Goodman, et al.: 2012] These two experiments when combined could lead one to wonder if there is a prime stage in which to treat the particular pest with gentrol, or an optimal dosage so as to maximize its effects. This could be carried out by either dividing different concentrations of gentrol among a group of larvae of M. sexta. Also, to carry out the second experiment, groups of larvae at each instar could be obtained and treated with a consistent gentrol concentration, as was done in this experiment in order to identify if there is an optimum time for treatment. If either one of these experiments were run this would give more insight to the optimal treatment of caterpillars with gentrol. This would be important to know because M. sexta are pests during their youth as they feed on the leaves of a tobacco plant. If more was known about the effects of gentrol on development, the most effective way to treat these pests could be found.
