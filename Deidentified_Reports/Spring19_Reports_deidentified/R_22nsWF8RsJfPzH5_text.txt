Title: Effects of Green, Red, and White light on Spinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
Spinacia Oleracea rely on light to power photosynthesis and keep them alive. Different colors emit longer or shorter wavelengths that may be absorbed differently and effect photosynthetic rates. Red light has been found to increase photosynthetic activity in green plants, while green light has been found to decrease photosynthetic activity in green plants, as compared to white light. Chloroplast were isolated from Spinacia Oleracea leaves through centrifuging, and assigned to one of the experimental groups. DCIP was be used as an indicator, and absorbances of the solution were taken in 10 minute intervals for 30 minutes. The results found that red light had the largest change in photosynthetic activity as predicted, but green light had a larger change than white light. These results were not significant, but may be explained through differences in light intensity and wavelength. This experiment could be redone with more controlled lightbulbs and environments. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process that makes virtually all life on earth possible. Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts where both light dependent and light independent reactions occur. Both are crucial in the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The light reactions start at Photosystem II where light excites an electron and produces Oxygen gas. This electron is passed down to other carrier proteins, creating a proton gradient, and is eventually passed on to Photosystem I. Here NADPH and ATP are produced, both of which are crucial inputs to the light independent reactions, where glucose is formed. Without light, the plant is unable to produce sufficient amounts of Oxygen gas, NADPH, and ATP from the light dependent reactions, and cannot efficiently conduct photosynthesis. Green plants contain chlorophyll, a pigment that has been found to reflect green light, giving plants their characteristic green color. Photosynthesis in plants can be tested using a centrifuge to separate the chloroplasts from other debris and adding DCIP to the solution. DCIP is a dark blue substance that turns colorless when it is reduced to DCIPH2, which occurs during photosynthesis. In a study done by Chih-Yu, Chun-Chong, and Yung-Chuan, they found that Red LED was the most efficient light required for photosynthesis in S. plantensis. Blue LED reported the lowest growth rate, and therefore can be inferred that it had a low rate of photosynthesis as well [Wang: 2007]. Alternatively, as study done by Muner, Kim, Park, and Lee found that exposing green plants to green LED caused them to have decreased biomass suggesting less photosynthetic activity [Muneer: 2014] Our experiment adjusts these experiments by testing whether red, white, or green light increases photosynthetic rates the most. We predict that chloroplast solutions under red light will have the highest photosynthetic rates, while white light will produce slightly lower rates, and green light will produce the lowest rates of photosynthesis. 

Materials and Methods:
First, put the mortar and pestle, medium beaker, and three 50 mL centrifuge tubes in ice. Remove the veins from four spinach leaves and rinse them thoroughly with water. Add leaves to the mortar and pestle and add 10 mL of grinding buffer. Grind spinach until it turns into a paste. Add 10 more mL of grinding buffer and strain the solution created with a cheesecloth into the beaker. Next, put the leftover liquid in a 50 mL tube “A” and spin at 200 G for three minutes at 4℃. Pour the supernatant into a 50 mL centrifuge tube labeled “B”. Centrifuge “B” at 1000 G for ten minutes at 4℃. Pour the supernatant into a beaker and be careful not to disturb the pellet at the bottom. Then, add 20 more mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and gently stir it in order to suspend it. Label and prepare 10 test tubes, 9 containing 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCIP, and 2 mL of buffer, and 1 containing all the same except for DCIP. When you are ready to begin recording absorbances add 100 µL of chloroplast solution from “B”. Take and record initial absorbances and then place the cuvette in the drawer with the appropriate light. 3 should go in red, green, and white. Continue to take absorbances every 10 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. Finally, once you have recorded your scores, calculate the percent change between each one. The final scores should be analyzed through an anova test to determine significance.

Results:
All chloroplast extracts tested in green, red, and white lights showed an increase in overall photosynthetic activity, as shown in figure 1, although their percent increases varied. Red light was shown to increase the most overall. Green light increased photosynthesis the second most overall, and white light increased the least. The results were not found to be significant (p = .418). 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment indicated that variations in wavelength do not significantly affect rates of photosynthesis, as measured by absorption. Our results suggested that red and green light both increased photosynthetic activity in S. Oleracea more than white light. Although these results were insignificant, they still went against our initial prediction. Photosynthesis can only occur if the chloroplast are able to absorb light and activate Photosystem II. Due to S. Oleracea leaves’ green appearance, it was assumed that they were reflecting green light back and absorbing other wavelengths. However, research done by Johkan, Shoji, Goto, Hahida, and Yoshihara found that high-intensity green LED light and short-wavelength green light both promoted growth in lettuce leaves [Johkan: 2012]. This research may explain why the plants exposed only to green light still had such high photosynthetic rates. The light bulb we used to produce green light was simply a white bulb with green film over it. We had no control over the intensity or the wavelength. The wavelengths emitted from this bulb may have been the correct wavelengths of green light that chloroplast can absorb and efficiently use in photosynthesis. Additionally, this same experiment found that higher intensity light was also related to an increase in photosynthetic activity [Johkan: 2012]. The white light bulb used in our experiment was later found to only be a 20 Watt bulb while the green and red bulbs were 120 Watts. This may explain the low change in photosynthetic activity of the plants exposed to white light, as the white light was only about 16% as strong as the other two lights. The light emitted from the white light may not have been strong enough to fully penetrate the sample, causing the unexpectedly low photosynthetic rate.  This experiment should be redone using a method that can better predict the wavelength of the lights being emitted. It should be done in a controlled setting using different colored bulbs all with the same watts at the same distance away from the samples. This continuation would allow more accurate and precise results.
