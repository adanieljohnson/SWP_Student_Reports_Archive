Title: Resource Allocation in Vigna Radiata Under Differing Light Conditions

Abstract:
The use of red light on plants has been shown to facilitate photosynthesis due to its long wavelengths. When a plant’s resources are limited, resources such as sufficient light for growth, plants must allocate their resources in order to utilize the present conditions efficiently. In this study, differing forms of light, red light and regular sunlight, affected the resource allocation of the plant Vigna radiata. One controll group only received sunlight to grow for two weeks, while the other experimental group received only red light. The root: shoot weight ratio and shoot length were recorded and statistical analysis was calculated using a two sample T-Test for each of the measurements. The first two sample T-Test (root: shoot weight ratio) revealed that there was insignificent statistical significance between the groups, while the other (shoot and root length) revealed that they were in fact statically significance. Although the results partially do not suggest this, Vigna radiata should be allocating their resources under red light to make their shoots longer due to a lack of regular sunlight. 

Introduction:
Resource Allocation is observed in plants when biotic or abiotic stressors threaten the survival of the plant in their environment. Plants thus allocate their resources as a strategy to gain tolerance to such stressors. Resource limitations affect the number and type of species present in a community, and also inhibit natural selection from occurring, as one species cannot outgrow all the others when taking resources requires the spending of them too. Plant species, in response to these challenges, have learned to allocate their resources and sacrifice certain desired traits. Resource allocation patterns can be seen through the size and length of leaves, roots and stem of a plant. When plants are exposed to red light, photosynthesis can be aided as red lights emits the longest wavelengths out any colored light [Bayat: 2018]. The species being used in this experiment, known as Vigna radiata (Mung beans), is a legume originating from East and Southeast Asia. Vigna radiata grow at a relatively rapid rate and mature early, enabling them to be effective plants to study allometry with [Lema: 2018]. 

In this study, the issue as to which type of light, normal sunlight or red light, allows for optimal growth of Vigna radiata’s leaves, stem and root. We are testing to see if red light allows for optimal growth of the leaves, stem and root or if regular sunlight does. This study is relevant because it will further explain the resource allocation processes of plants in relation to light exposure and light color. The experimental group will have lower root: shoot ratios than the controll group because the red light of the experimental group will not allow for the optimal growth of root and shoots compared to the sunlight of the controll group. 

Materials and Method:
We planted a total of 6 plots of Vigna radiata beginning by filling each plot halfway with soil. The soil was then generously wetted. A substantial amount of Vigna radiata seeds were planted in each and the plots were transported to the greenhouse. In the greenhouse, three plots were positioned to be facing the sunlight, while the other three plots were placed under a red-light tarp that was held up by three sticks. Three of the plots were designated as the controll group, which would receive sunlight, and the last three plots were designated as the experimental group, which would receive red light. The independent variable was the type of light the plants were receiving (either regular sunlight or red light) and the dependent variable is the weight and length of the replicate, root and shoot. The plants were monitored and watered 200 Ml each for a total of two weeks. After the end of the two weeks, the controll group and experimental group plots were removed from the greenhouse to be examined. To obtain individual replicates, the entire plot was placed in a tub of water to loosen the soil. Individual replicates were carefully removed in order to ensure that no roots or shoots were broken off. Individual replicates were chosen at random. For each of the three conditions, 16 replicates were chosen, 8 from each plot (N=16 replicate samples total). Each replicate was dried thoroughly and weighed in grams as a whole. Then, each replicate was carefully cut at the root-shoot junction and the roots and shoots were weighed separately. The roots and shoots of each replicate were also measured in centimeters. The root to shoot weight ratio, shoot and root length of the controll group and the experimental group were recorded, analyzed and compared through a conducting multiple two sample T-Tests. 

Results:
The average Root: Shoot weight ratio was higher for the experimental group (0.96 g) than the controll group (0.57 g). As seen in Figure 1, the average root: shoot height ratio was higher for the controll group (0.81 cm), while the experimental group was lower (0.77 cm). The P-value of the root: shoot length ratio was 0.444974. As seen in Figure 2, the average maximum root length for the controll group was 8.0875 cm and 10.8875 cm for the experimental group. The P-value for the root length was thus 0.100294. As seen in Figure 3, the average maximum shoot length for the controll group was 11.23 cm and 14.3 cm for the experimental group. The P-value for the shoot length was 0.047628. The degrees of freedom for the root: shoot ration was 14, and the degrees of freedom for the root and shoot length were 14 as well. 

Discussion:
Our results revealed that our hypothesis was not supported. In the first two sample T-Test, the P-value of the root: shoot length ratio has not statistically significance. The ratio should be smaller in the experimental group as they are receiving less sunlight than the controll group and thus want to allocate their resources into extending their shoot to be closer the sun. On the contrary, the P-value of the average shoot length did provide statistical evidence to support alternative hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis. This proves, unlike the root: shoot length ratio, that the shoot length recorded had enough significance to partially support out hypothesis. This is also the case for the average root length, as the P-value had statistical significance as well. The shoot and root lengths of the experimental group were higher than the lengths of the controll group. This suggests that Vigna radiata allocated their resources in the form of shoot and root length to reach as much sunlight as possible. Plants allocate their resources to the organ that will most aid in their survival and reproduction [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, for instance, the plant allocates resources towards its shoots (stems and leaves) to expend energy on growth and reproduction rather than the collection of nutrients from the soil [Johnson: 2018]. 

According a study conducted on the effects of light on seed germination of Vigna radiata, differing wavelengths of light, especially longer wavelengths, incite strong root growth and accelerated photosynthesis for seedlings.  [Patel: 2018]. These findings, similar to our own, suggest an alternative reason as to why shoot and root length in the experimental group were longer than those in the controll group. Red light aids in the process of photosynthesis, so seed germination can occur at a faster rate in plants under this type of light compared to plants under regular sunlight due to wavelengths.  

For future experiments, a greater number of replicates from each plot could be collected in order to gather a larger pool of data and stabilize for outliers. Another similar experiment to this one could analyze root: shoot weight and length ratios of Vigna radiata under differing light conditions such blue or yellow light and see how each plant responds to these differing abiotic factors through resource allocation.
