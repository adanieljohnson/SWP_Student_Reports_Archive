Title: Effects of Acidity and Alkalinity on Resource Allocation in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity refers to the way plants allocate resources due to changing environmental conditions. Generally, optimal plant growth is observed under “standard conditions” (pH 7.0) where less resources need to be allocated to the root systems. It is hypothesized, if Vigna radiata are nourished with water of pH concentration 7.0, then they will have smaller average root-to-shoot length and weight ratios, as opposed to Vigna radiata that are grown with water of acidic or alkaline pH concentrations. Three groups of five Vigna radiata plants were identically prepared, and, for two weeks, routinely nourished with water of varying pH concentrations (pH 3.5, pH 7.0, and pH 8.5). After the maturation period, each subject was harvested, measured, and analyzed. Vigna radiata that were nourished with water of pH concentration 7.0 yielded the smallest average root-to-shoot length and weight ratios. Two statistically insignificant ANOVA results, evaluating the average root-to-shoot length and weight ratios, suggested that varying environmental pH conditions have no effect on resource allocation of Vigna radiata.

Introduction:
In plants, selective pressures, or environmental factors, may confer a specific pattern of resource allocation. An organism’s ability to adapt in response to environmental changes is referred to as its phenotypic plasticity. High phenotypic plasticity correlates with an ability to survive in a range of varying environments; whereas low phenotypic plasticity correlates with an ability to  survive in one, static environment [Johnson: 2019].
The acidity or alkalinity of a solution is expressed in terms of pH which is measured on a scale of 1.0 (acidic) to 14.0 (alkaline) where 7.0 is neutral [Sadava: 2017]. Most biological processes are dependent on pH; thus, an organism’s ability to regulate and maintain a constant pH that is conducive to life (pH 6.5–7.5) is paramount. Biological buffers, mixtures of weak acids and their conjugate bases, keep pH relatively constant [Nelson: 2017]. However, natural phenomena, such as acid rain, affects an environment’s pH. Environments which deviate from the biological pH reduce a plants’ ability to uptake nutrients and, subsequently, grow. Plants in acidic environments uptake nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium; plants in alkaline environments uptake zinc, iron, and copper. Since uptake of nitrogen is vital, especially to leaf and shoot growth, optimal plant growth is generally observed when plants are cultivated in slightly acidic environments (pH 5.0–6.5) [Bower: 2005].
Vigna radiata, or Mung Beans, utilize a standard root and shoot system which makes them a model organism to study resource allocation. One study suggests that Vigna radiata grow optimally in a pH environment of 7.0 and favors a slightly acidic environment (pH 6.0) over a slightly alkaline environment (pH 8.5). These results affirm that life is sustained at a neutral pH and, regarding plants, has slight favorability for acidic environments [Cheng: 1998]. Therefore, it is hypothesized, Vigna radiata nourished with water of pH concentration 7.0 will grow optimally and, thus, have smaller root-to-shoot ratios.


Materials and Methods:
Fifteen 4 in. x 6 in. trays were filled with soil and 500 mL of Miracle-Gro. In each tray, nine indentation holes were made in the soil, and 2-3 Vigna radiata seeds (soaked in water for 24 hours prior) were placed in each hole. The fifteen plants were separated into three groups (acidic, neutral, and alkaline), labeled, and placed in the greenhouse.
Once a day for two weeks, each replicate was allotted 50 mL of water which was conditioned to the assigned pH concentration (pH 3.5, pH 7.0, or pH 8.5). After maturation, one plant from each tray was randomly selected, separated from the soil, washed, measured (length of roots and length of shoots), and weighed (weight of roots and weight of shoots). The root-to-shoot length ratios were calculated by dividing each plant’s root length by its shoot length then averaging the root-to-shoot ratios within each group. The same method was used to calculate the root-to-shoot weight ratios. After data was collected and condensed, the average root-to-shoot ratios were employed to conduct two ANOVA tests which determined the statistical (in)significance that varying pH environments have on resource allocation of Vigna radiata.


Results:
The relative effect of the three pH environments varied for the average root-to-shoot length ratios (see “Figure 1”) and average root-to-shoot weight ratios (see “Figure 2”). The average root-to-shoot length and weight ratios for the acidic environment (pH 3.5) was 0.713 ± 0.302cm and 0.887 ± 0.547g, respectively. The average root-to-shoot length and weight ratios for the neutral environment (pH 7.0) was 0.583 ± 0.246cm and 0.436 ± 0.153g, respectively. The average root-to-shoot length and weight ratios for the alkaline environment (pH 8.5) was 0.761 ± 0.234cm and 0.742 ± 0.324g, respectively. The rank of the average root-to-shoot length ratios of the three pH environments, from lowest to highest, was neutral, acidic, then alkaline. The rank of the average root-to-shoot weight ratios of the three pH environments, from lowest to highest, was neutral, alkaline, then acidic. 
An ANOVA test for average root-to-shoot length ratios between the three pH environments yielded a p-value of 0.5580. An ANOVA test for average root-to-shoot weight ratios between the three pH environments yielded a p-value of 0.1980. 


Discussion:
Based on the results, it can be concluded that the hypothesis was not supported. Evaluating graphical data, the average root-to-shoot ratios (length and weight) appeared to support the hypothesis since the ratios were lowest for the plants nourished with water of pH concentration 7.0. Although the results appeared to follow a trend, the ANOVA tests yielded statistically insignificant p-values which negated the implication. This suggests that varying environmental pH conditions have no effect on resource allocation of Vigna radiata.
These results oppose current ecological knowledge. Previous studies cite that plants, including Vigna radiata, grow best in acidic, nearing neutral, pH environments [Bower: 2005]. Had these results been statistically significant, an argument could be made that this experiment supported current literatures. In this study, the Vigna radiata favored a neutral environment (pH 7.0) which was closest to the pH environment that was expected to be preferred – slightly acidic. In this study, the acidic environment (pH 3.5) and alkaline environment (pH 8.5) were less favorable for the growth of the Vigna radiata. The Vigna radiata’s aversion to the acidic environment (pH 3.5) is conceivable as it was highly polarized. Additionally, the Vigna radiata’s aversion to the alkaline environment (pH 8.5) reinforces literature [Cheng: 1998]. 
To enhance this research and gain insight into these discrepancies, replicates of Vigna radiata could be nourished with a broader range of water pH concentrations. Specifically, water with a slightly acidic pH concentration (closer to a neutral pH concentration than pH 3.5) could be used to distinguish whether Vigna radiata prefer neutral conditions or dislike highly acidic or alkaline environments. To expand the experiment, Vigna radiata could be measured and weighed at various intervals throughout the maturation period to evaluate the short term versus long term effects of the varying pH environments on resource allocation. Still, this study expands knowledge of phenotypic plasticity which can be applied to optimize conditions for plant growth, and advance agriculture.
