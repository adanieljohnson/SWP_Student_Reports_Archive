Title: Effect of temperature on photosystem II in Spinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
The study was designed to evaluate the effect of the temperature on photosystem II in Spinacia Oleracea. Temperature is one of the environmental factors that can affect the activity of photosystem II and the overall photosynthetic activity. The hypothesis is that if the temperature is at 25 ℃, photosynthesis II will have the most optimal activity. As the temperature increases, photosystem II will decrease. Hill assay was used to measure the reduction activity of photosystem II in three groups, which are positive control (room temperature in light), negative control (room temperature), and experimental group (40℃ in light). Percentage changes in absorbance in the function of time were graphed and a paired t-test was used. The results did not support the hypothesis as there was no statistical difference between the positive control and experimental group. However, the highest photosystem activity was predicted at room temperature as the electron transport worked optimally at room temperature, and the high temperature can block the photosystem II activity. A wider range of temperatures is considered for further study.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process used by plants to convert light energy to chemical energy through light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. Photosystem II is the first protein complex in the light-dependent reactions that capture the energy from sunlight and uses it to extract electrons from water molecules [Barber:2003]. 
Environmental changes can affect the rate of photosynthesis and then affect the primary productivity. Temperature is one of the main environmental factors that can affect the rate of photosynthesis and sudden temperature changes can cause irreversible damage to the photosynthetic apparatus [Öquist:1983]. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of temperature on photosystem II under room temperature and high temperature in spinach (Spinacia Oleracea). Spinach was selected as the study sample because it is suitable for biochemical analyses. And the Hill reaction was used to measure the reduction activity of photosystem II.
A previous study has shown that high temperature around 40℃ can cause serious damage to photosystem, and plants switch photosystem to protect photosystem II [Yamauchi: 2011]. Another study has shown that photosystem II electron transport determined at respective optimum temperatures were the highest in the leaves developed at 27℃ [Yamori:2005] According to these studies, photosynthesis II has an optimum temperature at which it operates, when it exceeds that value, whether lower or higher, it will decrease. It has such a specific optimum because maximum rats of CO2 and electron transport are readily available at this temperature. Therefore, to test the effect of temperature on the activity of photosystem II, three groups of the enriched chloroplast of spinach were tested under different conditions with a blank sample, one group was tested under the room temperature in light as the positive control, the second group was tested under 40℃ and in light, the last group was tested under the room temperature without light as the negative control. 
In this study, the independent variable is the temperature and the dependent variable is the light absorbance recorded I the DCIP decolorization assay. The hypothesis is that if the temperature is at 25 ℃, photosynthesis II will have the most optimal activity. As temperature increases, photosystem II will decrease.


Materials and Methods:
Before the DCIP decolorization assay (Hill assay), centrifugation was used to enrich chloroplasts as the hill reaction works best with a high concentration of chloroplasts. Four medium-sized spinach leaves without veins were rinsed by tap water and blotted off the moisture. Then the leaves were grinned with 10ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) until there were no large chunks of leaves left. Then, the spinach slurry was strained through cheesecloth with another 10ml of grinding buffer into the chilled beaker then to the centrifuge tube A. In the first round of centrifugation, the tube A was span at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4℃. After that, the supernatant was poured out of the tube A to another centrifuge tube B, then span tube B at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4℃. Then the supernatant was poured out of the tube B to another tube. After that, 20 ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet for further use.
After the preparation of the enriched chloroplasts, the next step was the quantification of photosystem II reduction activity with Hill Reaction. Three replicates of reaction mixes were prepared for the three groups with on blank sample in a total of ten test tubes. The blank sample marked as #1 was added by 8mL of water, 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5). The positive control group, negative control group, and the experimental group marked as #2-4, #5-7, and #8-10 were added by 6mL of water, 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM), and 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5). After that 100μl of the enriched chloroplasts prepared before was added to each tube. Then time zero data points were recorded at 600nm by using the black sample at first. The positive control group was placed under the lamp and room temperature, the negative control group was placed in dark and room temperature, while the experimental group was placed in the water bath at 40℃ in light. Then absorbances were recorded every time minutes till thirty minutes. The percentages in absorbance change were calculated for every ten minutes. The percentage change in absorbance equals to the subtraction in absorbance at time zero minus absorbance at the time “N” divided by absorbance at time zero times one hundred percent, and only absolute values were used.
Therefore, the changes in absorbance that imply the activity of photosystem II reduction can be used to test the effect of temperature on photosystem II. The paired t-test was employed for statistical analysis and data interpretation, and three paired t-tests were done between every two groups.


Results:
The average percent change in absorbance for the positive control (room temperature in light) was 1.3%. The average percent change in absorbance for the negative control (room temperature in dark) was 0.4%. And the average percent change in absorbance for the experimental group (40℃ in light) was 4.5%. 
The average standard error for the positive control (room temperature in light) was 0.0041. The average standard error for the negative control (room temperature in dark) was 0.0031. And the average standard error for the experimental group (40℃ in light) was 0.0224.
The p-value was 0.213 when compared the positive control group to the negative control group. The p-value was 0.071 when compared the positive control group to the experimental group. And the p-value was 0.00170 when compared the negative control group to the experimental group. Figure 1 shows the percentage change of absorbance as the function of time.


Discussion:
According to the results, when compared the positive control group to the negative control group, there was no statistically significant result. When compared the positive control group to the experimental group, there was no statistically significant result. However, when compared the negative control group to the experimental group, there was a statistically significant result. Therefore, as there was no statistical difference in comparison between the positive control group and the experimental group, the results failed to support the hypothesis that if the temperature is at 25 ℃, photosynthesis II will have the most optimal activity. As the temperature increases, photosystem II will decrease.
As there was no statistical difference between the positive control group and the negative control group, the light did not show an effect in photosynthetic activity. However, light is the fundamental element for photosynthesis, so the results did not follow the biological principle of photosynthesis. And the possible cause could be the experimental error or human error, one possibility was that the negative control group was not tested completely in dark. 
      Additionally, as there was no statistical difference between the positive control group and the experimental group, the temperature did not show an effect in photosynthetic activity and the photosynthetic activity was higher under 40℃ than that under the room temperature. However, a lot of studies have shown that high temperatures can block photosystem activity and lower the overall photosynthetic activity. A study in Kobe university suggests that heat damage to PSII is due to a backflow of reducing power from the stroma to PSII, and that light causes a state transition of the photosystem, driving cyclic electron flow and thus protecting PSII from damage [Yamauchi: 2002]. And many other studies also found the optimal temperature for photosynthetic activity around 25℃, Yoho University found the optimal temperature for photosynthesis in Spinach to be 25℃ [Yamasaki:2005] and another group of scholars from Amsterdam found the optimal temperature for photosynthesis in seagrass around 25℃[Bulthuis: 1987]. These results can be explained by the high efficiency of photosystem II electron transport, and the temperature dependence of electron transport at the plastoquinone and water-oxidation sites was modulated by the temperature at which the leaves had developed [Yamasaki:2005]. Therefore, the photosynthetic activity is predicted to be highest at an optimal temperature. However, the results in this study did not make scenes, and the possible cause for that could be the lamp was too close to the samples that did higher the actual temperature in the positive control group. 
Furthermore, as there was a statistical difference when compared the negative control group to the experimental group, the positive control group had higher photosynthetic activity than that of the negative control group when the negative control barely showed photosynthetic activity. 
Based on this study, a wider range of temperatures and multiple treatments for different temperatures were considered for further studies. Also, multiple groups of samples and replicated processes can be tested for accuracy.
