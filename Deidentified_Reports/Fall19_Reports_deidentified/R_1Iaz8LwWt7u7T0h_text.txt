Title: Effects of excess juvenile hormone on the development and growth of Manduca sexta larvae

Abstract:
An abstract was not required for this lab report.

Introduction:
Hormones are signaling molecules produced by the glands of multicellular organisms to regulate specific behaviors and actions. In animals, these chemical messengers affect many aspects of an organism’s life including their metabolism, reproduction, and growth and development. The latter describes what this lab is interested in running experiments on. The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is a moth present throughout the majority of the Americas and is commonly considered a pest. With four major life stages (egg, larvae, pupa, and adult), this insect is termed holometabolous and in order to progress to the ensuing life stage, the organism must molt. Molting is the process of an insect shedding its old outer layer and replacing it with a newly secreted cuticle. This development in the life of a Manduca sexta is controllled by the following three hormones: prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). This lab is specifically interested in the latter two and their unique relationship involved in an insect’s growth. Depending on the changes in the relative levels of these hormones, JH and 20E controll the molting and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta [Johnson: 2019]. There is extensive evidence to suggest that a decrease in the concentration of JH occurs prior to the process of molting [Nijhout: 1974]. With this knowledge in mind, the lab is interested in understanding how essential the precision of these relative levels of hormones is to the growth and development of the insect. What would happen if the relative levels of these hormones were artificially adapted during vital stages of the insect’s development? Due to the insect’s classification as a pest, this information could be vital to developing new method of pest controll as well as accumulating a greater understanding of how these insects grow and develop. This classification as a pest is one of the main reasons that the Manduca sexta was selected as the subject organism for this lab. Other reasons include the ease of obtaining them, their relatively short life cycle that is easy to track and controll, and the minimal resources required to keep them alive. Specifically, in this lab, we were looking at the effect that excess JH would have on a 4th instar larva’s growth. Keeping in mind the fact that after this instar, JH levels normally drop drastically, we predict that adding JH to counteract this decrease will have detrimental effects on the larva’s ability to grow, thus decreasing its weight, and will most likely result in death. 

Materials and Method:
This lab required eight Manduca sexta in the 4th instar larva stage that were split into two groups of four organisms: the controll group and the treatment group. Each individual organism was placed into its own plastic cell and provided with ten grams of food that had been mixed with seven pipette drops of a specific liquid. For the controll group, the liquid mixed with the food was water and for the treatment group, the liquid was IGR juvenile hormone (concentration of 1: 1250). All eight Manduca sextas were stored in an incubator for two weeks and every day, the food and organism were checked and replenished if necessary. Data was taken by measuring the mass of each organism daily and recording any observations about their movement and general habits. After data was collected, a one-tailed, two-sample t_test was used to compute statistics for analysis. 

Results:
Over the course of the experiment, both the controll and the treatment groups grew from their original sizes. At the beginning, the size and growth rate of the two groups were very similar until day 6. At this point, the larvae in the controll group began to grow more and faster (seen in Figure 1). Despite this discrepancy between the groups, the average growth rate of the treatment larvae was not significently lower than the growth rate of the controll larvae (t_stat = 0.509, d.f. = 28, P = 0.307). Standard deviations for these two groups were both high (6.70 ± 5.13 for the controll group and 5.80 ± 4.57 for the treatment group). The colorations of the two groups of larvae were also different: the controll group was a vibrant green, while the treatment group had lost its vibrancy and was a much paler white pigment. Another difference between the two groups was there movement. The controll group exhibited relatively normal movement, while the treatment group was visibly more lethargic and lacking energy. In general, both the treatment and controll groups ate the same amount of food each day and produced around the same amount waste per day. There was one anomaly larva in the controll group (Manduca sexta #3) that refused to eat its food and, thus, was much smaller and less energetic than the other larva. 

Discussion:
Due to the lack of statistical significance, the results from this experiment cannot support the hypothesis that the addition of excess juvenile hormone into the food supply of 4th instar larva stunted the growth of these organisms compared to a group whose food supply was diluted with water. Although this experiment failed to show statistical differences, there was still evidence present to exhibit that additional JH hormone caused differentiations in the larvae, such as lethargic movement and discolorations. As pointed out in other studies, the presence or absence of juvenile hormone dictates the differentiation in larva and pupal stages of the Manduca sexta [Kiguchi: 1978]. Further studies also show that there is an expected drop in juvenile hormone occurring around the beginning of the 5th larval instar immediately prior to pupation [Johnson: 2019]. This research explains why this experiment did not achieve significent results as the larvae were not given time to reach the pupal stage. Additional JH was added to the larvae’s food with the intent of counteracting the normal drop in JH, but if the drop never occurs, the hypothesis cannot be effectively tested. On the other hand, the changes in appearance and movement of the larvae can most likely also be explained by this excess JH. Juvenile hormones are a class of insect hormones produced by the corpus allata that regulate the type of molt during the organism’s development [Johnson: 2019]. These long chain organic molecules work together with Ecdysterones (20E) in concentration ratios to further develop the organism [Johnson: 2019]. Therefore, if the concentration ratio was unbalanced by artificially altering the absolute concentration of JH in hemolymph, the Manduca sexta would experience unusual developments, which could include a discoloration and lethargic movement. This would also help to explain why the majority of the treatment group larvae were smaller in size to the controll group larvae. To further this study, more trials need to be recreated with a larger sample size of Manduca sexta in order to decrease the risk of skewed data from anomalies. Additionally, the experiment should be carried out for longer than 15 days in order to provide adequate time for the larvae to fully develop into pupae. This would allow the complete effect of additional JH to be observed and recorded, thus providing more accurate data on the hormone’s effect of growth in Manduca sexta. All in all, this experiment demonstrates the importance of hormones in the development of insects and shows how precise the concentrations of these hormones need to be in order to produce the desired results. Despite not achieving significent results to suggest that additional JH would stunt the growth of a Manduca sexta larva, this experiment still provided valuable information on the effect of hormones on an organism’s bodily functions. The discoloration, lethargic movement, and slight undergrowth show that hormones do, in fact, affect the chemicals, behaviors, and actions of organisms, thus demonstrating the importance in understanding how and why they function.
