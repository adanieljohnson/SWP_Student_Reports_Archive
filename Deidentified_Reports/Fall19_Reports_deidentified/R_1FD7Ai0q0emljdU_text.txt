Title: The Effect of JH Hormone on the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
.

Introduction:
Our study involves Manduca Sexta, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers. The life cycle of a Manduca Sexta is an example of a holometabolous life cycle. This life cycle includes egg, larva stage, pupa, and finally an adult. Hormone based signaling and neuron based signaling controll the growth, development, and  behaviors of the Munda Sexta. There are three main hormones in insects, including the prothoracicotropic hormones, ecdysterone, and the juvenile hormone. Our experiment focuses primarily on the juvenile hormone which is produced by the corpus allatum, and regulates the type of molt during development, as well as regulated many functions in an adult insect. Our group hypothesized that if a group of larva is fed 4 drops of precor juvenile hormone, then that group will molt slower than the larva not treated with extra juvenile hormone.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we are using eight larva. Each larva is separated and is receiving 10 grams of food. However, the four larva that we are treating as our experimental group are receiving food that has been treated with 4 drops of precor JH hormone, while the other four larva in our controll group, are receiving their food with four drops of water. This way, both the experimental and controll groups are receiving the same amount of food with the same consistency. Our group has been coming in each day to record the weight of each individual  larva. 



Results:
Standard Deviation: Control- 2.68g   JH Treatment Group: 1.58 
Two-tailed P-value:  .205305 
On average, the controll group weighed less at the end of the experiment compared to the experimental group which was treated with the JH hormone. 



Discussion:
Since our P-value was less than .05, our data is not scientifically significent. However, on a more primitive level, there were noticeable differences between the controll and experimental groups. Based on our results, it is evident that JH hormone causes caterpillars to gain weight more rapidly. The correlation between weight and juvenile hormone is further discussed in the article cited below. Browder discusses the “critical weight” which defines the time at which JH is no longer secreted.  [Browder: 2001] Although it appeared as though the controll group was beginning to molt, given the time frame of the experiment, it was difficult to confidently determine whether or not the JH hormone has a significent effect on the molting specifically. If we were to repeat this experiment, we would most likely have changed our hypothesis to predict the effect of Juvenile Hormone on the weight of caterpillars, rather than testing the effect of the JH hormone on their molting rate.
