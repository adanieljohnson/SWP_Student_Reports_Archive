Title: Minor Effect Juvenile Hormone Elicits in Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
In this experiment, students are observing hormones. The insect used in this lab was the hornworm (manduca sexta). Manduca sexta are caterpillars that partake in the holometabolous life cycle where they undergo four major life stages and body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis from larvae to adult [Johnson:2018]. They have five larval instars that are separated by molts depending on hormone levels. Two major hormones involved in the development of the Manduca sexta are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone [Johnson: 2018]. JH is a hormone that is used to prevent metamorphosis in insects [Johnson: 2018]. Until about the fourth instar, JH is relatively high and regulates molting types during development. However, around the fifth instar there is normally a decrease in the JH levels and an increase in Ecdysterone. This is when a commitment pulse occurs, and it indicates to the Manduca sexta that it is large enough to begin pupating [Johnson:2018].The hornworm was chosen for this experiment because it is found in abundance in nature and due to it being considered a model organism. It is easy to study in a laboratory setting because the hormones in the manduca sexta are relatively easy to understand. These insects are also easy to maintain within the lab. [Johnson:2018]. The Manduca sexta is also considered to be a pest and is popular to study as a result. The hornworm is considered a pest because it will harvest on crops such as tobacco, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and other vegetation in this family. Hornworms will eat the leaves of these plants. They also digest fruit that is yet to ripen, giving a rise in opportunity for the fruit to be diseased. [Byron and Gillett-Kaufman: 2017]. Pests have also been studied to determine the best way to controll outbreaks in crops. The insect growth regulators we experimented with affect the growth and development of the insects.  
Hypothesis: The expectation for this experiment is that the juvenile growth hormone IGR will alter the growth of worms by accelerating their development. We predict that the worms given six drops of the growth hormone IGR in their food will have a significently higher weight than the controll group with no growth hormone used.


Materials and Method:
For this experiment we separated eight hornworms into two separate containers. In the containers, each worm had their own section. Small holes were placed on the side of the container to help air flow. The initial weight of each worm was taken, then they were placed in their respective containers. After this approximately ten grams of food was weighed out and given to each worm. The controll group received six drops of water added to their food. The treatment group received six drops of IGR pesticide added to their food. Each container and section were labeled. Every day the worms were checked on. We weighed the worms, recorded their mass, cleaned their containers and gave them new food if needed. Each container was kept in an incubator in the lab. A two-sample t test was used to determine if the difference in mass between the two groups was significent or not. 

Results:
In the experiment done with the specific juvenile growth hormone IGR, there was no obvious increase in the amount of weight gained each day when comparing the controll group to the treatment group as seen in Figure 1. Both groups had one caterpillar die in the experiment. This is demonstrated in table one by the decrease in weight each day. For the most part, the caterpillars in both groups were around the same weight, varying from a mean of 8.9 grams and 6.6 grams on the last day. Both groups of caterpillars had signs of motion and continued eating food up until the last day. The caterpillars also kept their green/blue coloring, with the exception of the two that died. The results of the two-sample T-tests for the weights of the caterpillars was 0.24. 

Discussion:
The juvenile hormone had no to little effect on the growth and development of the caterpillars. Our test for weight resulted in a p_value of 0.12, meaning that there is little correlation between the juvenile hormone fed to the treatment group being responsible for the weight that was gained. These results rejected the hypothesis that the juvenile growth hormone would alter the growth of worms by accelerating their development. The results also rejected the hypothesis that the worms given six drops of the growth hormone in their food would have a higher weight than the controll group with no growth hormone used. When the juvenile hormone is released into an insect’s body in the lab, it covers up the effects of insulin that is released naturally [Safranek and Cymborowski: 1980]. Insulin is responsible for the body using carbohydrates and glucose from food intake. This would be the reason for there not being a significent difference between the weights of the controll and treatment group. Since the juvenile hormone masked the only way for the insect to gain weight, this had no impact in weight gain. Another cause for weight gain to not be significent is due to juvenile growth hormones in the horn worm also being responsible for the process of metamorphosis. While this hormone can affect weight, metamorphosis is also a factor.  
Future studies with this experiment could be with insulin in insect bodies.  A continuation of this study could be to analyze potentially for a type of insulin strong enough that the juvenile hormone does not mask its effects. This could be useful to insects that have trouble gaining weight. Overall, this experiment demonstrated that additional juvenile hormone in insects has a small effect on growth and development but is not significently different than insects that have normal amounts.

Figure 1. The average weight of the controll group compared to the treatment group over two weeks. The two sample T-test yielded a p_value of 0.12. This means that there is not a significent difference in the weight of the controll group compared to the treatment group. *************************************************************************
