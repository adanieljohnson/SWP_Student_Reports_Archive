Title: Exploring the Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
None

Introduction:
Introduction
	Manduca sexta, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm, lives a holometabolous life cycle consisting of four or five larval instars followed by pupation and the rearrangement of most of its internal organs called, metamorphosis [Morgan: 2017]. The timing and type of the molt that the insect undergoes is controllled by its endocrine system. Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) are the two hormones that controll this process. Ecdysterone controlls the timing of the molt, when it spikes it signals the beginning of a molt or of pupation into an adult. Juvenile Hormone controlls what type of molt the insect undergoes. If JH is high, the insect undergoes a molt from one larvae to another, but, when JH drops, the insect undergoes its final metamorphosis into an adult. Therefore we hypothesized that if we varied the levels of juvenile hormones in the food of our experimental group, then the insects given supplements of juvenile hormone would take longer to pupate. 


Materials and Method:
Materials and Method
	The Manduca sexta were provided by our TA and placed in two four-slot containers with one caterpillar in each container. Two airholes were punched in each of the slots, and 10 grams of food were placed in each slot. The controll group’s food was treated with 5 drops of water, and the experimental group’s food was treated with 5 drops of Precor, a Juvenile Hormone analog, for the first week. The second week, the controll group’s food was treated with 10 drops of water, and the experimental group’s food was treated with 10 drops of Precor. The mass of the insects was measured every day, and they were watched for signs of pupation. 


Results:
Discussion
	Our hypothesis that the larvae treated with Juvenile Hormone analog would pupate later than those that were not treated with Juvenile Hormone was rejected. This was because the mass of the test caterpillars remained fairly equivalent to and even surpassed that of the controll caterpillars during the experiment. This did not support our hypothesis, and, furthermore, none of our caterpillars showed any signs of pupation throughout the experiment meaning that we did not see any signs to support our hypothesis. We ran a one-tailed T-test that came out with a value of 0.3724, meaning that our results had no statistical significance. The Manduca sexta are known to have their cuticles harden and darken to form a pupa of a dark reddish-brown color, however, since none of this was observed in our experiment, this was a source of error [Morgan: 2017]. Since our caterpillars did not pupate, we did not observe them for long enough which was an error.
