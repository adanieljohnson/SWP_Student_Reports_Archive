Title: Effects of Decoys on Betta splendors aggression

Abstract:
Intraspecies competition is often one of the major driving forces for natural selection. As a result, many individuals in species have evolved various physiological mechanisms to contest with one another, this is most often seen in male to male competition. This specifically was studied in the reaction of male Betta splendins. This was achieved by gauging the level of habituation and aggression of a male Betta splendins when in the presence of a decoy male. We hypothesize that the decoy will lower the rates of aggression against other male Betta Splendins.


Introduction:
Outside of the pressures of survival from predators and their environments, animals must compete with other individuals in their populations to create progeny and pass on their genetic information. As individuals that have an upper hand in this arena have an advantage, species throughout the animal kingdom have evolved in response [cox: 1977]. The most dramatic of these evolutions are often seen in male to male competition. While many animals can approach this competition by deploying non aggressive behaviors, the opposite holds equally as true. In the grand scheme of the animal kingdom it has been observed that natural selection more often than not selects for males to be aggressive towards one another. This is due to males with predisposition for aggression having an inherent advantage over individuals who do not.[Cox: 1977]. The males of the species, Betta splendins, more commonly known as the siamese fighting fish is a model organism for aggression between males. This is due to their efficient recognition of and aggression towards other members of their species of the same gender. [Bronstein: 1981]The males of Betta Splendins are so aggressive that they exhibit aggressive behaviors to their own reflections in a mirror. [Clayton: 1 968] . The males of Betta Splendins possess various physiological adaptations to help facilitate their inherent aggression towards one another. The most noticeable are their larger fins and changeable colors which are used effectively in their agnostic behaviors. While these adaptations grant many benefits, their usage in agnostic behaviors take a large metabolic toll on the fish [Castro: 2006]. This metabolic uptick slowly builds up over time. This continues until the fish cannot continue to display and exhibit aggressive behaviours. This in turn has both immediate and long term negative effects on the fish. To avoid this, the fish have evolved a habituation response which limits their aggressive behavior after an extended time of aggression. [Clayton: 1968]. We will study the effects of how male Betta splendins gauge and limit their aggression. Using their innate habituation response, we will attempt to determine the limits of what triggers their aggression. If a male Betta splenden determines something as a threat, it will exhibit aggression. If it is exposed to this threat extensively, it will exhibit its habituation response. Using a decoy, we will test to see if a male Betta splendins will exhibit the habituation response to real male if it is exposed to a decoy before hand. We hypothesize that if the fish is habituated with a decoy between exposures to a real male, its aggression to the real male will decrease over time.


Materials and Method:
A medium fish tank was separated into two equal halves by a removable opaque and translucent screen. In each half, a male Betta Slendens was placed. The In one half a realistic male betta splendins decoy was placed. The opaque barrier was then removed and the time was recorded for the larger fish to display aggression to the other fish in the form of a broadside movement or gills extended. Once the fish displayed aggression, the opaque barrier was lowered again. The fish were separated for 5 minutes and the opaque barrier was raised again. This was repeated until 5 times were recorded. After the fish were kept in isolation for ten minutes, this process was repeated but a realistic male Betta splendins decoy was in the tank with the larger with for 5 minutes before each confrontation. The realistic decoy was colored red and accurately resembled the anatomy of the fish. After five timepoints was recorded, this was again repeated except using a less realistic and less aggressive decoy. This decoy was a crude cut out sketch of a male betta fish with sharpie on blue paper. A one tailed T test was ran on each experimental group against the controll with no decoy.


Results:
The T test for the red decoy yielded a P value of 0.089 and the T test for the blue decoy yielded a p value of 0.21 Each data set was a downward trend. As each set of experiments progresses, the fish seemed to become more aggressive towards the decoy and mobile in between each confrontation. By the end of each set, the fish began biting and constantly displaying broadside interactions towards the decoy. 



Discussion:
Our P values for each of the T tests were insignificent. Thus this shows us that both decoys do not result in a significent change in the aggression of the fish. However, Figure 2 shows that the red realistic decoy created a faster aggression time, however not significent. While this data is not significent, it is a trend that is against our original hypothesis. While we expected the habituation effect to occur, we expect that our set up did not expose the decoy to the male betta fish for a long enough time to trigger the habituation response. To fix this problem when recreating this experiment, it is recommended to choose a much longer interval in between confrontations. This trend however does give a scope into how aggression is regulated in the male Betta Splendins. As the fish attacked the decoy it shows that the Betta splendins has evolved to have a strong and rapid aggression reflex that does not discriminate on how accurate the threat may be. While this has its drawbacks in survival it is ultimately favored in sexual selection.[Cox: 1977]. While no conclusions can be made, due to our insignificent data, we can use our Betta Splendins data to point towards what other tests should be done in the future. The non specificity that we observed should be tested to its extremes to see what really determines an aggressive behavior. As Betta Splendins exhibit an extreme response, it makes it easier to study so that we have existing knowledge that allows us to study animals that have other less explicit mechanisms of aggression.
