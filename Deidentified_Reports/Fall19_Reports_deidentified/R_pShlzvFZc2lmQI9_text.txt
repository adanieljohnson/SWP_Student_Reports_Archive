Title: Resource Allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum Plants Exposed to Acidic Environments

Abstract:
Resource allocation in plants is defined as how the individual redirects its resources in response
to environmental pressures. environmental pH is one of such pressures influential on plant
growth. Fagopyrum esculentum, commonly known as buckwheat, is a plant with which resource
allocation can be studied given soil of different acidities. To measure the resource allocation in
our plants, the root-to-shoot weight ratios were calculated in order to determine where growth
was directed in each individual. We hypothesized that plants exposed to acidic pH values will
have a greater root-to-shoot ratio as they will expend more resources in roots in order to reach a
more tolerable pH environment. In our experiment, we exposed half of our seeds to normal
environmental conditions, and half to acidic solution. After a week of growth, the masses of each
individual were recorded as well as the masses of the roots and shoots of each in order to
determine the root-to-shoot ratios, which are indicative of the plant’s resource allocation. we
found our data to be nonsignificent and our null hypothesis could not be rejected. Despite
nonsignificent data, the study of resource allocation in buckwheat plants is an important topic as
the issue of crop health is at the forefront of agricultural studies.

Introduction:
Resource allocation describes the tendency of plants to redirect their resources depending on
environmental challenges [Johnson: 2019]. This allows for individual organisms to adapt to their
surroundings and provide for optimal growth. Environmental challenges can arise from various
factors, both biotic and abiotic, such as alkaline or acidic conditions, pollution, dryness, sun
exposure (or lack thereof), and nutrient density in the soil [Johnson: 2019]. Understanding the
effect that the environment has on plant growth is essential as we share our environment with
these species and rely on them as energy sources, and as key species in ecosystem
maintenance. While environments are constantly changing, especially today, the topic of resource
allocation in plants and the impact of changing environments on how plants grow is increasingly
studied. In a study published by the American Society of Plant Biologists, green pepper plants
exposed to acidic fog experienced a profound decrease in photosynthetic rate and growth
[Takemoto et al: 1988]. It was found that the individuals exposed to fog with a low pH value
yielded reductions in stem and leaf mass [Takemoto et al: 1988]. This is indicative of resource
allocation as cell acidification prevents the allocation of the resources and nutrients required for
photosynthetic activities in the leaves of the plants [Takemoto et al: 1988]. In order to further
study the impact of acidic environments on resource allocation, buckwheat seeds were exposed
to normal soil conditions and acidic soil conditions in order to tell differences in plant growth in
sprouted seeds in response to pH solutions of 3.5. In a paper published by the Department of
Agronomy at the University of Missouri Extension, buckwheat seeds were determined to tolerate
soils of pH down to a value of about 5 [Myers et al: 1994]. With this knowledge of optimal
buckwheat conditions, the effect of an acidic environment below tolerable pH values presented
itself as a researchable topic in the context of plant resource allocation. We hypothesized that
buckwheat seeds that are exposed to soil of pH 3.5 will have a great root:shoot ratio in terms of
mass compared to buckwheat seeds that are exposed to soil of neutral pH.

Materials and Method:
A hand.f.ul of buckwheat seeds were soaked prior to partitioning them into pots for experimenting.
Once the seeds had soaked for about an hour, six planters were prepared by filling each to the
top with soil, then adding a scoop of Miracle-Gro™ to each, spreading evenly. Three planters

were labeled “controll” while the other three were labeled “experimental” to differentiate our two
groups. 15 seeds were added to each planter, totaling to 90. The planters were saturated with
water, then placed in the greenhouse for the remainder of our week long experiment. Each day,
once a day, both groups were watered with 150 Ml of water to each planter, and to the three
experimental planters, 50 Ml of aqueous pH 3.5 solution was added to each planter. After 8
days, the plants were removed from each planter and rinsed and dried. This allowed for accurate
massing of the individuals. Three individuals from each planter were analyzed. To do so, an
individual was placed on a tared weigh paper on a digital scale. The mass of the entire individual
was recorded, followed by the mass of the shoots alone, obtained by cutting the individual at the
root and shoot junction. From these two masses, the mass of the root could be calculated by
subtracting shoot mass from the total mass. This data allowed for the calculation of the root to
shoot ratio, simply performed by dividing the root mass by the shoot mass. The average ratio of
each planter was then calculated, followed by the average weight ratio of the controll group and
the average weight ratio of the experimental group. A two-sample t_test was used to determine
the significance of our data.

Results:
Our experiment yielded nonsignificent data with a p_value equal to 0.25. The average root:shoot
ratios of the controll buckwheat individuals did not show a clear pattern of difference compared to
the root:shoot ratios of experimental individuals. The p_value indicates a 25% likelihood that our
data patterns were due to chance, which is above the 5% accepted value. The error bars
represent our standard deviation and express that our experimental group individuals displayed
more variation in their root:shoot ratios than did controll group individuals.

Discussion:
The two-sample t_test yielded a p_value of 0.25, which is above the accepted p value of 0.05 and
thus indicates that our data is not significent. Our null hypothesis, which states that if buckwheat
plants are exposed to acidic soil they will not show a difference in root:shoot weight ratio
compared to plants grown in neutral soil, cannot be rejected. Despite patterns in our data that
indicate a general trend toward greater root:shoot weight ratios, we cannot assume that our data
was not due to chance. This could be attributed to several factors, namely our small sample
sizes, and also our limited plant growth. Our buckwheat plants only grew to a maximum weight of
0.38 grams, which is a small mass and consequently, roots and shoots perhaps did not grow to
their full potentials given the environmental circumstances. So, perhaps a larger sample size and
a longer experimental duration of 14 days or longer could provide adequate data to yield a p-
value equal to or below 0.05. In reflecting upon our prior research, our results do not defend
previously acquired data on the resource allocation in other crops such as green peppers after
exposure to acidic environments [Takemoto et al: 1988]. Perhaps further studies could focus on
the differences in acidic soil environments versus air environments (fog) on resource allocation in
crops. As climate change continues to be the topic of biological and agricultural research, the
effect of pH as well as temperatures, pollution, and nutrient density in the surroundings of plants
will be an important focus in understanding how our crops are adjusting to environmental
pressures.
