Title: Effects of Magnesium Sulfate on Mung Beans, Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Phenotypic variation is very important in adaptation and natural selection. Organisms must adapt to various factors within their environment to be best fit to produce offspring. In this experiment, three pots of Mungs Beans (Vigna radiata) received 150 mL of water and three pots of Mung Beans received 150 mL of water with Magnesium Sulfate (2x MgSO4) per day. Each pot contained 10 seeds and was watered with the appropriate solution for two weeks. After two weeks, three plants were taken from each pot and the total mass (clean of soil) of the three pots was collected and averaged (no magnesium versus magnesium). The ratio of wilted leaves/total number of leaves of three plants per container was collected and averaged among the three containers per group. Using a Two-sample T-test, the presence of magnesium indicated statistical significance in the total averaged mass (t-stat = 9.43, df = 4, P = 0.000704), however was not indicated in the ratio of wilted leaves/total leaves (t-stat = 2.55, df = 4, P = 0.0636). The average mass and ratio with magnesium was 2.21 grams and 0.57. The average mass and ratio without magnesium was 0.36 grams and 0.89.  

Introduction:
In general, phenotypic variation is important in an ecosystem for a multitude of reasons. This variation is most important when an organism adjusts to its environment and is experiencing natural selection. In certain biological environments, organisms (both plants and animals) must interact and adapt to other organisms and environmental stimuli that originate from other organisms, which are also known as biotic factors [Johnson: 2016]. In a study done by Axel Mithöfer and Wilhelm Boland, they analyzed plant defense against herbivores using chemical defenses. There are many chemical defenses in different kinds of plants, where some are constitutive or induced during and after an attack. Others are toxic, repellent, or antinutritive for all herbivores. Some include cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates, alkaloids, and many macromolecules that disrupt the biological processes of organisms that consume them [Mithöfer: 2012]. However, it is the job of the plant to recognize the herbivore and timing of defense to adequately and efficiently allocate its resources and energy to defend itself. Organisms must also be able to interact with abiotic factors (non-living), such as wind or temperature. Both of these factors affect multiple other processes/organisms within the environment, such as energy capture, fitness, and reproduction. Occasionally, in certain cases, biotic factors can even cause movement of certain organisms, shaping their interaction within their environment, which are known as intra- and interspecific interactions [Johnson: 2016]. 
	These two interactions depend on obtaining essential resources, like sunlight or water, but the majority of resources are limited, leading to resource limitation. Resource limitation affects what species are present in a community and acts as a selection force, resulting in allocating resources in certain ways determining where they grow in the environment and even within their body. For example, this can be seen generally in the population density of organisms in a jungle versus in a desert. Again, resource allocation and the notion of trade-offs are critical for the survival of an organism. An organism only has so much energy and can spend so much energy. Therefore, it has to be smart in terms of how it uses that energy and may expend more energy and mass in one area to grow a particular area and reduce spending energy in other areas. A good example of this is the variety of reproduction across organisms. Resource allocation (trade-off) is the term used to describe the pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources [Johnson: 2016]. There is the ability for some modification of this pattern in certain organisms in certain environments, like in this lab. When a plant does not have to compete and is provided resources in a controlled setting, like in this lab, it allows for the ability to analyze how plants are affected and respond to certain stimuli. For example, in a study done by Xiuming Hao and Anthanasios Papadopoulos, they found that magnesium concentrations of 300 and 80 mg/L were the appropriate amount to provide greenhouse tomatoes with supplemental resources to aid in growth. Typically, magnesium deficiency does occur in greenhouse tomatoes during the fall or winter, ultimately hurting the plant’s productivity [Hao: 2004]. Therefore, supplemental resources can be very important and beneficial worldwide to stimulate and enhance plant growth. Although too many resources can also potentially hurt the plant as well. 
	In this lab, resources acquired by plants for growth can be divided into those acquired above ground and below ground. Therefore, plants vary in terms of how they obtain, absorb, utilize, and allocate resources based upon their shoot and root system. This also varies from plant species to plant species. Plants will change how they allocate their resources based on certain conditions, called phenotypic plasticity [Johnson: 2016]. This results in new growth in the plant to attain more beneficial substances and stop growth when there are negative substances. In this lab, one compares the number of wilted leaves in Mung Beans (Vigna radiata) in the presence and absence of magnesium sulfate. Mungs beans are ideal organisms to work with because of their easy cultivation and speed in growth. In the presence of magnesium sulfate, the plants will exhibit less wilted leaves because magnesium will help to coordinate chlorophyll and stimulate growth more efficiently due to better energy management/trade-off compared to those in the absence of magnesium. 


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, one planted 10 mung bean seeds in six containers with soil and fertilizer (~20 mL per container). Next, one watered three containers with 150 mL of water each day and the other three with 150 mL of water with magnesium sulfate (2x MgSO4 according to prepared solution by Biology Department) for two weeks. The plants were placed in a consistent environment, with consistent temperature, air flow, and sunlight. Following this step, one measured the one plant species (Mung Beans) by harvesting plants by pulling three plants per container with adherent medium out of tray after two weeks. Next, one washed the three plants per container in water in order to remove any soil or fertilizer in order to mass purely the weight of the plant itself. Thus, the mass of the three plants per pot was totaled, which represented the mass of that container. Next, the three pots per container were averaged together for each group (no magnesium versus with magnesium). After this is completed, one counted the number of non-wilted leaves compared to that of the total number of leaves for the three leaves for each of the six containers. Thus, the ratio of wilted to total leaves was calculated for each of the six containers/pot (based upon the three plants selected from each pot). Then, average the ratios of the three pots of the two groups (control – no magnesium versus experimental – with magnesium) to find the overall average for each group. Once all the data was recorded and collected, discard the materials appropriately. 

Results:
The general trend for our observations regarding the average mass of plants (g) in the presence and absence of magnesium was that there is greater mass in the absence in magnesium than in the presence of magnesium. This observation is clearly seen in Figure One; there is a clear difference between the control and treatment group. The average mass of plants in the absence of magnesium was 2.21 grams and the average mass of plants in the presence of magnesium was 0.36 grams. The Two-sample T-test we ran for the average mass in the absence and presence of magnesium gave us a p-value of 0.000704 (t-stat = 9.43, df = 4, P = 0.000704). The mean of the control does hold significance over that of the experimental group for the average mass because the p-value is significantly smaller than 0.05 (t-stat = 9.43, df = 4, P = 0.000704). The general trend for our observations regarding the average ratio of wilted leaves to total leaves in the presence and absence of magnesium was that there is greater ratio of wilted leaves to total leaves in the presence of magnesium than in the absence of magnesium. This observation is seen in Figure Two; there is a difference between the control and treatment group, however, not by a significant amount. The average ratio of wilted leaves to total leaves in the absence of magnesium was 0.57 and the average ratio of plants in the presence of magnesium was 0.89 grams. The Two-sample T-test we ran for the average ratio in the absence and presence of magnesium gave us a p-value of 0.0636 (t-stat = 2.55, df = 4, P = 0.0636). The mean of the control does not hold significance over that of the experimental group for the average ratio because the p-value is greater than 0.05 (t-stat = 2.55, df = 4, P = 0.0636).

Discussion:
Overall, as a group, we expected the group that received water with the presence of magnesium sulfate to grow less wilted leaves and to also grow to a greater mass compared to that of the group that received water with the absence of magnesium, especially due to the study done by Xiuming Hao and Anthanasios Papadopoulos (as mentioned in the introduction) and due to the fact that plants were receiving a supplement resource. Based upon our data, the opposite of what we thought was going to occur took place. As seen in Figure one, the average mass of plants in the absence of magnesium was 2.21 grams and the average mass of plants in the presence of magnesium was 0.36 grams. Using a Two-sample T-test, the p-value between the mass of these two groups is 0.000704 (t-stat = 9.43, df = 4, P = 0.000704). Because the p-value is below 0.05, this means that the data is statistically significant, however contrary to our hypothesis, the control had a greater mass. As seen in Figure two, the average ratio of plants in the absence of magnesium was 0.57 and the average ratio of plants in the presence of magnesium was 0.89, meaning there was more wilted leaves in this group. Using a Two-sample T-test, the p-value between the mass of these two groups is 0.0636 (t-stat = 2.55, df = 4, P = 0.0636). Because the p-value is above 0.05, this means that the data is not statistically significant, however contrary to our hypothesis, it is evident that the group that received magnesium in their water had a greater number of wilted leaves. The reason for this contradicting data is most likely due to the fact that plant received too much magnesium sulfate in its water over the span of two weeks. Despite varying in amount from plant to plant, the study done by Hao and Papadopoulos supports the fact that supplemental magnesium plays a crucial role in plant growth and plant productivity. So, a possible explanation for the error in our experiment is that too much magnesium was given to the plants, thus becoming in excess and resulting in either slower /inhibited growth of the plant, or even plant death. In one study analyzing the biochemical, physiological, and structural effects of excess copper in plants, one of the most environmentally harmful factors is heavy metal pollution, where materials/compounds/elements, like copper, cause serious problems due to widespread industrial and agricultural use. It was also found that in general, plants are very sensitive to copper toxicity, resulting in metabolic disturbances and growth inhibition at higher-than-normal levels [Fernandes: 1991]. This could be the same case for our own plants experiencing an excess of magnesium. Plants receiving water with no magnesium will clearly grow normally and without a problem when under standard conditions, as seen in our control group. In another study, it was found that excess MgSO4 in 30 mM solution reduced growth to 33-42% in Echinochloa species and 54-67% in rice cultivars  and across the species studied in this experiment, it was found that excess magnesium intake in plants greatly reduced calcium uptake, which further adds to the notion that excess magnesium can inhibit plant growth [Kobayahsi: 2005]. Therefore, this is a potential reason for the contradicting results/data. Based on our results, specifically the ratio of wilted leaves to total leaves being greater than 0.05 and technically not statistically significant, we cannot reject our null hypothesis, however it is clear that magnesium did have some effect on plant growth as seen in Figure one and the average masses of the groups. This is most likely because too much magnesium was given to the plants, to the point where it negatively impacted growth. Our experiment did not run parallel to that of Hao’s greenhouse tomatoes. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported by our data. In order to improve our data if we were to do this experiment again, we should be careful and determine the appropriate amount of magnesium sulfate in solution to beneficially aid the plants in growth.
