Title: Visibility of Betta splendens affects male aggression

Abstract:
Males of the same species will often compete with each other for access to resources such as food, territory, and mates. In many cases, males will engage in aggressive, competitive behaviors toward each other in order to establish dominance and a social hierarchy in order to determine the extent to which individuals have access to certain resources. In Betta splendens, such aggressive behavior can easily be studied and manipulated to investigate different aspects of their recognizable aggressions. One such aggressive behavior is tail beating, and is a sample of the overall aggressive state of a male Betta. Our findings investigated whether reduced visibility of male Bettas would decrease their number of tail beatings. Our resulting significant data indicates that as visibility of an opposing male decreases, so too does the overall aggressive behavior towards it.

Introduction:
Intraspecies males will often exhibit aggressive behaviors towards each other in the interest of dominance, typically with the goal of either social dominance or the attainment of territory.  Social dominance within a group can lead to several evolutionarily reproductive benefits, such as improved access to food and mates, while acquiring territory over other males can also lead to social dominance, but is limited to its territory and usually prevents the formation of an intraspecies social hierarchy [Collias: 1944]. In other findings, male three-spined sticklebacks that displayed a brighter red color during male-male competition were not only intended to intimidate the other male, but also served as a signal to females, who showed preferences for the dominant males [Candolin: 1999]. This additionally suggests that the behaviors displayed during male intraspecies competitions serve multiple purposes, and are important to not only the competition itself, but to signaling any females observing the behaviors. Betta splendens, otherwise known as Siamese fighting fish, have repeatedly been shown to exhibit several such male-male aggressive behaviors, with some of the more easily distinguishable ones being pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and spreading their opercula (gill covers) [Johnson: 2016]. Our research investigated whether the level of visibility opposing male Bettas had of each other would influence the number of aggressive behaviors, in this case, tail beatings, displayed, and therefore indicate overall aggressiveness. This investigation’s findings could potentially be applied to the studies of pollution in the oceans near southeast Asia, where Bettas are native to, and elsewhere, and could be useful in determining the effect that human pollution is having on marine species’ mating behaviors. In this study regarding visibility, our prediction was that as visibility was reduced, the resulting number of tail beatings produced by a male Betta would also be reduced. 


Materials and Methods:
Bettas are an ideal species to observe aggressive male intraspecies behavior in a lab setting due to their naturally aggressive manner toward all other male Bettas, their easily identifiable behaviors, and their relatively small and convenient size. To create the environment for the fish to be observed, we set up a small glass tank filled with treated water specially tailored to Bettas. We ensured that the tank being used had a slot for dividers to create two separate spaces within the same tank. Three kinds of dividers were prepared: clear, one layer of film over glass, and two layers of film over glass. In the slot for the dividers, a completely opaque divider was placed first to divide the tank into two spaces. One male Betta was then placed into each section.  The Bettas were given five minutes, on their own and without view of the other, to adjust to their new environment. One male was randomly selected to be the observed male (Betta 1), while the other was to only serve as the stimulus to the aggressive behavior of the observed male (Betta 2). After five minutes on their own, we replaced the opaque divider with a clear one. For two minutes, Betta 1 was observed, and the number of tail beatings that it produced in full sight of Betta 2 were counted. The fish were then given a three minute rest with the opaque divider between them. This was repeated twice more and became the control treatment to which we compared the other two treatments. After another three minute rest, the glass divider with one layer of film (Treatment 1) was placed into the dividing slot, and the number of tail beatings exhibited by Betta 1 were counted for two minutes, followed by three minutes of rest with the opaque divider. This treatment was repeated twice more. For Treatment 2, a glass divider with two layers of film was placed into the tank, and Betta 1 was once again was observed for two minutes, followed by three minutes of rest, for a total of three trials. After we recorded the number of tail beatings exhibited by Betta 1 for each treatment, we analyzed our data through a one-tailed paired t test. 



Results:
The average tail beatings per level of visibility displayed in Figure 1. reveal that the lower the visibility, the lower the number of tail beatings. The control treatment, or the treatment with the greatest level of visibility, produced the highest average number of tail beatings.  The control treatment produced an average of 5 +/- 1.00 tail beatings, Frost 1 produced 2.33 +/- 1.15, and Frost 2 produced 0.33 +/- 0.58. Both frosted glass treatments, or layers of film over the glass, were compared back to the control for the paired t test, and in this comparison, the p-value of Frost 1 was 0.0470, while the p-value of Frost 2 was 0.0099, both of which are less than the standard 0.05; this indicates that both treatments resulted in significant results.


Discussion:
Based on the results displayed in Figure 1., we can conclude that our hypothesis of reduced visibility resulting in decreased number of tail beatings was supported. This suggests that even when Bettas have some but not full visibility of another male, they are less likely to recognize that male as one of the same species. It also suggests the possibility that they are more likely to interpret a male in reduced visibility as less threatening than a male in full visibility. Under the assumption that tail beating is an accurate sample of male aggression, our significant data indicates that reduced visibility of other males decreases overall aggressive behaviors in male Bettas. However, it is possible that as the experiment was run, the fish became accustomed to each other after multiple and repetitive visible exposures and recognized that neither was a threat since there was a separation between them in a behavior known as habituation [Johnson: 2014]. In the future, this experiment would need to be run again with more trials and more observational males over a greater time frame to confirm our findings, and to confirm that habituation had no effect on the resulting aggressive behavior. It is our hope that marine biologists will find this data useful in further research on the topic of marine animal mating behaviors, particularly fish, in an everchanging environment that is directly being impacted by human climate change.

Figure 1. Displayed are the average number of tail beatings by Betta 1 in different levels of visibility of Betta 2. The error bars represent the standard deviations of each treatment on the x-axis in comparison to the control treatment, the control deviating by 1.00 tail beatings, Frost 1 (one layer of film) deviating by 1.15 tail beatings, and Frost 2 (two layers of film) deviating by 0.58 tail beatings*************************************************************************
