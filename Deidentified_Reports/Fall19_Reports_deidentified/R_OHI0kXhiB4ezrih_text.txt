Title: Increased JH Levels in the Manduca sexta do not negatively impact mass

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera and is referred to as a model organism. A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied in order to understand a range of biological phenomena and be able to formulate hypotheses and results [Leonelli: 2013]. The Manduca sexta is considered holometabolous, meaning that it goes through four distinct life stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. This differs from hemimetabolous development in the way that holometabolous development includes the pupal stage, a transition period from the larvae into adulthood. The emergence into the pupal stage is due largely in part to the drop in juvenile hormone (JH) levels [Noriega: 2014]. JH regulates development and reproduction maturation in insects [Noriega: 2014]. The removal of JH in the Manduca sexta has been proven to shorten the larval stage of the caterpillar and result in development into pupation [Kiguchi: 1978]. On the other hand, if JH levels remain high, the Manduca sexta will remain in the larval stages and be unable to pupate into an adult [Kiguchi: 1978]. With this information, we formulated a question on the relevance of the relationship of the presence of JH and growth development: Will the promotion of JH levels in the Manduca sexta negatively impact the growth of the caterpillar, more specifically the mass of the insect? This is a very relevant question as tobacco hornworms are a common pest of plants. If the enhanced JH levels do negatively impact the growth of the caterpillars, it would provide relevant information to insecticide manufacturers. Thus, we used this information to conclude that if increased JH levels were introduced to an experimental group, then the insect’s mass will be less than that of the controll group, who did not experience increased levels of JH. 

Materials and Method:
Each group was given eight individual organisms for testing. We split the eight caterpillars into two groups, four organisms in each group (controll and experimental). We used a plastic container divided into four separate sections for each group. This ensured that each caterpillar had its own space and could not interfere with the other organisms. Holes were punched in the sides of each individual cell to make sure the caterpillars had an adequate oxygen supply. We labeled each container and each individual cell to make sure each caterpillar was accounted for properly. The JH enhancer we used for this experiment was known as Precor. Along with ten grams of food, the experimental group received six drops of Precor to be mixed in with the food. The controll group also received ten grams of food but six drops of water in the food (instead of Precor) to make sure the total liquid content for each group was the same. The organisms were refed when their food supply got low. Each refeed consisted of weighing out ten grams of food and mixing in the respected amounts of liquid depending on which group the caterpillar was in. Over the course of the fifteen-day test, fifteen measurements were taken of each caterpillar using a scale to calculate their mass. Daily general external observations were also collected on each organism. The organisms were kept in an incubator at an optimal temperature for the Manduca sexta. Each day, we cleaned out the feces of each caterpillar to make sure they had room to move freely within their cells. For statistical significance testing with our results, a two-tailed T-test with a p_value was used to determine if our data was statistically significent or by chance when comparing the means of the controll and experimental groups. A p_value of .05 or less would suggest that our data is significent while a p_value greater than .05 would suggest that the results were in large part due to chance.  

Results:
After collecting all of the data for our experiment, the average growth in mass proved to be greater in the experimental group compared to the controll group (Figure 1). The average weight gain in the experimental group was 14.189 grams compared to an average of 12.320 grams gained by the controll group (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the experimental group ( .97 s.d.)  was also significently smaller than the standard deviation of the controll group ( 4.26 s.d.) (Figure 1). The daily mass of the experimental and controll groups are also shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. Using a two-tailed T-test, the p_value was determined to be .499. 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis that the increase in JH levels would stunt growth in mass, as the experimental group on average gained more weight over the course of the study than the controll group did (Figure 1). Furthermore, the large p_value of the experiment (.499) suggests that our data is not statistically significent and is in large part due to chance. It is important to note that our experimental group only consisted of three caterpillars compared to the controll group having four organisms. One of the experimental caterpillars died early on in the experiment, and to avoid allowing its weight measurements to skew our data, we decided to omit all of the measurements from that experimental organism from our calculated data. The experiment proves that our hypothesis was not specific and refined enough to measure the observable development of the caterpillar rather than relying solely on the mass of the organism to suggest its development. Because we only used weight as an indicator of growth, we failed to consider pupation as a measure of growth and development. While we did take general observations of each caterpillar daily, we did not consider using this information when we formulated our hypothesis that determined what we would be using to accept or reject this statement. Because of this failure to consider other forms of development rather than just weight, our alternate hypothesis that the mass of the experimental group would be less than that of the controll group was disproven. The biological explanation for this is that increased JH levels hinder the organism’s ability to pupate but do not keep the organisms from continuing to grow while they remain in the larval stage [Zhang: 2017]. Based on the four caterpillars from our controll group that were beginning to transition into the pupal stage, their masses began to drop. This factor that we did not account for could have skewed our measurement of average weight gain because the final measurement did not get these four controll caterpillars at their peak weight. This also suggests that our hypothesis was not clear enough in calculating the overall development of the caterpillar. A scientific approach that measures the organisms both quantitatively and qualitatively would allow one to observe the physical development of the caterpillar and not have to rely just on the mass to suggest development. An argument that supports our data collected is seen in a 2017 study that shows that the depletion of juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), which is the JH-specific degradation enzyme that plays a key role in regulating JH, extends larval periods and growth the Bombyx mori, commonly known as a silkworm [Zhang: 2017]. Without the JHE, the B. mori had extended larval periods and created giant larvae [Zhang: 2017]. On the other hand, the presence of JHE led to the maturing of the caterpillars from the larval stage to the pupal stage [Zhang: 2017]. The results in this study hint at the findings of our experiment in the way that it suggests the presence of JH keeps the caterpillars in the pupal stage and allows them to continue to grow. If we were to redo this experiment, we would reframe our research question and hypothesis to include the effects of JH levels on maturation rather than just on the mass of the organism. This restructuring of our experiment would allow us to gain more information on the overall effects of JH on development, considering maturation as a factor. While our information disproved our alternate hypothesis, important information can still be gathered. It can still be concluded that a pesticide involving increased JH levels could still be effective, however further research would need to be done to gain more knowledge on the matter. On a larger and more applicable scale, our study shows the way that hormones can play a significent role in allowing life cycles to occur or halting them altogether.
