Title: Effect of higher temperature on the intraspecific agnostic behaviors of male Betta splendins

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effect a higher water temperature would have on the intraspecific agnostic, or aggressive, behaviors of Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish. We hypothesized that the fish in the warmer water would display more aggressive behaviors than the controll fish due to an increase in its metabolism, allowing for more movement. Thus, with increased activity, more displays of these behavior are expected. Our controll temperature was 19°C, and to conduct the experiment we separated two males in a tank with dividers (one clear, one opaque), then removed the opaque divider and chose one of the fish to observe for two minutes. We recorded its broadside and facing antagnostic behaviors with a tally system. After time passed, we placed the opaque divider back into the tank and let the fish rest for five minutes and did a total of five trials. This was repeated with the males in the 21°C water. A two-sample one-tailed t_test was then done on the data to see if there was a significent difference. The results of this experiment support our hypothesis since there was a significent difference (p = 7.76e-5) between the average number of aggressive behaviors displayed by the males at the two different temperatures. 

Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, is an exceptionally broad field that brings together observational skills from natural history, laboratory method, and insights from other fields in biology [Johnson: 2019]. This field seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, and how they are shaped by evolution and natural selection [Johnson: 2019]. It involves long periods of patient observation, both in the field and laboratory, because the quality of the research depends on how well the researcher knows their animal. The behavior of animals is fundamental to whether individuals will or will not survive and reproduce, therefore, studying their behavior is essential in fully understanding evolution. 
	The purpose of this experiment was to understand a small part of the behavior of the fish by watching their responses to certain conditions; we attempt to understand a small part of their world through their perspective to explain the evolutionary basis for their behavior. We study the behavior of Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, who are common aquarium fishes that originate from southeast Asia [Johnson: 2019]. At rest, the males are inconspicuous, but when excited by the presence of another male, they show agnostic, or aggressive, behaviors. We are focusing on the intraspecific behaviors, or the behavior of males in the presence of other members of their own species, which can be divided into two main types of movements: broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are displays performed when a fish turns its side toward an opponent, while facing movements are displayed when the fish is looking at their opponent [Johnson: 2019]. 
	In this experiment we decided to test the effect that temperature would have on the intraspecific agnostic behaviors of the B. splendins males. These are ectothermic organisms that depend primarily upon external heat sources and behavioral and physiological adjustments to thermoregulate [Andrade et al.: 2015]. Therefore, it can be deduced that temperature has profound effects on the physiology and behavior of ectothermic animals, especially since behavior is known, at least in part, to be linked to metabolism [Forsatkar et al.: 2016]. We chose to test the behaviors at 19°C (controll) and at 21°C (experimental) since they are temperatures they can survive at, and water temperatures outside the optimal range can have significent effects on the fishes. We hypothesized that the fish in the warmer water would display more agnostic behaviors than the controll fish due to the fact that the warm water would increase its metabolism and allow for more movement, thus, with increased activity, more displays of the behavior are expected; we expect there to be a significent difference between the two. 


Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, we began by obtaining two male B. splendins fishes, that were separated in a tank by both a clear and an opaque divider, with the water at 19°C (controll). We then removed the opaque divider and chose one of the fish to observe for two minutes. We recorded its broadside and facing antagnostic behaviors with a tally system (i.e. a tally was marked every time it displayed behavior). After the two minutes passed, we placed the opaque divider back into the tank and let the fish rest for five minutes. We repeated these steps four more times for a total of five trials, always observing the same Betta fish. Then, we repeated the entire process for a male Betta fish in a tank with the water at 21°C (experimental). Our data was analyzed through a two-sample one-tailed t_test. 

Results:
The average number of agnostic behaviors displayed by the male B. splendins at 19°C was 16.2 ± 1.92, while the average for the male fish at 21°C was 29.4 ± 3.97 (Figure 1). There was a significent difference between the average number of aggressive behaviors displayed by the males at different temperatures (p = 7.76e-5). 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment fully support our hypothesis seeing as we saw a significent difference between the average number of aggressive behaviors displayed by the males at the two different temperatures, with the males in the 21°C water having a higher average than those in the 19°C water. We hypothesized this because higher environmental temperatures, with the physiological range of an organism, have been found to enhance responses to stimuli, while lower environmental temperatures, tend to inhibit these responses in ectotherms [Bly & Clem: 1992]. From previous research aimed at studying the effects of ambient temperature on boldness responses of B. splendins, we saw that the individuals exposed to increased temperatures were generally more active [Forsatkar et al.: 2016]. 
	Temperature, as one of the main abiotic factors in the aquatic ecosystem, has profound effects on metabolic rate and important physiological processes, which can change behavioral responses. Fish are a major group of ectothermic animals, who will typically experience a wide range of temperatures throughout days, but their optimum temperature lies within a more limited temperature range. An experiment done on damselfish found an increase in activity levels, aggressiveness and boldness after being exposed to higher temperatures [Pang et al.: 2011]. From this we can infer that the male B. splendins, who are known for being highly territorial and aggressive towards opponents of same species, would show an increase in this behavior and boldness when placed in warmer waters. 
	It is important to study the effect temperature has on fishes since small temperature fluctuations of a few degrees or less can have substantial effects on physiology and behavior [Forsatkar et al.: 2016]. The continuous increase in global temperatures is a reality we face as climate change continues to have detrimental effects, and it is crucial for us to know how aquatic organisms are affected by this. Although we only studied aquarium fishes, it is a step in the right direction, and to further this investigation we could begin by studying other aquatic organisms. The extent to which individuals display a particular behavior in different situations can have significent ecological and evolutionary consequences (e.g. differences in boldness and dominance can affect reproductive success and success at foraging).
