Title: Juvenile hormones effect on the development of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
In the past few decades, hormone influence on insect growth has garnered attention from the agricultural industry [Dhadialla: 1998]. Two hormones in particular, ecdysterene (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH), have been heavily researched due to their controll of insect growth, behaviors, and development. This is important when considering target-specific insecticides [Noriega: 2014]. Recently developed insecticides can controll hormone levels, thus affecting the insect’s developmental stages and causing less of an ecotoxicological impact on other species [Noriega: 2014]. The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is recognized as an agricultural pest. The hornworm follows a holometabolous life cycle consisting of four stages: the egg, larvae, pupa, and adult [Johnson: 2019]. Concentrations of the hormones 20E and JH controll the molting process, a process that develops the hornworms into each stage. JH controlls the type of molting while 20E manages the time it occurs [Johnson: 2019]. For the Manduca sexta to develop past the fifth instar and molt, a spike in 20E and drop in JH must occur. After pupating, the JH concentration remains low while 20E gradually increases until a fully developed adult is formed. This raises the question of whether higher JH concentrations can hinder the growth of a hornworm. The hornworm was chosen as a representative pest to examine controllling the final molting can be used for growth inhibiting insecticides. In this experiment, the affect JH has on hornworm growth will be assessed using the insect growth regulator (IGR), methoprene. This IGR’s function is analogous to that of the juvenile hormone. Based upon knowledge of hormone concentrations at during molt, it is hypothesized that if IGR Methoprene is added to the Manduca sextas food source, the worms grow in size but fail to pupate and become an adult.


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta in the larval stage were selected and separated into groups of four, a controll group and an experimental group. Each group was placed in its designated container (labeled with controll or experimental) and each hornworm was weighed then set into a labeled (1-4) section of the container. The controll groups’ hornworms were given ten grams of food mixed with five drops of water. The experimental groups’ hornworms were given ten grams of food mixed with five drops of IGR Methoprene. The food was compacted into the corner of each section and replenished in the same proportions  throughout the experiment. The containers were set in a light regulating incubator and data was collected each day for the following fourteen days. This data included the weight of each hornworm along with observations. Observational data was taken every five days and the observations noted color and development of the hornworms. When data for fifteen days was collected, statistical tests were used to compare the controll and experimental hornworms. These tests include finding the average weight, the standard deviation, and a one-tailed, two sample T test. 


Results:
This lab captured data in a fifteen day period that compared the weight of controll hornworms and experimental hornworms. During the experiment, it was noted that the controll and experimental groups remained similar in size and weight. The average controll group mass was 7.48 +/- 4.78 grams and the average experimental group mass was 8.09 +/- 5.29 grams. Similarity in mass throughout the lab can be represented in Figure 1. Each day provided only a slight difference in average mass until the  final four days, when the experimental group’s average mass surpassed that of the controll group. To statistically compare these average values, a one-tailed, two sample T-test was completed. The resulting p value was 0.25511, indicating significance, but showing only a small dispersion between the means. Although the statistical data does result in a significent difference between the hornworm groups, observational data showed a slower development of pigment in the experimental group than in the controll. Both controll and experimental hornworms began with a white coloration. The controll group changed into a vibrant green/blue by the end of the experiment. The experimental group never fully reached this color and did not develop color as quickly as the controll.  


Discussion:
The Manduca sexta’s adult development relies on a decrease in the concentration of JH, leading to metamorphosis and the transition into adulthood. For the worms treated with IGR Methoprene, it was initially predicted that growth will occur but development to adulthood will be unsuccessful. After fifteen days of data collection, the experimental and controll groups did not show significent weight distinctions. Color change was the only noticeable difference between the groups. Regardless of whether this data showed a larger difference, a measurement of weight would not have given an accurate assessment of development. The mass reflects food consumption, not a progression through phases. Although color varied between the two groups, this also cannot be used to judge a developmental stage. The experimental results do not provide enough information to support or refute the hypothesis. The time constraint on this experiment factored into the inconclusive data. None of the hornworms reached the pupation stage, making it difficult to determine the effect that  IGR Methoprene had on the experimental group. With more time, the Manduca sexta may have provided concrete observations such as undergoing metamorphosis and entering adulthood. Although results from this experiment neither support or disprove JH deterring insect growth, agriculture has begun incorporating JH analogs (JHAs) into their insecticides based on other supportive research. This reduces toxicity, showing only a slight behavioral effect on some insects and susceptibility in others during metamorphosis. JHAs however do not affect fish, birds, and mammals [Slama: 1971].  The future of JHAs being used within insecticides is heavily focused on specificity within the insecticide. Having the JHAs reach only a particular target insect is important for narrowing the number of insects it affects. Further studies could assess the efficiency of JHAs as insecticides in comparison to traditional chemicals and their effect on the environment. Although this experiment did not contribute to examining whether additional JH will affect adulthood, it can be recognized that more time to experiment and a larger concentration of IGR Methoprene could have yielded more significent results. A longer period may have allowed more time for pupation to occur. A higher dosage of IGR Methoprene could have lead to more recognizable differences between the Manduca sexta groups over the longer period.

Figure 1. This graph represents the average mass of caterpillars per day. To achieve this data, an average mass of the four caterpillars from each group (controll and experimental) was calculated for each day. Over the fifteen days, the average controll group mass was 7.48 +/- 4.78 grams and the average experimental group mass was 8.09 +/- 5.29 grams.
