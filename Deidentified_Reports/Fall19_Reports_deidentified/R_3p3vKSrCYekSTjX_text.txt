Title: THE EFFECT OF LIGHT INTENSITY ON PHOTOSYSTEM II ACTIVITY IN SPINACIA OLERACEA

Abstract:
The activity of photosystem II, a light-dependent reaction in photosynthesis, is affected by the intensity of light exposed to an autotroph, correlating to the circadian rhythm in photosynthesis. The circadian rhythm controlls the opening and closing of stroma in chloroplasts of plants. Autotrophs obtain energy by absorbing sunlight into their chloroplasts, and converting glucose to carbon dioxide and water [Anastasios: 1986].  In this experiment, the photosystem II activity in the leaves of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) was affected by the intensity of light.  This activity was determined by measuring the change in absorbance of DCIP, an alternative electron acceptor in the Hill Reaction, over the course of thirty minutes. The rate of electron transfer was measured, which is a direct indication of PSII activity. The results supported the hypothesis that the higher light intensities at 50% and 100% were directly correlated to the rate of PSII (p = 0.031 and p = 0.0058, respectively).  The longer the leaf was exposed to a higher intensity of light, the lower the absorbance readings, thus indicating high activity of PSII.  Further studies should focus on agricultural applications for the most efficient method to growing plants in varying locations where light intensity may fluctuate. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the chemical process in which autotrophs harvest light energy to synthesize food from water and carbon dioxide, as well as harvest ATP, the major energy-carrying molecule in biological organisms.  This process takes place in chloroplasts, the organelle responsible for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a three-stage process; the first two stages are light-dependent reactions, and the last stage is a light-independent reaction. The first stage is Photosystem II (PSII). In this reaction, electrons leave chlorophyll and move to plastoquinone (the electron acceptor accompanying Photosystem II [Stiehl: 1969]) due to the energy from absorbed photons of light [Tsuyoshi: 1997].  Plant growth is dependent on a series of interactions involving the presence of light. The intensity of light can have a direct effect on the activity of photosynthesis, which is consequently related to a plant’s ability to grow.  Different plants require varying strains of light, which is directly correlated to the PSII activity.  A spinach leaf (Spinacia oleracea), for example, is dependent on the presence and intensity of light, as is true for all different plants. In one experiment, the activity of photosynthesis was observed in green and yellow leaves by measuring absorbances at varying light intensities, including 50%.  The experiment showed that to bring the photosynthetic activity to its maximum, the intensity of light must increase [Emerson: 1929]. The present experiment examines how different light intensities, 0%, 50%, and 100%, affect Photosystem II activity was directly in spinach. In this experiment, it was hypothesized that the variation of light intensities exposed to spinach was directly correlated to the performance of PSII because light is a vital factor in the activity of photosynthesis. By comparing PSII activity of each sample at varying levels of light, we concluded that the higher intensity of light, 50% and 100% light intensity, caused a higher activity level of PSII.  


Materials and Method:
The Hill Reaction found that PSII will pass electrons to alternative electron acceptors, which make it PSII activity to measure. The molecule DCIP is an alternative electron acceptor that changes color from blue to colorless when reduced, and it absorbs light maximally at 600 nm.  In this lab, DCIP was utilized as an alternative electron acceptor for the Hill reaction by measuring the absorbance of DCIP at varying time intervals [Sandmann: 1980]. This absorbance ultimately expressed the rate of electron transfer for a given leaf, which correlated to the PSII activity. The central veins from four healthy leaves of spinach were removed, and the remainder of the leaf was ground up with 20 Ml of grinding buffer and a cold mortar and pestle. After no large chunks of the leaves remained,  the mixture was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker, which was then transferred into a chilled centrifuge tube.  This tube was centrifuged at 200 x G for three minutes at 4C.  After finished centrifuging, the supernatant was decanted into a new chilled centrifuge tube, which was centrifuged at 1000 x G for ten minutes at  4C.  This supernatant was decanted into a new tube, and 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and then suspended by stirring the mixture gently.  This completed part one of the experiment. For part two, 8 Ml of water was pipetted into the blank test tube, which also contained 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate.  The samples that contained no chloroplast contained 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate, and . The samples that had chloroplast in the dark (negative controll)  contained 6Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate, and 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts. The samples containing chloroplast in 50% and 100% light contained 6 Ml of water, 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate, and 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts, with the only difference being that sample exposed to 50% was placed under a light covered by a mesh cloth, while the 100% light intensity sample was not under any mesh cloth. Using the blank sample, a spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nm.  The initial absorbances of each sample was measured. After 10 minutes, the same process was performed. This was repeated at 20 minutes and 30 minutes. The average percent error of each triplicate was calculated using the measured absorbances, along with the standard error, and p_value.  A paired two sample t_test and a two-tailed p_value was used to evaluate the results.

Results:
When compared to the samples in the dark, the samples at 50% light intensity had a statistically significently higher percent change in PSII activity of 13.6% compared to a 2.39% change of the samples in the dark.  The samples at 100% light intensity also had a statistically significently higher percent change in PSII activity compared to the samples in dark, having a percent change of 30.51%.  The percent change increased noticeably at higher light intensities (50% and 100%) as time increased from 0 minutes to 30 minutes. The percent changes over time for each sample are displayed in Figure 1.  The mean of the controll groups were statistically significently different than the experimental groups in 50% and 100% light [(50%) t_stat = -5.59, d.f. = 2 , P = 0.031; (100%) t_stat = -13.00130113, d.f. = 2 , P = 0.0058].

Discussion:
The data suggests that increased light intensity over time impacts the PSII activity, supporting the hypothesis.  Since Photosystem II is a light-dependent reaction in photosynthesis, it is not surprising that the intensity of light has such great impact on the activity of PSII in plants.  The data from this experiment supports that claim.  The close percent change values for the samples without chloroplast as well as the chloroplasts exposed to no light indicate that photosynthetic activity is dependent upon light exposure. Previous studies have shown that the circadian rhythm of photosynthesis, which can be affected by light intensity, reflects changes in PSII [Samuelsson: 1983], supporting my hypothesis. Circadian rhythms are the 24-hour day/night cycle of the planet, which affects many organisms, including plants, such as the opening and closing of flowers during the day and night. Photosynthesis is an important circadian rhythm in autotrophs, as photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert carbon dioxide to sugar and water, and the tiny openings in plants, stomata, regulate the CO2 taken in and the water and sugar expelled by opening and closing, which occur during the day and night [Hennessey: 1991].  Although this experiment does not directly address circadian rhythm, the results may have broader implications on day and night cycles of autotrophs.
