Title: Examining the Effect of Light Color on Photosystem II Activity

Abstract:
Photosystem II is a protein complex in chloroplasts which uses light energy to cleave water molecules, starting the process of photosynthesis. This experiment examined the effect of light color on photosystem II activity, testing red, blue, and white light. Chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves and given Blue DCIP to react with. Absorbance was measured with a spectrophotometer prior to beginning the experiment and after every 10 minutes of incubation under light. Blue light was found to have the highest percent change in absorbance after 30 minutes at 37.6%, followed by white light at 25.2% and red light at 13.7%. Each group was found to be significently different from one another using an ANOVA test. It was concluded that the color of light does have an effect on photosystem II activity, it is likely that the blue light color which is closer to the UV spectrum has more energy and is able to excite electrons easier, leading to higher photosystem II activity.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a vital process which produces the vast majority of bioavailable energy in Earth’s ecosystems. It is also a key part of the carbon cycle, fixing atmospheric carbon for use by living organisms and producing gaseous oxygen as a byproduct. Photosynthesis only occurs in chloroplasts, which are organelles found in plant cells and certain other microorganisms. Photosystem II is a specialized protein complex which uses light energy to remove electrons from water, splitting it and creating gaseous oxygen as a byproduct. This is the first step in the process of photosynthesis, and it’s rate determines the overall rate of photosynthesis in the chloroplast. The activity of photosystem II has been known to vary based on light color [Pfündel: 2018] and light intensity [Ohnishi: 2005]. This experiment focused on the effect light color has on photosystem II activity, answering the question: does light color have an effect on photosystem II activity? This experiment tested white, blue, and red light at the same intensity. The hypothesis was that photosystem II activity would not be significently different between red, blue, and white light. 


Materials and Method:
1.  A mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 Ml size), and 3 50Ml centrifuge tubes were packed into crushed ice to cool.
2.  While the mortar and pestle were cooling, the large central veins were removed from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves. The veins were thrown away, and the remaining leaf pieces were rinsed with tap water. Any excess moisture from the leaves was blotted off.
3.  Once the mortar and pestle became cold, it was wiped dry, and the spinach leaves were added to it.
4.  10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) were added. The spinach was ground until it became a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left.
5.  An additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added, mixed with the spinach slurry, and the entire volume of green slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker.
6.  The green liquid was transferred to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge and spun at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4oC. 
7.  The supernatant was poured out of the tube into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube. The pellet of debris was left at the bottom of the tube.
8.  The 50 Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC.
9.   The supernatant was poured out. Special attention was paid to not to disturb the pellet. The tube with pellet was placed on ice.
10.  20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and suspended by gentle stirring with a transfer pipet. 200 μl of this resuspended pellet was transferred into a microtube labeled “Sample”, & stored on ice.
11. A spectrophotometer was turned on and set to 600nm. It was then blanked with DI water.
12. 9 test tubes were labelled as shown in Table 1, and all solutions added except the enriched chloroplasts. 
13. Enriched chloroplasts were then added and initial absorbance readings taken. Each tube then underwent ten-minute incubation periods under their corresponding direct fluorescent light source so that the light intensity was between 535 and 560 lux.
14. At the end of the first incubation period, 2Ml of each sample was pipetted into a labeled, corresponding cuvette for absorbance testing. 
15. Absorbance was recorded for each tube. 
16. This process of incubation was repeated 2 times for all samples for a total of 30 minutes incubation, with recordings of absorbance also taken at 20 minutes and 30 minutes. The mean of each triplicate group was taken at all 3 time intervals.
17.  An ANOVA test was used to compare the mean percent changes in absorbance after 30 mins in order to determine significance between each of the groups.

Results:
The mean percentage change in absorbance after 30 minutes differed significently between all 3 groups (p= .0000866, white-blue: significent, white-red: significent, blue-red: significent), therefore the null hypothesis is rejected. The mean percentage changes in absorbance after 30 minutes were 25.2% for white light, 13.7% for red light, and 37.6% for blue light. Figure 1 shows how the mean absorbance changed at each ten-minute interval.


Discussion:
The results did not support the null hypothesis, they suggest that light color does have an effect on photosystem II activity. The color of light that had the highest photosystem II activity was blue, and the color with the least photosystem II activity was red light. White light was the intermediate in terms of inducing photosystem II activity. These results may be explained by a difference in energy between the light colors, as the different colors of light have different wavelengths and therefore carry different amounts of energy. Because blue light has shorter wavelengths than red light, the blue light carries more energy even in the same light intensity and can therefore excite electrons easier than red light, leading to greater photosystem II activity levels. The results of this experiment align with the results of some previous experiments [Muneer: 2014], and contradict others [Pfündel: 2018]. However, even in the experiment that is contradictory to this one, the finding was that there wasn’t a significent difference between blue and red light. The discrepancy in results may be due to the focus being on different parts of the chloroplast or photosynthetic cycle.
