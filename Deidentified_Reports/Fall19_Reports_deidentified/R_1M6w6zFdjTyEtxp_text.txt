Title: The effect of magnesium sulfate and nitrate fertilizers on the root:shoot ratio of Vigna radiate.

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to determine if magnesium sulfate and nitrate fertilizers had an effect on the allocation of resources to the roots and shoots of mung beans, Vigna radiate, by measuring the root:shoot ratios of length and weight. The controll group was given water every day, while the two treatment groups were given magnesium sulfate and nitrate solutions respectively. After two weeks, the mass and lengths of the roots and shoots of plants from each group were measured and recorded. An ANOVA statistical test was used to analyze the significance of the results. It was determined that root:shoot length ratio among groups was insignificent, while root:shoot weight ratio among groups was significent. These results conclude that fertilizer affects the root:shoot length ratio but not the root:shoot weight ratio. However, these results tend to be inconsistent with other studies.


Introduction:
All plants exhibit an ever changing allocation pattern under adverse conditions to devote more or less resources to a certain aspect of their phenotype in order to survive. For example, the roots of a plant are an absorptive organ, and thus, if there is a deficit of water, the plant will allocate more resources to grow the roots to absorb as much water as possible. A way to determine this allocation is to measure the root to shoot ratio of plants to help determine which physical structure the plant allocated more resources to. In short, this is referred to as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson: 2016]. Agricultural farmers worldwide have strategically taken advantage of the plasticity of plants by using fertilizers to supplement deficiencies of nutrients in the soil to facilitate growth. This study was conducted to examine how different fertilizers actually effect the roots and shoots of plants. A study found that nitrogen deficient soil has been known to reduce leaf area, leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate, which all lead to lower biomass production in plants [Zhao: 2005]. Similarly, another study suggests that magnesium deficient soil inhibits root growth in plants [Cakmak: 1994]. Given these findings, it can be shown that deficiencies in nutrients lead to growth effects of the roots and shoots of plants, and therefore, effect the root:shoot ratio of these plants. While plants respond negatively to nutrient deficiencies, plants usually respond well to nitrogen sufficient fertilizers by exhibiting a visible effect of an increase in the root growth. In a study done on the effect of fertilizer on birch and sycamore-maple tree growth, there was 50% more root growth than shoot growth; hence, a greater root:shoot ratio [Harris: 1992]. Given the results of these studies, it is shown that fertilizers do exhibit an effect on a plant’s phenotypic plasticity. This study used mung beans because they are quick and easy to grow in a greenhouse setting, and thus, are feasible to use to display phenotypic plasticity. Given that nutrient-deficient plants exhibit less growth than plants with sufficient nutrients, it was predicted that by supplying mung beans with two types of fertilizers, magnesium sulfate and nitrate, there will be an increase in the root:shoot ratio due to the increase of growth in the roots.


Materials and Method:
Nine seeds of mung beans, Vigna radiata, were planted in a vase filled with vermiculate and watered with 100 Ml of Miracle-Gro. This action was repeated nine times to have a total of nine vases: three groups with three vases of plants each. The three groups consisted of the controll group, and two treatment groups. The controll group was watered with 600Ml of water. The first treatment group was watered with 600 Ml of a 1:4 dilution of nitrate and water, which was labeled as the first fertilizer group. The second treatment group was watered with 600Ml of a 1:4 dilution of magnesium sulfate and water, which was labeled as the second fertilizer group. Each group was watered with their respective solutions every day for two weeks in the controllled setting of a green house. After two weeks, the plants were harvested and two plants from each vase, so six plants per treatment group were collected from the vermiculate. Each plant was weighed and measured for total length and weight. The roots were separated from the shoots of each plants at the root-shoot junction, and then, the roots and shoots were weighed and recorded for each plant. The maximum root and shoot length of each plant was measured and recorded as well. Using these measurements, the root:shoot ratios were calculated for the weight and length of each plant, which was done by dividing the root length by the shoot length for each chosen plant, and then again with the weight. The average root:shoot ratios were determined for each group. An ANOVA statistical test was used to determine the differences among the average root:shoot ratios of the plants for the controll group and the two treatment groups. If the p_value was below 0.05, a Tukey-Kramer statistical test was used to determine among which groups were significent.


Results:
The average root:shoot ratio for length was 1.21 (±0.16) for the controll group, 1.47 (±0.23) for the nitrate group, and 1.38 (±0.29) for the magnesium sulfate group. These results can be observed in Figure 1. The ANOVA statistical test showed that these results were insignificent (p=0.187). The average root:shoot ratio for weight was 0.83 (±0.29) for the controll group, 1.17 (±0.21) for the nitrate group, and 1.2 (±0.23) for the magnesium sulfate group. These results can be observed in Figure 2. The ANOVA statistical test showed that these results were significent (p=0.038). The Tukey-Kramer test showed that among these groups, the root:shoot ratio for weight had a significent difference between nitrate and magnesium sulfate groups.


Discussion:
The results suggested that root:shoot length ratios were not affected by nitrate and magnesium sulfate fertilizers, while the root:shoot weight ratios were affected by nitrate and magnesium sulfate fertilizers. The difference between the nitrate group and magnesium sulfate group’s root:shoot weight ratios were significent as seen in Table 2. This result showed that magnesium sulfate and nitrate fertilizers did affect the mung bean plants phenotypic plasticity differently. The results support the hypothesis, because root:shoot ratios were bigger for fertilizer groups, but only to a significent degree for weight. A possible explanation for these results is that since nutrients were not depleted in any of the groups, the plants did not need to exhibit phenotypic plasticity by growing the length of their roots to acquire more nutrients. However, the adequate supply of nutrients by the fertilizers allowed the plants in these groups to grow fruitfully and accumulate more biomass in their roots. These results are conflicting because it is hard to determine why the length ratios were unaffected by fertilizer, while the weight ratios were affected. These results are also conflicting because many studies state that nitrogen fertilization decreases root:shoot weight ratio, while this study supported that they increased. Such as an experiment done with maize (Zea mays l.) that found that nitrogen fertilization significently decreased the root:shoot weight ratio, while root length remained unchanged or increased [Anderson: 1988]. However, in another study, nitrogen deficiency enhanced root growth and not shoot growth, while the leaf dry weight was higher in the increased nitrogen treatment group than in the controll group [Grechi: 2007]. While this study did not experiment with nitrogen deficient soil and given that a lack of nitrogen increased root growth, then this corollary should be tested for in the future. Furthermore, in a study done with the beans, Phaseolus vulgaris grown in magnesium deficient soil, the root:shoot dry weight ratio was smaller than for the controll group that had sufficient nutrients [Cakmak: 1994]. Given these results, root:shoot length ratio has been found to increase with fertilization and in nutrient deficient environments. At the same time, root:shoot weight ratio has been found to decrease with fertilization and in nutrient deficient environments. Due to these incompatible studies, it is hard whether to deduce if a reduction in the root:shoot ratio is a result of sufficient or deficient nutrients in the soil and if an increase in the root:shoot ratio is result of the contrary. A plant cannot exhibit phenotypic plasticity if it does not have the energy resources from nutrients to grow. With this, there seems to be a paradox between a deficiency of nutrients in the soil for plants to have the resources to grow their roots successfully and plants exhibiting phenotypic plasticity to acquire these deficient nutrients. Due to this ambiguity, this study should be repeated in the future numerous times to verify that these results were not random. Similarly, another treatment group should be added that has nutrient deficient soil to examine the effect it has on root:shoot ratios. Determining fertilizer’s effect on plants is important because although fertilizers provide necessary nutrients for plants to grow, they can also be toxic chemicals and pollutants to other biotas. Knowing the exact effect of particular fertilizers can determine if they are more of a benefit to humans or a cost to the environment.
