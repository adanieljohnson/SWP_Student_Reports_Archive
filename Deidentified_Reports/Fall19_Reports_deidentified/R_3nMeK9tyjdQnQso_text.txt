Title: The Effect of Azaguard on the Development of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to explore the key hormones of an insect’s life cycle and development. In this study, the organism studied is the Manduca Sexta which is considered a pest when they are young. The hypothesis that was being tested was if Azaguard (E20) is added to the food supply of Manduca Sexta (hornworm caterpillars) then the weight of the caterpillars will decrease and eventually cause death. Since E20 is necessary for an incest’s development into an adult, the goal was to inhibit the hormone intact and see the effect is had on the development. To test our hypothesis and gain insight into how E20 works within early development, a control group and an experimental group were used to aid in qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Both groups were given the same amount of food, however, the experimental group was given Azaguard and the control group was given water only which was mixed into their food supply. The results showed that all the caterpillars in the experimental group decreased in weight and died before the experiment was completed after fourteen days. Whereas, all the caterpillars in the control group survived and were healthy. The conclusion of the experiment supported the fact that E20 is essential for development in an insect’s life. 



Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the hornworm caterpillar, is the study of the experiment that was conducted. This type of caterpillar “is a widely used model for biochemical research” [Kanost: 2004]. Ecdysterone (E20) and juvenile hormone (JH) are two relevant hormones that are necessary for incest development, molting, and eventually the emrgence of adult insects. E20 regulates the timing of molting during the insect’s early development and is the focus of the experiment that was performed. Azaguard is a formulated insect growth regulator and blocker to the hornworm’s growth because it prevents molting between larval, pupal and nymphal stages [Herrick: 2017]. Essentially it is an E20 inhibitor. If Azaguard or E20 is added to the food supply during the early stages of the Manduca Sexta’s life cycle, then the weight of the caterpillars will decrease and cause death.

Materials and Methods:
The experiment dealt with eight individual caterpillars and were then divided into two groups- a control group and an experimental group- in two separate containers. Each caterpillar had its own compartment within the container. Within the control group, each caterpillar was given ten grams of food that was grounded up and laced with five drops of water. Within the experimental group, each caterpillar was given ten grams of food that was grounded up and laced with five drops of Azaguard (E20). The weights of the individual caterpillars was weighed daily using a scale and general observations on the caterpillar’s appearance was recorded. After the two weeks (14 days) of gathering data was completed, the data collected was used and ran a statistical analysis of a two-sample T-test to find a p-value (significance of the data of the experiment) and the standard deviation to measure the variance of the data.

Results:
Over the course of 14 days, the control caterpillars showed increasing weight and remained very healthy. They were bright blue in color, highly active, and showed an increase in weight gain all fourteen days as seen in Figure 2. However the experimental caterpillars were all dead by day 10, so there data ends earlier than the control group. They were dark in color, mangled, soft to the touch, and were noticeably smaller than the control caterpillars. As shown in Figure 3., the experimental caterpillars’ weights increased within 2 days then gradually decreased over the course of the following days until till death on day 10. Figure 1 displays the average change in weight of the two groups in addition with their individual standard deviations. In Figure 1, the  averages (means) of both the experimental group (-0.04925 grams) and the control group (6.488 grams). The standard deviations of both the experimental group (+/- 0.02 grams) and the control group ( +/- 1.4grams). The two-sample T-test was run and it yielded a  p-value of 8.46E-5 (0.0000846), which is lower than the parameter value of 0.05.


Discussion:
The hypothesis of the experiment conducted was that the E20 would negatively impact the Manduca Sexta’s development and was supported by the experiment. Azaguard which contains E20 which is an insect growth inhibitor that prevents molting during the earlier stages of development [Herrick: 2017]. This was proven through observations because the caterpillar’s sizes were greatly different than the control group’s size indicating that the caterpillars were not able to molt into the next stage in development. It was clear that the caterpillars in the experimental group were not molting into the next stage in development because they were not gaining weight and there was no evidence of molting in the compartments. Whereas, the control group caterpillars had evidence of white, flaky skin indicating that there was activity of molting and shedding into the next stage in development. The observations were then supported by the two-sample test because it yielded a p-value lower than the parameter value, which concluded that the results are significant. In the future, repeating experiments with Azaguard can further the understanding of its effects by differing the amount of Azaguard in the food supply of the caterpillars. The amount of Azaguard utilized in this experiment could be different so adding less could offer insight into whether or not the caterpillars survive the full length of time. The information obtained from these experiments could potentially help maintain and control the populations of similar insects that are considered pests.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The Mean Weight of Experimental and Control Caterpillars
This figure shows the mean weight of the experimental and the control group of the caterpillars. The experimental group’s average was found by subtracting the final weights minus the initial weights of the caterpillars. Their average was -0.04925 grams with a standard deviation of +/- 0.02 grams indicating the weight loss. The control group’s average was found by subtracting the final weights minus the initial weights of the caterpillars. Their average was 6.488 grams with a standard deviation of +/- 1.4 grams indicating the weight gain.

Figure 2. Graph of the Weight of the Control Caterpillars over 14 Days
This graph shows the gradual increase in weight of the control caterpillars over fourteen days. 

Figure 3. Graph of the Weight of the Treatment Caterpillars over 10 Days
This graph shows the increase in weight of the experimental caterpillars then the decrease in weight over ten days because the caterpillars died before the end of the experiment.
