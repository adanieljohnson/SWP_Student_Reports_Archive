Title: The Effects of Salinity on Photosynthesis Rate in Green Spinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of salinity on the rate of photosynthesis in spinacia oleracea. Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods such as glucose from carbon dioxide and water. We wanted to test whether higher levels of salinity inhibit photosynthesis. The spinach leaves were ground up in dilutions of various concentrations of salinity, 20:1 and 10:1 dilutions of 2M NaCl. The absorbances were measured of the solutions with salt and those without salt in just water to determine whether photosynthesis would occur. An increase in absorbance meant that photosynthesis was inhibited and a decrease in absorbance meant that photosynthesis proceeded. In studies conducted similar to this one, conclusions that salinity decreases the rate of photosynthesis in plants were made. Based off these conclusions, it was hypothesized that an increase in salinity decreases the overall rate of photosynthesis. To verify this, two-tailed t-tests were used to calculate the difference in photosynthetic rates. From the two-tailed t-tests, the p-values were both lower than the benchmark value of 0.05, thus meaning that the data was significant enough to support the original hypothesis. 

Introduction:
In this lab we will observe the effects of salinity on the rate of photosynthesis in green spinach leaves. Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods such as glucose from carbon dioxide and water. Oxygen is a byproduct of this reaction. Photosynthesis requires energy for it to function by a process called primary active transport, moving a substance against its concentration gradient. The sodium-potassium pump is another pathway or process that uses primary active transport. Salinity has been found to affect photosynthesis rates in plants as more sodium ions disrupt the normal sodium-potassium ratio within the plant cell that allows for materials to diffuse properly into plant cells [P. Sudhir et al: 2004]. It has also been concluded from other studies that salt primarily affects diffusion of carbon dioxide in the leaves through a decrease in stomatal and mesophyll conductances [Rasmuson, Kaylie E., and Jay E. Anderson: 2001]. Based on these results, it can be hypothesized that an increase in salinity decreases the overall rate of photosynthesis. This will be tested by measuring photosynthetic activity via absorption in spinach leaves in a normal solution of water and two other solutions with low and high salt concentrations.  

Materials and Methods:
The experiment began by removing the central veins from three leaves of spinacia oleracea. The leaves were then ground down with 10mL of the grinding buffer solution. Once ground completely with no chunks of leaves remaining, an additional 10mL of grinding buffer was added and mixed thoroughly again. The solution composed of the spinach and grinding buffer were then strained through cheesecloth to collect and remove any large chunks that were not completely ground. To a centrifuge, the solution was added, while in another separate centrifuge, water of the same volume was measured to allow for a proper balance between the two centrifuges in the spectrofuge. Both centrifuges were spun twice, once at 200rpm for three minutes, and for the second time for the same time and rate. Ten test tubes were then prepared with 2mL of reaction buffer solution, and 6mL of water was added to each tube. For six of the tubes, 2M NaCl was added. Three tubes had a ratio of 10:1, 2M NaCl, and three tubes had a ratio of 20:1, 2M NaCl. Of the four remaining test tubes, three were used as the control group with just water and the reaction buffer and one was used as a buffer. The absorbances were taken of the solutions using a spectrophotometer at 600nm.



Results:
Over three time periods of ten minutes, twenty minutes, and thirty minutes respectively, the absorbance levels of the spinach leaves were recorded. As observed in the graph, the 10:1 diluted NaCl increased, suggesting that photosynthesis would not occur, however, this had the lowest average absorbance compared to the others. This suggests photosynthesis would not occur as easily as the other solutions, or even at all. The 20:1 dilution increased, then decreased a little suggesting that photosynthesis would occur, but at a lower level. As for the light, the relative average absorbances were higher than the solutions with NaCl, suggesting that photosynthesis would proceed. 

Discussion:
In the end, the original hypothesis that an increase in salinity administered to the leaves decreases the rate of photosynthesis stands and is supported by the collected data. The calculated p-values of 0.00346165365269328 for the 20:1 dilution and 0.0000096221099715978 for the 10:1 dilution was significant enough to support the original hypothesis. The data collected supports and falls in line with the conclusions of the two studies mentioned in the introduction. The addition and increase of salinity indeed decreased the rate of photosynthesis in the spinach leaves, with leaf solutions with higher concentrations of salt having even lower rates of photosynthesis and an increase in absorbance. In the samples without salt, the control group, the value of absorbance decreased, indicating that photosynthesis did indeed occur. From there, there were two other samples, one diluted with 2M NaCl 20:1 and the other with 2M NaCl 10:1 dilution. In the 20:1 dilution, absorbance did decrease a little and the rate of photosynthesis was slowed, but only just slightly. Compared to the 10:1 dilution where there was a higher concentration of salt, absorbance actually increased, thus, photosynthesis did not proceed. The 20:1 2M NaCl dilution was enough to slow the rate of photosynthesis, but not enough to completely stop it from occurring. 

For future study, we would like to test the effects of salinity on the overall growth of green plants or plants in general, knowing that it affects the rate of photosynthesis. It would be interesting to see if the plants would die since photosynthesis would be hard to come by in salty conditions.
