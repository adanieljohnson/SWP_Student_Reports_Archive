Title: Juvenile hormone in the immature Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a moth that lives throughout North America. In its larval stage, Manduca sexta feeds on foliage and other crops, affecting North America’s agriculture. Thus, studying the growth of Manduca sexta can possibly help prevent negative agricultural consequences. Since they are considered pests when they are larvae, it could be beneficial for Manduca sexta to become adults as quickly as possible. They are good model organisms because they are easy to obtain and are numerous in population. Researchers studied juvenile hormone and juvenile hormone esterase, which helps clear away juvenile hormone in fifth instar larvae. [Browder: 2001]. Usually, juvenile hormone esterase reaches a peak right before Manduca sexta starts to look for a place to pupate, suggesting to researchers that it might play a role in the timing of pupation [Browder: 2001]. The researchers found that juvenile hormone esterase did not affect the timing of pupation [Browder: 2001]. We wanted to determine if juvenile hormone would affect the growth of the caterpillar. If we treat the Manduca sexta with ten drops of Juvenile Hormones in their food, then there will be a negative effect on the timing of their transition to the pupal stage and they will lose weight. 

Materials and Method:
In our experiment, we had a controll group with four Manduca sexta caterpillars and an experimental group with four Manduca sexta. Our TA gave us the caterpillars. Each caterpillar was given ten grams of food. The controll group’s food had ten drops of deionized water. The experimental group’s food had ten drops of juvenile hormone. When the caterpillar’s food dried up or they ate it all, we gave them more food as well as the appropriate treatment (water or juvenile hormone). We weighed them once a day, for fifteen days, and they stayed in the incubator. We used a two-tailed p_value to determine significance of our results, which are as follows: 

Results:
Both the caterpillars in the controll group and the experimental group gained weight each day. The controll group’s average mass was 14.10 grams (sd=0.66). The experimental group’s 
average mass was 13.16 grams (sd=1.52). The two-tailed p_value was 0.3. 


Discussion:
Our group hypothesized that the experimental group caterpillars would weigh significently less than the controll group caterpillars. Although the average weight of the experimental group was 0.96 grams less than that of the controll group, the p_value was 0.3, and the threshold for significance is a p_value less than 0.05. Therefore, the data did not support our hypothesis. Upon replication, the researcher should take care to choose caterpillars with similar initial weights. Since the caterpillars can grow at different rates, this might make any discrepancies easier to detect. It would also help standardize the methodology, as the average of the experimental group’s weight was brought down by experimental caterpillar #4. Juvenile hormone is the hormone that keeps the caterpillars in the larval stages. Researchers compared the affect of juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta and Drosophila [Mirth: 2013]. To do so, they used the established role of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta: to manage body size and the timing of metamorphosis [Mirth: 2013]. The researchers note that if more juvenile hormone is present, the larvae have more time to grow; thus, they could grow to be bigger than those whose juvenile hormone supply has been naturally cut off by their bodies [Mirth: 2013]. This phenomena might be best studied by researchers who have more time with their caterpillars and can see the insects into the adult stages. As larvae, Manduca sexta are pests that can disrupt agricultural patterns. It is in the best interest of humans for Manduca sexta to molt into moths as soon as possible. The increased presence of juvenile hormone does not necessarily prevent the molt from occurring.
