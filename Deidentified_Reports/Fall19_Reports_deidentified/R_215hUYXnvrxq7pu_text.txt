Title: Effects of 20E Blocker AzaGuard on the Life Cycle on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
NA

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a moth most commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm or the Carolina Sphinx Moth. This organism is well known to gardeners and farmers as these insects feed on tomatoes and tobacco, eating entire leaves and sometimes the green fruit itself. These caterpillars eat increasingly more amounts of the plant as they go through their life cycle, eating 90% of all that it eats in its final instar phase [Capinera: 2001]. The life cycle of this organism ranges from 39-48 days, the stages of its life cycle being 1st Instar Larva, 2nd Instar Larva, 3rd Instar Larva, 4th Instar Larva, 5th Instar Larva, Pupa, and Adult Moth [Johnson: 2019]. To proceed through one stage to the next, the caterpillar will have to proceed through a molting process in which a new outer layer is produced while the old layer is shed. The life cycle of Manduca sexta is regulated primarily by the hormones juvenile hormone, J.H., and ecdysterone. J.H. is a hormone produced by the corpus allata. Its main function is to regulate the type of molt of the caterpillar. Ecdysterone is a hormone that is secreted by the prothoracic gland. The main function of this hormone is that it regulates the timing of molting. The concentration ratio of these two hormones is important to the development of the organism; the manipulation of either hormone could result in major dysfunction of the organism's life cycle. [Johnson: 2019]. Ecdysterone is especially crucial towards the end of Manduca sexta’s life cycle. Rises and peaks of ecdysterone indicate to the organism to molt into the final adult form before pupating. It is also critical in the development of the adult moth [Tublitz:1997] AzaGuard is a specific insecticide that behaves as an insect growth regulator. The insecticide acts as an ecdysterone blocker, blocking the ecdysterone produced by the prothoracic glands. If Manduca sexta is treated with AzaGuard, they will have a shortened life cycle and have a decrease in mass.


Materials and Methods:
 The materials used for this experiment were the AzaGuard (1:1250 concentration) 20 E blocker, Manduca sexta instar larva, caterpillar food, water, and the 26.5°C Incubator. There were two groups of 4 caterpillars being tested. Group 1 was the control group and Group 2 was the experimental group. Each group was placed in a four-section divided container, with 2 holes along the side for airflow. The caterpillars in Group 1 were given 8 drops of water onto 10 grams of food daily for 2 weeks. The caterpillars in Group 2 were given 8 drops of AzaGuard onto 10 grams of good daily for 2 weeks. The food was checked and changed daily to maintain its moisture, as this was the only source of water intake for the caterpillars. The caterpillars remained in the incubator unless data was being collected. To monitor the progression through the life cycle of the organisms, photos were taken each day of the caterpillars. Furthermore, to monitor the physical aspects of the organism, the weight of each caterpillar was taken daily. At the end of the two weeks, the two groups’ data were compared. The average size of the caterpillars of each day was determined. T-tests were conducted to determine significant differences between the two groups and P values were calculated to determine if the differences were actually because of the experiment or due to random chance.


Results:
The results of this experiment showed a significantly lower mass of the caterpillars in the experimental group with ecdysterone than those in the control group. This data can be seen in Figure 1 below. The statistical tests completed on the data collected concluded that there was a significant difference between the experimental groups and that the results were due to aspects of the experiment rather than random chance (t-value= 3.89, p-value= 0.000352). As the graph depicts, the average caterpillar of the control group grew steadily throughout the two weeks, while the average caterpillar of the experimental groups ceased in obtaining significant mass early on in the experiment. In the control group, one caterpillar died on day thirteen, while the rest of the organisms survived the entire experiment. In the experimental groups, one caterpillar died on day nine, two caterpillars died on day ten, and the last caterpillar died on day eleven. On the graph, by day eleven the data for the experimental group is terminated, as all four caterpillars had died by that point. 

Discussion:
Ultimately, the hypothesis was supported by the results of this experiment. The experiment demonstrated that when caterpillars are exposed to Ecdeystrone Blocker AzaGuard that not only will they not grow and progress through their life cycle, but rather the lack of molting and growth will lead to the ultimate death of the caterpillars. The P-value supports the alternate hypothesis that adding 20 E Blocker will decrease the growth of the caterpillars. Because the P-value was well below the acceptable range so therefore the null hypothesis is rejected. Ecdysterone has proven to be crucial to the survival of the Manduca sexta. The caterpillars did not proceed to the 4th and 5th instar stages as there were no rises in ecdysterone to initiate this change. Furthermore, these caterpillars could never have progressed to the full adult stage and develope in the pupa, as it requires a substantial amount of ecdysterone to complete this process [Tublitz: 1997]. With the addition of Azaguard as an insecticide, Manduca sexta’s impact on a farmer’s produce could be greatly lessened, resulting in a higher yield of produce. This same experiment could prove to be useful in other instances where the ceasing of the life cycle of a particular insect would be beneficial. For instance, experiments on Bombyx mori, more commonly known as the silkworm, resulted in similar results as this experiment. In the experiment, the ecdysterone blocker was “extremely effective in producing pupal deformities and larval-growth inhibition in Bombyx mori”[Koul: 1987]. The knowledge that blocking ecdysterone results in the altering of the life cycle of multiple pests could be used in order to better create methods of protecting produce in the future.
