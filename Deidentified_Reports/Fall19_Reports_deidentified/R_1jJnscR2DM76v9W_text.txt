Title: Resource Allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum Plants Exposed to Acidic Environments

Abstract:
The study of plant health is at the forefront of current scientific discussion as climate change is increasingly impacting plant health and imposing new environmental pressures. One of the many measurable aspects of plant health that indicate how individual organisms respond to environmental pressures is resource allocation. There are several environmental factors have the ability to affect resource allocation in plants, especially environmental pH. Fagopyrum esculentum, commonly known as buckwheat, is a plant with which resource allocation can be studied given soil of different acidities. To measure the resource allocation in our plants, the root-to-shoot weight ratios were calculated in order to determine where growth was directed in each individual. We hypothesized that plants exposed to acidic pH values will have a greater root-to-shoot ratio as they will expend more resources in roots in order to reach a more tolerable pH environment. In our experiment, we exposed half of our seeds to normal environmental conditions, and half to an acidic solution. After a week of growth, the masses of each individual were recorded as well as the masses of the roots and shoots of each in order to determine the root-to-shoot ratios, which are indicative of the plant’s resource allocation. Bas

Introduction:
Resource allocation describes the tendency of plants to redirect their resources depending on environmental challenges [Johnson: 2019]. This allows for individual organisms to adapt to their surroundings and provide for optimal growth. Environmental challenges can arise from various factors, both biotic and abiotic, such as alkaline or acidic conditions, pollution, dryness, sun exposure (or lack thereof), and nutrient density in the soil [Johnson: 2019]. Understanding the effect that the environment has on plant growth is essential as we share our environment with these species and rely on them as energy sources, and as key species in ecosystem maintenance. While environments are constantly changing, especially today, the topic of resource allocation in plants and the impact of changing environments on how plants grow is increasingly studied. In a paper published in Physiologia Plantarum, photosynthetic and metabolic processes were found to be hindered in bean plants treated with acidic solution designed to simulate acid rain [Velikova: 1999]. These hindered processes could have been attributed to low membrane permeability and increased stomatal acidity inflicted by the simulation [Velikova: 1999]. In a study published by the American Society of Plant Biologists, green pepper plants exposed to acidic fog experienced a profound decrease in photosynthetic rate and growth [Takemoto: 1988]. It was found that the individuals exposed to fog with a low pH value yielded reductions in stem and leaf mass [Takemoto: 1988]. This is indicative of resource allocation as cell acidification prevents the allocation of the resources and nutrients required for photosynthetic activities in the subject plants [Takemoto: 1988]. In order to further study the impact of acidic environments on resource allocation in plants, buckwheat seeds were exposed to normal soil conditions and acidic soil conditions in order to tell differences in plant growth in sprouted seeds in response to pH solutions of 3.5. In a paper published by the Department of Agronomy at the University of Missouri Extension, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) seeds were determined to tolerate soils of pH down to a value of about 5 [Myers: 1994].  With this knowledge of optimal buckwheat conditions, the effect of an acidic environment below tolerable pH values presented itself as a researchable topic in the context of plant resource allocation. We hypothesized that buckwheat seeds that are exposed to soil of pH 3.5 will have a great root:shoot ratio in terms of mass compared to buckwheat seeds that are exposed to soil of neutral pH.  


Materials and Method:
Six planters were prepared by filling each to the top with soil, then adding a scoop of Miracle-Gro™ to each, spreading evenly. 15 seeds were added to each planter and saturated with water then placed in the greenhouse for the remainder of our week long experiment. Each day, once a day, the planters were watered with 150 Ml of water to each planter, and to the three experimental planters, 50 Ml of aqueous pH 3.5 solution was added to each planter. After 8 days, the plants were removed from each planter and rinsed and dried. This allowed for accurate massing of the individuals. Three individuals from each planter were analyzed. The mass of the entire individual was recorded, followed by the mass of the shoots alone, obtained by cutting the individual at the root and shoot junction. From these two masses, the mass of the root could be calculated by subtracting shoot mass from the total mass. This data allowed for the calculation of the root to shoot ratio, simply performed by dividing the root mass by the shoot mass. The average root:shoot ratio was recorded for the controll group then again for the experimental group. A two-sample t_test was used to determine the significance of our data. 


Results:
Our experiment yielded nonsignificent data with a p_value equal to 0.25. The average root:shoot ratios of the controll buckwheat individuals did not show a clear pattern of difference compared to the root:shoot ratios of experimental individuals. As shown in figure one, the average root:shoot ratios of the controll and experimental group are displayed with the average controll weight ratio being 0.283, and the average experimental weight ratio being 0.393. The p_value indicates a 25% likelihood that our data patterns were due to chance, which is above the 5% accepted value.  The error bars represent our standard deviation and express that our experimental group individuals displayed more variation in their root:shoot ratios than did controll group individuals. The maximum weight recorded of a controll individual was 0.38 grams, and the maximum weight of an experimental individual was 0.28 grams. 


Discussion:
 The two-sample t_test yielded a p_value which indicates that our data is not significent. Our null hypothesis, which states that if buckwheat plants are exposed to acidic soil they will not show a difference in root:shoot weight ratio compared to plants grown in neutral soil, cannot be rejected. Despite patterns in our data that indicate a general trend toward greater root:shoot weight ratios, we cannot assume that our data was not due to chance. This could be attributed to several factors, namely our small sample sizes, and also our limited plant growth. Our buckwheat plants only grew to a maximum weight of 0.38 grams, which is a small mass and consequently, roots and shoots perhaps did not grow to their full potentials given the environmental circumstances. So, perhaps a larger sample size and a longer experimental duration of 14 days or longer could provide adequate data to yield significent data. The general pattern of our data suggests that there were individuals in the experimental group that had greater root:shoot ratios, which is suggestive of the individual’s allocation of resources put toward trying to achieve more favorable soil environments. In a study published in the journal Environmental Pollution, there was a decreased biomass of buckwheat individuals exposed to heavy metals in the soil (which contributed to low pH of the soil) [Tani: 2005]. As acidic soil hinders the availability of nutrients for buckwheat plants, the experimental group cannot allocate resources toward shoot growth without adequate nutrients.
     In reflecting upon our prior research, our results do not defend previously acquired data on the resource allocation in other crops such as bean plants green peppers after exposure to acidic environments [Velikova: 1999][Takemoto: 1988]. While it is popular to study the profound impact of acidity on metabolic processes in plants, perhaps further studies could focus on the differences in acidic soil environments versus air environments (fog) on resource allocation in crops and how root:shoot ratios in weight, length, width, etc. of staple crops varies in response to environmental pressures. As observed by the Tani study, buckwheat plants exposed to metal ions such as zinc and copper in the soil (and thus, growing in acidic soil,) buckwheat roots grew and absorbed the metal ions, however did not exceed toxic levels in any concentration of the metal ions [Tani: 2005]. So, as climate change continues to be the topic of biological and agricultural research, the effect of soil and environmental pH will be an interesting subject as we seek to identify which elements and pollutants will yield toxic crops, and which may have negligible effects on plant growth and health.
