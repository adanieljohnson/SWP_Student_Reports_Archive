Title: Effects of Insect Growth Regulators on the Development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Hormone regulation is an important topic in agricultural and environmental studies. Given the marked increase of global warming's affect on the ecosystem, it is important to consider alternatives to current toxic pest regulation methods. This study examined the effectiveness of juvenile hormone, an insect growth regulator, as a pesticide on Manduca sexta. The prediction was that Manduca sexta would develop at a slower rate than that of the control group if treated with juvenile hormone during its developmental stages. Our data showed indicators of inhibition, however, these results were not found to be significant. This insignificance could be attributed to incorrect distribution due to methodology and timing of the juvenile hormone. In addition observation of Manduca sexta development after treatment with the JH suggests that future studies must be conducted to determine the true effectiveness of juvenile hormone as a pesticide. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco worm, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. This species follows the holometabolous life cycle, which develops in four stages: egg/ embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. Tobacco worms mediate growth, development, behaviors, and other processes using hormone and neuron based signaling [Johnson: 2019]. Three hormones regulate a substantial portion of this species’ development: Prothoracicotropic hormones, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone. In response to a neurological signal, endocrine cells in the brain produce prothoracicotropic hormones that are transported to and released in the corpus cardiacum. Subsequently, the Prothoracicotropic hormone stimulates the prothoracic gland to secrete ecdysone. Each time ecdysone is released, a molt is stimulated, taking the instar larva through its developmental stages: larva, pupa, and adult. The corpus allatum is responsible for producing juvenile hormone in declining amounts. juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt the Manduca sexta undergoes during development. When the juvenile hormone reaches depleted levels, the larva surrounds itself in a cocoon, molting into a pupa. Since the pupa does not produce the juvenile hormone, it can undergo metamorphosis into an adult [Johnson: 2019]. The hormones responsible for development can act as insect growth regulators as they affect regulatory processes in insects that are necessary for healthy development. The tobacco worm is considered a pest during its larval stages. Pesticides used to treat insects are often harmful to the environment and its inhabitants because their toxicity affects more than the desired pest. As stated in the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry, “an insect growth regulator does not have to be toxic to its target. Instead, it leads to abnormalities that reduce insect survival” [Tunaz: 2004]. This study treats a group of Manduca sexta with juvenile hormone, to test its effectiveness as a “pesticide” on insects similar to Manduca sexta. The tobacco worm was selected because its hormone levels can be easily manipulated; therefore, it is a model organism. Treating pests with hormones could serve as a viable method in maintaining a healthy environment by disposing of undesired pests in a manner that has little toxic effect on the surrounding environment. If treated with the juvenile Hormone, the Manduca sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the control group (the group not treated with any substance). Developmental inhibition will occur when juvenile hormone levels are increased due to the required lull in juvenile hormone levels for the tobacco worm to enter the pupal stage. 


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta were examined by permission of the Wake Forest University Biology department. All specimens examined were studied in their larval state. Four Manduca sexta were treated with five drops of IG Regulator 1:125 (juvenile hormone), and four were treated with five drops of di water. Two containers with four compartments were prepared by placing holes on the sides to enable respiration and labeled according to treatment type, lab section, and group names. One container was designated for four Manduca sexta in the control groups, the other four for the treatment group. Each compartment of the control and treatment containers were numbered 1-4 to differentiate between each Manduca sexta. Ten grams of food were placed in each chamber after being treated with the reagent or di water. The initial weight of each Manduca sexta was recorded in grams, and weight recordings were measured each day for the subsequent thirteen days. Food was replaced with a new ten-gram blob when dried out or when feces were present in the compartment. A one-tailed t-test was utilized to determine the significance of juvenile hormone as an insect growth inhibitor. The statistical test compared the change in mass over fourteen days of the treatment and control groups.


Results:
 No significant differences were detected between the control and juvenile treated Manduca sexta. The average weight per day and average weight change of the four controls and four treatment groups were calculated, and a one-tailed t-test was run, finding no significant difference at the .05 level (P= .170054). Figure one depicts the average change in the growth of the Manduca sexta (measured in grams) of the control and treatment groups over fourteen days. Between days seven and day eleven, the treatment group grew at a higher rate than the control group. Days twelve through day fourteen showed weight loss in the control group; day thirteen showed weight loss in the treatment group. Table one depicts the overall average change in mass for the control and treatment groups over fourteen days (8.16g vs. 14.8g). Table two depicts the average change in mass over fourteen days for each Manduca sexta utilized in the experiment. Manduca sexta 3 in the control group had the highest average change in mass with a weight of 9.9 grams (compared to 7.3-7.8 grams for the other control group worms). The treatment group’s total change in mass ranged from 12-17 grams. 


Discussion:
Juvenile hormone treatment did not significantly inhibit development and growth in Manduca sexta, as hypothesized. This study measured growth by recording the weight of eight tobacco worms across fourteen days. Four Manduca sexta were treated with juvenile hormone and four with di water. A one-tailed t-test found that the null hypothesis was not rejected; the treatment group’s rate of growth was not statistically less than that of the control group as predicted. The one-tailed t-test found the alternate hypothesis was rejected. This is due to the fact that at the .05 level, the p-value was insignificant (P=.170054). The findings demonstrated the overall weight change of the tobacco worms treated with juvenile hormone was higher than that of the control group, although these results were not considered statistically significant. Juvenile hormone acts as an insect growth regulator by controlling the molting patterns of Manduca sexta as they undergo development. Deficient levels of juvenile hormone result in pupa molting. Although the exhibited results were not significant, it is possible the juvenile hormone had an inhibitory effect on the tobacco worms. The results showed that treating the organism with juvenile hormone caused increased weight gain, an indication of pupation inhibition. The insignificance of the results may be attributed to incorrect administration of Juvenile hormone to the insects’ due to timing and methodology. Carroll Williams examines these insect growth regulators known as third-generation pesticides, arguing that insect hormones, “promise to provide insecticides that are not only more specific but also proof against the evolution of resistance” [Williams: 1967]. Hormone regulators as pesticides are integral to study due to the harmful practice of controlling pests. Many pesticides are toxic to other organisms, as well as the surrounding environment [Williams: 1967]. Utilizing insect growth regulators as pesticides could contribute to a healthier ecosystem, by altering the current practice of eliminating pests. 
A study on S. gregaria by M. Tanani examined the effects of insect growth regulators on carbohydrate composition. It was found that treating the S. gregaria with juvenile hormone caused the larvae to accumulate excess carbohydrates in their fat bodies, inhibiting development [Tanani: 2012]. For the purposes of this study, it is conceivable the juvenile hormone inhibited tobacco worm growth by increasing carbohydrate content in those treated to prevent pupation; however, our results conclude this increased weight gain did not inhibit development significantly. A study performed by Jim Core that examined the viability of using juvenile hormone as a pesticide in cereal boxes provides an explanation for the insignificant degree of inhibition. He concluded, “if used at certain times, JH agonists can prevent pest insects from developing normally into adults” [Core: 2003]. Based on Core’s findings, it is possible that the study conducted on the tobacco worms did not deliver the hormone through a practical methodology that would significantly inhibit growth. Instead of delivering the hormone to the Manduca sexta in accordance with molting times, the hormone was given through the food in the container of each worm. This prevented controlled delivery of the hormone to the subjects at optimal inhibition points as it was impossible to regulate eating patterns. Administering the juvenile hormone via the tobacco worm’s food could have affected results in another way. A study conducted by G. Gade examined the delivery methods of insect growth regulators. They found the effect of juvenile hormones on cells to be independent of the developmental fate of neighboring cells, arguing inhibition resulting from juvenile hormones, “depend not only on the presence and concentration of the hormone but also on the sensitivity of the tissues to the hormone. Sensitivity may change when new JH receptors are being synthesized” [Gade: 1997]. It is possible that ingesting the hormone prevented the growth regulator from reaching the physiological parts of the organism that are most sensitive to its effects, which could have resulted in insignificant growth inhibition. A study conducted by Tunaz, examining the effectiveness of juvenile hormones as pesticides for mosquitoes, found that the use of juvenile hormones may be impractical in some species that are considered pests in the entire larval stage due to the fact that juvenile hormones are inhibit most at the last larval instar (Tunaz: 2004). Manduca sexta are considered pests throughout their entire larval stage, for this reason, it is possible the juvenile hormone would be more effective in organisms such as mosquitoes, as the hormones “do not induce quick mortality to preimaginal stages or larval mosquitoes, which is a desirable feature of JHAs in mosquito control because the larvae are an important food source for fish and wildlife (Mulla: 1995).” Further investigation is required to confirm whether the measurements collected are a result of incorrect distribution methods and timing of the juvenile hormone, as well as the organism studied, or if they indicate juvenile hormones are not viable pesticides. The toxicity of synthetic insecticides, their persistence in the environment, and their effects on human beings and domestic animals are of concern to agricultural and health scientists. Insect growth regulators have the potential to function as pesticides with minimal effects on the environment. For this reason, it is integral to continue the study of these hormones and their effectiveness as insect controllers in order to maintain a healthy environment by providing a feasible alternative to the current toxic pesticides.
