Title: Resource Allocation of Vigna radiata in Nutrient Rich Environments as a Measure of Fertilizer Effectiveness 

Abstract:
Magnesium sulfate & nitrates have been proven to play key roles in fertilizing soil to optimize the growth of crops. In this lab, the effects of magnesium sulfate & nitrates on the growth of Vigna radiata, mung beans, was observed in order to determine the effectiveness of one fertilizer over the other in this particular species. Sprouts were grown under identical conditions in a greenhouse but treated with different solutions during watering. After two weeks of growth, the plants were uprooted, & measurements were taken to determine root to shoot ratios for both weight & length. The collected data showed the average ratios for weight to be 0.83(±0.29), 1.17(±0.21), & 1.20(±0.23) for the control, magnesium sulfate, & nitrate treatments respectively. An analysis of variance test was then conducted for these data yielding statistically significant data [F(2,15)=4.115, p=0.038]. Additionally, the average ratios for length were observed to be 1.21(±0.16), 1.47(±0.23), & 1.38(±0.29). An analysis of variance test was then conducted for these data yielding statistically insignificant data [F(2,15)=1.87, p=0.187]. It was speculated that the treatment groups received inadequate concentrations when watering since there was no discernable difference between treatment groups & the control.

Introduction:
	It has been previously established that plants have the ability to respond to their environment by investing more into the processes deemed necessary for survival, resulting in phenotypic variation [Fusco & Minelli: 2010]. This phenomenon is referred to as phenotypic plasticity, and while it can influence selection and evolution within a species, this experiment set out to observe phenotypic plasticity in a single organism. 
	In previous experiments, it has been proven that root to shoot ratio in plants can be used as a measurable component of a plant’s characteristics indicative of phenotypic plasticity[Harris: 1992]. In effect, plants placed in environments with rich soil will need to spread their roots less resulting in a lower root to shoot ratio. The inverse is also true – plants in nutrient deficient soil will experience more growth in the roots, resulting in a larger root to shoot ratio. 
	Of the nutrients necessary for plant development, MgSO4 and nitrates in particular have been shown to play a pivotal role in developmental processes [Drew & Saker:1975][Härdter et al.: 2005]. Because of its known benefit, these nutrients were selected to observe the optimization of growth in mung beans, V. radiata. It was hypothesized that V. radiata treated with one of the fertilizing solutions would experience lower root to shoot in length and weight ratios than that of control groups which lacked supplemental amounts of these nutrients.


Materials and Methods:
The experimental design for this lab involved growing V. radiata in various conditions. Nine seeds were planted in vermiculite mixed with 100mL of Miracle-Gro in each pot, with three pots per treatment. From there, the plants were watered with solutions according to their arbitrarily assigned treatment. Control pots received 200mL of tap water while magnesium sulfate and nitrate treatments received 200mL of a 1:4 dilution of the appropriate stock solutions provided by the biology department. The plants were grown in the biology department’s green house and watered once every twenty-four hours for two weeks.
	Once the two-week growing period had passed, the plants were uprooted so that measures of root to shoot ratio could be obtained. It was also ensured that the roots were washed to be free of vermiculite during these measurements. The differentiation between root and shoot of the plants was determined by change in coloration of the shoot of the sprout, and a cut was made at this mark to separate the roots from the stalk. Length measurements for roots and shoots were taken by hand from this change in coloration to the tip of the longest root, and from the other side of the cut to just below the branching of the first leaves respectively. Using these cut portions, mass measurements were taken with an electronic scale precise to the hundredth of a gram. 
	Six replicates were pulled from each treatment for these measurements, with two coming from each pot. Once the ratios were calculated, the averages were determined, and an analysis of variance was performed to determine statistical significance.

Results:
     The collected data showed the average ratios for weight to be 0.83(±0.29), 1.17(±0.21), and 1.20(±0.23) for the control, magnesium sulfate, and nitrate treatments respectively. This is represented by the table in Figure 1.1, and graphically portrayed in Figure 1.2. An analysis of variance test was then conducted for these data yielding statistically significant data [F(2,15) = 4.115, p =0.038]. However, Turkey Kramer tests were also performed, and no significance was observed between groups.
      Additionally, average ratios for length were observed to be 1.21(±0.16), 1.47(±0.23), and 1.38(±0.29). This is represented by the table in Figure 1.3, and graphically portrayed in Figure 1.4. An analysis of variance test was then conducted for these data yielding statistically insignificant data [F(2,15) = 1.87, p =0.187]. Turkey Kramer tests were also performed, but no significance was observed between groups.


Discussion:
Despite previous data suggesting otherwise, the results of this experiment suggested that there was no difference in growth by V. radiata despite supplementing of additional nutrients [Harris: 1992]. This may suggest a flaw in experimental design. Concentrations of stock MgSO4 and nitrate solutions were unknown, and the 1:4 dilution performed before watering maybe have rendered the supplementing inert because of low concentration. Additionally, human error may have occurred when measuring root to shoot ratios. The differentiation between root and shoot was somewhat arbitrary and phenotypic, distinguished by variation in coloration around the roots, which have been a confounding factor within the data. Furthermore, the precision of instruments used was relatively low. A simple ruler with the ability to measure to the nearest millimeter and a scale with precision to the nearest tenth of a gram were used. With mung beans being a small plant, it is possible that small inaccuracies in measurements could have led the data to be inaccurate, but this is far less likely than the two previously mentioned possible sources of error. In addition, the sampling size for statistical tests could have been raised in an attempt of standardizing the data and lowering deviations. 
	If this experiment were to be repeated, it would be advisable to alleviate some of these issues by a number of methods. One such solution could be using different plant species for measurements. Additionally, it should be noted that to make a broader statement about the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate over nitrates, or vice versa, as a fertilizer, multiple species should be subjected to this type of experiment with different forms of delivery for the nutrients. Moreover, it would be beneficial to find optimum concentrations of each nutrient for a given species.
	In conclusion, no comment can be made on the results of this experiment with regard to the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate or nitrates as a better source of nutrients for V. radiata. Additionally, since previous studies implicated both substances as effective fertilizers and since no statistical significance was seen between treatments and the control organisms, it is highly likely that an error occurred in the experimental design occurred. Further studies would need to be conducted to comment on this topic.
