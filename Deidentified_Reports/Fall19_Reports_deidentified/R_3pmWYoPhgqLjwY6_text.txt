Title: Effect of Red, Blue, White Light on Photosynthetic Rate of Spinacia oleracea Leaves

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is crucial for survival of plant species. We mainly focus on light dependent reactions, especially photosystem II. We are interested in how different wavelength of light may have effect on photosystem II so as to change the photosynthetic rate of plant species. Our hypothesis is that exposure to red or blue light would increase photosynthetic rate of spinach leaves as compared to white light. Therefore, we decided to measure the change in absorbance of spinach chloroplasts containing DCIP, which is a colorless compound when reduced. Test samples were placed under red light, blue light, white light and controlled light respectively and the absorbance was measured every 10 minutes in an overall of 30 minutes. The results indicated that there were no significant changes in absorbance after 30 minutes treatments of any of the light source selected and there were no significant changes in absorbance between red, blue, white light as compared to normal treatment. One of the possible explanations of the insignificant result may be due to photoinhibition. Further experiments need to be done and some possible improvements are also discussed.

Introduction:
Plants can capture and store energy from the sun directly via the process of photosynthesis. The mechanism of photosynthesis involves multiple stages, but our main focus is on the light dependent reactions, especially photosystem II. According to previous study, Arnon [1958] points out that the oxidation-reduction reactions and phosphorylative reactions during photosynthesis could be directly be related in chloroplasts. Thus, the actual process is that during light dependent reactions, chlorophyll carries electrons to a high energy electron carrier, plastiquione, therefore generating a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane so as to drive ATP hydrolysis of ATP synthase. Hill reaction turns out to be an effective way to measure the activity of photosystem II. From previous experiment, oxidized DCIP, a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure, accepts hydrogen equivalents at a site near primary photochemical step and is reduced near to plastiquinone [West et al: 1967]. When DCIP is reduced to DCIPH2, it will turn into a colorless compound. Due to this kind of color change, we are able to measure the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts that contain DCIP. 
Photosynthesis is crucial for the survival of plant species. According to Demming-Adams [1996], in response to the changing levels of light because of the stress imposed by natural environment, multiple levels of control allow adjustments in energy dissipation of plant species so as to protect their photosynthetic apparatus. Therefore, we are interested in investigating how changes in light wavelength may affect organism’s adjustments to photosynthetic rate. Recent study shows that different wavelength of light has different effects on growth, yield and nutritional quality of greenhouse vegetables, especially with positive plant yield, growth and nutritional quality when vegetables are exposed to blue, green and red light [Olle: 2019]. Thus, we decided to explore the effect of red, blue, white light on Photosynthetic Rate of spinach Leaves. We choose to use spinach as our sample organism simply because many previous experiments have been using spinach and spinach is easy to obtain. More importantly, the chloroplasts of spinach are easy to be isolated through centrifugation. We hypothesize that exposure to red or blue light would increase photosynthetic rate of spinach leaves as compared to white light.


Materials and Methods:
We added 10mL of grinding buffer and grinded the spinach until no large chunks of leaves left. We then performed centrifugation twice, 200xG, 3min and 1,000xG, 10min respectively. After centrifugation, the pellet contained chloroplasts. We then added 20mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and got rid of the debris. The test samples were prepared based on Table 1, and after the samples were ready, we used spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance readings of the samples. We then put those samples under different wavelength of light. Absorbance readings were taken every 10 minutes through an overall of 30 minutes period and we also calculated the percent change of the absorbance respectively. A one-tailed paired t-test was performed to investigate whether there was a significant difference of photosynthetic rates of these samples exposed to different wavelength of light.

Results:
According to Figure 1, the average percent change of test samples under white light is 0.221 for 10 minutes, 1.77 for 20 minutes and 3.31 for 30 minutes. The average percent change of test samples under red light is 0.433 for 10 minutes, 1.52 for 20 minutes and 1.52 for 30 minutes. The average percent change of test samples under blue light is 1.05 for 10 minutes, 3.15 for 20 minutes and 3.15 for 30 minutes. The average percent change of test samples under regular room light is 2.16 for 10 minutes, 4.53 for 20 minutes and 4.96 for 30 minutes. 
White light does not significantly increase the rate of photosynthesis after 30 minutes (t-stat = 0.3932, df = 4, p = 0.3571). Red light does not significantly increase the rate of photosynthesis after 30 minutes (t-stat = 1.11, df = 4, p = 0.165). Blue light does not significantly increase the rate of photosynthesis after 30 minutes (t-stat = 0.735, df = 4, p = 0.503). Normal room light does not significantly increase the rate of photosynthesis after 30 minutes (t-stat = 1.13, df = 4, p = 0.161). 
There is no significant different in absorbance under white light as compared to normal treatment after 30 minutes (t-stat = 0.533, df = 4, p = 0.311). There is no significant different in absorbance under red light as compared to normal treatment (t-stat = 0.979, df = 4, p = 0.191). There is no significant different in absorbance under blue light as compared to normal treatment (t-stat = 0.167, df = 4, p = 0.437).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that exposure to red or blue light would increase photosynthetic rate of spinach leaves as compared to white light is not supported by our data. Although there is no significant changes in absorbance for any of those test samples, we could still see the trend from Figure 1 that there is little increase in the absorbance for all the test samples from 10 minutes to 20 minutes but there is no change in absorbance at all for the samples under red light and blue light ranging from 20 minutes to 30 minutes. The unchanged absorbance catches our attention, because ideally, photosynthetic activity tends to increase as plant species are exposed to either red or blue light. According to previous study, red LEDs are efficient for plant growth because these wavelengths perfectly fit with the absorption peak of chlorophylls [Darko et al: 2014]; Moreover, experiments have found that overall there is a trend to higher biomass production and photosynthetic capacity in a blue light-containing irradiance [Hogewoning: 2010]. Possible explanation to why the absorbance remaining the same through 20 minutes to 30 minutes can be that according to Darko [2014], the spectrum and intensity of fluorescent lights are not stable over a long time, thus the red light /blue light lamp we used for the experiment may not able to provide stable light energy for plants to activate photosynthesis. Another possible explanation is that the red light/blue light lamp we used may work “extremely” well, meaning that they may provide excess light energy. Excess light energy can also be a problem because it can photoinhibit photosynthesis and may lead to photooxidative destruction of the photosynthetic apparatus [Long: 1994]. The density of chloroplasts in those testing samples may be relatively low, and after exposed to high intensity of light, chloroplast in the solution may be damaged. Overall, further experiments should be conducted to get a more accurate result. Some improvements can be for example, increasing the sample size so that the results will be more convincing and we also need to completely isolate different treatment groups so as to prevent different light sources from intervening with each other. More importantly, we should measure the intensity of light provided by the lamps so that we can determine whether the chloroplasts function normally or no.
