Title: THE EFFECT OF ECDYSONE HORMONE ON THE MASS OF MANDUCA SEXTA

Abstract:
ABSTRACT

Hormones play a vital role in the life of all living organisms. In this experiment, the hormone ecdysone, or 20E, (molting process hormone) demonstrates how too much of one hormone can have detrimental effects to a species. Excess 20E cause developmental delays and death in Manduca sexta. Our hypothesis is “The tobacco hornworms treated with the 20E hormone will have decreased weight.” We tested this with two groups (1 control and 1 group treated with 20E hormone). We placed both groups in plastic containers and gave them food. The 20E treated group was given 5 drops of the hormone in their food. For two weeks, every day, we weighed the caterpillars and recorded our results.

We found that the caterpillars given 20E hormone, had decreased in size and died after 14 days. With this, we were able to support our hypothesis. The average mass for our control group was 2.31 g and for our treatment group, 0.089 g. Our P-value= 0.000629, which supports our hypothesis. These results are significant because they reveal the effect of ecdysone on the molting process of Manduca sexta. It increases our knowledge and understanding of not only the hormones involved in molting, but how consuming too much of one hormone can disrupt development of that hormone in the body.


Introduction:
INTRODUCTION

Background: Hormones are produced by the endocrine glands into the bloodstream and affect the activity of another part of the body [Morely: 2019].  Hormones control the organs and they affect growth, reproduction, energy, development, and many other factors of the body. Certain types of hormones influence certain organs and tissues [Morely: 2019]. 

In this experiment, we looked at the roles of hormones in Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. Its holometabolous life cycle has 4 stages (egg, larvae, pupa, and adult) [Byron: 2017]. These stages are generated by molting, which is when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer and the old layer is shed [Hadley: 2019]. The tobacco hornworm maintains homeostasis by sensory pathways and hormones [Byron: 2017]. It produces the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) in the corpus cardiacum and this then triggers the production of the ecdyson [Song: 2017]. The tobacco hornworms use ecdysone (20E), produced in the parathoracic gland and juvenile hormone (JH), produced in the corpus allatum, in the molting process [Ishimoto: 2010]. JH keeps the hornworm looking juvenile. 20E plays an important role in developmental transitions in larva molting. In this experiment, we treated the tobacco hornworms with 20E to stimulate growth, cell reproduction, cell regeneration, and to affect molt timing. The tobacco hornworm was chosen for this experiment because of its short life cycle (39-48 days) and because it is considered a pest when it is an adult, so any harm to them during the experiment does not have a major negative impact on the environment [Byron: 2017] . The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of the 20E hormone (independent variable) on the molting process of the tobacco hornworm. We will use weight (dependent variable) to quantitatively analyze our results. 

Hypothesis: The tobacco hornworms treated with the 20E hormone will have decreased weight.
Null Hypothesis: There will be no difference in weight between the control group and the group treated with 20E.


Materials and Methods:
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials: 
2, 4-celled containers with lids
Hole tool for air
Hornworm food
2 spoons (one for control and one for treatment)
Mixing container
Balance scale
20E Hormone
Water

Independent Variable: Tobacco hornworms given 20E hormone

Dependent Variable: The mass in grams of the tobacco hornworms

Control Variables: Amount of food given, type of food given, temperature, moisture, amount of drops of hormones/ water.

Methods: 
Using the hole tool punch one hole in each cell sidewall and 2 over each cell on the lid
Using a Sharpie label the control container on each cell as well as the treatment container (1-4)
Label your group names on each container 
Measure 10 grams of food for each cell 
For the treatment group, mix 10 grams of food with five drops of 20E hormone in a separate bowl with a spoon. Repeat for the other three cells and pack each mixed food with hormone tightly into the corner of the cell (big clump to prevent drying out)
For the control hornworms, pack 10 grams of food tightly to each corner of the control cells.
Add 5 drops of water to each clump of food
Add 1 hornworm to each cell for both groups, 8 total
Put both lids on and place in the refrigerator 
Measure the weight of each hornworm and record results daily 

Statistical Tests: We will be using an unpaired two-sample t-Test in order to test our hypothesis and to see if there is a significant difference between the group with 20E and the control group.

RESULTS

Qualitative Results: Initially, all of the hornworms were bright green in color and relatively moist. For about the first week, all the control worms stayed pretty moist as they increased in size. However, the second week, they became more dry. Their color was bright green throughout the 14 days. By the end of the 14 days, signs of molting were seen in the hornworms. For the 20E treated hornworms, they clearly developed much slower. By the third day, they were evidently smaller and were moving much slower. As the days progressed, the treatment hormones became darker in color and appeared to be dried and shriveled up. By day 11 they were all dead. The difference in size, moisture, and color can be seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Table 1 shows the average weight in grams of the 4 caterpillars in each group for each of the 14 days. We used the mean to calculate the average. This information is graphed in Figure 3.

Statistical Test Results: We used the unpaired two-sample t-test to determine the statistical significance of our results. The mean of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat= 0.0006, df=6, P= 0.000629), since our P-value was smaller than P=0.05. This is visually demonstrated in Figure 4.




Discussion:
DISCUSSION

Our hypothesis, “The tobacco hornworms treated with the 20E hormone will have decreased weight” is supported and our null hypothesis, “There will be no difference in weight between the control group and the group treated with 20E” is rejected. We can conclude this from our results in the t-test. Our P-value was 0.000629, which is P&lt;0.05, showing there was a statistical difference between our control group and our treatment group. 

Biologically our results are supported for multiple reasons. In the introduction, I stated that the corpus cardiacum produces PTTH in a consistent release. Insects, like the tobacco hornworm have a “biological clock” in their brain that triggers the 20E hormone to be produced from this consistent release of PTTH.  [Song: 2017]. It is possible that when the tobacco hornworms were consuming the 20E hormone orally in their food, it not only caused a decrease in the synthesis of 20E, but also caused less PTTH to be produced. As a result, the 20E hormone inhibited a developmental hormone that prevented molting and caused the insects to die. This is supported by other examples like with the use of steroids. According to an endocrinologist, Dr. Ghandi Saadeh, MD, “Use of anabolic steroids for bodybuilding will cause the testes to shut down their testosterone production” [Vann: 2015]. Testosterone is the best known hormone to be affected when one consumes too much testosterone through steroids, but it is very likely other hormones in the body, like 20E act similarly.  

Another biological explanation is that because the 20E hormone levels were always so high, the juvenile hormone levels were never able to develop to a high enough level that the hornworms could grow and develop to an adequate size, in their juvenile stages, before molting. Therefore, the 20E hormone became lethal for the insects. The role of all three hormones (PTTH, 20E, and JH) was disrupted by the excess 20E and therefore, caused a decrease in weight and development of the tobacco hornworm.

Our results are supported by previously published studies. In 1980, biologists Louis Safranek and Carroll M. Williams studied the prothoracic hormone in Manduca sexta. They concluded that the species has four major development transitions before adulthood (larval molt to fifth instar, feeding after fifth instar, larval-pupal molt, and pupal-adult molt). They found that the beginning of each molt had a rise in ecdysone production [Safranek: 1980]. However, Safranek and Williams then injected ecdysone and implanted active prothoracic glands and found that this can hinder development [Safranek: 1980]. Therefore, they concluded that each of the four developmental stages is dependent on adequate ecdysone levels for transformation [Safranek: 1980]. Biologists HF Nijhout, G Davidowitz, and DA Roff performed a study where they analyzed the effect of ecdysone on body size. They found that timing plays a major role in the metamorphosis of Manduca sexta [Nijhout: 2006]. They concluded that it is a “pulse of ecdysone at the end of larval life that causes the larvae to stop feeding and growing and initiate metamorphosis” [Nijhout: 2006]. This supports our experiment because our insects were never able to receive this “pulse” because they had constant ecdysone they were consuming.

There are several potential sources of error that could have affected the results of our experiment. When transferring the tobacco hornworms from the container to the scale, they often had food or manure attached to them, causing a potential increase in mass. This tended to be more common in the control group because they were more developed in size and had limbs that could hold onto the food or manure better. Another potential source of error could be that we did not weigh the insects at the same time of day every day. This could cause a slight variance in the data and could also affect our results of when the treatment caterpillars actually died. Finally, when adding drops of water and more importantly, when adding the drops of 20E, it is possible that there were inconsistencies with the amount of drops of 20E hormone. This could cause them to die sooner and develop even slower.

Our results are heavily supported by previous studies, but for our data to be thoroughly supported I think more testing should be done in the future. I think the experiment should be done again with more tobacco hornworms and with groups receiving different amounts of 20E. One group should have the hormone completely blocked and the other groups should vary on the amount of 20E they receive. This would show us how much of the hormone is detrimental to the insect and what happens if they have none. To do this I would test 4 different groups (control group, group with ecdysone blocked, group with the amount of ecdysone we tested in the experiment, and a group with slightly less ecdysone). I would also use 8 caterpillars for each group in order to have stronger data.

In conclusion, hormones in any species play a major role in the development of a species and the function of the species. In this experiment, we focused on insects and the effects hormones, specifically ecdysone, have on the molting process. As I stated earlier, our results can be widened to other hormones in the body because of common trends, like testosterone. Hormones consumed in excess can have detrimental effects and our study supports this. Further research and experiment variations is always necessary, but with our data and the researched data, common trends will most likely be found.
