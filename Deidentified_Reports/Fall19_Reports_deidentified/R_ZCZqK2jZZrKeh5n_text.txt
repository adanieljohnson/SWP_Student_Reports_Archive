Title: Effect of Soil Type on the Root to Shoot Ratio of Vigna radiata

Abstract:
In this experiment we were testing the resource allocation of Vigna radiata in different soils as it is related to the root and shoot ratio of the plants. We hypothesize that the plants in the clay will have a higher root to shoot ratio in both weight and height than those in the regular soil. The t_test for weight go us a p value of 0.014553 (DF=51, T=2.245401). The t_test for length go us a p value of 0.02991 (DF=51, T=1.924968). Our hypothesis was supported by both the means as well as the t_tests that we ran showing that the root to shoot ratio was in fact higher in the clay plants. This is important as when food is being grown on non-optimal soil in developing countries, more thought needs to be put into getting the plants the nutrients that they do in fact need to grow.

Introduction:
All species, plants included have a finite amount of energy that they can use at any given point during their lifetime. There is always an ongoing trade-off of where the plant wants to put this energy, whether it be in different aspects of growth or reproduction. This concept is known to biologists as Resource Allocation. Vigna radiata, otherwise commonly known as mung bean, is no stranger to this phenomenon. They have to allocate energy to this balance in the best way they see fit, whether in reproduction or growth, [Shellie, 1991]. One of the main ways that you can see this trade off in plants is to observe the root to shoot ratio of said plants. In the process of acquiring natural resources the plant will be able to determine what is lacking and allocate the energy to that part of the plant, ie the roots or shoots. Looking at where there is a lack vs an abundance of resources is key in determining where we will see more growth, [Monk, 1966]. In our experiment we wanted to see how changing the medium in which a plant is grown in would affect this ratio of allocation in roots to shoots. We grew two sets of plants one in normal soil and then one which was grown in clay. This is important as there are many developing countries where food growth is extremely important and they oftentimes don’t have the best soil to grow said plants. We hypothesize that the plants that were grown in the clay would have a higher root to shoot ratio in both weight and height. We think that this will be the case based on the fact that they will have access to the same amount of sun and nutrients from the air where as the clay lacks a lot of the resources that are in the regular soil. Based on this, the plant will put more effort into growing the roots which would mean it has a higher root to shoot ratio.

Materials and Method:
Materials including the different soils, plants, plant boxes, and measuring equipment was collected. Our independent variable was the type of soil and the dependent variable was the root shoot ratio and weights as well as heights. Six plant boxes were set out and labeled to identify them from other experiments. Three plant boxes were filled with clay while the other three boxes were filled with soil. Twelve holes were poked into each of the six plant boxes. One mung bean was placed into each of the twelve holes of every plant box. There were a total of 72 plants to start out with. Mung beans were then covered and the soil was first saturated with a large amount of water. Plants were placed into the green house in direct sunlight for two weeks. During that two week span, plants were watered once a day. After two weeks the plants were retrieved from the greenhouse and plants were removed from the boxes and laid out in separate groups based on the box they were in. All plants were cut at the whtie junction between root and shoot and weighed separately. The same was done for length and all data was tabularized. Graphs were created and a one tailed two sample t test for our statistics.

Results:
The average root to shoot ratio for the weight and length of the controll plants were 1.493207 (SD=0.7717) and 1.633507 (SD=0.672791). The average root to shoot ratio for the weight and length of the clay plants were 3.15271 (SD=4.091114) and 2.358768 (SD=1.971801). The t_test for weight go us a p value of 0.014553 (DF=51, T=2.245401). The t_test for length go us a p value of 0.02991 (DF=51, T=1.924968).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported in both weight and length as they both were higher for those plants that were in clay rather than in the controll group. This is because the plants that were in the clay lacked a lot of the resources that plants uptake through the ground normally. To try to correct this they added to their root mass to try to find those smaller pockets of those resources. This leads to the increased root to shoot ratio which is shown in our result. We really wanted to tackle and see how resource allocation would affect the root to shoot ratio of plants in different soil. This research is important because in many developing countries the soil in which plants are grown in isn’t ideal and can lead to very harsh variation in the resources available to the plants, [Zingore, 2006]. In order to be able to grow the necessary crops to sustain the population and all that is needed in the developing world it is important to consider the type of soil that is best to grow the crops if they don’t have secure access to good soil. A step that we can take next in this research is to use clay and then add easily made or found natural fertilizers to see which aid in getting the plants back to where they are fruitful and can continue to grow upwards to make usable food.
