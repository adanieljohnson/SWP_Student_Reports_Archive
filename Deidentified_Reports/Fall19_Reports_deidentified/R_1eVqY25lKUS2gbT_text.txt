Title: Effects of Soil Temperature on the Phenotypic plasticity and Energy Allocation of Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity, coupled with energy allocation, is a key mechanism for plants to cope with environmental stress. With a given amount of resources, plants tend to allocate the acquired resources toward body parts, which can obtain further bioavailable resources, and reduce the growth and biomass of parts that are more energy-consuming/inefficient. This report implemented an allometric approach to study how the soil temperature influences the phenotypic changes of Vigna radiata (mung beans). Results show no statistically significant difference (two-sample t-test p-value &lt; 0.05) in all, except weights of whole plant, body size comparisons. Therefore, our hypothesis (higher soil temperature leads to higher root-to-shoot weight/length ratio) was not supported. The effects of phenotypic plasticity and allocation strategies of V. radiata are discussed with further suggestions on ways to improve the experimental design to be closer to real-life conditions.

Introduction:
Phenotypic plasticity is a universal mechanism that allows organisms to survive when facing environmental challenges. One aspect of the phenotypic plasticity we focused on was the allometric trajectories of plants in response to environmental stressors. These stressors can be categorized as biotic factors (the stimuli produced by other living organisms) and abiotic factors (environmental stimuli from non-living sources). Although phenotypic plasticity is assumed as a major way plants use to cope with the environment, to what extent does such mechanism affect plants’ phenotypic appearance to enhance its survival chance remains unknown [Gratani: 2014].
	One way to study how the environmental factors affect plants’ phenotypic plasticity is through measuring the sizes of different body parts. In resource-limited conditions, plants may redistribute energy to different parts of the body, such as root/shoot length and weight, leaf size, thus having various dissimilar proportions of body parts in each plant species. The primary reason for increasing the growth rate of a body part is to capture and allocate energy more efficiently. Although the allocation pattern is mostly genetically determined, in order to adapt to the living condition, some modifications can still be made [Sultan: 2000]. It is known that different parts of a plant serve different functions in energy capturing. Leaves are the major solar energy capture sites, if an increase of energy is sent to leaves, plants may have a higher growth rate. Stems are the supporting structure of the shoot; they not only perform photosynthesis, but also lift the leaves higher than competing plants to obtain more light energy. Roots anchor plants to the soil and acquire bioavailable nutrients and water from underground; they can go wide and deep in water/nutrients-scarce areas, such as the deserts or in drought environments [Ryser: 2000][Johnson: 2016]. 
	This report aims to investigate the energy allocation in Vigna radiata (mung beans) by measuring the root and shoot’s lengths and weights that are grown in normal and high soil temperature. Mung beans have a fast growth rate, which may display its phenotypic plasticity faster than other slower-growing plants. Also, mung beans do not have much high stress-tolerance against high temperature condition innately, thus its phenotypic changes can be observed more easily. Temperature is one of the abiotic factors in the environment that may affect the energy allocation and growth pattern of plants. Higher, than room, temperature may cause water in the soil to evaporate faster than normal thus decrease the amount of water available for the roots to absorb. Thus, it is hypothesized that the higher temperature of the soil, the longer or wider the roots will grow to obtain more underground resources, and the root-shoot ratio will be higher than normal. The outcome of this report can be agriculturally beneficial since phenotypic plasticity may play a fundamental role in plant’s external feedback in response to climate change [Weiner: 2004], thus understanding such mechanism may increase overall crops production and preserve endangered plant species during drastic environmental changes. 


Materials and Methods:
Two groups of mung beans were set up – experimental (with heat mat underneath) and control. Seeds were distributed with equal space from each other and the depth of the seeding holes was approximately the same. For the experimental condition, a heat mat was placed underneath the pot to increase the soil temperature approximately 10°F to 20°F higher than normal while the control group didn’t have the heat mat. Watered both groups daily for two weeks. 
At the end of the second watering week, carefully harvested the plants from the pots and removed dirt from the plants. Weight the weight of the whole plant, then cut the plants at the root-shoot point (usually the intersection where the white section meets the red area) to separate the plants into root and shoot parts. Measured the maximum length of roots and shoots, weight of the whole plant, weights of roots and shoots. Recorded the data, then calculated the mean ± standard deviation and root-to-shoot ratio (in weights and length). Bar graphs were used to compare the data in each condition. One-tail p-values from two-sample t-test were used to evaluate the statistical significance of each comparison.    


Results:
8 out of 18 plants died in the experimental condition (higher soil temperature). In Figure 1., there is statistical significance for the comparison of whole plant weights; experimental plants were heavier than plants grew under control condition. The mean weights of the experimental plants were 0.59 ± 0.2 g and 0.38 ± 0.3 g for control (n=10 for experimental, n=18 for control), p-value is 0.019. There is no statistical significance in the other comparisons for root weights, shoot weights, R:S weight ratio, root length, shoot length, and R:S length ratio (shown in Figure 1, 2, and 3). In weight and length comparisons, experimental samples (orange column) always had the heavier weight. In Figure 3., for the ratio comparison, the weight proportion of roots in control condition was larger than it was in the experimental condition; the length proportion of roots in experimental condition was greater than it was in the control condition.

Discussion:
Energy allocation is one of the central concepts in ecology that allows plants to adapt to their environment with phenotypic changes. Here, our results do not support our hypothesis that the higher temperature of the soil, the longer, or larger, the roots would grow, and the root-shoot ratio will be higher than normal. While studies have found heat stresses can limit plant growth, but the water stress in the soil also plays an important role in root growth [Lipiec: 2013][Vadez: 2012]. In normal drought condition, there is only minimal moisture in the soil, thus plants may have wide-spread and long roots to reach water that is kept deep underground. However, in our experimental setting, the soil was kept moist due to daily watering, which did not stimulate the roots to grow longer to search for the bioavailable resources. Additionally, constant watering also canceled the heat stress imposed by the heat map since watering cooled the soil. Thus, the soil temperature may not be raised as high as 10°F to 20°F; in other words, the soil temperature of the experimental group might have minimal difference from that of in the control condition. Moreover, the soil was not lacking any necessary resources, thus with a minimal increase of soil temperature results in no statistically significant difference in all, but one, body part growth, as shown in Figure 1., 2., and 3.
	Several factors that affect root growth includes, but not limited to, soil compaction (or other mechanical impedance) [Nosalewicz: 2014], time and frequency of heat stress and drought condition, heat/drought-tolerance of each plant [Hanslin: 2019], etc. The phenological responses to heat-stress and water limitation not only lengthen the root also reduce the shoot growth to limit the water use [El: 2010]; however, this change is not prominent in this report since water was not limited in the experimental setting since soil water was expected to evaporate more rapid due to higher soil temperature. However, 8 of the 18 plants in the experimental condition died while all of the plants in the control lived, thus heat-stress may have influenced the plants but through mechanisms different from phenotypic plasticity.  A difference in the proportion in root-to-shoot length was shown in Figure 3. and the root tends to take up more portion of the entire plant in the high-temperature condition.  
	Although these environmentally-induced structural adjustments and energy redistributions plasticity was not obvious in this report, it is, according to several studies, a crucial mechanism for plants to respond to environmental changes [Nicotra: 2010]. It is also essential, and agriculturally beneficial, to unveil such machinery to enhance future plant breeding success under climate change. At the ecological level, it is also critical to phenotypically and genetically analyze how plants, especially the endemic species, respond to their environment during drastic fluctuations [Loretta: 2014] to preserve them before any major ecosystem lost.  
	In conclusion, our proposed hypothesis is not supported by the results. However, more plants died in the higher-soil-temperature condition than the control and an increase in total weight of the plants was observed in the experimental condition still shows some phenological responses of the plants. Therefore, further experiments, with more realistic design and at the molecular level, should be done to investigate the allometric patterns of plants in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli.
