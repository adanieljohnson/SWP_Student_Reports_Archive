Title: Effects of Na Concentration on Rate of Photosynthetic Activity in Plants 

Abstract:
Light-dependent reactions are an essential part of photosynthetic activity and electron transfer in plants. In our experiment we wanted to determine if the addition of NaCl would have a significent effect on these two variables. Considering that absorbance plays a big role in the rate of electron transfer, we hypothesized that the addition of NaCl would inhibit the rate of electron transfer. We designed an experiment with 10 different test tubes, using spinach to extract a chloroplast precipitate. We later combined 6 of our tubes with two different dilutions of NaCl, 3 with a 10: 1 ratio, and 3 with 20: 1. Once the chloroplast was extracted and added to our two NaCl treatments, absorbance values were recorded 3 separate times after three 10 minutes intervals, using a lamp for a light source. After recording and analyzing the absorbances, we determined that our results did support our hypothesis. Our p_values being less than .05 showed that the treatment of NaCl did have a significent effect on absorbance values, consequently decreasing the rate of electron transfer as absorbance increased.    

Introduction:
Chloroplasts are cytoplasmic organelles that play an essential role in facilitating the processes of photosynthesis. The energy required to carry out these processes start with light-dependent reactions, which are divided into two systems, Photosystem I, and Photosystem II. The order in which these two systems occur is counterintuitive, with Photosystem II occurring before Photosystem I. During Photosystem II, energy is absorbed from photons of light, which in turn, drives electrons out of chlorophyll, moving them to plastoquinone [Johnson: 2018]. John F. Allen and Thomas Pfannschmidt describe the wavelengths of the photons in saying, “PS II, where the initial electron donor is water, absorbs and converts visible light at wavelengths up to 680nm. PS I, which accepts electrons from PS II, uses light of greater wavelength, up to or beyond 700 nm [Osmond et al.: 2000] …” Oxidized chlorophyll is then cut by hydrolysis to produce O2. The remaining free protons from water are pumped out through the thylakoid membrane. In Photosystem I, the initial energy carried by incoming photons of light is used again to excite the electrons of chlorophyll molecules.  This reaction causes the excited electrons to leave the chlorophyll and pass through NADP+, producing NADPH, which along with other enzymes, provide energy to many intracellular reactions. Photosystem I and II function together to create the proton gradient necessary to drive ATP synthesis [Johnson: 2018]. In our study we hypothesized that by increasing the salt concentration inside the plant cell, this would cause a reduced rate of the electron transfer that drives photosynthetic activity. 


Materials and Method:
The study began by destemming, and grinding 3 leaves of spinacia oleracea, with 10Ml of grinding buffer solution. Once ground thoroughly, an additional 10Ml of grinding buffer was added, and mixed again. After being strained through cheesecloth to ensure no loose particles, the spinacia oleracea solution was added to a centrifuge. An equivalent volume of water was also added to another centrifuge to properly balance the spectrofuge. The centrifuge was spun on two separate occasions, once for 3 minutes at 200rpm, and then a second for the same rate and time. While the spectrofuge spun, 10 test tubes were prepared with 2Ml of reaction buffer solution, and 6Ml of water added to each tube. For 6 of the tubes, 2M NaCl was also added, 3 with a ratio of 10: 1, and 3 with a ratio of 20: 1. For the remaining 4 test tubes, 1 was used as a buffer, while the other 3 acted as our controll group with just the reaction buffer and water. Once the last cycle in the spectrofuge was complete, the excess solution was poured off, leaving only the precipitate (or B-pellet), as our source of chloroplast. From here, 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the B-pellet, and 2 Ml of DCIP was added to our 10 test tubes, minus the buffer. 100μL of B-pellet solution were then pipetted into each of the same 9 tubes, and then afterwards, an initial absorbance value was recorded. Lastly the absorbance values were re-recorded after keeping the cuvettes under a lamp for 10 mins. This process was repeated for a total of 3 times, in order to observe any changes in absorbance values. A two-tailed t_test was conducted to test significance, along with a two-tailed p_value. A line-graph was also used to clearly see the shifting change in absorbance values after leaving the cuvettes under the lamp.  

Results:
After collecting the average absorbance values for each of the two treatment, and one controll groups in Figure 1; it was shown that our 20: 1 NaCl treatment had a higher average change in absorbance values from the start of the first 10 minutes under the lamp, up until the last 10 minutes. The dependent variable was the change in absorbance, and the independent variable being the 2M NaCl. We calculated a mean, at zero absorbance, of 0.342 for our 20: 1 treatment group, 0.345 for 10: 1, and 0.425 for our controll group. Also, for our controll we found a standard deviation of 29.7 at the 10-minute interval, 33.7 at 20 minutes, and 33 for 30 minutes. For the 20: 1 treatment, 13.45 at 10 minutes, 19.8 at 20 minutes, and 19.2 at 30. Lastly, for the 10: 1 treatment, 12.6 at 10 minutes, 12.74 at 20 minutes, and 15.93 at 30. Using the two-tailed t test, we computed a p_value of 0.03 for our controll and 10: 1 treatment, and a p_value of .00000962 comparing our controll and 20: 1 treatment group. 

Discussion:
According to our results there was a significent difference in absorbance between the chloroplasts with 2M NaCl and the controll group without. The change of absorbance values was a direct effect our treatment, since both of our p_values 0.03 and .00000962 were less than .05, showing significance. To compare our results to a similar study, it was noted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London that chlorophyll molecules tend to decrease once it reaches an initial maximum absorbance. Allen and Pfannschmidt state, “Chlorophyll fluorescence falls slowly from an initial maximum, and oxygen yield (not shown) increases with approximately the same kinetics as those with which energy is redistributed to PSI at the expense of PSII. PSI, which is initially rate limiting, becomes more effective in capturing light energy and transporting electrons as the redistribution proceeds. The chlorophyll fluorescence from PS II decreases as a result of the combined decrease in excitation energy transfer to PS II and increased photochemical quenching of PS II fluorescence [Osmond et al.: 2000].” Much like our experiment, our average absorbance values under each condition tended to peak at a certain point, showing that photosystem I does have a large effect on the rate of electron transfer as the absorbance goes down. Meaning that as absorbance decreases, the higher rate of electron transfer. Despite the controll group having a higher change in absorbance, the two NaCl treatment groups had higher overall absorbance values, 10: 1 being the highest. This higher absorbance proves that the NaCl did inhibit photosynthetic activity and electron transfer. Our hypothesis was proven in this study. A good idea for a future experiment could be to leave the cuvettes under the lamp for a longer period of time or to use different ratios of NaCl to see if we observe any new changes in reaction compared to the ones we saw in this study.
