Title: Variations in habituation rates of Betta splendends 

Abstract:
Two experiments showed the there is not a significant difference between habituation rates in Betta splendens to variations in specific visual stimuli. When exposed to variations in male-male visual stimuli fish were timed to determine the rate of habituation. In this experiment, we defined habituation as the absence of agonistic behaviors for 30 seconds. The first experiment showed that there was no difference between habituation rates in fish which were presented with their own reflection than fish presented with another male with the resulting p-value 0.147. The second experiment showed that there was no difference between two males which were separated over a long distance when compared with the sort distance separation. This resulted in the p-value 0.715. Despite these findings, the consensus of the vast body of literature is that habituation occurs faster both in a mirror and a distance increase. Because of this, reducing agonistic behaviors in Betta splendens is likely important for the health and wellbeing of proximally located fish.

Introduction:
Many species of animals respond to stress or perceived threats with agonistic behavior. Here, species will often use threats, displays, or physical aggression to assert dominance. This can occur in two ways. First, agonistic behavior can occur as an interspecies behavior. An example of this would be two species of crayfish participating in territorial and resource-based physical aggression [Bergman: 2003]. The second way agonistic behavior occurs is as intraspecific behavior. Intraspecific agonistic behavior is where members of the same species exhibit aggressive behavior towards each other. This often occurs for the same reasons as interspecific agonistic behavior, but unlike interspecific, intraspecific aggression is more closely linked to mate selection. 
Over time and exposure, individuals of a species generally habituate to each other and their surroundings. This habituation allows for stress reduction as individuals reduce their agonistic behavior to various stimuli in their environment.
Agonistic behaviors are an important part of animal behavior. Because of this, understanding agonistic behavior in a species is relevant when attempting to conserve ecosystems and when managing certain species. Because of their agonistic behavior, some species will fight each other to the death when placed in the same enclosure or die of stressed when placed too close to each other. Because of this, knowing the agonistic patterns of a species is significant for managing individuals.
Siamese Fighting Fish (Betta splendens) perform many variations of agonistic behaviors when they feel threatened. These fish use their fins, coloration, and physical aggression to defend territory and secure mating partners [Simpson: 1968] These displays can be divided into two main forms, facing displays and broad-side displays [Simpson: 1968]. Agonistic displays of B. splendens are frequently used for studies in intraspecies interactions because of their consistent and easily recognizable displays as well as their ability to eventually habituate. We hypothesized that when compared, the habituation rates between two males that were closely separated would be significantly longer than both males presented with their own reflection and, males separated by a greater distance. 


Materials and Methods:
Three male Betta splendens were selected and then placed in separate sections of a divided tank labeled 1-3. The tank was filled with room temperature tap water and each of the dividers had both a clear and opaque layer. Three different experiments were conducted to determine the rate of habituation under different circumstances. Habituation was defined as the time at which a fish did not display any agonistic behaviors for thirty seconds. To prevent injury from stress, the fish were never allowed to exhibit agonistic behavior for more than sis minuets. 
In the first experiment, one male, fish 1, was presented with its own reflection in a mirror and timed to determine the rate of habituation. After the fish reached habituation, the mirror was removed, and the fish was allowed to rest for five minutes before the experiment was repeated. This was replicated three times. 
For the second experiment, two male fish were separated by a clear and an opaque divider. The opaque divider was removed allowing fish 1 and 2 to interact until they habituated. This was repeated for three replicates with five minutes between each replicate. After this, this experiment was repeated but the fish 2 and 3 were used and they were separated by a greater distance; approximately 4 inches. Once all of the data from the three experiments was collected, the results were analyzed using a two-sample t-test.


Results:
Using the data collected, we compared the control groups, the two males which were close together, with both of the experimental groups, the male with the mirror and the two males which were far away from each other. When compared with the control group, both of the experimental groups presented data which was not significant. The average amount of time it took for the fish to habituate to its own reflection was p-value of the fish with its reflection was 49 seconds with a standard deviation of 9.54 while the average for the control was 199.67 seconds with a standard deviation of 143.32. The p-value for this experiment was 0.143 as can be seen in figure 1.
	The average amount of time it took for the fish to habituate to each other over a longer distance was 166 seconds with a standard deviation of 38.74 compared to 199.67 seconds with a standard deviation of 143.32 for the control group. The p-value for this experiment was 0.715. This can be seen in figure 2.


Discussion:
In both of the experiments, our results proved to be not significant. In the first experiment, B. splendens was found to not habituate faster when presented with its own reflection than when presented with another male fish in its close proximity. This is surprising because other sources found the opposite to be true [Rhoad: 1975]. Baenninger specifically found that not only did B. splendens habituate, but they began to display avoidance behaviors [Baenninger: 1966]. One explanation for this difference is the amount of time the fish were observed and what the researchers defined as habituation or avoidance behaviors. Much of the literature presented used much longer amounts of time, up to 32 hours, for exposure [Baenninger: 1966]. Despite this, more recent research found B, Splendens to frequently habituate in under 10 minutes [Bronstein: 1983].
Similarly, our second experiment did not support our hypothesis because habituation rates between two fish which were only separated by a clear divider and the habituation rates between fish which were separated by a greater distance were not different. This finding is counter to findings in the available literature. Multiple sources found that distance did correspond negatively to habituation rates [Bronstein: 1983] [Bronstein: 1981].  Again, one possible explanation for this could be the amount of time another is the sample size for many studies was much larger than our sample size of three fish [Baenninger: 1966] [Bronstein: 1983].
Despite methodological similarities, our findings were different from the vast amount of available literature which likely means that our design was likely flawed. Based on prior research, it is likely that in reality both of the experimental groups habituate faster than the control group. This means that ensuring that B. splendens kept in captivity are placed farther apart does reduce their stress and would likely improve the overall wellbeing of all fish located within visual range of each other. Reducing agonistic behaviors in Betta splendens is likely important for the health and wellbeing of proximally located fish.
