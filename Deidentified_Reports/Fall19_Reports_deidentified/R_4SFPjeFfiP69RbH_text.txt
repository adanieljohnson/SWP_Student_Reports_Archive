Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormones on the Larvae of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
none

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta and its holometabolous life cycle of 39-48 days has been studied and observed countless times. Beginning as an egg, the insect then goes through five instar stages as a larva before it pupates and then molts into an adult. Moving from one life stage to the next requires molting, which is when the insect sheds its old cuticle and replaces it with a new one. Most of this development, molting, pupating, and formation into an adult is controllled by two main hormones—Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Juvenile Hormone is produced by glands on the corpus allata, and this hormone regulates the type of molt that happens during development as well as various functions in adult insects. JH levels stay high in the Manduca Sexta up until the fourth larval instar where they start to drop, and once the fifth larval instar is underway, JH levels are extremely low [Johnson: 2019]. The effect of Juvenile Hormone in metamorphosis “has gained it the attribute ‘status quo’ hormone” [Hartfelder: 2000]. Studying the effect of Juvenile Hormone on larvae of any kind of insect is important because treating larvae with Juvenile Hormone can prevent them from becoming pests as adults. The larva can only molt into the adult form once Juvenile Hormone levels are low, so if Juvenile Hormone levels stay high and consistent, then the larva’s ability to molt into an adult will be affected. We hypothesized that if a group of tobacco hornworms is treated with Juvenile Hormone, then the speed at which they will molt to an adult will decrease.

Materials and Method:
A group of four tobacco hornworms was each fed ten grams of food with four drops of water to serve as the controll group. A separate group of four tobacco hornworms was each fed ten grams of food with four drops of Precor Juvenile Hormone to serve as the experimental group. The weight of each worm was recorded each day along with other observations about the appearances of the worms in each group. Each hornworm was contained in a separate chamber with airholes and their own food supply. The food was replaced in the same amount if it was no longer moist. A two-sample t_test was used because the means from the controll and experimental groups of hornworms were compared. The alternative hypothesis was one-tailed because it was predicted that the speed at which the experimental group molted to an adult would be significently less than that of the controll group. A one-tailed p_value was calculated along with two standard deviations – one for the average final weights of the controll group and another for the average final weights of the experimental group. 

Results:
One-tailed p_value: 0.205305
Control Group Standard Deviation: 2.68
Experimental Group Standard Deviation: 1.58
Figure 1 displays the average final weights of both the controll group and experimental group fed with juvenile hormone along with standard deviation bars for each. The average final weight of the caterpillars in the JH experimental group was calculated to be 13.846 grams, and the average final weight of the caterpillars in the controll group was calculated to be 12.323 grams. The experimental group of caterpillars had a greater final average weight than the controll group. The controll group of caterpillars had a greater standard deviation of average weight than the experimental group. Figure 2 and Figure 3 display two caterpillars from the controll group on the final day of the experiment that began the molting process. The brown spots on the underside of the caterpillars indicate the beginnings of molting. 

Discussion:
Even though the average final weight of the experimental group was heavier than that of the controll group, the hypothesis was supported because the controll group began to pupate and molt before the experimental group that was treated with Juvenile Hormone. Figure 1 displays this difference between the average final weights of the experimental and controll groups. Certain studies portray evidence that Juvenile Hormone also plays a role in the final size of insects; it was found that larvae that lack the JH-producing organ (the corpus allata) were smaller in size and grew at reduced rates [Mirth: 2014]. This study supports the results of our experiment because the controll group had a smaller average final weight than the JH experimental group. It also explains why there was a difference in weight between the two groups. It was observed that the experimental group caterpillars were much lighter in color than the controll group, and on the final day of the two week experiment period, the caterpillars in the controll group began to turn brown on the bottom and can therefore be considered to be at the beginning stages of pupation, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Other studies have been conducted to examine the speed at which molting occurs in Manduca Sexta larvae. Some studies have concluded that a sort of timer for molting is involved in Manduca Sexta larvae and affects when they begin to pupate and molt to an adult. The larva must reach a critical weight before they can begin metamorphosis on time, and juvenile hormone is inhibitory of this critical checkpoint [Yuichiro: 2013]. This study supports the results of our experiment because we also found that Juvenile Hormone was inhibitory of the timing at which Manduca Sexta larvae being molting and pupation. It is important to note that two caterpillars in the experimental group died about halfway through the two-week experiment period for unknown reasons, which affected the calculated final average weight of the controll group. One way in which the experiment could be modified for future test would be to extend the experiment period to five to six weeks in order to be able to more accurately observe the molting processes in both groups and compare the speed at which both groups molt to an adult. This would provide more accurate data to support the hypothesis because the Manduca Sexta would come close to completing an entire life cycle. The results of the test are not statistically significent because the p_value is above 0.05. The standard deviation for both groups is small because the weights of each caterpillar in each group were similar, indicating that Juvenile Hormone has minimal effect on the Manduca Sexta larvae. This also indicates that Juvenile Hormone is not an effective pesticide because it caused the experimental group to grow more than the controll group, creating larger larvae and therefore larger pests.
