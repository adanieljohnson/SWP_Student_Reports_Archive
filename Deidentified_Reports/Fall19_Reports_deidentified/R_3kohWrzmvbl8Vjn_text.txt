Title: Resource Allocation During Mung Bean Plant Growth under Differing Temperature Conditions

Abstract:
Plants use the mechanism of resource allocation to meaningfully distribute limited resources throughout the organism to prioritize organs in response to the environment that the individual experiences. To observe this mechanism in plant life Mung Beans, Vigna Radiata, were utilized and tested in two separate temperature conditions to observe if temperature would affect energy allocation in this plant. The two conditions that the Mung Beans were grown in were the temperatures of the greenhouse and the raised temperature of an incubator. As a result of experimentation, the data conveyed that plants grown in the greenhouse had a higher weight and height root to shoot ratios. Specifically, the Mung Beans grown in the incubator had longer shoot lengths in comparison to the plants grown in the greenhouse. Whereas, the Mung Beans grown in the green house had longer root lengths. This demonstrated that Mung beans grown in higher temperatures allocate more of their resources to the shoots and plants grown in conditions that are more regulated will allocate more resources to the roots.


Introduction:
Plants use the mechanism of resource allocation to meaningfully distribute limited resources throughout the organism to prioritize organs in response to the environment that the individual experiences. To observe this mechanism in plant life Mung Beans, Vigna Radiata, were utilized and tested in two separate temperature conditions to observe if temperature would affect energy allocation in this plant. The two conditions that the Mung Beans were grown in were the temperatures of the greenhouse and the raised temperature of an incubator. As a result of experimentation, the data conveyed that plants grown in the greenhouse had a higher weight and height root to shoot ratios. Specifically, the Mung Beans grown in the incubator had longer shoot lengths in comparison to the plants grown in the greenhouse. Whereas, the Mung Beans grown in the green house had longer root lengths. This demonstrated that Mung beans grown in higher temperatures allocate more of their resources to the shoots and plants grown in conditions that are more regulated will allocate more resources to the roots.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we used four pots for each growing condition with 12 Mung Bean seeds in each pot. We placed for watered pots with Mung Beans in both a heated incubator and a greenhouse. The plants were grown for a two week long period in their respective conditions and throughout this growing process the plants were watered approximately 4-5 times each week.  Then after the plants grew for two weeks the length and mass of the roots and shoots of 10 selected plants, from each of the two growing conditions, was collected. To measure the length and mass of the roots and shoots we cut the plant at the root-shoot junction,separated the respective selections and weighed each section of the plant. We measured the total mass of the plant prior to cutting the plant. We used a traditional ruler to procure the lengths of the roots and shoots.  Then the root to shoot ratio for both mass and length was calculated. A paired T-test was used to determine the significant difference between the length and weight of the plants grown in the two environments.



Results:
Generally, it was observed that the Mung Beans grown in the greenhouse conditions had on average longer stems and roots in addition to having a greater mass in comparison to plants grown in the heated incubator. The average root length of the plants grown in the greenhouse was mean +/- 17.89cm sd (Fig.2)  and the p-value was .00664. The average length ratio of the plants grown in the greenhouse was 1.767 and the ratio for the plants grown in the incubator was .961. The p-value for the root length is .000208.
Furthermore, the masses of the plants grown in the greenhouse were higher than those grown in the heated incubator (Fig.1). The average length of the roots grown in the heated conditions were mean +/- 13.33 cm sd. The average weight root to shoot ratio for Mung Beans grown in the greenhouse was  mean +/-  1.016g sd and the average ratio for the incubator was .866. 


Discussion:
The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis that Mung Beans grown in the greenhouse will not only have a higher mass but we expect that their roots will be longer than the plants grown in the heated incubator and we expect the opposite for plants grown in the heated incubator. These results could have occurred because Mung Beans are a warm season crop that require adequate rainfall and when grown in high temperature- low moisture environments the growth ability is negatively affected. According to a study done on the effects of Co2 and temperature on plant growth and resource allocation plants grown in more mild climates were able to grow larger and a higher rate (Coleman ,2019). An additional factor that could affect the resource allocation is when introduced to increased temperature results in reduced allocation to leaves possibly due to photosynthetic rates. The increased lateral growth could be attributed to an increased amount of stoma being opened in warmer conditions. The opening of stomata allows for more carbon dioxide to enter the plant ,therefore increasing the rate of photosynthesis. In the future, if this experiment were to be replicated, we could evolve the study into including a wider variety of plants and more extreme temperatures for the environments the plants are grown in.
