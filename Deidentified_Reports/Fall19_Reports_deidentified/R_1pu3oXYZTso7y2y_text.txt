Title: Inhibiting Ecdysterone in Juvenile Manduca sexta Shown to Significantly Decrease Growth Rate

Abstract:
Ecdysterone is an important hormone for the growth and molting of Manduca sexta larvae. To understand the effects of removing ecdysterone from juvenile M. sexta, we treated their food with an ecdysterone inhibitor and measured their mass daily to find their growth rates. We hypothesized that larvae treated with the hormone inhibitor would experience decreased growth rates compared to untreated larvae. The treated larvae hardly grew and died after 9 days of treatment. A one-sided two-sample t-test was conducted, and a significant result [p=0.01] was obtained showing that blocking ecdysterone in juvenile M. sexta decreased their rate of growth. This is likely because ecdysterone is necessary for larval development, and without it they went into diapause causing decreased cell proliferation and eventually death.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta, or tobacco hornworms, are a moth that can cause serious damage to crops while in their juvenile larva stage. Farmers need effective pesticides in order to limit the harm caused by hornworms, and avoid economic loss. M. sexta, were a useful model organism because they are easy to rear in a lab, and show visible physical changes throughout their life cycle. Hornworms have four stages of life: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The larval stage, the stage where they cause the most harm, is broken into five different instar stages. After the fifth instar, they molt and undergo metamorphosis. Two families of hormones, juvenile hormones and ecdysterones, are critical in the development of the larva, as they work together to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis [Johnson: 2019]. A decrease in juvenile hormone and a spike in ecdysterone triggers molting and pupal development in M. sexta [Nijhout: 1975]. This experiment showed that ecdysterone was a necessary hormone in order to molt. We are interested in whether inhibiting ecdysterone, or 20E, will be detrimental to larval development. If this is the case, a 20E inhibitor could be used as a pesticide. If an ecdysterone inhibitor is administered to M. sexta larvae via their food, then over 14 days of treatment they will have a significantly smaller rate of growth, based on mass, than larvae whose food is treated with water.


Materials and Methods:
First we obtained two empty plastic containers that each had four separate cells. One container would hold the experimental group of hornworms, so each cell was labeled experiment a, b, c, and d respectively. The other container would hold the control group, so cells were labeled control a, b, c, and d respectively. One healthy 3rd instar larva hornworm was massed and placed in each cell. Each hornworm received 10g of food in its cell that was treated with either 1:1250 parts Azaguard 20E inhibitor for the experimental, or water for the control group. The larvae were massed every day, and their food was replaced whenever it got dry. After 14 days, we found the mean change in daily mass for each group. We then averaged those results to get the overall mean growth rate for each group. All four experimental hornworms were dead after the ninth day so data was only used up until the ninth day. We then conducted a one-sided two-sample t-test to test for a significant difference between the mean growth rates of the experimental and control hornworms.


Results:
We observed that, even after only a few days, the experimental group of hornworms appeared much smaller than their control group counterparts. Experimental hornworms began to lose their green color after several days, and looked more yellow than the control hornworms. At day 10 all experimental hornworms were dead, and one control hornworm was dead. The error bars in both figures 1 and 2 partially overlap, showing the large variation in individual weights of the hornworms. However, one can see the average weights of the control group begin to rise greatly above the average weights of the experimental group around day five (Fig 1). The mean daily growth for the experimental group was 0.136956 ± 0.147935 g (Fig 2). The mean daily growth for the control group was 0.000244 ± 0.014571 g (Fig 2). We determined that the mean daily growth for control hornworms was statistically significantly larger than the mean daily growth of experimental hornworms [df=8, p=0.01].


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by the data. The mean daily growth rate of M. sexta larvae treated with a 20E inhibitor had a significantly smaller daily growth rate. We observed a statistically significant difference at the .05 level, suggesting that inhibiting 20E in juvenile hornworms greatly limits their development. 20E is known to work in conjunction with juvenile hormone to regulate growth and molting [Johnson: 2019]. With 20E being blocked, the hormonal balance of the larvae would be thrown off making them unable to grow and molt. This is likely what led to their death. Another group in our lab doing the same experiment with half the dosage of 20E blocker also had their experimental group die before the 14 days were over. This would suggest that the death was induced by the 20E inhibitor rather than another unknown factor. Previous experiments have shown that when ecdysterone levels drop too low, M. sexta larvae undergo diapause and experience decreased growth and cell proliferation [Champlin: 1998]. This study demonstrates ecdysterone’s importance in molting, and likely explains why our experimental larvae stopped growing. The lack of 20E could have caused a prolonged diapause, ultimately resulting in their deaths. In future experiments it would be beneficial to have many more hornworms to treat, and to treat them with different doses of 20E inhibitor. This would help clarify whether the deaths we observed were due to the treatment, or due to chance in a small sample size. If the Azaguard 20E inhibitor can reliably halt growth in hornworm larvae and lead to their death, then it could be an effective pesticide that would be valuable to farmers. If a 20E inhibitor were sprayed on crops, any hornworms that attempted to eat them would likely go into diapause and perish.
