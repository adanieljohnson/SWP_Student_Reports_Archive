Title: The examination of the change in Manduca Sexta growth patterns due to the addition of Precor in their diet

Abstract:
This experiment was performed to study the effect of Precor Insect Growth Regulator on the Manduca Sexta. We hypothesized that the larvae treated with Precor would be smaller than the controll since they would be larvae for longer and their growth processes would be disturbed leading to potential growth complications. To test this hypothesis, we used 8 larvae, 4 for controll and 4 for treatment. We fed them 10 grams of food with 5 drops of water for the controll group and 5 drops of Precor for the treatment group. During our experiment we averaged the largest difference for each subject. The overall mean for the controll was 5.17 grams and the mean for the treatment group was 6.48 grams. This means, on average, the treatment group was 1.31 grams larger. This difference is insignificent because our p value is 0.245. This value is greater than 0.05 so we fail to reject our null hypothesis. However, I still believe with more testing, we will find out that Precor has potential benefits in pest controll.

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta (MS) is an organism that starts as a caterpillar and through many developmental stages, becomes a moth. The Manduca Sexta is a pest in its infantile stages, when it is a caterpillar, but it out grows its pest-like behavior as an adult moth [Byron: 2017]. For this experiment we are focusing on one of the more important hormones, Juvenile Hormone [JH], which keeps the Manduca Sexta as a larvae for as long as it is abundant in the organism. We are going to test the effects of JH on Manduca Sexta growth and maturation. We found this particularly important because, if altering the amount of Juvenile Hormone in a Manduca Sexta would prompt it to develop into an adult moth faster, then the Manduca Sexta would be a pest for shorter amount of time. This would be extremely beneficial for farmers. With that said, we posed the following question, if Precor is used, will it alter Juvenile Hormone levels in Manduca Sexta to inhibit growth and make the caterpillars treated with it smaller than the controlls. From this question we derived our hypothesis. We hypothesized that the Manduca Sexta’s growth and ability to molt would be inhibited by Precor; thus, the treatment group will weigh less and molt slower. This makes out null hypothesis a statement of no difference between weights of caterpillars treated with water or Precor. Our independent value is the amount of Precor added (in grams) and our dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillar (in grams). 

Materials and Method:
In order to accurately test the effect of Precor in a Manduca Sexta’s diet on their growth we selected eight total caterpillars and split them in half, four in a controll group and four in a treatment group. We put two airholes at the top of each cell.  We gave each caterpillar 10 grams of food with 5 drops of liquid. The treatment group got Precor and the controll group got water. We fed the caterpillars when the food ran out or if the food became dry. We also cleaned out all excrements in the cells daily. For 15 days straight, we monitored our caterpillars. We measured their masses everyday and took observations. To determine the overall growth of our caterpillars from day 1 to day 15, we averaged the weights of the controll group and the treatment group daily and made a figure. To calculate our p_value, we took the same daily average sand subtracted each day by the final mass for each group to find our average growth per day. We used a one-tailed T-test to find out our p_value and compared it against 0.05 to see if our experimental data is significent or not.

Results:
After collecting the data we formed Figure 1 to display our results. We found that on average, our treatment group was 1.3 grams larger than the controll group. We also discovered that day 10 was the day when the growth rate of the controll group decreased but the rate of the treatment did not. The overall mean for the controll group was 5.17 grams and the overall mean for the treatment group was 6.48 grams. Our p_value, calculated with a one-tailed T-test, was 0.245.

Discussion:
After observing our experiment with Manduca Sexta for two weeks, it became evident that our hypothesis was not supported. The treatment group was actually larger than the controll group, even though our alternative hypothesis stated that we thought the treatment group would be smaller [Figure 1]. This comes as no surprise because Manduca Sexta larvae entering their 5th interstellar stage, before pupation, becoming quite large reaching around 10-12 grams [Kanost: 2016] [Johnson: 2018]. Our p_value was greater than 0.05 so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Precor did not have a statistically significent impact on inhibiting the growth of our caterpillars. The most interesting part of our experiment to me was at day 10. Our caterpillars were around the same size, but then our controll group shrunk, and our treatment did not. For the rest of the experiment the treatment group would be larger than the controll group. I think an error we could have made was not changing the food often enough when they got bigger. There were days where there would be some food left so, we would not change it but we most likely should have because the caterpillars were large and there was not much food left. This could have hampered the caterpillar’s growth in both the controll and treatment group. To further test this study more experimenting should be done with a sample size larger than eight total caterpillars.
