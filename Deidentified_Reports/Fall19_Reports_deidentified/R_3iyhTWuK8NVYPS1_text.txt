Title: The effect of the Phosphorus on  Fagopyrum esculentum's Root Length to Shoot Length Ratio

Abstract:
In natural environments, organisms adapt under pressure, with different strategies to maximize their surviving chances. Plants adjust their growth pattern based on the environment by the property phenotypic plasticity, which could be shown through their root length:shoot length ratio. Phosphorus, a soil nutrient, is known to make plants allocate more biomass to the roots when deficient in soil. This experiment intended to investigate the effect of phosphorus on buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum’s root length:shoot length ratio. The hypothesis that plants that are treated with phosphorus will have a smaller root length:shoot length ratio was not supported, since there is no significant statistical difference. One explanation to the result is over fertilization of phosphorus in our test group. Further experiment could be done with different levels of phosphorus treated to buck-weed, measuring their difference in root:shoot ratio.  

Introduction:
Since resources are limited, plants, trying to survive and compete, change how they allocate resources based on environment conditions, such as adjusting their growth pattern based on the environment. The patterns of allocation is not completely fixed for a species, but depend specifically on the environment an individual is exposed to [Johnson:2006]. This property is called phenotypic plasticity. One method to access plants’ change in growth pattern is through their root length:shoot length ratio, the amount of plant tissue that are invested in absorbing soil nutrients to the amount of plant tissue invested to collect solar energy, so that we could measure whether they invest more resource on collecting chemicals in the soil or solar energy from the sun. 
In nature, phosphorus absorption is one of the factors that affect plants’ growth and development. Phosphoric acid has a role in plant metabolism, in that carbohydrates can enter into the metabolism of plants only by way of the carbohydratephosphoric acid ester; it helps plants to use carbohydrates, building up secondary substances [Behrens:1956]. Phosphorus deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity [Carstensen:2018]. Since photosynthesis is process of plant energy production, phosphorus which affects ATP synthase activity is a crucial nutrient for plant growth and survival.  As phosphorus is absorbed by plants from soil, plants allocate their growth of root in response to the level of phosphorus to obtain sufficient nutrient. During plant growth stage, the biomass of plants increase proportionally with phosphorus absorbed, while plants with lower phosphorous allocated more biomass to roots than shoots [Kim:2016]. This experiment intended to investigate the effect of phosphorus on Fagopyrum esculentum’s root length:shoot length ratio.  Fagopyrum esculentum, or Buckwheat,  is an abundant species originated in Asia that is a popular healthful food due to its antioxidant, antidiabetic and antitumor activities [Ren: 2013]. It is also resistant to adverse growing conditions and pathogens [Zhou:2013]. Therefore, it is a good subject of study since it has medical value and is easy to grow in the lab environment, that it could adapt differently to our treatments, adjusting its root and shoot length based on phosphorus level in soil. We hypothesize that plants that are treated with phosphorus will have a smaller root length:shoot length ratio.


Materials and Methods:
     Sixteen plots, with 10 seeds in each pot, of buckwheat were planted, where 8 are used as the test group and 8 were used as control. All plots are watered with 100mL liquid each day, where the test group is watered with 20% bone meal(phosphorus), while the control is watered with pure H2O. After two weeks, 2 plants from each pot were harvested and cut apart into root and shoot, contributing to 32 plants in total, and 16 individual plants in each treatment group. For each plant, the maximum lengths of the root and shoot were measured and the root:shoot ratio were calculated. Mean and standard deviation of root length, shoot length, and root:shoot ratio are calculated for the test group and the control group. One-tailed two sample performed between the test group and the control group to determine if there is a significant difference(     p&lt;=0.05, df =30) between the test group and the control group.



Results:
As shown in Fig.1, the average maximum root length of the test group is 49.9mm with a S.D. of 13.07mm, while the average maximum root length of the control group is 58.4mm, with a S.D. of 18.37mm. As shown in Fig.2, the average maximum shoot length of the test group is 101.9mm with a S.D. of 15.22mm, while the average maximum shoot length of the control group is 120.3mm with a S.D. of 19.61mm. Both the average maximum root length and shoot length of the control group are higher than the test group. As shown in Fig.3, the average root length:shoot length ratio is 0.49 for the test group with a S.D. of 0.13, while the average root length:shoot length ratio is 0.50 for the control group with a S.D. of 0.19. Although the ratio is slightly higher for the control group, there is no significant difference between the average root length:shoot length ratio between the two groups(t-stat=0.17, d.f=30, p=0.43).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that plants that are treated with phosphorus will have a smaller root length:shoot length ratio was not supported. As shown by Fig.3 and two sample t-test, there is insignificant
  difference between the average root: shoot length ratio of the two groups, suggesting that 100mL 20% bone meal each day for two weeks would not result in a different type of allocation of root and shoot growth in Buckwheats, compared to the those that are only treated with 100mL water. Since the control group received higher level of phosphorus compared to the control, it should result in the control group investing more biomass in shoot. They can absorb more phosphorus per unit of soil, so they theoretically don’t need to invest in roots as much as the control group. In previous experiments, root shoot:shoot  ratio decreases while phosphorus level increases [Kim:2016].  Possible explanation for the result could be that there is an overfertilization in the test group. 
As shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2, on average the control group has longer root and shoot length than the test group, suggesting that the control group, with less phosphorus received, has gained more resources and has better growth than the test group. There is a threshold of phosphorus uptake for plants that exceeding it won’t contribute to plant growth [Kim:2016]. Furthermore, high phosphorus environment could induce mycorrhizal growth in the soil, competing for resources with plants. Mycorrhizal-induced growth depression of plants in high-P soil has been reported in many species [Peng, 1993]. Therefore, overfertilization of phosphorus could contribute to the result not supporting the hypothesis that plants that are treated with phosphorus will have a smaller root length:shoot length ratio.  Further experiments could be done using different levels of phosphorus concentration treated to buckwheat, so that we could test our explanation, whether there is a threshold of phosphorus level for buckwheat to grow with smaller shoot:root length ratio, or the unsupported hypothesis is due to soil quality, bone meal quality, or other errors of this single experiment.
