Title: Impact of Juvenile Hormone Precor on mass gain of Manducta Sexta

Abstract:
Abstract 

Introduction:
Manducta Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera and has many other names such as the Sphinx Moth and tobacco hornworm. In about 19-23 days, the Manducta Sexta becomes an adult moth. This molting process is highly dependent on the roles of two hormones: Juvenile Hormone (JH) and E20. The Juvenile Hormone is produced by the Corpus Allata in the brain and is a naturally occurring hormone in the Manducta Sexta. The Juvenile Hormone is unique because it has a different structure and has certain effects on insect development [Wyatt:1996].  JH is also a type of insect growth regulator (IGR), which can have an effect on the regulatory processes for normal growth of the Manducta Sexta, among other insects. Juvenile Hormone outside of the natural regiment can be used as insect control as it can “adversely affect insect growth and development” [Tunaz:2004]. The term “third-generation pesticide” was invented in 1967, which introduced the concept of using JH as a pesticide [Subramanian: 2016]. Since additional JH inhibits Manducta Sexta from molting into an adult, when they are considered invasive species, additional JH is commonly used as a pesticide. In this experiment, Precor will be used as an insecticide, instead of Juvenile Hormone. The main ingredient in Precor, methoprene, mimics Juvenile Hormone, and is can prevent molting of the Manducta Sexta into an adult [Miller: 1999]   Given this information, the hypothesis of the experiment was when five drops of Precor are added to each the control group’s food source, their average mass gain will be less than the average mass gain of the control groups at the end of the two weeks (more weeks will be added if needed).


Materials and Methods:
Eight caterpillars were obtained and the initial mass of all was taken. They were randomly divided into two groups of four, one was the treatment group and the other was the control group. Each group received a 10 gram piece of food. The food for the treatment group was treated with 5 drops of Precor each and the food for the control group was treated with 5 drops of water. Students obtained 2 plastic bins, each with four compartments for the four caterpillars with each compartment labeled 1-4 and control versus treatment. The Manducta Sexta were stored in an incubator and received daily check-ins to record the mass of the caterpillars along with general observations. A 2-sample t-test was done to determine whether the results are statistically significant or not and if the null hypothesis can be rejected. A p-value of less than .05 means the results are statistically significant.


Results:
The mass gain of the Manducta Sexta treatment group over the course of two weeks was not statistically significant compared to the control group (t-stat=.93, df=6, P=.18). The average mass gain for the treatment group was 12.178 grams and 9.108g for the control group, as seen in Figure 1. For the most part, both the control group and treatment group grew a large amount over the course of the two weeks, but the control group’s average mass gain did not exceed the treatment group’s average mass gain enough for the scores to be statistically significant. After 7 days, the average mass gain for the treatment group was less than the control group. However, after that the control group weighed less (Figure 2). 


Discussion:
This experiment was to test the effect of Precor on 8 different Manducta Sexta. The main ingredient in Precor, methoprene, acts as an agonist and mimics the action of JH, causing the caterpillars to not molt, and therefore one would believe it would have a smaller mass gain. The hypothesis alluded to the average mass gain of the control group being higher than the average mass gain of the treatment group. However, our p-value of .181693 did not support this hypothesis. With a p-value less than .05, the data is statistically significant. The majority of the Manducta Sexta remained alive in this experiment, except for one of the controls, which died on Day 13. However, even before day 13, this caterpillar was an outlier, which had a large impact in our data and standard deviation (Figure 1). On day 12, a day before the caterpillar died, the mass was .39 g. In total, it grew .34 grams, which is much different than the average growth of 9.1 grams for the control group. This particular caterpillar significantly lowered the average mass gain of the control group, thus negatively affecting the hypothesis. When taken this caterpillar out of the equation completely, the average growth of the control group was 12.03 grams, which is much closer to the average growth of the treatment group, which was 12.178 grams. This also greatly affected the standard deviation for the treatment group (Figure 1). Yet, even with the outlier removed, the average mass gain of the control group was unexpectedly smaller than the treatment group. Given that IGR “may adversely affect insects by regulating or inhibiting specific biochemical pathways or processes essential for insect growth and development” [Tunaz: 2004], one would think the mass weight gain would be smaller for the treatment group. Additionally, Tunaz states that some insects may die with the treatment of these IGRs [Tunaz 2004]. This makes sense in the real world for killing of invasive species, but specifically for our experiment, this was not the case for the treatment group. Some errors that could have occurred in this experiment could include not cleaning the caterpillar’s waste every day which could negatively affect their growth, not having the exact same portions of food for each caterpillar, or not properly using the scales. In the future, one could add more than 5 drops of precor into the food, so the Precor would have a strong affect. This correlates to research regarding the effects of  Precor on the development of the bed bug Cimex lectularius. In this study, 1x and 2x amounts of Precor used against bed bugs had no effect in their development, but at 3x and 10x, it had an effect on their development [Goodman: 2012]. The results from this could be expected to be different, in that the treatment group would have a lower average mass gain than the control, which would support the hypothesis. Also, in the future, one could measure the length and see how the length of the control group and the treatment group differed, and if this length growth was proportional to the mass growth.
