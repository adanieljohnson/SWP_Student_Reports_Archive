Title: The Effects of The 20E Inhibitor Azaguard on Manduca sexta and Its Ability to Pupate 

Abstract:
	This study focuses on the insect Manduca sexta which is part of the order Lepidoptera. These insects have two major growth hormones Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) that controll its lifecycle and molting process to become an adult. During the larval stage these insects are detrimental to certain agricultures, and the use of different growth inhibitors in pesticides is used to controll them. This experiment looks into the use of the 20E inhibitor Azaguard and how effective it may be in stunting growth. It was hypothesized that the introduction of Azaguard would stop M. sexta from entering the pupal stage. A controll group that was given food and water and an experimental group that was given an equal amount of food and Azaguard were used to test this hypothesis over the course of two weeks. It can be concluded that the inhibitor does in fact stop them from reaching the pupal stage, and in some cases even kills the insect prematurely. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect of the order Lepidoptera whose average life cycle from eggs to adults is about 19-23 days. This is a fairly short lifestyle from start to finish, but the problem they present to agriculture occurs during the larval stage. The M. sexta, or the tobacco hookworm, tends to be a voracious feeder during its larval stage on things like tobacco, tomatoes, and sometimes potatoes [Byron et al. 2017]. The lifecycle of the M. sexta is controllled by two main hormones known as Ecdysterone (20E), which controlls the timing of a molt, and Juvenile Hormone (JH), which controlls the type of molt that occurs. These two hormones work together in order to progress the hookworm through each stage of growth [Johnson and Mallison et al. 2019]. The question that was asked during this lab was how a 20E inhibitor known as Azaguard would affect the lifecycle of M. sexta. It was hypothesized that the presence of Azaguard in pesticides would prevent M. sexta from entering the pupal stage.

Materials and Method:
	This experiment had three separate variables: the independent variable which was the presence of Azaguard, the dependent variable which was the survival and life stage of M. sexta, and the controll variable which was the hookworms who were given water and not the 20E inhibitor. The experimental and controll groups each had four hookworms. Each worm was put into a plastic container with holes in it and separated into quadrants. Each quadrant was labeled with a number 1-4 for each group. This means a total of 8 worms were chosen at random and randoMly assigned to either the controll group or the experimental group. Once the two groups of four have been chosen, each one of the 8 sections was given approximately 10 grams of food that was weighed out on a scale. Once the food was placed into each separate space the Azaguard and water were added. The experimental group was given 5 drops of Azaguard on their food, while the controll group was given 5 drops of water on their food. To keep up with the progress of the two groups, one person from the group went to check on them each day while replacing the 10 grams of food and putting the necessary drops of water or Azaguard onto the food. The worms were also weighed each day to record their progress. The feces produced from the worms was also cleaned from each container during this process.

Results:
	The general trends of the average weights can be seen in Table 1 and Figure 1. The Control group had a steady increase of weight until day 6 and 7 when the weights plateaued. The controll group had a decrease in average weight from 11.3 grams average to 10.5 grams average from day 7 to day 8. The total increase in weight of the controll group was 9.2 grams from day 1 to day 8. The experimental group had a very slow increase in average weight, and did not have an average weight as large at any point in the experiment. The weight did not drop towards the end, but it only went up 0.02 grams. The average increase in weight of the experimental group from day 1 to day 8 was 1.33 grams. A two tailed t test was used to test the significance of the data and came to a p value of 0.0003. 

Discussion:
It can be seen in the data that the Azaguard did in fact have an effect on the growth of the M. sexta. The controll group increased its weight on average by 9.2 grams while the experimental group only increased an average of 1.33 grams. The only discrepancy within the data is the fact that our first experimental group all died, so we were forced to create a new group. This is the reason for the data collection period being a tad bit skewed toward the controll group. This does not necessarily affect the outcome of the experiment though, as the average weight gains were very different still. It may be further interpreted that since the controll group never once had any fatalities that the amount of Azaguard we were using could have been a fatal dose. In the second experimental group there was also one hookworm that died as well. The M. sexta does become harmful to different types of agriculture in the larval stage, so it would seem that an attempt to limit their growth using Azaguard would make the problem worse. In this experiment however, the dose we gave the experimental group seemed effective in killing them off, so this may be the reason a 20E inhibitor is used in pesticides. The two tailed t test indicates that the data is significent, and the p value being less than 0.05 means that we can accept the null hypothesis that the presence of Azaguard would prevent the M. sexta from entering the pupal stage. This further proves the statement that the inhibition of an essential growth hormone will stunt the growth of the hookworm and therefore stop it from completing its lifecycle [Johnson and Mallison et al. 2019].
