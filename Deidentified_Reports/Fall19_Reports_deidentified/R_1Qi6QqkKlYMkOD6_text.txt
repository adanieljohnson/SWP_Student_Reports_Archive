Title: The Effect of Concentrated Nitrogen on the Growth of Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Nitrogen is a nutrient that is primarily responsible for influencing plant photosynthesis and root/shoot growth . Nitrogen is absorbed by the roots in the soil and distributed to the leaves and stem of the plant. The leaves utilize the nitrogen to enrich the chlorophyll and the stem uses nitrogen to elongate the plant. Previous studies indicated that the optimal amount of nitrogen can lead to higher shoot growth and lower root: shoot ratios. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of 32% of concentrated nitrogen fertilizer on the resulting shoot growth rate of mung beans. Two of the pots were filled with soil and received 50 mL of nitrogenous solution. These pots would receive this solution for two weeks, under a shaded region. After two weeks, the root and shoot lengths were measured. The results showed that the resulting root and shoot growth rates for the control group was higher than the other treated groups. Overall results were considered to be statistically significant (p= 0.041), but the nitrogen group vs. the other groups were considered to be not statistically significant. 

Introduction:
Organisms rely on interactions and adaptations, to thrive in an ecological community. Specially, organisms utilize biotic and abiotic factors to obtain resources for survival. Biotic factors are living things that can influence or affect an ecosystem. Examples of biotic factor can be predators, parasites, or mutualistic organisms. Abiotic factors are the nonliving resources that an organism exploits to obtain energy such as wind, temperature, sunlight, and minerals. Though animal intra – and interspecific interactions are imperative in sustaining the ecological community, plant interactions shape the whole community. The inter- and intraspecific interactions of plants lean on attaining resources like sunlight, nitrogen, or water (abiotic factors). But at times of extreme conditions, certain resources can vary in amounts, causing plants to resource allocate. The plant species distributes and uses its limited resources to focus on nourishing the leaves, stems, and roots. If given excess nitrogen, plants would allocate this resource towards its leaves  to improve photosynthetic activity and growth rate (Ozturk 2003). 
	Nitrogen contributes to providing the dark-green color in plants, promotes leaves, stem, and other vegetative parts (Chaturvedi 2005). Additionally, it promotes root growth and produces early growth, fruit quality, and uptake of other minerals such as potassium and phosphorus. These minerals help to control the overall growth of the plant. Insufficiency of nitrogen causes reduced growth, appearance of chlorosis (the alteration of green color into yellow color), presences of red and purple spots on leaves,  and restrictions of lateral bud growth. Deficiency symptoms first arise on older leaves, then leaf senescence (aging of plants) begins. Excessive nitrogen has antagonistic effects on plant growth, stimulates extra dark-green color on leaves, and contributes to poor fruit quantity with reduced quality (Chaturvedi 2005). Moreover, usage of excessive nitrogen causes uncontrollable vegetative growth in areas of high humidity and temperatures. Plants can only uptake nitrogen in certain forms. Most plants take nitrogen in its nitrate form, while crops like rice or maize utilize ammonium. Nitrates can be submerged in particular soil types, leading them to become futile (Chaturvedi 2005). Optimal growth and development of plants need the precise amount of nitrogen. Too little of nitrogen and reduce crop yield, while too much nitrogen leads to structural damage. 
	To understand the efficiency of nitrogen as a nutrient, an experiment can be modeled by using nitrogenous fertilizer and mung beans, Vigna radiata. The purpose of the experiment is to observe the effects of the nitrogenous fertilizer on the overall shoot growth of the mung beans. It was hypothesized that if a mung bean is given the largest amount of nitrogen, then it will have the maximum shoot growth. 


Materials and Methods:
Forty-eight mung beans were soaked in water for 24 hours. Eight pots were used to place the mung beans. Two of the eight pots represented a soil type: 32% nitrogen, 20% phosphorus, nitrogen/phosphorus, and control. Each pot was soaked with water and filled with soil. Afterwards, the excess water was drained, and three holes were created with two seeds placed in the holes. The control group was treated with plain water every day. The phosphorus group was treated with water and 50 mL of phosphorus solution. The nitrogen group was treated with water and 50 mL of nitrogen solution. The combination group was treated with water and 25 mL of nitrogen/ 25 mL of phosphorus solution. The process was repeated for the duration of the experiment. The amount of water was reduced, when the soil was saturated with water. The mung beans were grown for two weeks under shaded areas. After the two weeks, the plants were harvested, without the roots removed. The dirt was washed off the roots. Then, the roots were left to dry and the root and shoot length was measured for each plant. An ANOVA test was utilized to measure the significance of the data. 

Results:
The control group had the highest root and shoot length (11.5 and 8.75 cm). The nitrogen group had a lower root and shoot growth (8.88 and 5.90 cm), as compared to the phosphorus group’s root and shoot growth (9.375 and 6.5 cm). The combination group, 50% Nitrogen/ 50% Phosphorus, had the lowest root and shoot length (8.5 and 2.5 cm). Initially in the experiment, the mung beans weren’t growing, but conditions improved after increased water intake. The reported R:S ratio average and deviation for the phosphorus group was 1.498 (+/- 0.453)  (Figure 1). The reported R:S ratio average and deviation for the nitrogen group was 1.970 (+/- 1.221) (Figure 1). The reported R:S ratio average and deviation for the combination was 4.478 (+/- 2.642 ) (Figure 1). The reported R:S ratio average and deviation for the control was 1.301 (+/- 0.305)  (Figure 1). From the ANOVA test with an alpha of 0.05, the F-value was 3.858, p-value of 0.041, and degrees freedom (df) of 3. 

Discussion:
The overall data was stastically significant (p-value 0.041 &lt; 0.05). The mean of the nitrogen group was not stastically different from the phosphorus, nitrogen/phosphorus, and control groups. Therefore, the hypothesis of the experiment was not supported. Excessive nitrogen application leads to nitrogen regression. When interacting with water, nitrogen-based fertilizers breakdown into nitrogen gas and nitrates (Gadagi 2004). Nitrates accumulate in deeper soil layers and cause the roots to deplete nutrients and lowers the root growth rate. Additionally, inorganic fertilizers increase the electrical conductivity of the soil, affecting the nitrogen uptake in the roots. Inorganic fertilizers contain nitrogen content, but also consist of minerals such as sodium and chloride (Gadagi 2004). When dissociating in water, sodium and chloride ions interact with soil. These minerals compete with nitrogen for uptake. Consequently, these ions are absorbed by the plant, leaving free nitrates stuck in the soil. Therefore, the nitrogen is unable to reach the leaves or stem of the plant, decreasing the shoot growth (Gadagi 2004). As compared to nitrates from fertilizer, pure form of nitrogen is usually utilized by the plant and distributed to leaves, so chlorophyll absorbs the nitrogen and executes photosynthesis efficiently. Further studies can involve different minerals such as salts and observing its effects on the growth rate, but also increasing the number of mung beans for repeated trials. Results of these studies would help to find ways of regulating the growth rate in the shoot and roots of plants.
