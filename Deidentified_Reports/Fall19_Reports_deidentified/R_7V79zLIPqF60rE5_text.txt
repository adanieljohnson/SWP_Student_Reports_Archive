Title: Manduca Juvenile Hormone Experiment

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Manduca sexta or Tobacco hornworm is a moth of the family Sphingidae that lives predominantly in America south. Manduca sexta is a pest that destroy plants and agriculture fields during their larval stages of life. Manduca sexta is a model organism for many hormonal studies as they are easy to obtain and show directly effect of hormone quickly due to their short life span. The growth of Manduca sexta is being regulated by several key hormones. Ecdysterone (20E), prothoracicotropic hormone (brain hormone), and juvenile hormone are three of the key hormones in Manduca sexta’s life cycle. [Sadava: 2019] 20E and juvenile hormone are especially integral to the bugs’ growth as they regulate the molting process for the insect. Specifically, E20 elicit an increase in CA activity thus leading to increase in the JH titer during the latter part of the last instar. [Whisenton: 1985] The presence or absence of JH is especially crucial as the amount of JH present moves the insect towards either larval or pupal cuticle. [Truman: 1974] Juvenile hormones are long chain organic molecules that mainly regulate the type of molt during development. When juvenile hormone level is low, the insect starts the next stage of life and begins to pupate. According to Sparagana, juvenile hormone level rises immediately to a high level directly after ecdysis but reduces to none in the following days. [Sparagana: 1984] In this experiment, we are focusing on the effect of juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta’s growth. We wonder what would happen if the insects’ juvenile hormone intake reaches an abnormally high level. We hypothesize that the over-abundance of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta speed up the natural growth of the insect but prevent them from reaching adulthood. 

Materials and Method:
Manduca sexta larvae were selected randoMly from the group of Manduca sexta larvae provided by the TA. Eight Manduca sexta larvae were selected and divided in half into a treatment group and a controll group. Both groups received 10 grams of the same Manduca sexta food provided by the TA. The treatment group’s food received 10 drops of solution containing 5% juvenile hormone, while the controll group’s food was simply moisturized by 10 drops of deionized water. The insects were placed in plastic boxes with air holes on the side; the boxes were then all placed in the same incubator to controll growing environment. The insects’ growth was measured daily. The boxes where the insects resided for the experiment period was cleaned frequently of feces and dried food. Food was remoisturized and replaced frequently depending on the moisture of the food on each daily inspection. A two-sample T test is employed to test the significance of the experiment. 

Results:
The mass of Manduca sextas were measured on a daily basis, and incremental growth is observed every day. No significance has been found in the data collected. Although not significent, but a difference is detected between the average mass of the Manduca sextas from the treatment and controll group. (1.51 g vs 2.41g; P = 0.532) A difference is detected in the net change mass change of Manduca sextas from treatment and controll group however no significance is detected (7.33g vs 8.81g; P = 0.692) Consequently, a slight difference was found between the net mass change per day between treatment and controll group, yet no significance is detected. (0.523g vs 0.669g; P = 0.603) Although little significance is shown from contrasting the mass and change of mass of the Manduca sextas, there are interesting observations made. The treatment group Manduca sextas appear to have paler skin color and black strips and dots on their back is absent; while the controll group have clear and distinct black strips and their skin color is a lot more vibrant. The treatment group has a higher level of mortality rate in the experiment as 75% of treatment group are either dead or extremely malnourished by the end of the experiment. No Manduca sextas from either group started or even show signs of pupating, and no adultoid character has been observed on any Manduca sexta. It also appears that the Manduca sexta prefer food without juvenile hormone as insects in the controll group are less likely to die of starvation and have significently more weight gain throughout the experimental period.

Discussion:
The lack of significance in our data demonstrate the lack of causation and correlation between juvenile hormone intake level and Manduca sexta’s mass. Although a difference in mass gain is present between the treatment and controll group, there is no significance in such differences. There was no conclusive evidence to show the correlation between juvenile hormone intake and Manduca sexta growth, despite the many interesting phenomena observed for future studies. The high mortality rate in the treatment group makes it likely that the overabundance of the juvenile hormone might have contaminated the food in ways that causes a higher death rate. According to Savor-Blat and So [Savor-Blat: 2000], a clock-regulated gene mutation in Manduca sexta called “takeout,” whose amino acid sequencing is similar to that of the juvenile hormone, induces a rapid death in the event of starvation. We can extrapolate that an overabundance of juvenile hormone, a “takeout” analogue, also induces a rapid death in response to starvation. The dose of juvenile hormone should then be decreased in future experiments from 10 drops to perhaps 5 drops to avoid such deaths caused by overabundance of juvenile hormone. Although there aren’t any studies investigating the correlation between weight gain and juvenile hormone level, many studies have made conclusions on the effect of juvenile hormone on commitment pulse and adulthood development. According to Truman [Truman: 1988], the JH inhibits adult-specific neurites in action and blocks the insect’s outgrowth. Truman concludes that the role of JH is to maintain status quo of central neurons and prevent changes in response to E20. Only in the absence of JH could central neurons go through metamorphic change to adulthood. Furthermore, according to Kiguchi [Kiguchi 1978], JH’s presence will also inhibit adultoid features including eye differentiation, non-extension and non-fusion of the pupal proboscis, and shortened pupal wings. The result of the experiment show no conclusive, definite support on our hypothesis; however, based on the primary research articles mentioned, the second part of the alternate hypothesis—the overabundance of juvenile hormone prevent Manduca sexta from reaching adulthood—is correct.
