Title: Effects of Precor Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta Weight Development

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the methods, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
This study shows how juvenile hormones impact the growth and development of the Manduca sexta hornworms measured through weight. The Manduca sexta is a nectar collecting moth, commonly referred to as a tobacco hornworm. It is a member of Lepidotera Order. The average weight of a tobacco hornworm is 11.3 grams +/- 1.5 [Doucet: 2015] but pupae and adults do not grow so size is determined by the size of the hornworm prior to molting [Davidowitz: 2006]. The Manduca sexta follows 8 stages of development: egg, 1st instar larva, 2nd instar larva, 3rd instar larva, 4th instar larva, 5th instar larva, pupa and adult moth. The development cycle of the moths is 39 to 48 days. The Manduca sexta is controlled by 3 hormones: PTTH, 20E, and JH. The Precor used in this lab is a juvenile hormone. The last larval instar includes the secretion of the PTTH and 20E are inhibited by a juvenile hormone. In early instars, the juvenile hormone prevents the hornworm from successfully molting but as the JH esterase inactivates the juvenile hormone so that pupation can occur [Davidowitz: 2006]. When there is a lack of or no JH, tissues are able to change into the next metamorphic stage [Browder: 2001]. The JH acts as the driving determinant on an insect’s ability to molt. The JHE enzyme works in insects to strongly push them towards molting by blocking the juvenile hormone and allowing the PTTH and 20E to effectively transform the tissue [Sanburg: 1975]. Insects are models for showing endocrine systems and the release of hormones throughout development. [Rowland: 2017]
In this lab, the interest is in how weight development of the Manduca sexta is different when juvenile hormone, Precor, is added to the food source. The hypothesis tested in this lab states that when 5 drops of Precor are added to each insects’ food source, their average weight will be less than that of the control group at the end of 2 weeks. The p-value used to test the hypothesis is 0.05. 


Materials and Methods:
The independent variable is the Precor juvenile added to the food, the dependent variable is the weight of the hornworms and the control variables are the environment, amount of food, and a group receiving water while the other receives Precor. The statistical test used will be a 2-sample t-test to test for the differences between weight measurements for the two groups. The procedure is carried out with two groups: a control group and a treatment group. There are eight hornworms used in this experiment; each of the two groups will contain four hornworms. Manduca food is measured out, 10 grams for each of the eight hornworms. The four pieces of food for the treatment group are measured out and using a dropper, five drops of Precor are added to each set of food. The worms and food are placed in separate, labeled containers. The container is a plastic box with four separate openings. Two holes are punched into each of the individual habitats to provide air for the hornworms.  The four pieces of food for the control group are measured out and five drops of water are added to each. The worms and food are placed in separate, labeled containers. The containers follow the same format as those used for the treatment group. The hornworms are weighed daily for two weeks as the develop. The hornworms are kept in an incubator set to room temperature for the duration of the experiment. The food is changed out when it becomes dry and the containers are cleaned daily. 

Results:
The hornworms were measured individually each day. Table 1 references the average of the weights of the hornworms in the control and treatment groups daily. This data can be seen more clearly through Figure 1. It is necessary to note that caterpillar 1 in the control group died between day 12 and day 13. There is a large range of variability in the control group, as seen in Figure 2, which is most likely a result of control caterpillar 1 dying. The rate of change in weight can be seen for each caterpillar in tables 3 and 4, table 3 referencing the control group caterpillars and table 4 referencing the treatment group caterpillars. Through observation, it can be seen that there is a difference in the color in the treatment and control groups. The treatment group has a lighter, whiter tint to them while the control group is more of a blue green color. 
A 2-sample t-test was run using the difference in weights between day 1 and day 15 for the two groups (control and treatment) and the p-value that resulted was 0.1817. 


Discussion:
Based on the 2-sample t-test run above, the p-value is significantly larger than our significance level of 0.05 so we will not reject our null hypothesis. The null hypothesis stated that when the juvenile hormone, Precor, is added to the insects’ food, the treatment group will weigh less than that of the control group. While the results found were not completely consistent with this, the p-value is significant, and we therefore are unable to reject our hypothesis. In a large sense, juvenile hormone causes for a smaller weight in tobacco hornworms. Juvenile hormones are effective in inhibiting the molting stage and keeping insects from developing and growing further. From this test, we can say that the juvenile hormone did have somewhat of an effect on the growth development in terms of weight for the tobacco hornworms. There is not a huge change in the data between the treatment and control group weights and this can be traced back to the weight being finalized prior to pupation and adult phases [Doucet: 2015].   In future studies, it would be important to have larger testing groups to account for potential mortalities. In this data set, one of the control hornworms died which may have significantly skewed the data. The test should also last for longer so that it can be seen if molting does occur in the treatment and control groups as the tissue transforms from the hormones [Sanburg: 1975].
