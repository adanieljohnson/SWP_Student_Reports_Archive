Title: The Inhibition of Ecdysterone by E20 inhibitor in the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
na

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta also known as the tobacco hornworm is a native species to Winston-Salem [Vandock:2010]. The worm is a pest and studies are being conducted in order to try and eliminate their effect on the environment. Rather than using harmful chemicals and pesticides to kill off the worms IGR’s are used. IGR’s (insect growth regulators) change the development of the worm in order to stop the reproduction and function of the worm [Dorn: 1987]. The tobacco hornworm does not develop reproductive organs until its full maturity, so the IGR’s keep the worm from reaching adulthood at the proper time. The IGR that is used in this lab is E20 inhibitor. The E20 is stopping the production of the Ecdysterone in the worm. Some experiments have been done to see the effect of the amount of ecdysterone present, this lab is doing something similar by completely removing the Ecdysterone [Champlin: 1998]. Ecdysterone is a hormone present during the times of molting in the worm [Bollenbacher: 1981]. Bollenbacher’s research showed ecdysterone having three major effects temporal qualitative and quantitative [Bollenbacher: 1981]. Each stage affects the development of the worm showing the time of molt the amount of mass gained from molt and the types of ecdysteroids present [Bollenbacher: 1981]. This experiment will be more focused on the temporal aspect of the ecdysterone and seeing what happens when the hormone is not present. Hormones allow communication throughout cells from one point in the body to target areas, such as testosterone in reproductive organs in males [Branton: 1978]. Hormonal communication is slow compared to neural communication taking up to several days, so the experiment is done over the course of 3 weeks [Branton: 1978]. By applying E20 inhibitor to block the communication of Ecdysterone to the rest of the body the worm will be prevented from molting and remain in its first development stage. 

The purpose of this lab is to see the effect of E20 inhibitor of ecdysterone on the hornworm to stop development, molting and the reproduction of the worm. 

The hypothesis is that feeding E20 inhibitors to the Manduca Sexta insects will slow the timing of the molting process during development, resulting in decreased mass gain, and prevent it from pupating. 


Materials and Method:
The lab began by collecting the Manduca Sexta from the larva stage or first instar stage and placing eight worms in four-welled containers. Each worm was given a name and number. Holes were punched in the side of each section of the containers. The worms were separated into two groups. Four worms were chosen to be the controll group and the other four were the experimental group. The Four worms for the experimental group were placed in one four-welled container, and the four worms for the controll group were placed in a separate four-welled container.  In this Lab the experimental group was given the 7 drops of E20 inhibitor in their food while the controll group was given 7 drops of water in their food. The worms were then monitored for three weeks being weighed and inspected every day, and the food was changed when the moisture from the E20 inhibitor or the water evaporated from the food. When the food was replaced due to dryness or consumption the controll group received new food with 7 drops of water again and the experimental group received food with 7 drops of E20 inhibitor. When the experiment was completed the worms were weighed a final time and pictures were taken to record and observe and the worms were disposed of in a freezer. The statistical test used in this experiment was the two sample T test.  

Results:
The results collected were as follows. The controll group grew at a normal pace increasing in mass and going through the normal molting phases. The amount of food consumed increased as the controll worms grew at a steady pace while the experimental worms remained small and consumed very little amount of food [figure 3]. The averages for controll group is 0.85 and the average for experimental is 0.08125. The data collected showed a P Value of 0.000247. The Experimental group after some days of being fed the E20 inhibitor began to lose mass and some died. The mass gain is shown in figure 1. The controll group grew significently in mass while the Experimental group remained around the same mass some even dying. 



Discussion:
The data collected agreed with the hypothesis showing the result of inhibiting the molting of the young worm into other instar phases. The statistically significent result rejects the Null hypothesis, which is feeding E20 inhibitors to the Manduca Sexta insects will slow the timing of the molting process during development, resulting in decreased mass gain, and prevent it from pupating. 
The E20 inhibitor blocked the production of Ecdysterone hormone from reaching the target cells in the worm prohibiting molting [Bollenbacher: 1981].
The inhibition of ecdysterone increased the death rate of the Manduca Sexta by not allowing the worms to molt [Dorn: 1987]. The data shows the worms receiving the inhibitor remain in the instar phase when they first took the inhibitor supporting the hypothesis. The Control group grew at a normal pace molting regularly and moving from one instar phase to the next [Branton: 1978]. Bollenbachert focused on three aspects of the hormone ecdysterone temporal quantitative and qualitative. This lab focused more on the temporal aspect of the hormone and agreed with Bollenbachert that the lack of the hormone will hinder manduca sexta growth [Bollenbacher: 1981]. 
The Lab could have been improved by keeping the amount of inhibitor given the experimental group below 5 drops [Nijhout: 1975]. The worms in this lab died quickly due to an over ingestion of the hormone. Lowering the amount of E20 inhibitor would allow the worms to molt once or twice to be at a stage for predators to consume and therefore not breaking the cycle of the tobacco fields[Nijhout: 1975].Had we given the caterpillars a lower concentration of the E20 blocker, maybe a different p_value would’ve been obtained to give a better indication of whether the results are significent or not.
