Title: Growth of Manduca sexta Caterpillars Treated with Ecdysterone

Abstract:
he development of Manduca sexta is characterized by five larval instar stages before a pupation stage before reaching adulthood. Each process is regulated by the concentration ratio of certain hormones. In order to determine the effects of a developmental hormone on M. sexta caterpillars in their first larval stage, four caterpillars were given food treated with Ecdysterone (E20) and their mass was measured over two weeks to compare with a control group. E20 is a hormone produced in the corpora allata that determine the timing of molting for M. sexta, and is in low concentration until pupation. It was hypothesized that caterpillars treated with E20 would develop more quickly and thus grow to larger masses. It was found, however, that E20 works as a growth inhibitor and leads to developmental abnormalities and eventual death. This helps show that hormones can be used to treat pest populations instead of synthetic, toxic insecticides. 

Introduction:
Hormones are important for the development, safety, and homeostatic regulation of all organisms. Manduca sexta is a species of moth that goes through five larval and a pupation stage before developing into a moth in its adult state, making it a perfect organism to analyze growth over a longer period of time. The concentration ratio of certain hormones are an important part of this process by regulating the growth of the caterpillar towards its metamorphosis stage. Juvenile Hormone (JH) is produced in the corpus allata – a pair of glands situated on both sides of the foregut – and regulates the type of molt during development. During its transition from one larval stage to the next, JH levels are very high to assure the continuing growth of the caterpillar. JH doesn’t drop until the fifth larval stage to signal the pupation stage. Ecdysterone (20E) is produced in the prothoracic gland – right behind the head – and determines the timing of molting and pupation in Manduca sexta caterpillars. 20E is very low throughout the larval instar stages and does not increase until the fifth stage when JH levels are dropping [Nijhout: 1974]. How does a constant exposure to 20E hormone levels during the caterpillar instar stages affect their growth? Will they continue to grow? Will they grow faster? Or, will treating them with these hormones produce a fatal effect that can be utilized for pest control? It was hypothesized that if the Manduca sexta caterpillars are treated with a constant level of 20E hormone, then those caterpillars will grow larger in mass than the control group due to a faster growth period. The null hypothesis is that at day 14 when the experiment ends, the growth in mass for the 20E caterpillars will be equal to the growth in mass for the control caterpillars. The alternative hypothesis is that the growth in mass for the 20E caterpillars will be greater than the growth in mass for the control caterpillars.


Materials and Methods:
The independent variable was determined by whether or not the caterpillar was treated with the 20E hormone, so that the growth of the caterpillars could be compared with a control group. To complete this experiment, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars in their first larval instar stage were used and separated into two even groups of four caterpillars. Each caterpillar was given an identical living space and 10g of nutrient-rich food. The control group had their food treated with seven drops of deionized water. The variable group had their food treated with seven drops of 20E. Every day, the cages for each caterpillar were cleaned, the mass of each caterpillar was taken, and the food was replenished (with the appropriate seven drops) if it was dried out or a large amount of it had been consumed. The dependent variable was the mass of the caterpillars that was measured and recorded each day. The caterpillars were kept in an appropriate incubator overnight. After fourteen days, the total change of mass for the caterpillars were measured and used in a one-tailed t-test to determine if the change of mass between the two groups was significant. As well, it was determined if the growth of the 20E caterpillars was larger than that of the control group.

Results:
None of the caterpillars treated with 20E grew. They did not eat much of their food and thus never grew in mass. All caterpillars in the variable group were dead by day 10 and their final change in mass was 0g. The control group, whose food was treated with seven drops of water, grew larger and more rapidly than the variable group, with an average growth of 5.92g and a standard deviation of 3.46, as shown in figure 3. In particular, Control 2 and Control 4 grew larger than the rest, with their highest mass both occurring on day 11 at 12.57g and 11.77g, respectively. As well, their Total changes in mass were 8.5g for Control 2 and 8.6g from Control 4. Control 3 was slower than Control 2 and Control 4, with its day 12 mass measuring at 1.56g, but began growing substantially as the experiment was coming to a close around day 13 and 14, with masses of 3.47g and 6.48g for those respective days. Control 1 began to grow with the others, but started to die for unknown reasons around day 10. Figure 1 helps show the development over time of each caterpillar by showing the mass for each day measured. Overall, the control group contained the only caterpillars able to grow and have a change in mass between day 1 and day 14. Figure 2 summarizes the total change in mass for each caterpillar and contains the data utilized to calculate a p-value of 0.013. 


Discussion:
	Although the null hypothesis was rejected, the alternative hypothesis originally presented could not be accepted. The one-tailed t-test helped provide enough confidence to conclude that the variable and control groups grew to statistically different sizes. However, the original alternative hypothesis surmised that the caterpillars treated with E20 would grow to larger masses due to a faster developmental period. The data collected, however, shows that the caterpillars treated with E20 did not grow at all and the control group grew steadily to large masses, so the alternative hypothesis can not be accepted. The other alternative hypothesis that could have been presented would be that caterpillars treated with E20 would grow to smaller masses due to a slower developmental period. It is more likely to conclude that an increase in E20 levels to first instar Manduca sexta caterpillars will halt growth, which would allow us to accept this second alternative hypothesis. Since E20 is a hormone used to determine the timing of pupation, and is at low levels until the fifth instar, a drastic increase in this hormone within the caterpillar will likely attempt to trigger a process that the caterpillar is not physically ready for (Johnson: 2019). Thus, the hormone will likely confuse the body into trying to pupate when it physically cannot and lead to developmental abnormalities. The result is a lack of growth and eventual death for the caterpillar. This shows that E20 – and possibly other hormones – can be used as a pest control for Manduca sexta larva since it will inhibit growth and development. These Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) can limit the need to use toxic synthetic insecticides while also helping rid an area of certain pests [Siddall: 1976].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The daily effect of E20 on caterpillar growth is shown. All caterpillars treated with E20 did not grow and thus their graph of development is linear with a slope of 0 and a y-axis equal to their starting mass. The caterpillars treated with water (the control group) grew substantially, and their graph can be seen above alone with a line of regression for each caterpillar. Control 2 and Control 4 grew larger than the rest, reaching masses of 12.57g and 11.77g on day 11, respectively, but started to lose mass towards the end of the experiment. Control 3 grew slowly but began to approach the mass of Control 2 and Control 4 around day 13 and 14, with masses of 3.47g and 6.48g for those respective days.


Figure 2. The total change in mass between day 1 and day 14 is summarized for each caterpillar. It can be seen that none of the Variable caterpillars (those treated with E20) grew at all during the experiment. Instead, the control group had caterpillars that developed and had a larger change in mass over the two weeks, specifically Control 2, 3, and 4. The average growth for Control caterpillars was 5.92g. P-Value = 0.013.


Figure 3. The average total change in mass for the control and variable group is shown. It is worth noting that the Variable group had an average total change in mass of 0.01g (with 0.0 standard deviation) while the control group had an average total change in mass of 5.92g with a standard deviation of 3.46. *************************************************************************
