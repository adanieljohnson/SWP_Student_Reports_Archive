Title: How Juvenile Hormone affects Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the methods, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.


Introduction:
All living things are regulated by combinations of certain hormones. A body and its systems work hard to meticulously monitor the levels of hormones. Hormones are signals produced by glands throughout the body that control aspects such as mood, metabolism, puberty and reproduction, and growth. Hormone balance and imbalances in theory should cause an organism to experience different changes and sometimes abnormalities. “Any interference in the homeostasis of these hormones with exogenous sources of the hormones or with synthetic analogs (agonist or antagonist) would result in the disruption or abnormal course of development and reproduction of the target insect” [Hoffmann: 1998]. 
This study focussed on the Manduca sexta caterpillar, commonly known as a hornworm as the subject, and how varying hormone levels affect its development. The Manduca sexta is an insect with a relatively short full life cycle. It takes between 39-43 days for a caterpillar to grow into an adult moth [Johnson: 2016]. This life cycle (like all other living things) is regulated by hormones. Hormones regulate the timing and type of changes the caterpillars go through while growing. “ The level of JHs in the haemolymph fluctuates during the development of an insect’s stadium and correlates with specific developmental events, such as molting and metamorphosis” [Calberro: 2011]. In particular, Manduca sexta has three types of hormones that contribute to its development. The three types are Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH), Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone.  PTTH controls the glands that release Ecdysterone; Ecdyterone regulates the timing of its molting. Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molt occuring in the insect’s life cycle 
This experiment has the goal of analyzing if changing the level of hormones somehow affects the growth of the caterpillars. Particularly, our hypothesis was if elevating the level of Juvenile Hormone (Precor) exposed to the caterpillars if this would cause those caterpillars to grow larger and have a greater mass. 


Materials and Methods:
This hypothesis was tested by organizing the caterpillars randomly into a treatment group and a control group. All the caterpillars that were tested came from the same source and were in the larva stage. The caterpillars lived in plastic containers separated into four separate compartments; these containers when not being checked on were stored in an incubator. 
The control group consisted of four caterpillars. The control was evaluated daily and had their masses recorded in grams. They were consistently given ten grams of food with five drops of water within the food. The treatment group consisted of four caterpillars who were checked on a daily basis and had their mass recorded. They were given ten grams of food with five drops of Juvenile hormone. Data collection of both groups went on for fourteen days. Both groups had their living areas cleaned of fecal matter everyday, and food replaced when needed. A two-sample T-test with a significance value of 0.05 was used to compare the means of the control group and treatment group so see if their difference was significant.


Results:
The average mass of the control group at the end of the experiment was 12.39 grams, with a standard deviation of 1.42 grams.  The average mass of the Hormone group was 9.38 grams with a standard deviation of 5.90 grams.  It should be noted that one caterpillar (Hormone 1) died while the experiment was ongoing, so no more mass readings were recorded after 9/13/19. This could have skewed the results slightly, it made the treatment group have a lower mass at the end of data collection. For this reason it was declared an outlier and excluded from the two-sample T-test.
Figure 1 is a graph of the growth of the caterpillars over the course of the experiment. This graph shows how the Control group over the course of the whole studied maintained a higher growth rate and contained caterpillars with greater masses than the experimental group. Figures 3 and 4 show how much the caterpillars grew and changed just over the course of two weeks. An observation taken over the course of the experiment was that the hormone treated caterpillars became a lighter shade of blue than the control group.
A two-sample T-Test of the collected mass data from the caterpillars was performed at end of this experiment.  The results were (t-stat=0.1236, df=4, P=0.4538). 


Discussion:
	The results from this lab did not support our alternate hypothesis. Although over the fourteen day data collection time period all caterpillars in both groups grew larger and gained mass, the difference in their gained mass was not significant. After the data was collected, a two-sample T-test was run to compare the average mass  of the control group to the average mass of the experimental group. The results were (t-stat=0.1236, df=4, P=0.4538). Because the p-value of 0.4528 is greater than the significance value of 0.05 we failed to reject the null hypothesis. There was insufficient evidence that increased hormones would cause the Manduca sexta caterpillars to have a greater mass. 
Overall, this experiment did not give sufficient evidence to support that a greater level of Juvenile hormone would cause a caterpillar’s mass to be greater. The extra exposure to hormones may have hindered the experimental group’s growth, but not enough for it to be statistically significant. 
In the future if this experiment, or a similar one, would be completed again, I believe that testing a new hypothesis stating that elevated levels of Juvenile hormones would hinder the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars might show might be able to gain statistical support. This is relevant because scientists focussed on discovering new pest management strategies can focus on insects’ endocrine system. By using hormones scientists can develop target chemicals to disrupt metamorphosis and development, metamorphosis and reproduction of the target insects [Hoffmann: 1998].
