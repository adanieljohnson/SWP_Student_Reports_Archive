Title: Effects of Dyed Water on Visual Cues for Agonistic Behaviors in Male Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Knowing when it is necessary to perform certain behaviors is important to an organism so that it doesn’t waste energy on behaviors that are not beneficial. Many behaviors are triggered by some sort of cue, often coming from one of the senses. For Male Betta Fish or Betta Splendins when two males see each other, they will display agnostic behaviors toward one another. One behavior is they protrude their branchiostegal membrane from under their operculum. This behavior if maintained allocates a lot of energy away from other functions, so it is important the B. splendins only performs this behavior when necessary. Visual cues play an important role in the production of this behavior. In this experiment we tested, how agnostic behaviors between two B. splendins were affected when normal visual cues, like shape and color, were disrupted by dying the water blue and red, the two colors of the male B. splendins. Our resulting data showed no statistically significent difference between time displaying red mane behavior and the color of the dye in the water. Though the average time of displaying agnostic behaviors was highest in B. splendins in dyed water that matched their color. This research shows the importance of visual cues on the behavior of organisms, and how there is more than 

Introduction:
Visual and auditory senses play a critical role in the behavior of many organisms whether to detect prey, evade predators, or find a mate. These visual cues are often strongly influenced by size, shape, color and movement. Individually, these visual factors may not produce a certain behavior, and we wanted to determine which factors play the biggest roles. Betta Splendins, or the Betta fish, commonly found in Southeast Asia, is extremely aggressive toward other males. They perform this intraspecific behavior to fight for limited resources like territory and the right to breed with other females. Often turning and erecting their fins, the B. splendins use this broadside movement to make themselves look as large as possible. They also will flare and flex their branchiostegal membrane which is a part of their gills and located under their operculum [Johnson:2019]. Both behaviors are only triggered when the B. splendins is displaying aggression. Brightness and color seem to have strong effects on how fish react to certain stimuli [Evans: 1996] [Roman:2017][Grabowski: 1968]. We wanted to see how B. splendins reacted not when the color and brightness was changed by means of changing lighting, but through the dying of the water, which better mimics the murky waters which they naturally live in. Our hypothesis was that due to the dyed water, B. splendins males in dyed water that is a different color than themselves would display less aggressive behaviors because it is harder for them to see the other B. splendins. This is due to the other male blending into the environment better and becoming harder to distinguish from the surrounding water. This would show that the visual cue of color and shape, plays significent roles in B. splendins agnostic behaviors. 

Materials and Method:
Two separate aquariums, divided into three equal chambers by a piece of clear and colored acrylic, were used to house the four male B. splendins fish. Two of the male B. splendins fish were red while the other two were blue. One of each colored fish were separately placed into two of the chambers in both the aquariums. Each fish was left to acclimate in the aquarium for five minutes before the commencement of the experiment. All experiments were conducted with the same four fish. First with clear water, the colored acrylic piece was removed which allowed the B. splendins to see each other and display agnostic behaviors. This to confirm both males were healthy and displaying normal behaviors. Then in one tank, with food coloring the water was dyed red, and the other a dark blue. Then three, three-minute trails of red and blue males were performed in both the red and blue. Five minutes were given between trials to allow the fish to rest and not become habituated to the presence of the other male betta and change their natural behavior. During the trails time of displaying the agnostic behavior red mane was recorded, as well as time displaying agnostic broadside movements. Red Mane display counted when the branchiostegal membrane was flexed past the operculum and maintained the membrane out. Broadside movement displays counted when the fish positioned itself perpendicularly to its rival B. Splendins. Times were recorded for each of the three trails in each dye, and then averaged for each fish in each respective dye. A two-sample two tailed t_test was used to determine if the difference between the two agnostic behaviors differed in either the type of behavior or in type of dye.   

Results:
The average broadside display time for Red B. splendins in red water was 68.66 seconds while in blue water it was 27.66 (Fig 1.). The standard deviation was 59.60 and 20.84, respectively. The average broadside display time for blue B. splendins in red water was 115.33 seconds while in blue water it was 139.25 (Fig 1.). The standard deviation was 9.29 and 87.85. The average red mane display time for Red B. splendins in red water was 108.33 while in blue water it was 0 seconds (Fig 2). The standard deviation was 15.31 and 0, respectively. The average red mane display time for blue B. splendins in red water was 92.14 and for blue water was 192.66 (Fig 2). The standard deviations were 26.67 and 70.21 respectively. 

Discussion:
From the results of the experiment, we reject our hypothesis that B. splendins males in different colored dyed water will display aggressive behaviors less than in dyed water of its own color. This is due to three of the four comparisons having a insignificent statistical difference. The one comparison that was significent was red mane display time for a red B. splendins in red compared to blue water. There seems to be a trend, that when a B. splendins is in dyed water that is the same color as itself, the male seems to be more aggressive for both red mane and broadside. There might not actually be an increase in the aggressive behavior of the male in the same colored water as itself, but a decrease in aggressive behavior in the other male. This might be because it is harder for that male in different colored water to distinguish the other well-camoflauged male in the same colored water, so it is less aggressive. It has also been shown that brightness can affect B. splendins response [Bando: 1991]. the coloring of the water may have caused the B. splendins shape to be harder to distinguish but also reduced its brightness and reflectiveness. Reflectiveness would be an important visual cue for wild B. splendins in murky dark waters to use, as it would be an obvious cue of an approaching rival male or predatory fish. 
Some possible confounding variables were time given between encounters, two males of each color were used, and improper mixing of the dye. After each three-minute trial five minutes was given to each B. splendins to calm down and rest. This was a decided arbitrary timeframe, that had not been scientifically determined as most effective. Over time during the trails, there seemed to be a decrease in aggressive behavior, which is not shown in the summarized data. This could be either due to the males becoming habituated to each other’s presence or because they became progressively more and more tired. This data contrasts with other reports of early encounters of aggressive behavior being positively correlated with the intensity of later aggressive behavior between B. splendins males [Bronstein: 1981], so it is probable that habituation was playing a role. Two males of each color, red and blue, were used during our experiments, as to not overstress one male. This was problematic because one of the red males did not red flare at all while in the blue dye. This seems highly unusual that it would not perform that agnostic behavior at any time during the three-minute trial period. It is possible that males behavior had already been influenced by another male, and this red male had lost and become subordinate, as it has been shown that red mane behavior has a positive association with behavioral dominance [Evans: 1985]. If we had more time, we could have used just the one red male to make our results more consistent, but to be declaring statements about a whole species it would be better if we had a much larger sample size of males for both colors. With the food coloring that was added, we attempted to add five drops of the food coloring to each tank. What we failed to do, was systematically mix the water equally throughout the tank, as there were three separated compartments in it. Without equal mixing, it is hard to say if both fish perceived the same visual conditions.
	In future studies, it would be most suitable to increase the trails, and the sample of males used. To minimize any odd male behaviors, it would be useful to randoMly assign the males of each color to a tank for each trail. Mixing of the dye should occur before the fish are put into the tank, and the compartments are removed. This study shows preliminary data, on how specific factors, like shape, color, and brightness, play a more weighted important role than others in visual cues.
