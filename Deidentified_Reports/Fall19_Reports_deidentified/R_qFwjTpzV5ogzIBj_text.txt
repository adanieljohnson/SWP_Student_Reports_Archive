Title: Resource Allocation and Phenotypic Plasticity of Mung Bean Seeds in Spacious and Cramped Conditions

Abstract:
Organisms rely on resource allocation to help maximize the amount of limited resources around them. Plants such as mung beans solve this problem through phenotypic plasticity which allows for them to develop different patterns of root and shoot grow. Our hypothesis is that mung bean seeds placed into spacious environments will have a higher root to shoot ratio compared to mung bean seeds placed into cramped environments because of the lack of competition for resources. Our results were significant with a one tailed p-value of  0.010 for the R:S weight ratio and 0.0003 R:S length ratio. Therefore mung beans do use trade-offs to help maximize the limited amount of resources available to them.

Introduction:
In ecological environments organisms rely on their adaptations to survive and reproduce with both the biotic, living, and abiotic, non-living, influences. These influences contribute to how organisms interact with the environment from resource allocation, energy and resource capture, and growth. Since natural resources are limited, organisms must compete with one another. In order to overcome this competition organisms develop various niches and strategies to survive. A common strategy to solve this issue is resource allocation and trade-offs. Organisms develop patterns of phenotypic plasticity such as in the case of plants, growing deeper roots to obtain more water at the cost of less shoots for photosynthesis in a dry environment. This can be seen through the species Retama sphaerocarpa, which when placed into different competition intensities, and facilitation change along gradients of amounts of resources, showed that plant interactions in terms of growth are dynamic with some of the plants grew longer shoots to photosynthesise more while other plants grew longer roots to obtain more water [Pugnaire: 2003]. In our experiments we are examining intra-species competition between mung bean plants, Vigna radiata. Mung beans in mainly cultivated in Southeast and East Asia and grow in well drained sandy-loam soil. We are examining how mung bean plants use trade-offs, in terms of shoots and roots when placed into cramped environments compared to spacious environments. Our hypothesis is that mung bean seeds placed into spacious environments will have a higher root to shoot ratio compared to mung bean seeds placed into cramped environments because of the lack of competition for resources. A lack of competition will lead to a higher root to shoot ratio because the mung beans will not have to complete each other for sunlight by growing more shoots, but instead can focus on growing longer roots in order to obtain more resources. This is noteworthy because more shoots are important for photosynthesis while more roots are important for gathering water as well micro and macro nutrients from the soil. Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in root and shoot ratio. Our alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in root and shoot ratio.


Materials and Methods:
Seventy-two mung bean seeds were selected at random and were placed into square planter pots. Twelve mung bean seeds were placed into a single plant potter for a total of three sets which served as the control group. Six mung bean seeds were placed into a single plant potter for a total of six sets which served as the treatment group. The mung bean seeds were placed into the vermiculite while being completely submerged, and were equal distance from one another. Then the soil was moistened. The control group and experimental group were placed into a greenhouse and allowed to grow for two weeks, while watering them everyday. After the two week growing period, ten plants from the control and experimental groups were selected at random. The entire mass of the mung bean was obtained by placing in onto a scale. The roots were then separated from the shoots by being cut at the root-shoot junction. The shoot weight was obtained by subtracting the total plant weight by the shoot weight. Both the shoot length and root length were measured by using a ruler to the nearest centimeter. The root to shoot weight and length ratios were calculated. The significance of these values were measured by using a one-tailed two sample t-test were the alpha value was 0.05.


Results:
The experimental group had both a greater root to shoot weight ratio and a greater root to shoot length ratio compared to the control group. Figure 1 shows the root to shoot weight ratio.The control group had a mean of 0.53 R:S weight ratio +/- 0.17. The experimental group had a mean of 1.18 R:S weight ratio +/- 0.80. The one tailed t-test results where: (DF: 18, t-value: 2.531, and One tailed p-value: 0.010). Figure 2 shows the root to shoot length ratio. The control group had a mean of .07 R:S length ratio +/- 0.17. The experimental group had a mean of 1.43 R:S length ratio +/- 0.54. The one tailed t-test results where: (DF: 18, t-value: 4.116, and One tailed p-value: 0.0003). Overall the experimental group had longer and bigger roots on average (16.69 cm and 0.52 grams) the control group had longer and bigger shoots on average (13.25 cm and 0.56 grams).

Discussion:
    Our hypothesis was supported, mung bean seeds placed into a spacious environment have a greater root to shoot ratio compared to mung bean seeds placed into cramped environments. Mung bean seeds that were in the experimental group of six of six had both longer and more root mass. Mung bean seeds that were in the control group of three of twelve had both longer and more shoot mass. This makes sense because the group of twelve had less resources per plant in the soil, where they all had more resources available by growing longer and bigger shoots. Therefore the control group invested their energy into creating more shoots to allow for more photosynthesis. The group of six had more resources per plant in the soil and therefore grew longer and bigger root systems in order to maximize resource consumption. Therefore the experimental group invested their energy into creating more roots to allow for more absorption of water, micro and macro nutrients. The ideal space between mung bean seeds to allow for the maximum amount of harvest is 40 x 15 cm from an economic standpoint [Birhanu: 2018]. This relates back to our study in terms of our control group and experimental group being in spacious and cramped environments and how to maximize food production for increasing profit. The reason why this happens is due to phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms that all have the same genetics to change their physical properties based on the world around them. The group of twelve grew longer and bigger shoots because they collected more resources through photosynthesis ; the same group of six grew longer and bigger roots because they collected more resources though water and nutrient absorption through the roots. Natural resources are limited so species try to change and adapt to fit their current environment. The mung bean plants would trade off and use resource allocation in order to obtain more resources from the soil or from the sun. A future experiment could focus on how other plants may or may not also relies on phenotypic plasticity and resource allocation. Our experimental can be applied to farmers which are trying to optimize the amount of food that they can grow to help with the problem of world hunger.
