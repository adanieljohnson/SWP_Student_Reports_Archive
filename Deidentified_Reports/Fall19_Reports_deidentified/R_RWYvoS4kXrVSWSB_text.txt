Title: Studying the Effect of Phosphorus and Nitrogen Solutions on Mung Bean Root and Shoot Growth

Abstract:
An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of phosphorus and nitrogen on the growth of mung bean plants.  Phosphorus and nitrogen are both known elements to stimulate plant growth as they are essential in several biotic processes that influence plant growth [Novoa: 1981].  Nitrogen and phosphorus solutions were added to mung beans planted in soil combined with water daily.  It was determined that the control group (no added phosphorus or nitrogen) of mung bean plants grew the most with an average root length of 11.5 cm +/-4.18 cm SD (p= .565) and an average shoot length of 8.8 cm +/-1.65 cm SD (p=.041), while the group with a mixture of phosphorus and nitrogen solutions grew the least with a root length and shoot length of 8.5 cm +/-4.09 cm SD (p= .565) and 2.5 cm +/-2.17 cm SD (p=.041) respectively.  The hypothesis that the mixture group would grow the most was not supported by the data.  

Introduction:
Nitrogen is essential for plant growth because it helps make up the chlorophyll which is the mechanism that plants use to conduct photosynthesis [Novoa: 1981].  Nitrogen also plays a role in protein, nucleic acids, and can help in cell division and cell elongation [Firoz: 2009].  Phosphorus is also necessary for growth because it is involved in photosynthesis, and respiration [Novoa: 1981].  Phosphorus also increases root growth, and a deficiency can lead to poor root development [Firoz: 2009].  The effect of the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen could be helpful for people interesting in growing plants, such as gardeners and farmers.  The effect of adding phosphorus to a plant, the effect of adding nitrogen to a plant, and the effect of adding equal amounts of both phosphorus and nitrogen were being investigated. The addition of the combination of phosphorus and nitrogen to the soil of the mung bean plants was predicted to increase the length of the root and the shoot the most because phosphorus and nitrogen both play a role in processes that affect plant growth, so the combination of the two will have the greatest effect.  

Materials and Methods:
48 mung beans seeds were distributed among 8 pots (6 seeds per pot) and planted in shallow holes in vermiculite soil. 50 ml of phosphorus solution (20% P2O5) was added to pots 1 and 2 each.  50 ml of nitrogen solution (32% NO3-) was added to pots 3 and 4 each.  A mixture of 25 ml of the phosphorus solution and 25 ml of the nitrogen solution was added to pot 5 and 6 each.  Pots 1 through 8 were watered until the soil was soaked.  The plants were placed in a greenhouse with adequate sunlight.  The nitrogen and phosphorus solutions were added to the pots followed by the watering every day for two weeks.  At the end of the two-week period, the plants were uprooted carefully and the root to shoot lengths were measured, differentiating the root from the shoot at the location of color change on the base of the stem that led into the root. 

Results:

Summary of findings:
The average shoot length (p=0.041) was highest under the control at 8.8 cm +/- 1.65 cm SD, second highest under phosphorus, third highest under nitrogen, and the lowest under the mixture 2.5 cm +/-2.17 cm SD.  The average root length (p=0.565) was highest under the control at 11.5 cm +/-4.18 cm SD, second highest under phosphorus, third highest under nitrogen, and the lowest under the mixture 8.5 cm +/- 4.18 cm SD.  


Discussion:
The alternative hypothesis predicted that the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen simultaneously would increase both root and shoot length the most out of all the groups.  The alternate hypothesis was not supported because the mixture of phosphorus and nitrogen solutions resulted in the least amount of growth in both the root and the shoot length, at 8.5 cm +/- 4.09 cm SD and 2.5 cm +/- 2.17 cm SD respectively, while the control group grew the most with an average root length of 11.5 cm +/- 4.18 cm SD and longest average shoot length of 8.8 cm +/- 1.65 cm SD.  The phosphorus-group grew the second best with an average root length of 9.4 cm +/- 1.65 cm SD and average shoot length of 6.5 cm +/- 1.47 cm SD, while the nitrogen-only group had an average root length of 8.9 cm +/- 1.88 cm SD and an average shoot length of 5.9 cm  +/- 3.66 cm SD.  The standard deviations of the average root length for the mixture group and for the control group were particularly high, suggesting a potential unaddressed error. 
The root length p value was .565, failing to reject the null hypothesis that root length is not affected by adding phosphorus and nitrogen solutions to the plant.  Because the root length p value is .565, the root to shoot ratio data suggests no trend.  However, the shoot length p value was .041, rejecting the null hypothesis that shoot length is not affected by the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen solutions to the plants.  The high p value could be attributed to potential errors that may have occurred include fluctuations in humidity and temperature in the greenhouse.  Humidity and temperature could affect plant growth in unpredictable ways. In order to minimize those errors, the plants should be kept in an indoor, temperature/humidity-controlled room.  
According to a study on plant growth in a vegetable field, N fertilizer reduced plant growth in vegetables [Wang: 2004].  This result is constant with how the addition of a nitrogen solution resulted in lower root and shoot lengths compared to the control group. The study also stated that the effects of P fertilizer were species and sampling-time dependent [Wang: 2004].  This finding could explain why the phosphorus solution did not aid the growth of the mung bean plants-mung bean plants may be a non-responder type of plant to additional phosphorus.  Another study was conducted in China to investigate the possibility of overfertilization of phosphorus in greenhouses, and it was concluded that too much phosphorus was hindering growth [Yan: 2013].  A future experiment could be conducted on the mung bean plants to test the effect of different amounts of only phosphorus solution on root and shoot growth.  
The experiment has little real-world application due to the time scale of it.  Mung beans would typically be grown and harvested in a garden or a farm and would take a much longer time to allow the plants to fully grow and the beans to sprout.  The effect of nitrogen and phosphorus on the grown of the roots and shoots could be time sensitive, as some vegetables were found to be in the Wang study [Wang: 2004].  If the experiment were to be conducted again, the time could be increased from two weeks to a much longer time period, or until the beans were fully grown for harvesting.  Only then will the knowledge of the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus on the growth of the plant be useful.
