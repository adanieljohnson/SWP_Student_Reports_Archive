Title: Effects of the IGR concentrate, Precor, or juvenile hormone, on the rate of development in the tobacco hornworm (Manduca Sexta). By Catalina F. Provenzano 

Abstract:
Abstract
This study examines the acute and chronic effects of the Juvenile Hormone (JH) mimicking IGR concentrate, Precor, on the weight and rate of pupation of eight Manduca Sexta larvae. Precor is said to inhibit larvae pupation and reproducibility for up to 7 months and is often considered for use on the species, which as a larvae, is a pest. The controll group received 5 drops of distilled water in their food over a period of two weeks, while the treatment group received 5 drops of Precor. Over 15 days, both groups steadily gained weight until day 11, where the controll group began losing weight and ended the study with an average weight of 8.5 of ± 4.16 g grams compared to the treatment group’s average weight of 15.5 grams of ± 5.68 g. The concluded trend of extreme controll group weight loss and faster pupation is consistent with our hypothesis that the treatment group larvae would pupate at a slower rate than the controll larvae because weight loss is a crucial process of larval development. Therefore, the IGR concentrate Precor should not be considered for use on this species to avoid their juvenile presence. 


Introduction:
Introduction
Tobacco hornworms are very popular pests in the Winston-Salem area for their affinity for the tobacco and tomato crops. However, their metamorphosis into the adult stage transforms them into moths, where they are no longer considered pests. This is because their new source of food becomes nectar. Physiologically, their life cycles rely on the molting from one stage to another, and those various stages are dictated by two hormones: E20 and Juvenile Hormone. E20 dominates the timing of molts while JH controlls the type of molts [Nijhout: 1974]. Although juvenile hormone is needed for Manduca Sexta development, when it is additionally administered in a lab setting, it is said to inhibit insect growth. A form of the hormone is an IGR concentrate, Precor, can be used to mimic the hormone and is said to inhibit pupal development for 7 months, delaying the rate the insect will become an adult and have the ability to reproduce [Glare: 1999]. Using this knowledge and the biological curiosity towards the effects of hormones on the Manduca Sexta species, the goal of this experiment is to find a way to manipulate hornworm development with pesticide to controll moth development and prevent crop destruction in the Winston-Salem area. For our alternate hypothesis, we predict that the caterpillars given juvenile hormone, specifically, Precor, an IGR concentrate, will have delayed development in their life cycles and pupate at a slower rate compared to the controll group. Moreover, our null hypothesis is that both controll and treatment groups will develop at the same rate. 


Materials and Method:
Material and Method
The independent variable of the study is the Precor (1.2% active ingredient) IGR concentrate (juvenile hormone) and this variable is a categorical measurement. The dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillars and their rate of pupation, which are numerical measurements and observational. The treatment group was treated with 5 drops of Precor while the controll group was given 5 drops of distilled water. After eight caterpillar larvae were obtained, holes were poked in two 4-cell plastic containers, high up on the sides of each cell to prevent the escape of larvae. Each container was labeled with either “treatment” or “controll” and a number from 1-4. Using a clean square container and spoon for each group, 10 grams of Manduca food were measured per cell (80 grams total). Before the reagents were added, a ball was formed with each 10 grams of food. The appropriate reagent was then added to each food mass with a clean pipet per group. Eight masses (10 grams each) were then mashed and securely placed on the corner side of each cell. The eight caterpillars were then weighed and placed in their own, individual cell. Both containers were placed in a fridge at 50-55 degrees. After the initial study setup, the caterpillars were checked on daily and their feces were removed, their cells were cleaned, each caterpillar was weighed, observations were taken, and food was changed, depending on its conditions. The food was only changed if it was mostly consumed or if the mass dried. Dead caterpillars were left in their cell. For statistical testing, a two tailed t_test was used to compare the controll group, given distilled water, and the treatment group, given the Precor.

Results
To best understand how the reagents used during this study affected the Manduca Sexta larvae, the weight of each caterpillar was taken every day of the 2-week experiment duration and observations were also noted each day. The controll and treatment groups did not differ in their weight until the 11th day of the study. From then, the treatment group caterpillars continued to gain weight, while the controll group caterpillars significently lost weight each day. This is also seen in the average final weight of each caterpillar group on day 15, were the treatment group had an average weight of 15.5 grams with a calculated standard deviation of ± 5.68 g while the controll group larvae had an average weight of 8.5 grams with a standard deviation of ± 4.16 g. Figure 1 below best shows this trend, where the treatment group is represented by the orange curve and the controll group by the blue curve. Using the observational data from the study, nothing noted throughout the two weeks seemed too relevant to the study, other than two observations collected on day 13. When the larvae were checked on this day, caterpillars 1,3, and 4 observed to be living in a tan mush on the bottom of their cells. We were unable to differentiate whether the substance was mashed food, diarrhea, or both. The observation was notable because the four treatment caterpillars in the adjacent container had a solid pile of food left in their cells, as well as clearly solid, shaped feces. Also, during the last few days of the study, we noticed that the controll group began to form an anatomical black line across their backs. This was not observed in the treatment group. To compare the treatment and controll groups, a two-tailed t_test statistical analysis test was used to find a p_value of 0.007549, using the day of the study versus the average weight of the caterpillars on each day. 


Discussion:
Discussion
Based on our statistically significent result, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis, which states that the treatment group larvae will have impaired and slower development than the controll group. When looking at the data, the acceptance of the alternate hypothesis correlates perfectly with the results of the experiment, as Manduca Sexta larvae reach optimal weight between their 7th and 10th day of development, and after that time frame, they begin to lose weight because they must empty their alimentary canal for pupation into their next stage of life [Rowland: 2017]. This is also supported by the observations of the larvae made throughout the study. What we thought was diarrhea must have been the contents of their alimentary canals, which explains their sudden weight loss. Also, the development of the black line on the back of the controll group larvae indicated that they were beginning to morph into their shells for their pupal stage. The lack of this mark on the treatment group and lack of alimentary canal excretions in their cells indicates that the development of this group was impaired, which is supported by the alternate hypothesis. The data from our lab correlates with the data from John Rowland’s study, who noticed similar traits in their Manduca Sexta caterpillars, also given juvenile hormone. Their figure 3 is almost identical to our figure 1 above, where the same data points were used and produced very similar curves [Rowland: 2017]. For example, like our controll group caterpillars on day 11, their controll group larvae started to drastically lose weight, continuously, on day 9 of their study. Also, our treatment group ended with a higher averaged weight on day 15 compared to the controll group. Rowland’s study saw these same results, as well, with an average of roughly 10 grams for their treatment group and 5 grams from their controll group [Rowland: 2017]. Although this experiment showed to have precise biological results, the repetition of this study in the future could be altered for more accuracy. For example, since the Precor IGR concentrate is said to inhibit larvae development for 7 months, the study could extend to 7.5 months to better understand its holistic effects on the tobacco hornworm and the extended time would also allow for more data points [Glare: 1999]. To conclude, the administration of the Precor IGR concentrate (JH) to tobacco hornworm larvae showed to inhibit pupal development for at least two weeks in this study. This indicates that in the Winston-Salem area, pesticides with juvenile hormone should be avoided because it would increase the time that the Manduca Sexta species remained a larvae for up to 7 months, which again, is considered a pest and danger to tobacco and tomato crops [Glare: 1999]. With this particular species, their development into a moth is preferred in Winston-Salem and further studies could be performed to discover how to speed up their development, rather than inhibit it.
