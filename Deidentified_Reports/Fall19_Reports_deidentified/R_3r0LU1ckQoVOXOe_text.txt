Title: Raphanus sativus exposed to two levels of humidity led to no significent difference in root-shoot ratios

Abstract:

Plant resource allocation allows a plant to optimize its growth and use limited resources depending on its needs. One good way to measure plant allocation is using root-shoot ratios because roots and shoots allocate different types of resources. One of these resources is water. Allocation varies depending on the humidity of an environment a plant is in. In this experiment, radish plants (Raphanus sativus) were placed in two different environments with varying humidity levels to determine if there is a significent difference in their resource allocation. The results indicate there was not a statistically significent difference in the root-shoot ratios of plants placed in humid conditions and plants in ambient conditions. However, the overall trend shows lower root-shoot ratios in plants placed in the humid environment compared to those in the controll environment. Because mold grew in the humid environment and few plants were produced, it might have affected the root-shoot ratios. If the experiment is performed again, decreasing the amount of water to avoid mold growth is suggested.


Introduction:

Plant allocation refers to the way plants provide resources to their different parts: roots and shoots. While shoots process light, the roots of a plant process water and nutrients in soil. Plant resource allocation refers to where plants prioritize growth. By allocating resources to certain parts based on available resources, a plant optimizes its ability to respond to environmental cues and ensure the production and survival of the next generation. [Bennett: 2012].  Resource allocation in plants has to do with tradeoffs depending on the plant’s needs. A plant may spend more of its energy and mass to grow a structure, and in turn, spend less effort on growing other structures. [Johnson: 2019].  Root-shoot ratios are an effective way of telling us how a plant has allocated resources in certain parts of a plant because it is the biomass of the root divided by the biomass of the shoot. [Johnson: 2019].  A higher root-shoot ratio indicates that more energy has been allocated to the roots of the plants, and therefore they are longer, while a lower ratio indicates the same thing for the shoot. Dry conditions usually produce plants with a higher root-shoot ratio because drought is a type of stress to which roots respond to through biomass adjustments, a physiological response to avoid and tolerate this stress. [Brunner: 2015]. In this experiment, we will determine the effects of humidity on plant allocation in Raphanus sativus, otherwise known as radish plants. Radishes are a type of root plant that makes a good study species because it grows rapidly and is easy to maintain. We hypothesize that radish plants in a higher humidity environment will have lower root-shoot ratios than those in a normal environment because they do not have to compete for water in this case since there is an abundance of it. This means that we expect the shoots in our plants to be long when compared to our roots. 


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, two groups of radish seeds (Raphanus sativus) were placed in two different environments of varying humidity. Each group contained 3 pots of soil, which contained a substantial amount of radish seeds. One group (the controll) was placed on a tray and exposed to ambient conditions. Another group of 3 was also placed in and maintained on a tray, but this tray was enclosed in a glass case with 2 inches of water. Both groups were placed in a greenhouse and checked daily for a total of two weeks. The controll group was watered with distilled water when needed, while the high humidity group was maintained in the glass case for entire course of the experiment. After the two weeks, the plants were removed from the greenhouse and from their soil. For the controll group, we used a total of 6 plants to analyze and for the experimental group, only 4 plants were usable, one of which was smaller than the rest. They were washed and dried prior to being weighed to avoid any excess water from being included in the final weight. Their length was also taken. The plant was then separated into its shoot and its roots and the weight and length root-shoot ratios were taken. This was done on both the group of 6 plants and group of 4 plants. Because there were two groups of organisms each exposed to different conditions, a one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to determine if there was a significently higher root-shoot ratio of length and weight in the controll group compared to the experimental group. 

Results:
The mean root-shoot ratio for the length of the high humidity group was 0.965 +/- 0.083 and the mean root-shoot ratio for the length of the controll group was 1.159 +/- 0.428 (Figure 1). Although this ratio was higher for the controll group, it was not significently higher than that of the humidity group (t-value= 0.879, d.f.= 8, p_value= 0.202). The mean root-shoot ratio for the weight of the humidity group was 0.074 +/- 0.036 and the mean root-shoot ratio for the weight of the controll group was 0.164 +/- 0.098 (Figure 2). Although this ratio average was, again, higher for the controll group, it was not statistically significently higher than that of the humidity group (t-value=1.715, d.f.= 8, p_value= 0.062). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by the results. With a p_value higher than the alpha value of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean shoot-root ratios for weight and length of plants placed in an ambient environment and in a humid environment are not statistically significently different. While a significent difference was not seen, the general trend where radish plants in the humid environment had overall lower root-shoot ratios for weight than those in the controll group was in line with our predictions. The fact that it was not significent may be attributed to the amount of water we placed in the humid environment: 2 inches of water may have been too much of a quantity for the plants to survive. Only four plants sprouted in the humid environment. This number was more than two times as much in the controll group. Another abnormality we encountered was mold growth in many of the pots in the humid environment.  In a study that talks about fungi gnats in greenhouse plants, it mentions that improper water-draining and over-watering plants may cause fungi growth. [Cloyd: 2015]. While this study is about insects that feed on fungi, it mentions the causes of fungi growth in plants, which is what was observed in our experiment. If this experiment were to be performed again, to improve the results and avoid this mold problem we encountered, we could place the plants in less than 2 inches of water. We could also have used a better draining system or even change the water in the plants placed in the humid environment. Overall, this experiment allowed us to see that under extreme conditions, plant growth is inhibited. It also allowed us to see that humidity level does affect plant resource allocation, albeit not significently in this experiment. These results help us understand that certain environments are not suitable for some plants and depending on the kind of environment they are located, they must adapt and expend their energy on certain anatomical parts based on the resources available to them.
