Title: Disruptive Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Growth and Development of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the methods, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
Insect hormones, or mimics of them (Insect Growth Regulators), have been suggested to work as “the third-generation insecticides” in order to help regulate pests for agricultural and societal purposes [Pener: 2012]. The Manduca sexta is an insect in Order Lepidopten, with butterflies, moths and skippers. These insects go through a holometabolous life-cycle, meaning they go through major body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis [Johnson:2016]. “Because of its large size, the fact that it can be precisely staged and that is reared on an artificial diet” the Manduca sexta is a model organism for testing hormone regulation [Bollenbacher: 1981]. “The process of molting, which consists of retraction of the epidermis from the old cuticle, secretion of new cuticle, and ultimate shedding of the partially digested old cuticle, is controlled by hormones” [Gilbert: 1980]. The timing of the molting is controlled by the hormone ecdysterone, while the type of molting is controlled by the Juvenile Hormone. The commitment pulse is the point of development of the manduca sexta characterized by “the absence of juvenile hormone” [Weeks: 1986]. Therefore, adding precor, a mimic of juvenile hormone, to the food of Manduca sexta should disrupt their growth and development and delay the onset of the commitment pulse. If we add precor to the food of Manduca sexta caterpillars, then they will remain in the larval stage longer, thus the caterpillars will weigh less than caterpillars not treated with precor. 

Materials and Methods:
We took two plastic containers, split into 4 sections, punched holes in each compartment of both containers, and labelled the first container the control and the second container the experimental group. We numbered each compartment from 1 to 8, with 4 compartments for the control group and 4 compartments for the experimental group. In each compartment we placed The control group was given 10 grams of grub each with 6 drops of deionized water mixed in. The experimental group was given 10 grams of grub each with 6 drops of precor mixed in. We weighed and recorded to initial weights of each caterpillar then placed one caterpillar in each compartment. We placed both compartments in an incubator for 2 weeks to control the environmental conditions of the caterpillars. Every day for 2 weeks we weighed and recorded the weights of each caterpillar to see if there was a significant difference in the weights of the experimental group versus the weights of the control group. 
	To test for statistical significance, we averaged the differences of the experimental group’s final weights from their initial weight and then averaged the differences of the control group’s final weights from their initial weight, then calculated the standard deviation of each group’s average to find the variability of the data. We then calculated the rate of growth of each caterpillar over the 14 day period.

Results:
Precor, acting as juvenile hormone, did not significantly affect the growth of the caterpillars. The average difference in growth over a period of 14 days in the experimental group of 4 caterpillars was 9.91 g compared to the average difference in mass of the control group of 4 caterpillars at 12.50 g (Figure 1). While the experimental group shows less average growth than the control group, taking into account the standard deviation at 5.34 g for the experimental group and 1.86 g for the control group, the data does not yield significant results. When we plugged the values into the two sample t- test, the one-tailed p value is 0.20, which is greater than a p value of 0.05, therefore no significant difference is found. Figures 1 and 2 show visual depictions of the rates of growth of the control group versus the experimental group. The control group (Figure 2) shows a faster rate of growth and more overall growth than the experimental group (Figure 3).



Discussion:
We hypothesized that the juvenile hormone would inhibit the growth of the caterpillars, thus that the experimental group would grow significantly less than the control group. However, we observed that there was no significant difference in growth between the experimental group and the control group, which suggests that the precor did not significantly inhibit growth. Specifically, we expected the caterpillars to remain in the larval stage for longer than the control group, due to ingestion of precor, thus show a slower growth rate as well as less difference growth in total compared to the caterpillars not treated with methoprene [Gilbert: 1980]. 
While we fail to support our hypothesis, the graphs display that the experimental group did show less growth than the control group, which supports our hypothesis even though there is no statistical significance. Our background research also suggests that the Manduca Sexta’s development can be disrupted if treated with insect growth regulators, therefore our data might have not been statistically significant due to experimental errors or too small of a sample size [Pener: 2012]. In conclusion, there is still a possibility that IGRs can be used as insecticides but may not be the most effective form of pest control for manduca sexta caterpillars as well as other Lepidopten insects. Further research should include a larger sample size and a greater amount of precor in the experimental group’s food.
