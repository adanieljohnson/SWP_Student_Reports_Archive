Title: How Intraspecific Competition Affects Rate of Survival and Growth Among Vigna radiata.

Abstract:
Plants compete with each other for resources in order to survive, and one of the biggest factors in getting the necessary resources is the amount of space available. This study looked at how intraspecific competition affected the growth of Vigna radiata (mung bean) seedlings which could help determine how far apart to plant mung bean seeds for the best growth. In this study it was predicted that mung bean seeds that were spaced out would have better survival rates and longer root lengths than those grown clumped together. In each of the six flowerpots, fifteen seeds were planted. In three of the pots all fifteen seeds were put in the same hole and in the other pots, three seeds were placed in five evenly spaced holes. After daily watering for two weeks, the six pots were compared and the survival percentage and root to shoot length ratio was compared between the two groups of mung bean seeds. This study found that there was no statistical difference between the two groups’ survival rate and size after two weeks. Therefore, according to this study, the planting distance has no effect on how well a mung bean seedling grows. 

Introduction:
The legume mung bean (Vigna radiata) is a common food source throughout Southeast Asia and India. The sprout and the bean are used in many different dishes including pancakes, soups and stir-fries [Oplinger: 1997]. More uses of mung bean plants consist of being included in maize and wheat crop systems. When included in such systems, the overall crop yields have increased, and the water-use efficiency has improved [Parihar: 2017]. This study by Parihar et al. shows the importance of mung bean plants around the world especially as the amount of world’s arable land decreases. With the constant increase of the global population, this decrease of global space could have an effect on the yield of the mung bean crops around the world. Previous studies have shown that the planting distance between maize (Zea mays indurate) seeds has had a significant impact on its growth [Lihiang: 2017]. According to Lihiang et al., the greater the distance between the maize seeds and the fewer seeds planted in the same spot, the better the plant would grow as a result. This study will look to apply the concepts in Lihiang et al. to mung bean plants to see how the mung bean plant responds to a change in allotment of space. Therefore, the control group for this study will be the flowerpots that have the mung bean seeds planted in one location, and the experimental group will consist of the seeds in five evenly spaced holes. The hypothesis of this experiment is that the mung bean seedlings that are planted with more space between them will have less competition for root space and nutrients, therefore they will be more likely to survive and will have a bigger root to shoot ratio than the mung bean seedlings that are planted clumped together. 

Materials and Methods:
Ninety seeds of Vigna radiata were soaked in water for twenty-four hours before being planted. Six pots of vermiculite were prepared and labeled as group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Furthermore, groups 1-3 were labeled as “spaced” and group 4-6 as “clumped.” In each “clumped” flowerpot, one hole was dug in the center of the pot and fifteen seeds were place into the hole and covered. In the “spaced” pots, five holes were dug, one in the center and four at each corner. In each hole three seeds were placed and then covered. Each pot was then watered until saturated. All six pots of Vigna radiata were placed in a greenhouse. Each day for two weeks the pots were watered with 150 mL of tap water via a beaker. After two weeks the pots were removed from the greenhouse. The percent survival rate and the length root to shoot ratio was determined. The data was recorded in the lab notebook and a one-tailed two-sample t-test was used to test the hypothesis and to see if it had any statistical validity. 

Results:
The survival rate of the mung bean seedlings planted clumped together were 73.3% for Group 1, 93.3% for Group 2 and 80% for Group 3. The mean survival rate for the three pots of clumped mung bean seedlings was 82.2%. For the mung bean seedlings that were spaced out the survival rate was 73.3% for Group 4, 93.3% for Group 5 and 100% for Group 6. The mean survival rate for the spaced out mung bean was therefore 88.9%. This data is shown in Table 1. The statistical test between the experimental and the control groups show that the t-stat = 0.76, the df = 4 and the P-value is 0.27. 
The length root to shoot ratio (R:S) was also calculated. Group 1 had a mean R:S of 0.79, while Group 2 had a R:S of 0.51 and Group 3’s R:S was 0.65. For the mung bean seedlings planted in spaced out conditions, the R:S was 0.82 for Group 4, 0.65 for Group 5 and 0.74 for Group 6. This data is presented in Figure 1. The two-sample t-test for the R:S results was t-stat = 0.92, df = 4, P = 0.21. 

Discussion:
The goal of this experiment was to test the effect of space on the growth of mung bean seedlings. The hypothesis of the study was that the seedlings given more space would survive at a higher rate and would have experienced more growth during the two week timeframe. This hypothesis was rejected since the survival percentage and the root to shoot ratio of the experimental group and the control group were indistinguishable. The statistical test shows no significant statistical differences between mung bean seedlings that were planted clumped together and those that were spaced apart. Based on the results of this study, there is no consequence in planting mung bean seeds close together as they will survive at the same rate and grow to be the same size as seeds planted with space between them. However, this conclusion differs from that of similar studies. A previous study showed that more intra and inter-row spacing between mung bean seeds does increase the overall size of the plant [Wubetu: 2018]. This discrepancy between our study and theirs could be due to the timeframe of the experiments. Our study was conducted over a two week period while the study of Wubetu et. al lasted an entire growing season. Further studies will have to explore this issue to see if time has an effect on mung bean seedlings planted in different spatial environments. Our study as well as Wubetu et. al looked at how space affected the intraspecific competition among mung bean plants. Another study looked at how space affects interspecific competition between mung bean and sunflower plants. This study found that, in a square meter, the more sunflower plants that were planted alongside thirty mung bean plants, the smaller the mung bean plant would be in size, weight and grain yield [Anas: 2017]. In other words, the less competition the mung bean plant faces with other species, the more resources there are available to mung beans, and the better they will grow. The results found by Anas et. al compared to our results suggest that, in regard to space, interspecific competition is more of a factor in determining survival rate and thereby overall growth of mung bean plants than intraspecific competition. The implication of the comparison between the two studies could help farmers in determining the combination of mung bean seeds to other species to get the crop yield they want. Finally, a possible error within our study is that the flowerpots used were too small to provide an actual difference between our control and experimental groups. However, if further tests support our results then this could be a major breakthrough in how mung bean seeds are planted in the future. If space does not inhibit the growth of mung beans, then the decreasing amount of arable land in the world may have little to no affect as mung beans could be planted closer and closer together.
