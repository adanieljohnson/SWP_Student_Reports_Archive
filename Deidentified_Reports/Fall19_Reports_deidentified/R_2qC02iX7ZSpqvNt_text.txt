Title: Effects of Colors of Water on the Aggressive Behaviors of Betta splendins

Abstract:
Animals display different kinds of behaviors according to various evolutionary stimulus. For male Betta splendins, they are likely to show aggressive behaviors when their territories and reproductive fitness are influenced by their conspecifics. In this experiment, we want to investigate whether the change in colors of water will have an impact on bettas’ judgements of its intruding conspecifics. Based on early research on the effects of visual reinforcers for bettas, we chose the clear, yellow, and blue water as independent variables in order to observe betta’s change of response time for showing its first sign of aggression—gill flaring. The results of this experiment turned out an insignificent relationship between the colors of water and the respond time for starting aggressive behaviors for bettas. Since the habituation of the fish due to prolonged exposure of same intruding species had a great impact on increasing the respond time for bettas, our experiment needs to be further improved on adding more resting time for fish in between each trail. 

Introduction:
The purposes of displaying different behaviors for animals have been shaped by evolution and selection. In this experiment, Betta splendins were used as sample species and they are in green or blue color under unstimulated conditions. Male bettas are likely to display aggressive behaviors in defending their territories against intruding male conspecifics. Their patterns of aggressive behaviors are categorized as broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing; while facing movements include erecting pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and protruding then branchiostegal membranes to create a red “mane” [Lynn: 2007]. Since Betta’s aggressive behaviors will be affected by various environmental factors, their level of aggressive behaviors can thus be observed differently across different stimulus. Previous experiment has suggested a relationship between the level of Betta’s aggressive behaviors and the visual reinforcers that acted on them. It appeared that the fish will respond the least when the reinforcer coloration is like its own and most when the coloration is unlike its own [Thompson: 1965]. Accordingly, we want to investigate whether the colors of water in which Betta splendins live will exhibit a significent relationship with their levels of aggressions toward the intruding conspecifics. When the color of water is in sharp contrast with Betta’s own color, they are more likely to have more aggressive behaviors toward the intruding Betta, thus displaying first sign of aggressive behaviors more quickly. In contrast, Betta will respond slower when the color of water is close to its own’s. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the color of water has an effect on the response time for Betta splendins to have their first sign of aggression.

Materials and Method:
We selected two blue male Betta splendins as our experimental samples, and put each of them into two compartments in a transparent tank with an opaque partition in between. In order to determine the more aggressive fish as our observing target, we removed the partition between them and observed which male acted more dominantly than the other one. Then we decided to set the clear water as controll group, and the yellow-dyed and blue-dyed water as treatment groups. We also set the first sign of aggression as gill flaring for targeting fish from our observation. Due to the reaction time for both Bettas to see each other, our independent variable is the time between both fish seeing each other and the time of gill flaring. For clear water, we firstly removed the partition between to male Bettas and started recording time when two Bettas saw each other and stop recording after the targeting fish flared its gills. We did four trails with the same process and let the fish to be separated again and rested for 5 minutes in between each trail. Then we used a blue food dye to dye the water for both compartments of two fish with 2 drops each and repeated the same experimental process as we did for the clear water. Then we changed the water in the tank and dyed it into yellow. Same process of collecting data was repeated. We used an ANOVA test to test the significance of our results at last.

Results:
The mean time between two fish saw each other and the gill flaring of the targeting fish is 13.5 +/-2.38 seconds for clear water. It is 37.25 +/- 38.0 seconds for yellow water and is 44.25 +/- 27.8 seconds for blue water. There is not a significent relationship between the color of water and the response time for Betta’s aggressive behaviors (d.f. = 2, Fs = 1.404, p_value = 0.295). There are two outliers for our experiment with the yellow water. By excluding the outliers, the mean time became 5.50 +/- 3.54 seconds for yellow fish, and the resulting p_value among all groups is 0.075. Figure 1 shows the relationship between response time for first sign of aggression and the color of water without excluding the outliers. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the color of water has an effect on the response time for Betta splendins to have their first sign of aggression is rejected due to insignificent results. Our results will be more significent after excluding two outliers occurred in the last two trails of experiment for bettas in the yellow water. According to previous experiment, habituation occurred in Betta splendins when they are exposed to a prolonged image of their conspecifics. Specifically, their threats toward conspecifics would be less aggressive and have lower durations [Meliska: 1976]. Consequently, bettas probably displayed habituation in our experiment due to frequent exposure to the same intruding conspecifics and thus responded slower and less aggressively for the last few trails. In order to improve our experiment, we could extend the resting time for bettas in between each trail to avoid habituation caused by the similar responses of the other fish overtime. By obtaining more accurate results in this way, we could interpret the results within each color that whether the contrast color would stimulate bettas to have more aggressive behaviors than the same color compared with their own colors. In conclusion, the aggressive behaviors of Betta splendins are stimulated based on other conspecifics’ invasion of their own reproductive fitness. By observing and understanding the change of these behaviors across different environmental stimulus, we are able to conclude the costs and benefits of such aggressive behaviors and thus understand them in terms of the evolution process of Betta splendins.
