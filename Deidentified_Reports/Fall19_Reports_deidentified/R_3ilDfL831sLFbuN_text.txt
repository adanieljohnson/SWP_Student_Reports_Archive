Title: Effects of nitrogen on the root length of cultivated Radish (Raphanus sativus L)

Abstract:
Plants use allocation strategies in order to maximize the uptake of limited resources. Allocation is the distribution of resources to different body structures in plants through ration-driven process. This study aims to test the effects of altering nitrogen level on the root length of Raphanus sativus L (cultivated Radish). We hypothesized that lacking nitrogen would result in longer root length in radish plants. Radish plants were divided into control and treatment groups  The two tail p value was less than 0.05 and indicates that there is significant difference between the control and treatment groups in average root length. Therefore, our hypothesis was supported. It can be explained by the fact that plants compensate for the lack of nitrogen by growing longer roots to maximize their nutrient uptake in the soil. Through the study, we obtained a fundamental understanding of how altering nitrogen level affects plant growth and how plants conduct allocation. The correlation of nitrogen level and plant yield is a key concern of agriculture and requires further study. 

Introduction:
Since there are limited resources in nature, organisms develop various strategies to maximize the use of these resources. Allocation is one of the significant concepts among all the survival strategies.  In plant populations, allocation is a proportional or ratio-driven process. Plants are able to allocate given amount of resources to different body structures, such as root system and shoot system, in a way that different structures are invested with different amount of resources by ratio. This allocation is in response to biotic factors in the local habitat. For example, plants in the forest tend to develop a larger number of leaves to compensate for being overshadowed by taller trees, and thus to maximize the capture of sunlight for photosynthesis [Lichtenthaler et al: 1981]. In addition, plant species also show a “trade-off” characteristic in resource allocation. The “trade-off” indicates that certain plant species put more investment in developing one trait or body structure and reduce in other traits or structures. For example, previous study that focused on testing flood tolerance of three marsh plant species discovered that a trade-off exists between tolerance to flooding and tolerance to drought . The marsh plant with highest tolerance to flooding shows lowest tolerance to drought. The plants with medium tolerance to both drought and flood shows that highest survival rate in the experiment [Luo et al: 2008]. Previous works illustrate that in response to the local habitat, plants develop allocation and trade-off strategies to maximize their survival rate. In our study, one of the most important nutrients in soil, nitrogen was the testing factor. Raphanus sativus L (cultivated Radish) was subject to experiment. Raphanus sativus is a good model plant to study plant’s response to various environmental stresses, such as temperature, light intensity, water supply and nutrient level [Kostka-Rick and Manning: 1993]. The goal of this study was to learn the effects of altering nitrogen level to the root length of Radish. Nitrogen is an important macro nutrient to plant growth and development. It is an essential constituent of metabolically active compounds such as protein, nucleic acids, chlorophyll and enzymes, etc [Pervez et al: 2004]. When nitrogen is deficient in soil, the yield is poor in size of harvest, weight and quality. By taking samples of cultivated radish plants and measuring their root length, we were able to obtain a general idea of how different level of nitrogen affects the radish plant’s growth. The Radish plants were divided into control and treatment groups. The treatment group received extra nitrogen every day during the experiment. After two weeks, three plants from each pot were randomly picked and measured for their root length. The root length of the control and treatment were graphed and compared for difference. We hypothesized that the lack of nitrogen would produce longer root length in Radish plants. One possible cause was that plants compensate for the lack of nutrients in the soil by propagating their roots. 

Materials and Methods:
Ten Radish seeds were planted in each of the six pots of fertilized soil. Three pots were labeled control and the other three were labeled nitrogen treatment. The plants were put in greenhouse, under stable temperature and light intensity. Each day each pot was watered with 200ml of water. Each nitrogen treatment pot was watered with an additional 20ml of nitrate. After 14 days, three plants from each pot were randomly selected and rinsed with water. Each of the plant was cut and the root was separated from the rest of the plant. The maximum root length was measured and recorded. A bar graph comparing the average maximum root length of the control plants and the treatment plants was constructed. Two sample t test was performed to compare the difference of the mean root length from two groups by comparing the two tail p values. 

Results:
The average root lengths for control group were 101, 99.67 and 97 mm. The average root lengths for nitrogen group were 80.67, 74.67 and 20 mm. The average root length value for each group and the standard deviation values were shown in figure 1. Two sample t-tests were performed on control and treatment groups of average root length. The two sample t test results show that df=8, two tail p value = 0.0096 (p&lt;0.05). Since the p value is less than 0.05, there is significant difference between average root length of the control and treatment groups. However, in one pot of the nitrogen treatment group, we only obtained one plant. This resulted in two zero values in our data and significantly reduced the mean value. If we excluded these two outliers, the two sample t test would give us df = 14, two tail p = 0.017 (p&lt;0.05). Since the p value is less than 0.05, the outliers did not affect the results. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that states the lack of nitrogen would produce longer root length in Radish plants was supported by the results. Though there were two zero outliers, two sample t test excluding the outliers still shows that there is significant difference between the control average root length and the treatment average root length. Therefore, our hypothesis was supported. This conclusion illustrates that in the lack of nitrogen, the radish plants adapt the strategy of growing longer roots to obtain more nitrogen in deeper soil layers. It is also illustrated that plants distribute resources by proportion to different body structures in order to maximize the uptake of resources. In addition, in the nitrogen treatment group, we observed a higher plant death rate. It is possible that the addition of a large amount of nitrogen is related to plant death. A previous study that tested the response of Radish plants to different nitrogen level shows that the highest root yield of radish was not found in plants applied with the most nitrogen [Pervez et al: 2004]. The results indicate that adding too much nitrogen to plants would lead to low root yield and plant death. In conclusion, observation of the Radish plants illustrates the allocation strategy, which claims that plants distribute resources to different body structures proportionally. In the future, the correlation of nitrogen level and plant development is a field of interest, since the nitrogen is often used in fertilizers and is closely related to agriculture. It is important to find the optimal amount of nitrogen for a given plant species in order to obtain the desired production of the plant species. One previous study explored the role of nitrogen fertilization in rice production. The results in the study suggest that improved production of rice was obtained by applying fertilizers that contained nitrogen. The nitrogen plays an important role in optimizing the photosynthesis capacity of the leaves in crops and thus lead to higher yield of rice [Mae: 1997]. In addition to nitrogen, other factors also play important roles in plant growth as well and are worthy subjects for research, such as the space between each individual plant and the quality of the air, etc.  A previous study established that plant density could affect the yield of radish plants. In the study, researchers discovered that lowering plant density increases radish root quality in terms of average root weight and dry matter content. Increasing the level of nitrogen can further enhance on these effects [El-Desuki et al: 2005]. Studying allocation strategies of plants is important for us to understand plants’ development. Through understanding the effects of altering the level of specific nutrients in plant growth, people can apply the knowledge to agriculture and obtained desired yields.
