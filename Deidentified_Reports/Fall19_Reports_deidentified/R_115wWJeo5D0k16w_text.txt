Title: The shortened larval development of Manduca Sexta in response to the introduction of the hormone Ecdysterone (20E).

Abstract:
The focus of this experiment was to identify the impact of the hormone Ecdysterone (20E) on Manduca Sexta development. If 20E affects the timing of insect development then the Manduca Sexta individuals exposed to the hormone will have a higher average weight gain than the individuals not exposed to this hormone. 20E is one of the three developmental hormones in the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta were randomly separated into two groups, one control and one experimental. The experimental group was exposed to seven drops of 20E. This concentration of 20E was fatal to the Manduca Sexta in the experiment, so the experiment was restarted, and another experimental group was selected and exposed to three drops of 20E and seven drops of water. Daily the enclosures were emptied, weighed and 10 drops of water were​ added, or seven drops of water and three drops of 20E. The individuals that were exposed to the 20E did not gain as much weight as those that were not exposed to the hormone. The Manduca Sexta that were exposed to 20E displayed black splotches that are usually present right before molting. In conclusion, the hormone 20E did hasten the development timing of the Manduca Sexta, but the organisms did not gain more weight.

Introduction:
Ecdysterone (20E) is a steroid hormone that is formed in the prothoracic glands of the Manduca Sexta [Rybczynski: 2009]. Typically, this hormone is present in Manduca Sexta to signal the beginning of the molting process. Under normal laboratory conditions at a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius, the Manduca Sexta develops from larva to adult in 22-23 days. The final larval instar stage lasts approximately 10 days [Rybczynski: 2009]. One of the important behavioral changes in the Manduca Sexta is during the pupal stage. Just before the pupal stage, the behavior of wondering is exhibited. Wondering is during this stage the organism displays decreased and the pupa is sometimes enclosed by a cocoon. If 20E expedites the time it takes for Manduca Sexta to develop it would, therefore, cause the individuals exposed to it to mimic the pupal stage as well as a possible rapid gain in weight. The impact of the hormone 20E is important because if it expedites the development process the Manduca Sexta, which is usually considered a pest, can spend less time as a larva harming plant life.


The null hypothesis is; if 20E affects the timing of insect development then the tobacco hornworms will have a higher average weight gain, indicating a faster development, than the individuals without 20E. The alternative hypothesis would be that the hormone 20E would not affect the weight of the Manduca Sexta. The difference between the null and alternate hypothesis is that the null states that the hormone 20E will affect the weight of the Manduca Sexta and the alternate states that there is no change in weight. 

Manduca Sexta is a good model organism for this experiment because it has a short developmental period of approximately 23 days, with the last larval stage occurring in just ten days. The short developmental cycle of the organism makes it ideal for this experiment. Also, the hormones that impact the development are not hazardous to humans or other mammals in small quantities. “The Manduca Sexta is an organism that can also be successfully reared on an artificial diet” [Byron: 2017]. There are also only three hormones that influence the Manduca Sexta during development, so it would be easier to acknowledge the impact of one hormone in this organism compared to other organisms that have more hormones impacting development [Nijhout: 1974]. These hormones are Juvenile Hormone (JH), Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH) and Ecdysterone (20E).


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, eight Manduca Sexta were selected, weighed and placed into two plastic bins with four sections and one Manduca Sexta was placed in each section. Then ten grams of the bean paste food was measured and mixed with ten drops of water for the control and seven drops of Ecdysterone (20E), with three drops of water for the experimental. Both the experimental and control groups are given ten drops of liquid on their food. This was repeated for seven days. The individuals were weighed, waste was disposed of and fresh food was added daily. The Manduca Sexta was kept in an incubator at 26 degrees celsius. 

After day seven the treatment group died, so the methods were amended. The control remained unchanged with ten drops of distilled water mixed with the food, but the amount of Ecdysterone (20E) was reduced from seven drops a day to three drops a day and the amount of water increased from three drops to seven drops. The individuals were weighed, new food was made, and hormone or water was added to the appropriate group. The control variables are the type of food, bean paste, used and the same amount of liquid drops were added to the control and treatment. The environmental conditions were the same for both the control and treatment group; that being 26 degrees Celsius in an incubator. The independent variables were the amount of food (ten grams of bean paste), the amount of liquid (ten drops of liquid) that was given to the control and experiment group and the amount of 20E, seven, then three drops that were given to the experimental groups.  The dependent variable is the weight of the Manduca Sexta individuals. 

At the end of the experiment a two-sample t-test was used and a one-tailed t value was selected to compare the groups to make an inference about the influence of Ecdysterone (20E) on the weight and development of the Manduca Sexta.


Results:
Overall the mass of the control group increased each day while the experimental group increased then sharply decreased (Figure 2). The mass of the Manduca Sexta control group increased each day until day six where the group gained less weight than the day before, this is the only time it happens and on day seven the growth increases exponentially compared to the day before. The average growth for the control group was 0.561 grams with a standard deviation of 0.740 and the average growth for the experimental group was 0.0123 grams with a standard deviation of 0.0599. Given that the P-value for the two-sample t-test with one tail is 0.04991, the treatment group is statistically different than the control group. In addition to the weight loss in the individuals that were exposed to the 20E, they also demonstrated a fasting behavior and did not eat or produce much waste on​ day five. Also, on day five brown-black spots were found on the treatment individuals. These spots grew in size as the days progressed. 

Discussion:
The results indicate that the hormone Ecdysterone (20E) has a statistically significant impact on the mass of the Manduca Sexta. Contrary to our hypothesis, the Manduca Sexta lost weight instead of gained weight in this experiment (Figure3). While the treatment group developed faster than the control, indicated by the black spots on their bodies, the stage of development before pupation is a time of fasting for the Manduca Sexta not a time of growth. While observing the treatment Manduca Sexta, brown-black spots were present in the treatment of individuals. These spots became present while the individuals were losing weight. "All individuals exposed to ecdysterone developed a distinctive double row of black spots along their dorsum… that latter provokes a typical prodrome of pupation"[Nijhout: 1974]. Before the pupation stage, the Manduca Sexta the "gut purge" [Nijhout: 1974] occurs and the individuals stop eating, this is why after day 4 the treatment group began to lose weight.  Also, the presence of (20E) spurs a decrease in juvenile hormone. A decrease in Juvenile hormone causes Manduca larvae to lose weight [Nijhout: 1974]. With a significant p-value that there is less than a five percent chance of this weight discrepancy to happen on its own. Therefore, the hormone (20E) does have a significant influence on the weight of Manduca Sexta (Figure1). The decrease in weight indicated further development than the increase in weight because later development is characterized by a fasting period. During the first trial of our experiment we had seven drops of the 20E hormone, this produced a radical chemical imbalance in the treatment group that caused them to pupate within days of exposure to the hormone. As a result, we had to start over because we were measuring their weight and the weight of the treatment group under pupation is constant. During the second trial of our experiment we reduced the drops from seven to three, this reduced the reaction time from hours to days, so the impact of the hormone can be observed at a slower rate. Using a hormone-like 20E as a pesticide on plants would be effective because it would manipulate the Manduca Sexta that are exposed to it into developing into a pupa instead of eating more of the crop[Bryon: 2017]. The idea that 20E is an effective pesticide is supported by figure two because it displays a weight loss that accompanies a fasting period.  This fasting period would greatly reduce the amount of damage to crops this insect inflicts and would be a pesticide that is not harmful to humans in small amounts. The next logical step in this study would be to find the optimal amount of 20E that would only negatively impact the Manduca Sexta and not harm other insects that are beneficial to crops such as the Apis mellifera or the western honeybee.
