Title: Effect of Growing Media on Resource Allocation of Raphinus sativus

Abstract:
Using Raphinus sativus, commonly referred to as the radish plant, we tested the effect of different growing media on the plant’s resource allocation. Resource allocation is determined by how much resources the plant dedicates to either root or shoot growth, depending on abiotic factors. We hypothesized that planting Raphinus sativus seeds in gravel and clay will lead to more allocation of resources to the roots, resulting in a greater root:shoot than the plants grown in soil. We planted 15 seeds of Raphinus sativus for each growing media, kept them in the Winston Hall greenhouse, and watered them daily. All told, we have two experimental groups (gravel and clay), and one controll group (soil). After 14 days, we measured the length and weight of the root and shoot for every plant, then calculated the root:shoot ratio. Our data did not support our hypothesis; although there was a significent difference between the root:shoot ratios of the groups, soil had a greater root:shoot ratio, not lower ratio, than gravel and soil in terms of length and was greater than clay in terms of weight. The p_values for our ANOVA tests were 0.011 for comparing the root:shoot for weight of the 15 plants, and 0.0031 for comparing the root:shoot for length of the 15 plants. Both of the p_values were less 

Introduction:
 An essential function of plants is the manner in which they allocate their resources to root and shoot growth (Staddon: 1980). For our purposes, abiotic factors impact a plant’s resource allocation. Abiotic factors are environmental factors that are nonliving such as sunlight, nutrients available the soil, and climate (Thomas: 2003).  Previous studied have found that soil type has an impact on root length and weight (Kleczewski: 2010). In this lab, we will be examining the impact that abiotic factors have on Raphinus sativus, by measuring how the root:shoot ratio varies depending on the type of environment that they’re planted in. We hope to analyze the allocation pattern of the species Raphinus sativus, and how that pattern changes under abiotic factors. The types of ground that we will be testing the allocation of Raphinus sativus are soil, gravel and clay. We hypothesize that Raphinus sativus seedlings in soil will have a lower root:shoot ratio than the plants in clay and gravel, as the plants in soil will not have to put as many resources into root growth, as soil is more nutrient rich than gravel and clay. Additionally, the plants grown in gravel will have a larger root:shoot ratio than clay, as it is even more nutrient-poor, and the roots will have to grow longer in order to find nutrients. The dependent variables in this experiment are length and weight of the root and shoot, and the independent variable is the type of ground that the seed is planted in. 


Materials and Method:
We had three groups: a controll group (soil) and two experimental groups (clay and gravel) each containing 3 bins with 5 seeds of Raphinus sativa planted in each. After planting the seeds, the plants were placed in the Winston Hall greenhouse at a constant temperature and humidity and watered every day for the following two weeks. Our variables included measurable data such as mass of the whole plant, and length and mass of the roots and shoots. We then calculated the root:shoot ratio for the plants in each ground type. The statistical test we use to interpret data was an ANOVA test, comparing the root:shoot ratio of the plants in clay, soil and gravel. In total, the experiment took 14 days. 


Results:
Figure 1, Effect on Root:Shoot Ratio of Raphinus sativa plants by ground type depicts the impact that different growing media have on the root:shoot ratio of the plant. The root:shoot ratios for weight are in blue bars, and the root:shoot ratios for length are shown in red bars. The root:shoot for weight of the plants in gravel were found to be greater than those of soil and clay. However, the root:shoot of length for soil was greater than both gravel and clay. Our ANOVA test showed that the difference in root:shoot ratios for the plants grown in gravel, clay and soil were significent, as the p values for the root:shoot ratios of weight were 0.011, and the p values for the root:shoot of length were 0.0031. Table 1 depicts the average root:shoot ratio for the plants grown in the different growing media. For the plants grown in gravel, the standard deviations were 0.121 and 0.621 for root:shoot for weight, and root:shoot for length, respectively. Similarly, for plants grown in clay, the standard deviations were 0.0175 and 0.102 and for the plants grown in soil, the standard deviations were 0.109 and 0.416. 


Discussion:
I believe that the data does not support my hypothesis. I hypothesized that Raphinus sativa plants grown in soil would have a smaller root:shoot ratio, meaning that the plant would allocate less resources to the roots, as the soil is so nutrient rich. Yet, as the statistical tests and data made clear, there were noticeable differences between the resource allocation of the plants in different group types. The soil actually had the largest root:shoot ratio for length of 1.56, and the second-largest root:shoot ratio for weight, at 0.23. In general, we noticed that the plants in clay dedicated much more resources for shoot growth, while the plants in soil and gravel had more allocation for the roots. This data was supported by our ANOVA test, which found a p_value of 0.011 in comparing the ratios of the three growing media for weight, and 0.0031 for length. Both of these p_values are below our significance threshold of 0.05. A study that supports the claim that different growing media impacts the growth and root:shoot ratio of plants is by Johann G. Zaller, entitled, “Vermicompost as a substitute for peat in potting media: Effects on germination, biomass allocation, yields and fruit quality of three tomato varieties”. In this study, the investigators tested if vermicompost (VC) was an appropriate substitute for peat, by measuring how the resource allocation (root:shoot ratio) was affected by increasing concentrations of Vermicompost in the planting media (Zaller: 2007). They found that the root:shoot ratio of the plants in higher Vc concentrations decreased significently, meaning that the plants began to dedicate more resources to obtaining energy from the air, rather the ground (Zaller: 2007). There are some possible sources of error that my indicate as to why our hypothesis was not supported. The primary one that we suspect is that the plants were not given enough time to grow after germination. As the plant germinates, it does not need resources other than the resources in the seed go grow. Because our plants were noticeably shorter than those of other experiments, we suspect that the plants were possibly still germinating. If they were still germinating, the different growing media would not be as relevant, as the plant would not have had time to utilize the resources -or lack thereof- in the growing media. In order to test this possible source error, the experiment should be ran over a longer time period, to ensure that the plant is past germination when allocation is analyzed. During the course of our experiment, we noticed that the clay was a much denser media than the soil. Something I would like to investigate is if  the growing media is denser and harder to penetrate by root, the root length and mass will be less than the plants in a growing media that is less dense and difficult to penetrate.
