Title: The Effect of Size Variant Artificial Replicates on Provoking Agonistic Behavior in Betta splenden

Abstract:
Betta splenden are known for displaying aggressive behavior and will often attack their own species to acquire and defend resources. The two classifications of displayed aggressive behavior are known as broadside and facing movements. When placed in front of opponents or a mirror image, male Betta’s will extend their fins and flare their gills. This experiment aims to study agonistic behavior of Betta splenden when in contact with various sizes of artificial inanimate fish. It is hypothesized that Betta splenden will exhibit increased agonistic behavior and display faster responses when faced with a small artificial replicate compared to a medium and large replicate. Three Betta splenden were isolated and exposed to various sized foam cutouts for four minutes. The average number of agonistic behaviors and reaction time for each cutout size was documented and analyzed using an ANOVA test. Size of artificial replicates yielded an insignificant effect on displayed agonistic behavior and response time; however, the understanding of aggression in Betta fish has translational applications to the understanding of human aggression. 

Introduction:
Ethology, or the study of animal behavior, aims to study how behavior has been shaped by evolution. Aggressive behavior is widespread across many animals as it plays a vital role in acquiring and defending resources. Betta splenden, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, are confirmed to display high levels of aggression and will attack their own kind [Romano: 2017]. Betta fish display intraspecific behaviors that include colorful displays and specific movement when in the presence of their own species. When approached by other males, the fighting fish will engage in three stereotyped behaviors [Neri: 2019]. The first includes gill flaring where the gills are repositioned in front of the face. The second is fin extension, where the fins are rearranged to give the illusion of increased physical appearance. Third is increased oxygen uptake as a consequence to compensate for the energy loss from the previous two behaviors. Betta splenden will display aggression in either a physical or non-physical manner over food, territory, and protection of nests [Gelacio: 2019].  
	Previous experiments have been conducted on the effects of visual cues on demonstrated agonistic behavior without the physical interaction of two male fish [Thompson: 1963]. When placed in front of a mirror, a Siamese fighting fish will display aggression within seconds [Eisenreich: 2017]. Similar results can be obtained when a mirror is replaced by an artificial representation of a Betta fish is placed in the fish tank. Broadside and facing movement, both agonistic, can be observed. Specially, broadside movements include pelvic fin flicking, tail beating and tail flashing, while facing movements include erect pectoral fins, the spreading of gills, and the exposure of the branchiostegal membrane. 
	The aim of this study is to determine if various sizes of artificial Betta splenden have an effect on agonistic behavior when presented to the test fish. Additionally, response time to the inanimate fish will be recorded. It is known that Betta fish want to establish dominance; therefore, when near smaller Betta, the larger will display more agonistic behavior. It is hypothesized that Betta splenden subjected to small artificial Betta replicates will display more agonistic behavior and will respond faster compared to when in the presence of medium and large replicates. 


Materials and Methods:
Three male Betta splenden were isolated in a plexiglass tank divided by two solid separators. The tank was filled with distilled water. The experimental group consisted of two red and one blue Betta splenden. Simultaneously, the fish were stimulated for four minutes with the presence of an artificial foam cutout of a varying size. Each fish was presented once with a small, medium, and large red cutout. Over the course of the experimental period, agonistic behaviors were visually counted and reaction time to the artificial cut out was documented. The fish were given a two-minute rest period between each experimental trial. The average number of agonistic behaviors and reaction time for each cutout size was calculated and analyzed using an ANOVA test.

Results:
The average number of agonistic behaviors for each artificial cutout size are displayed in Figure 1. When presented to the small cutout, the average displayed agonistic behaviors was 10 movements (8.89 movements), the average displayed behavior when presented to the medium cutout was 4.67 movements (4.16 movements), and the average displayed behavior when presented to the large cutout was 2.67 movements (1.53 movements). The small artificial Betta evoked the most aggressive movement from the fish. An ANOVA test yielded an insignificant p-value of 0.337.
	The average reaction times to the presence of the artificial cutouts are illustrated in Figure 2. When presented to the small cutout, the average time it took the fish to react was 15.33s (4.16s). Average reaction time to the medium cutout was 29s (12.73s) and the average reaction time to the large cutout was 52s (24.02s). The fish responded to the small artificial cutout the fastest. An ANOVA test produced an insignificant p-value of 0.099.


Discussion:
At the conclusion of the experiment, it was found that the initial hypothesis that Betta splenden presented to small artificial cutouts would display increased agonistic behavior and increased response time compared to when presented with medium and large cutouts, was not supported. Without the application and analysis of the ANOVA tests, the data collected demonstrates trends that do support the hypothesis. The average number of displayed agonistic behaviors was highest when the fish were subjected to the small artificial cutout. Additionally, the reaction time to the small cutout was the fastest amongst cutout sizes. However, both AVOVA tests conducted produced insignificant results suggesting that stimulation with various size of artificial Betta has no correlation to the amount of provoked agonistic behavior. 
	These findings are conclusive with accepted literature in ethology. Although no studies have been conducted with the presence of an inanimate artificial fish, many have been conducted with the stimulation of a mirror. It has been previously concluded that Siamese fighting fish display less aggressive behavior when viewing their own image [Meliska: 1980]. Meliska suggested this is due to non-provoked movement allowing the fish to recognize itself. This ideology can be applied to this study. As the artificial cutouts did not provoke movement, the Betta fish did not find the cutout as threatening as it would have in the presence of another male Betta. Agonistic behavior was document; however, not enough was displayed to validate findings in this experiment. 
	One unique observation found during this experiment was the blue Betta displayed the least amount of agonistic behaviors compared to the red betta tested. Literature suggests that red Betta fish tend to be more aggressive towards other red Betta [Gelacio: 2019]. This may explain why the blue Betta splenden used in this experiment was not as provoked to the artificial red cutout. 
	Error in this experiment can be attributed to the visual documentation of agonistic behavior. It was difficult for all behavior to be recorded, especially if it was a questionable aggressive movement. However, understanding agnostic behavior in Betta fish proves to be beneficial in understanding human behavior. A link in genetics between Betta fish and humans could potentially link their aggressive behaviors. The HTR1A gene in both species codes for serotonin (mood regulator) [Dayan: 2008]. Therefore, studies of the correlation between aggression and serotonin in Betta fish can translate to human studies.
