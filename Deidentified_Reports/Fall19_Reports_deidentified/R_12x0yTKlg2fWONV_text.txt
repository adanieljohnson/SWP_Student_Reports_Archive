Title: Effects of AzaGuard Insecticide on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
In this experiment the group tested the effects of AzaGuard insecticide on the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The group accomplished this by monitoring a control and treatment group ever the course of ten days. The results showed that the presence of AzaGuard prevented the caterpillars from pupating and caused some to die. This showed that materials that alter the effects of hormones can influence the natural cycles of organisms.
 


Introduction:
The hornworm caterpillar (Manduca sexta) goes through molting processes driven by hormonal changes in the caterpillar. In a normal life cycle hormones such as Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone rise and fall telling the organism when to begin molting. The Juvenile hormone is present in high concentrations in the youth of the caterpillar and inhibits the pupation process. Ecdysterone rises and falls in the life of the caterpillar rising as it goes through pupation. Ecdysterone essentially triggers the pupation and growth of the caterpillar [Johnson:2016]. The purpose of this lab is to gain better understanding of hormones in animals. By learning how synthetic materials interact with the organism the characteristics of hormones can be better understood. This can also show how some comminn insecticides work. This is important because Manduca sexta is considered a pest and be very destructive for farmers and gardeners. For this lab the group chose this organism to study because they have a relatively short maturation cycle[Johnson: 2016]. The lab chose to use the insecticide AzaGuard to compare how M. sexta normally mature and how this insecticide would affect them.  H: The presence of AzaGuard will prevent the caterpillars from pupating. This would show that one of the characteristics  of hormones is that other substances can mimic their effects.  

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment the group selected four caterpillars for the control group and four caterpillars for the treatment group. They divided the caterpillars individually and gave each caterpillar roughly 10 grams of prepared food. All caterpillars were fed the same type of food. The four control caterpillars had five drops of water mixed into the food. The treatment group had five drops of the AzaGuard mixed in to the food. Over the course of ten days the group observed the caterpillars, weighed them, cleaned their boxes, and replaced the food. The independent variable of the experiment was the presence of AzaGuard while the dependent variable was the mass and survival of the caterpillars. The control variables were the type of caterpillar, the type of food, and the care they received. To analyze the results the group used an independent samples t-test to show that the difference in mass of both groups was not due to chance. 

Results:
 The group observed that the control group survived and grew rapidly. The initial treatment group died so the lab group started again with another set of caterpillars. Of the second set only one died but they rest did not grow substantially. As the Figure 1 below shows, the average mass of the control caterpillars on day 10 was 10.5 grams with a standard deviation of 1.35, while the average mass of the treatment caterpillars on day 10 was 2.0 grams with a standard deviation of 1.10. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the mass of the caterpillars that were treated with AzaGuard and caterpillars that were not treated with AzaGuard. The p-value of 0.000308 was calculated. It was also observed on day 10 that two of the four control caterpillars were pupating.   

Discussion:
According to the t-test of the masses of both groups it can be determined that the difference between the masses of the groups was not due to chance. This allows the group to conclude AzaGuard does have an effect on caterpillar growth and pupation and the hypothesis can be supported. AzaGuard alters the effects of Juvenile Hormone by preventing the caterpillar from molting into the next stage. AzaGuard works as an insect growth regulator (IGR) by preventing the caterpillars from molting which is necessary to survive. IGR’s have been shown to alter the effects of JH [Johnson:2016]. It has been shown that the introduction of natural or synthesized Juvenile Hormone prevents M. sexta from pupating [Kiguchi : 1978]. Since E20 (Ecdysterone) causes the caterpillar to pupate it can be concluded that AzaGuard inhibits the effects of this hormone since the presence of AzaGuard inhibited the growth and pupation.(It can be concluded that AzaGuard interrupts the normal cycle of the insect. This shows that synthetic materials can mimic or alter the effect of hormones. This can be applied elsewhere such as the use of synthetic materials to reproduce the effects of insulin. The effects of AzaGuard specifically are important to farmers and gardeners who are dealing with Manduca sexta. If the study were to be repeated it could be altered by comparing the effects of different insecticides on the caterpillars or possibly introducing the insecticide at different stages of life in the caterpillar.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This figure shows the average mass of each group of caterpillars by day to compare the growth trends. This shows the control group had a larger average mass on every day of the experiment. The difference between the average masses got increasingly larger until the last day. Note: The first two days of the AzaGuard group are not included because the first set of treatment caterpillars died and a new group was started on day 3. *************************************************************************
