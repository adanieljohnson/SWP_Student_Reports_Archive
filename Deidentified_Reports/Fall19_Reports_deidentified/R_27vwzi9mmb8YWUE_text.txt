Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
na

Introduction:
The Tobacco Hornworm, also known as the manduca sexta is an insect that belongs to the lepidoptera order, which is the same as multiple kinds of butterflies and moths. The manduca sexta goes through a series of distinct changes; which starts with it being a caterpillar-like insect, and gradually changes it into a moth-like pest. During its early life stages, the manduca sexta is in its larval stage, which is the stage that gives it its name “hornworm” because of a horn on its posterior [Byron et Gillett-Kaufman 2017]. Then once it continues through the cycle, it goes through stages such as 1st instar larva, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th instar larva until it forms its pupa that it stays inside of until ready to be in its moth-like final stage [Johnson 2019]. The fact that the Manduca Sexta goes through such distinct phases of change makes it an optimal species to study. This life cycle of the manduca sexta is regulated primarily by a hormone known as the Juvenile Hormone, or JH. JH is understood to regulate the growth and development of the manduca sexta, especially in the presence of the molding hormone ecdysteroids [Browder 2001]. It can be predicted that an increased concentration of the juvenile hormone activator, found in the manduca sexta, would cause it to develop and grow at a much slower rate than those who had their normal amount of juvenile hormone. 


Materials and Methods:
At the beginning of the experiment, the required materials were collected and all placed together at the lab bench. Then a plastic container with four individual sections was labeled as whether it was the control group or the experimental group. Then holes were placed in the sides of each section of the plastic containers in order for the manduca sextas to be able to breathe while in their sections. Ten grams of the food that was for the experimental group was then mixed with five droplets of a solution of juvenile hormone and five droplets of water, while the control group was given ten grams of regular food with ten droplets of water. The manduca sextas were then weighed and placed into their respective sections for observation. Over the span of two weeks, the manducas were weighed and recorded every day. 


Results:
Throughout the experiment, it was evident that all of the worms were growing in terms of mass, but the control group and the experimental group had seemingly similar growth patterns. The final average weight of the control group was 4.9 grams and the final average weight of the treatment group was 12.9 grams. The control group managed to grow to an average of After examining the final t-score, it had been examined that the two-tailed p-score was 0.000467. Since the p-value was less than 0.05, the null hypothesis was rejected.

Discussion:
From the results of the experiment, it can be concluded that given the addition of juvenile hormone to the treatment group did not slow down their developmental process, despite the original belief that it would slow down their development by a great quantity. There could be many reasons behind this misinterpretation. One reason could be that the group made a mistake and gave the hormone to the wrong group or could have mislabeled the containers. Also, when observing the data, it becomes evident that the mass of the control group was higher than that of the treatment group before all of the worms in the control group died.
