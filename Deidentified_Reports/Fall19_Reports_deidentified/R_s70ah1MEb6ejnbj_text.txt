Title: Comparing the Average Weight in Manduca sexta After Exposure to JH

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is an organism that uses metamorphosis to transition to the adult stages of life. It regulates molting and changes based on its hormone levels, specifically JH and 20E. As JH is low and 20E sees a jump, the commitment pulse is triggered, and metamorphosis begins. This experiment tests the affect on continuing high levels of JH on Manduca sexta. The conclusions draw from the experiment are that JH does not have any effect on the mass of the larvae over a period of 3 weeks when in low concentrations. At 4 drops a day, no difference can be detected. However, if given 8 drops a day the caperpillars are significently smaller. Also, other studies have demonstrated that that prolonged exposure to JH prohibits the Manduca sexta from entering metamorphosis [Cymborowski, Safranek, Williams: 1980]. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a type of moth commonly found in the Easter United States. In the early stages of life, the Manduca sexta lives in its larva stage and feeds on plant leaves [Lotts, Naberhaus: 2017]. It follows the life cycle of eggs to larvae to cuticle and finally adult. Therefore, the Manduca sexta exemplifies the a holometabolous life cycle. The larvae are considered pests frequently destroying fields of crops and is commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. As adults they feed on nectar from flowers and are pollinators [Lotts, Naberhaus: 2017]. Metamorphosis is controllled primarily be 3 hormones: Brain Hormone, Juvenile Hormone (JH), and Ecdysteroid(20E). Specifically, JH and 20E work to controll the cycles of life. As JH is low and 20E sees a sudden spike, the commitment pulse is reached, and metamorphosis begins.  If exposure to JH continues throughout the Manduca sexta, then the larvae will grow slower and never transition to the adult stages of life. The null hypothesis is that the two groups will have equal masses. The alternate is that there will be a difference in the 2 groups.

Materials and Method:
In order to test the hypothesis, there will be 2 controll groups and 2 groups receiving JH hormone. The controll variable is that each caterpillar will be kept in the same style of container where that has 4 compartments. Each compartment has 1 caterpillar, 1 hole for air, and 10g of food added each day. The caterpillars will be stored at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. As the first controll group, each of the 2 caterpillars receives 4 drops of water each day in their food. The second controll is identical to the first but receives 8 drops of water. The experimental group is the same as the controll except instead of 4 drops of water add 4 drops of JH. Do the same with the second group with 8 drops of JH. Record the mass of the caterpillars daily and record visual observations. The independent variable is the presence of JH in the food vs the absence of it. The dependent variable is the mass of the caterpillars. A t_test will be run on both groups to determine the statistical significance. The p_value must be below .05 for the results to be significent.

Results:
No significent difference was detected between the 2 groups in the first study with only 4 drops. For this reason, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. After comparing the larvae at each day, a p value of .566994 was reached for the 4 drops groups However, the 8 drop group was statistically significent and an p value of .003593 was determined for the 8 drop group. Therefore, for this group we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that JH does have an effect on the weight of Manduca sexta. Also, the difference in averages in the 8 drop group was much more significent than that of the 4-drop group as it was separated by almost 4 full grams. 

Discussion:
Based on this data, JH does not affect the growth of Manduca sextain in low concentations. There was no significent difference in the data for the 4-drop group. However, for the 8 drop group a statistically significent value was reached. From this data, it can be concluded that in order to full effect the larvae, the larvae must interact with a greater concentration of JH. That is not to say though that the JH had no effect on the 4-drop larvae. Both groups that interacted with the JH was noticeably more lethargic by the end. All JH larvae had much less vibrant colors as they looked sickly and white compared to the vibrantly green controll group. Other studies have concluded that JH does have effect on the life cycle of Manduca sexta passed that of just mass. In Effects Of Juvenile Hormone On Ecdysone-Dependent Development In The Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta, JH is revealed to stop the larvae from entering the adult stages of life [Cymborowski, Safranek, Williams: 1980]. Overall, the Manduca sexta is affected by JH; it just has to be in high enough concentration.
