Title: The Impact of Juvenile Hormone on Manducta Sexta Larval Development

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The Manducta sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, has three primary hormones that controll its development. These hormones include the prothoracicotropic brain hormone (PTTH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). The two hormones investigated in this lab are the 20E and JH. Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting during insect development and additional functions in adult insects. Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt during development and regulates multiple functions in adult insects. JH is more present than 20E until the end of the 4th larval instar period, which then it is surpassed by 20E hormone. This experiment investigates if additional JH is given to the tobacco hornworm will cause a longer developmental period before the caterpillar reaches its commitment pulse. The commitment pulse is when a small rise in 20E occurs as JH drops very low, and it is produced when the signals reaching the indicate that the caterpillar is large enough and stored enough nutrients to pupate. We hope to investigate the effects that JH has on the larvae as they develop so there is a stronger understanding of endocrine function in the caterpillars. In this experiment, we hypothesized that if the caterpillar of the Manducta sexta is given 8 drops of additional juvenile hormone every time it is fed, then the caterpillar will remain in the developmental stage longer and therefore weigh less.

Materials and Method:
The experiment contains two groups: the controll group and the experimental group. The controll group contains four caterpillars that are fed 10 grams of food with 8 drops of water, and the food/water is replaced once it dries out. The experiment group contains four caterpillars that are fed 10 grams of food with 8 drops of IG Regulator (JH), and the food/JH is replaced once it dries out. The weight in grams of the caterpillars is recorded daily as well as any observations of changes in the caterpillars.

Results:
Both the experimental group (given 8 drops IG Regular) and the controll group (given 8 drops of water) grew at similar rates throughout the experiment. Series 1 of the graph represents the experimental group and Series 2 represents the controll group, and the weights described in the graph are the average weight of all 4 catepillars in each group daily. During the later days of the experiment, the average weights of the experimental group exceeded those of the controll group. There were also important differences in the coloring of the two groups: the experimental group remained a much lighter blue color than the controll group. The controll group had much more defined stripes on its body and became darker blue over time. Both groups had development of their horns, with the experimental group having a lighter pink colored horn and the controll group having a darker red horn. The p_value in this experiment was found to be 0.39.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was contradicted slightly in this experiment by the data collected. The average weight of the experimental group was not less than the average weight of the controll group as we expected; in fact, it eventually exceeded the weight of the controll group at the end of the experiment. However, other conditions of development did seem to be impacted by the addition of juvenile hormone, such as the coloring of the insects. The experimental group was a much lighter color, in both the body and horn, than the controll group. The time period of 14 days was enough time for the caterpillars to reach the 5th instar larva, where they are at their largest size before pupating. This leads to the conclusion that although the addition of juvenile hormone to a diet does not prevent the Manducta sexta from reaching the 5th instar larva in terms of weight and size, it does impact the development of other parts of the caterpillar, such as defined coloring.
