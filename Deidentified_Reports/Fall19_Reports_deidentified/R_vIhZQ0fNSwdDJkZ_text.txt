Title: The effect of varying salt water concentration on growth of the Mung Bean plant

Abstract:
The growth and development of plants is dependent on the resources present in their environment. If a plant is in an environment where it is deprived of different essential resources, it must allocate its limited energy. The Mung Bean plant (Vigna radiata)
does better in an environment of pure water than it does in an environment of saltwater. Therefore, placing a plant in saltwater would limit its resources and effect its growth. We hypothesize that between the groups placed in environment of different types of water, there will be a significant difference in root:shoot ratio. An ANOVA test was used to analyze the statistics, which was revealed to support the null hypothesis. 


Introduction:
In nature, plants require several resources to be able to perform photosynthesis, grow, and reproduce. These resources include nitrogen, water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight among other important materials [Johnson: 2016]. When a plant does not have enough of each of these resources, it does not have the available materials and energy to properly maintain all of its functions [Bazzaz: 1997]. This forces a plant to go through the process of resource allocation, a method by which a plant divides up its limited energy and resources to fulfil its most demanding needs [Bazzaz: 1997]. Because of this, the environment in which a plant is placed present a plant with different challenges and have a significant impact on the adaptations and changes a plant makes to survive [Johnson: 2016]. The purpose of our experiment was to determine if resource allocation made a significant impact on the root to shoot ratio in Mung Bean plants (Vigna radiata) when different concentrations of saltwater were substituted for normal, pure water and given to the plants on a daily basis. Like the majority of plants, Mung Bean plants are shown to grow better when in an environment of pure water, as opposed to an environment of saltwater [Zayed: 1997]. In order to gain insight into this question, we established three different groups of Mung Bean plants, one that was watered with pure water, one with both pure water and saltwater, and one with just saltwater. We hypothesized that there would be a significance statistical difference in the root to shoot ratio of the three different groups because of the Mung Bean plants inefficient use of saltwater, therefore forcing resource allocation.

Materials and Methods:
The experiment required 8.4 liters of .98M saltwater, 8.4 liters of pure water, planting soil, 36 Mung Bean seeds, plastic planting pots, scissors and a ruler. Three different experimental groups of Mung Bean plants were prepared with each group being made up of three plastic pots with four seeds in each pot. Group 1 was treated with 400 mL pure water each day, Group 2 was treated with a mixture of 200 mL pure water and 200 mL saltwater, and Group 3 was treated with 400 mL saltwater. Each plant was watered once a day at roughly the same time for two weeks. Plants were placed in identical environments besides the variance of water. At the end of two weeks, five plants, randomly selected from each group, were harvest from soil and cleaned. Measurements were taken for each plant in order to determine the root:shoot ratio of each plant. An ANOVA test was used to analyze data. 

Results:
According to the Anova Test, there was no statistical different in the root:shoot ratios between Mung Bean plants placed in different environments of saltwater (P=.225, Df=2, Fs=1.75). The results of the Anova Test would then support the null hypothesis that the replacement of pure water with different concentrations of saltwater does not have a significant impact on the root:shoot ratio of plants. The results of the Tukey Kramer test also established that there was no significant difference between any of the three groups. The results of the test are further supported by Figure 1, in which there is not a large or noticeable drop off or change in ratio between the different groups. 

Discussion:
The results of our Anova and Tukey Kramer tests supported our null-hypothesis and did not support the alternative hypothesis that the root:shoot ratios between Mung Bean plants placed in different environments of saltwater, a mixture of pure water and saltwater, and pure water would be significantly different. These results, or lack thereof, could be contributed to a variety of factors. One of which is that a small sample size was used for the statistical test, which contributed to a very low degree freedom. Using larger sample size for each group and taking more samples from each group would cause a higher degree of freedom, allowing for the ANOVA to establish a better overall picture of the experiment. The time period of two weeks may have not been enough time for the change in water to fully demonstrate its effects on plant growth, as much of the effect of limited resources and resource allocation do take longer amounts of time to show themselves (cite). Allowing for longer periods of exposer to saltwater would make it clear if the effects would continue to proliferate over time [Zayed: 1997]. Another factor that could be manipulated is the concentration of saltwater and increasing that concentration could have a large impact on the results of the experiment [Zayed: 1997]. With these conclusions in mind, there are several changes I would make to the experiment if I was going to do it again. To begin, I would add an additional pot with four seeds to each of the treatment groups, which would give a larger available number of plants to be randomly selected. I would also increase the sample size of each group from 5 to 10, in order to increase the Degree of Free of the ANOVA test in order to get a fuller view of the experiment from statistical testing. I would also increase the testing period from two to three weeks in order to see the longer effects of the saltwater environment.
