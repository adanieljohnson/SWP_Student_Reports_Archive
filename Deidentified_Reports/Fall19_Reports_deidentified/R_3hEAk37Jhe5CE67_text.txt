Title: Effects of water temperature on aggressive behavior on Betta splendins

Abstract:
Agonistic behaviors occur in competitive situations and include aggressive, submissive, and defensive behaviors. In this experiment we focused on the effect of a change in temperature had on the agnostic behavior of betta fish. Our experiment aimed to determine whether or not an increase in temperature of the environment would lead to a significent increase in the overall count of aggressive behaviors committed. Betta fish were chosen as the model organism for this experiment as they are relatively inexpensive to purchase, and given they are relatively active, it can be used to study how a change in environment can affect their behavior. We used a controll group that was placed in a 19 C environment and a treatment group that was placed in a 21 C environment. We found that an increase in temperature of the environment leads to a statistically significent difference in the overall count of aggressive behaviors committed by Betta fish.


Introduction:
Siamese fighting fish, Betta Splendins, are typically found in overgrown ponds and or in slowly flowing bodies of water such as rice paddies [Sturgeon: 1999]. They originate from Thailand and are widely known for their aggressive behavior. Specifically, they are renowned for their intraspecific behaviors. Intraspecific behaviors refer to the notion of behaviors that are conducted by one organism in the presence of another of the same species. Furthermore, Betta Splendins have various forms of agnostic behavior which is a type of behavior that is introduced in an organism discerns something as threatening in its respective environment. Betta fish are able to display 2 various types of agnostic behavior: facing and broadside movements. Specifically, within facing movements (in order or increasing aggressiveness), there are the following behaviors: Erect pelvic fin, spreading of gill covering (opercula) and the extension of the “red mane” (branchiostegal membrane). For broadside movements (in order or increasing aggressiveness) there are the following behaviors: pectoral fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing. 
A study determining the effects of an increase in temperature on fish of similar nature has already been conducted. Previous research has shown, based on similar experimental design, that an increase in temperature leads to an increased count of aggressive behavior. 2 groups of Juvenile Yellowtail fish were incubated at 15, 20, 22, 25, 30 degrees Celsius over the course of 7 days. Only on the final day were measurements actually made. After the experiment was conducted, the team found that that Juvenile Yellowtail fish were more aggressive in 25 C water compared to that of the lower temperatures [Sakakura: 1996]. This experiment is similar to ours in that we will be determining how environmental (tank) temperature affects the behavior of Betta splendins. The treatment group will be placed, and habituated, in an environment that is 21C and the controll will be placed, and habituated, in an environment that is 19 C. We hypothesize that the treatment group will have a higher overall count of aggressive behaviors. This is because, as a result of being placed in a warmer environment. Consequently, this increases the overall BMR (Basal metabolic rate) of the organism. As a result of this increase, it increases the activity overall for the organism as a whole, leading to more aggressive behaviors. [Brandao: 2018]

Materials and Method:
For the room temperature tank, 2 Betta fish were placed in a tank that was filled with water that was 19 C (One on each side of the white divider present). We then waited for an initial period of 5 minutes to ensure that the fish were acclimated to their environment. The white divider was then removed and the total number of the various forms of aggressive behaviors were counted for 1 randoMly selected Betta fish for 2 minutes. The divider was then placed back in the slot, where the fish then rested for a total of 5 minutes. 5 trials following this procedure were conducted. The same procedure was also followed for the experimental group, however, one fish was placed in a 21 C environment; again, 5 trials were conducted with the experimental group as well.


Results:
We were able to see that, on average, the treatment group placed in a warmer environment had a higher count of aggressive behaviors after the experiment was conducted (29.4 ± 3.97) compared to that of the controll group (16.2 ± 1.92). This notion is reinforced in figure 1. We can see in figure 2 that the average number of broadside movements as well as facing movements was higher in the treatment group (18.2 ± 2.77) and (11.2 ± 2.17) respectively than that of the controll group (9 ± 1.58) and (7.2 ± 1.09) respectively; additionally, we can see that both in the treatment group as well as the controll group, on average, the number of broadside movements was higher than the number of facing movements. After conducting a 2 sample paired t_test, we calculated a T value of 5.569 and a p_value of 0.000529.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that the treatment group would have a higher count, on average, of total number of aggressive behaviors committed. After conducting the experiment as well as the appropriate statistical tests, the 2 sample paired t_test displayed a value that is less than that of alpha. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis as there is statistical evidence to support the alternative. This is because, as a result of being placed in a warmer environment. Consequently, this increases the overall BMR (Basal metabolic rate) of the organism. Our results support our hypothesis as well as the previously mentioned studies since, on average, there were a higher number of aggressive behaviors counted for the treatment group compared to the controll group. As a result of this increase, it increases the activity overall for the organism as a whole, leading to more aggressive behaviors. [Brandao: 2018]. For future study, we could conduct this experiment not only with different species but we could also test other factors in the environment (i.e: light intensity, presence of a predator) and see how that influences the behavior of the organism of interest.
