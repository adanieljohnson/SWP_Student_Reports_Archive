Title: done with different levels of phosphorus treated to buck-weed, measuring their difference in root:shoot ratio.  

Abstract:
Plants adjust their growth pattern based on the environment by the property phenotypic plasticity, which could be shown through their root length:shoot length ratio. Phosphorus, a soil nutrient, is known to make plants allocate more biomass to the roots when deficient in soil. This experiment intended to investigate the effect of phosphorus on buck-weed’s root length:shoot length ratio. The null hypothesis that there are no difference in root length:shoot length ratio whether phosphorus is added could not be rejected, since there is no significent statistical difference. One explanation to the result is over fertilization of phosphorus in our test group. Further experiment could be done with different levels of phosphorus treated to buck-weed, measuring their difference in root:shoot ratio.  


Introduction:
Since resources are limited, plants change how they allocate resources based on environment conditions, adjusting their growth pattern based on the environment. This property is called phenotypic plasticity. One method to access plants’ change in growth pattern is through their root  length:shoot length ratio,  the amount of plant tissue that are invested in absorbing soil nutrients to the amount of plant tissue invested to collect solar energy. 
This experiment intended to investigate the effect of phosphorus on plant root length:shoot length ratio. As an essential nutrient for plant growth and reproduction, phosphorus is a nutrient absorbed by plants by their root from the soil. During plant growth stage, the biomass of plants increase proportionally with phosphorus absorbed, while plants with lower P allocated more biomass to roots than shoots[Kim:2016].  Buck weed is used in the experiment because it has easy and fast growth in the lab environment. We hypothesize that plants that are treated with phosphorus will have a smaller root length:shoot length ratio.


Materials and Method:
	Sixteen pots of plants were planted, where 8 are used as the test group and 8 were used as controll. All pots are watered with 100Ml liquid each day, where the test group is watered with 20% bone meal(phosphorus) water, while the controll is watered with pure H2O. After two weeks, two plants from each pot were harvested and cut apart into root and shoot. For each plant, the maximum lengths of the root and shoot were measured and the root:shoot ratio were calculated. Mean and standard deviation of root length, shoot length, and root:shoot ratio are calculated for the test group and the controll group. One-tailed t_test were performed between the test group and the controll group to determine if there is a significent difference(p&lt;0.05) between the test group and the controll group.


Results:
As shown in Fig.1, the average maximum root length of the test group is 49.9mm with a S.D of 13.07mm, while the average maximum root length of the controll group is 58.4mm, with a S.D of 18,37mm. As shown in Fig.2, the average maximum shoot length of the test group is 101.9mm with a S.D of 15.22mm, while the average maximum shoot length of the controll group is 120.3mm with a S.D of 19.61mm. Both the average maximum root length and shoot length of the controll group are higher than the test group. 
As shown in Fig.3, the average root length:shoot length ratio is 0.49 for the test group with a S.D of 0.13, while the average root length:shoot length ratio is 0.50 for the controll group with a S.D of 0.19. Although the ratio is slightly higher for the controll group, there is no significent difference between the average  root length:shoot length ratio between the two groups(t_stat=0.17, d.f=62, p=0.43).


Discussion:
The null hypothesis that there is no difference between the root length:shoot length ratios of plants treated with phosphorus and those treated without cannot be rejected. The none significent  difference between the average of the two groups(t_stat=0.17, d.f=62, p=0.43) suggests that 100Ml 20% bone meal each day for two weeks would not effect the plants’ allocation of root and shoot growth, compared to the plants that are only treated with 100Ml water. Since on average the controll group has longer root and shoot length than the test group, suggesting that the controll group has better growth than the test, the failure to reject the null hypothesis could be due to over-fertilization of the test group, where inappropriate amount of phosphorus added through bone meal. There is a threshold of phosphorus uptake for plants[Kin:2016]. Over fertilization could lead to inefficient absorption of other nutrients than phosphorus. Further experiments could be done using different levels of phosphorus concentration treated to buck-weed, measuring their difference in root:shoot ratio.
