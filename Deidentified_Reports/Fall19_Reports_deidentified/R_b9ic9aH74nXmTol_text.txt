Title: The Effect of Color on the Aggressive Behavior of Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Animal behaviors are unique to each species and have evolved over centuries to help organisms adapt and survive in their environments. Betta splendens have evolved aggressive behaviors towards members of its own species in order to gain an advantage in intraspecies conflicts. We set up an experiment dividing two blue Bettas and one red Betta into individual compartments of a tank. We then allowed intervals for them to see each other and display their aggressive behaviors, and counted the aggressive behavior of our test subject (the one blue Betta that was allowed to interact with the other two fish). We found that on average, the blue Betta displayed 15 aggressive behaviors towards the red Betta, and less than 11 aggressive behaviors towards the other blue Betta. We used a one tailed two sample t test to find that this difference was statistically significant.

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior, and uses observations of nature, lab experiments, and insights to understand why animals behave in certain ways. They also use theories of ecology, genetics, and evolution to try to determine how these behaviors developed over time. For example, Betta splendens have evolved aggressive behaviors towards members of their own species, or intraspecific behaviors. These include two categories of behaviors, broadside and facing, and are used to intimidate an opponent before engaging in combat. This aggression has likely evolved in male Bettas as a form of sexual selection in order to attract and “win” mates. Because of this reasoning, we wondered how the aggression of Bettas would change when faced with two different members of their species of two different colors. A study of Betta fish has previously shown that color positively alters the amount of aggressive behavior displayed by Betta fish (Grabowski, John: 2013). This means that Bettas of the same color are more aggressive towards each other than they are to those of different colors. We predicted that a blue Betta fish would be more aggressive toward another blue Betta compared to its aggressive behavior to a red Betta. This is because, if the aggression truly evolved to aid in sexual competition, a blue Betta is more likely to see another blue Betta as a sexual competitor because they have more in common than a fish of a different color. 

Materials and Methods:
We will set up a tank that is divided into three separate compartments, using a clear piece of glass and an opaque material as barriers. We will place one fish (two blue and one red) in each compartment, and give them about five minutes to adjust to their new surroundings. During this time, we observed each fish individually to note how they behaved in their isolated and relaxed state. After this time, we removed the opaque barrier, but kept the clear barrier, between the two blue Bettas, and observed and counted their aggressive behaviors for five minutes. This was used as our control data. We were specifically looking for six different aggressive behaviors, including pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, pectoral fins coming upright, opening of the gill covers, and the protrusion of a “red mane” created by the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane from under the gill openings. We then replaced the opaque barrier and allowed five minutes for each fish to relax in isolation. This allowed us to make sure that each trial did not have an effect on the following trials. We repeated this cycle twice more with the two blue Bettas, and then we followed this procedure with a red Betta and a blue Betta (using the same blue and red fish in each of the three trials) which we used as our independent variable. We used a one tailed two sample t-test to compare the mean number of aggressive behaviors by the blue Betta when faced with the other blue Betta compared to when it was faced with the red Betta.

Results:
When faced with another blue Betta, our test subject displayed an average of 10.67 +/- 1.25 aggressive behaviors. When presented with a red Betta, our subject displayed an average of 15.00 +/- 1.63 aggressive behaviors. We observed that the second blue Betta (the one who’s aggressive behavior that we did not count) was fairly submissive when faced against our test subject. We noticed that this second fish rarely ever displayed any aggressive behavior back at our test subject, and would often swim away from the glass barrier. On the contrary, the red Betta matched the aggression that our test subject displayed when they were faced against each other. The results of our one tailed two sample t-test were t=2.98, degrees of freedom=4, and p-value= 0.02.


Discussion:
Our p-value means that our results were significant; however, our hypothesis was not supported by our results. We predicted that the Betta fish would show more aggression toward a Betta of its own color, but our results show that the blue Betta showed more aggressive behavior toward the red Betta. Based on the previous study that I referred to earlier in this paper, this is not the result that normally is not observed in an experiment like this. However, this could likely be due to the fact that the second blue Betta was observed to show very submissive behavior while the red Betta matched the aggressive behavior of our test subject. If the second blue Betta showed more aggressive behaviors, it is likely that our test subject would have also displayed more aggression in order to match the behavior of its counterpart. A study found that Betta fish are more likely to be aggressive towards an unfamiliar “intruder” fish compared to its aggressive nature towards a familiar Betta (Alyan, Sofyan: 2010). This could support our initial hypothesis by comparing the blue to blue Betta behavior to the familiar fish from this study, and the blue to red Betta behavior to the unfamiliar fish from the study. Doing so would support our hypothesis, and the idea that Bettas use their aggression to gain an advantage in sexual selection.
