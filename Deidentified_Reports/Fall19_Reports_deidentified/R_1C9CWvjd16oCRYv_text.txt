Title: Effects of AzaGuard on Manduca sexta Development

Abstract:
This experiment evaluates the effects of AzaGuard, a type of insect growth regulator, on the common tobacco hornworm pest, also known as the Manduca sexta. It was hypothesized that the organisms receiving 8 drops of AzaGuard in their food would have a lower average mass than those in the controll group which only had water added. The null hypothesis was that there would not be a significent difference between average masses of the controll and treatment groups. To test this hypothesis, a treatment and controll group were created with four caterpillars in each. They were fed 10 grams of food, either with the AzaGuard (treatment) or with water (controll), and then observed and weighed daily while being kept at a controllled temperature. After data was collected for 13 days, a two-sample T-test was performed which revealed that the average masses between the controll and treatment groups were significently different. The tobacco hornworms that were exposed to AzaGuard all died before the observation period was complete, whereas all except one organism survived in the controll group.

Introduction:
A recent method of pest controll involves using substances that affect the growth and development of such pests. These are known as “insect growth regulators,” (IGRs) which typically only affect the growth of organisms. These method do not have to be toxic, but still threaten the survival of targeted organisms. Therefore, these method are important because they allow for a more environmentally conscious approach to pest controll [Tunaz: 2004]. Other pesticides, including insecticides, can negatively affect organisms other than the target, including humans. Chemicals in pesticides can mimic or antagonize natural hormones found in humans and can disrupt their body’s systems. Pesticides can also be toxic to other animals and vegetation in the environment [Aktar: 2009]. This study allows for more information to be gathered about IGRs which are a better alternative to pesticides when considering the impact on other plants and animals. The substance “AzaGuard” is one of these insect growth regulators and is the one used in the following experiment. It acts as an ecydsterone (20E) inhibitor which prevents molting, and therefore affects insect development [Johnson: 2016]. Its impact is observed on the Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm. Tobacco hornworms are not only a common pest within the United States but are often used as a model for various experiments in scientific fields due to their relatively quick development and large size [Kanost: 2016]. The hypothesis tested in this experiment is that the Manduca sexta organisms that receive 8 drops of AzaGuard, the IGR, with their food will on average have a lower mass than those that do not receive the IGR. The null hypothesis is that the AzaGuard will not affect organisms, and instead their average masses will be similar if not the same.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, the independent variable is the type of food (whether it contains AzaGuard or not), and the dependent variable is the mass of the organisms. The controllled variable, or the controll group, consisted of the caterpillars that did not receive any Azaguard added to their food, just water. To begin this experiment, the food and containers were prepared for the Manduca sexta organisms. Two four-cell containers were acquired, one labeled for the controll group and one for the treatment group, and holes were punched in them so the caterpillars could receive oxygen. On each container, the cells were labeled 1-4 so the caterpillars could be properly identified. 10 grams of food were placed in each caterpillar cell. For the controll group, the food was moistened with 8 drops of water using a pipette. For the treatment group, 8 drops of AzaGuard, an insect growth regulator, were added to each caterpillar’s 10 grams of food. The food was replaced as needed, and the container cells were cleaned of feces. Each day the masses of all 8 organisms were recorded, and any important observations were noted. When the organisms were not being observed, they were kept in an incubator at a controllled temperature. This experiment lasted for two weeks, and once all data was collected, a two-sample T-test was used to determine whether the means of the controll group’s and the treatment group’s masses were significently different. Another two-sample T-test was used to compare the overall increase in mass per day between the two groups. This was also done to see if the difference between the two groups was statistically significent. 

Results:
By the end of the experiment, all tobacco hornworms in the treatment group were dead. When they were close to dying, they would typically turn a black-ish color and becomes very small. While they were alive, these organisms were much smaller than those in the controll group. This is displayed by Figure 1, where the average mass of the treatment group organisms is consistently lower than that of the controll group each day. For example, by day 3, the average mass of the controll group was already 0.88g while the average mass of the treatment group was only 0.26g. The overall growth for the controll group was 36.6g while the treatment group only grew 0.38g in total. The average mass of the controll group during the entire two weeks was 6.07g, and for the treatment group it was 0.3g. With this data combined, a standard deviation of the mass results in 4.80g. A two-sample t_test was used to determine whether the overall difference in masses of the controll group and treatment group were statistically different. For each caterpillar in both groups, the initial mass was subtracted from the final mass. The two-tailed p_value that resulted was 0.03.  A second two-sample t_test was done, but this time the change in mass per day was looked at for each group. For example, the total mass of the controll group caterpillars from day 1 was subtracted from the total mass of the controll caterpillars from day 2, and so on. This is similar to what was done in the previous test, but this approach gives a more detailed look at the differences in masses by day and is therefore more accurate. This two-tailed p_value came out to be 0.006. The data from this t_test is displayed by Figure 2, which shows the increase in mass of each group per day. The overall mass of the controll group increases at a higher rate than the treatment group. Their slow growth completely ceases by day 11 when all organisms are dead. 

Discussion:
For the first t_test performed, the two-tailed p_value was 0.03 which is less than 0.05, therefore making the difference in masses between the two groups significent. The second t_test performed focused on the differences in overall masses from one day to another. The two-tailed p_value came out to be 0.006, which once again less than 0.05, making the controll and treatment groups statistically different. This second t_test relates to Figure 2 and shows the differences in masses for both groups. This graph essentially analyzes the rates of growth for the groups. The controll group’s growth frequently fluctuates, sometimes with big increases or even slight decreases, whereas the treatment group’s growth remains very minuscule only slightly fluctuates up and down. This means AzaGuard did significently affect the treatment group by inhibiting their growth and development. These results support the initial hypothesis that says the organisms exposed to AzaGuard will have a lower average mass than those that were not. AzaGuard, a 20E inhibitor, prevented the Manduca sexta from molting from their 4th instar larva stage (which is the stage the organisms were in when the experiment began) into their 5th instar larva stage. Therefore, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Ecydsterone is responsible for regulating the timing of molting, so as expressed by the results of this experiment, without it the organisms cannot continue to molt or develop [Johnson: 2016]. In a similar experiment, azadirachtin, the active ingredient in AzaGuard, was directly injected into migratory locusts, or Locusta migratoria. Like the results achieved with the Manduca sexta organisms, the azadirachtin inhibited molting and caused mortality. The stronger the dose of the IGR, the more severe the response [Sieber: 1983]. This is also consistent with the data above because a large dose of AzaGuard was given to the treatment group of caterpillars, and before the two weeks of observation were complete all the organisms had died. A second experiment studied the effects of azadirachtin on the Rhodnius prolixus, and focused specifically on how the IGR would affect molting. As with the experiment performed with the Manduca sexta, the growth of the Rhodnius prolixus was inhibited and they would not molt if their food contained azadirachtin. If the dose of azadirachtin was very high, the organisms would avoid feeding on the contaminated food altogether. This experiment also determined that if ecdysone was added to the food along with the IGR, the effects of azadirachtin would be offset, and the organisms would continue to molt as normal [Garcia: 1984]. This information could be used to adjust the method of a future experiment involving the Manduca sexta. One could modify the procedure to include the addition of ecdysone to the food to see how development would then be affected. The data in the performed experiment would be more accurate if same scale was used each day to weigh the caterpillars. Although this may not have largely impacted the data, some scales recorded more decimals places than others. When dealing with numbers so small, specifically when recording the masses of the treatment group organisms, a more detailed and consistent method of measurement is preferred. Another way to make measurements more precise in future experiments is to weigh the caterpillars at roughly the same time each day. This experiment should be repeated with the existing method. There was one outlier caterpillar in the controll group which was much smaller and died before the other controll group organisms. This affected any means or statistical tests it was involved in, including both figures and t_tests. If this experiment were to be repeated differently, the number of drops of AzaGuard should be modified. 8 drops had severe effects on the treatment group, quickly killing half of the organisms by day 3. Fewer drops should be used in the next experiment to see how rapidly and severely the organisms will be affected. Overall, this experiment is important because it shows the effectiveness of IGRs like AzaGuard on inhibiting insect development. IGRs act as an alternate solution to toxic, chemical-based pesticides which can have adverse effects on the surrounding environment [Tunaz: 2004]. Pesticides can disrupt the systems of nearby organisms and vegetation other than the target pest, whereas IGRs are more direct and have fewer negative effects on the ecosystem. This experiment shows that IGRs can disrupt specific systems, such as the growth process in the Manduca sexta, without harming non-target systems. They are an adequate method of pest controll, and a better solution when taking the entire ecosystem into consideration.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 Average mass of Manduca sexta per day. Each dot represents the average mass of all four caterpillars within their group (either controll or treatment). Because the means are plotted, error bars are included to represent the variability of standard deviation. This graph shows that each day, the controll group organisms have a higher average mass than the treatment group. The treatment group’s line ends once all four organisms are dead.

Figure 2 Increase in mass per day. This graph shows the overall growth (in grams) for each group per day. The controll group is represented by the dark blue line, and the treatment group by the light blue. Error bars are included to account for the standard deviation of the values. A two-sample t_test was performed, and the two-tailed p_value came out to be 0.006. All organisms in the treatment group were dead by day 11, so there was 0g of growth for the last 3 days. Once an organism died, their last recorded weight was used for the rest of the days that way the difference of masses between days would not be skewed.*************************************************************************
