Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone (JH) on the normal development and metamorphosis of the insect Manduca Sexta.

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
Hormones are key factors in both insect and mammal development. Hormones can stimulate a variety of cells, tissues, and much more processes necessary for development. In this experiment, the assessment of hormones on the further development of insects will be observed, specifically in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. This insect was used because it is easily accessible due to them already being local pests in this area. Lots of research has already been done on the Manduca sexta as well, which is also beneficial. The Order Lepidoptera includes butterflies, moths, and skippers. Manduca sexta are members of this order, but are more precisely identified as moths. Their life cycle tends to last between 39-48 days, give or take a few days depending on the diet and living conditions of the insect. The life cycle of a Manduca sexta is defined as a Holometabolous Life Cycle based on a few key components. The first is that they have four major life stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. The second is that the larvae and the adults do not resemble each other at all, meaning that during pupal metamorphosis there is a major restructuring of the body [Wake: 2019.]
During this experiment, the larva stage will be the main focus. The larva stage is split up into phases called instars. These five instars are based upon the amount of days and weight of the growing larva. Molting is when an insect’s epidermal cells excrete a new outer layer, causing it to move from larva to pupa to adult. These organizational effects of the insects body occur mainly due to the presence of important main hormones. Prothoracicotropic (PTTH), or sometimes referred to as Brain Hormone (BH), regulates the releasing of ecdysterone by the corpus cardiacum located behind the brain. Ecdysterone (20E) are a group of steroid hormones that are excreted by the prothoracic glands. Ecdysterone administers the timing of insect molting. Juvenile Hormone (JH) are another group of hormones formed from the corpus allata, glands located near the mouth. JH executes the type of molt produced during the development of an insect. JH and 20E work hand in hand during the development of Manduca sexta fluctuating between high and low levels of expression. JH levels are very low during the 5th instar, occurring right before pupating. Adversely, there is a rise in 20E that is fairly small. This rise is called the commitment pulse. This commitment pulse is reached when the caterpillar is ready to pupate based on size and amount of nutrients reserved [Wake: 2019.]
JH levels are extremely low before pupation, thus if an excess of JH was present within the Manduca sexta during this time, a commitment pulse would not be reached and the insects will not further develop into pupa/adults. An excess of JH in the system would not only inhibit development, but this prolonged larva growth would also cause the Manduca sexta to become larger than normal as it is “stuck” in its developmental phase. 


Materials and Method:
Two groups of Manduca sexta were utilized in this experiment: one controll and one treatment. Each 4-celled plastic container included four sections for each caterpillar to be placed into. Both containers included a plastic lid. To start, a “hole tool” was used on each cell of the container. It was used to create two breathing holes for each cell. After that, both containers were labelled with a sharpie, in order to differentiate between the two groups as well as the different caterpillars. Next, was the preparation of the Manduca sexta food. The difference between the controll and the treatment was the amount of hormone added to the food. The controll group included no hormone, so six drops of water were added to ten grams of Manduca sexta food, using a clean pipette and a scale. The food was then mixed thoroughly in a plastic square container with a spoon and then placed into one section of the controll group. This step was repeated three more times for the remaining cells in the controll group. Next, six drops of Juvenile Hormone (JH) was added to ten grams of Manduca sexta food, using a new pipette. The food was mixed and placed into one section of the treatment group. This step was repeated three more times for the remaining caterpillars in the treatment group. The food was kept in as big of a clump as possible so that it would not dry out very easily. The Manduca sexta were then weighed (for day 0) and placed into each cell, for a total of eight caterpillars. The Manduca sexta were stored in an incubator for the remainder of the experiment. 
Everyday, for fourteen days, each Manduca sexta were weighed in grams using a scale provided. The data was then recorded on an excel sheet. Each day, the cells were cleaned of waste (poop). If the food was dried out or fully eaten by the Manduca sexta then it was to be replaced, being cautious of whether it was acquiring JH or not. If two or more caterpillars died, then an extra controll or treatment group was created and administered as well. 
The overall difference in growth of the caterpillars are being compared so a chi-squared test will be utilized to determine its significance. 


Results:
Significant differences were observed between both the controll and the treatment of JH on the growth of Manduca sexta. The controll group, with food that had nothing manipulated, showed overall less total growth than those treated with JH. The controll group did not exceed 9.5 grams (Figure 3), while the treatment group grew up to 17.47 grams (Figure 2). Although the controll started off growing faster than the treatment, once day nine was reached, there was a slight decline in the weights of the original controlls. The replacement controlls began to decline in their weight after day eleven (Figure 3). The treatment however, showed slow beginning growth but began to increase greatly after day nine. With that being 
In order to calculate the significance, the normal deviation and the abnormal deviation had to acquired for both the controll and the treatment group. Overall there was a p-score of 0.0016, producing very significent data. 
Through the experiment there were also a few significent visual observations that occured. The controll had a much more vibrant blue color than the treatment group. Two dark brownish red pupa’s also developed in the last two days of the controll group. 


Discussion:
Based on the data, the hypothesis that added Juvenile Hormone in the food of Manduca sexta will inhibit development and also cause the larvae to become larger than normal was supported. This is due to JH levels needing to be low during the 4th and 5th instar stages, so that a commitment pulse can be reached and so that it may change into a pupa/adult [Wake: 2019.] Because JH levels were manipulated in the treatment group, the larvae showed a significent difference in weight from the controll. The larger weight in the treatment displayed how the excess of JH in the system, prolonged its development, causing it to continue to keep growing, but not molt. Molting occurred in two of the caterpillars in the controll group, representing what would happen when JH levels are normal and low. The results are beneficial in the real world when considering pest controll. Some insect growth regulators (IGRs) rely on overstimuation and/or the of blocking specific hormones that are involved in insect development [Tunaz: 2004.] Because Manduca Sexta, specifically, are pests as larva, JH would need to be inhibited by IGRs. This would ensure that the insects do not stay as pests for a longer time than needed, since JH prolongs larva development. 
During the experiment, there were a few modifications that could help further the future study of Manduca sexta. The first, and most obvious, problem was the death of the two Manduca sexta within the first controll group. Because this occurred a replacement group was added to the data starting on day seven, so that there would be enough data to accurately produce an analysis. Although the caterpillars replaced were a part of the controll group, the new group were at instar stages much further than all of the caterpillars that was started with. This means that the controlls were not completely equivalent due to the living conditions that the new controll group had undergone being different up until day seven. Being able to utilize two groups of controlls and two groups of treatments from the start of the experiment would allow this problem to be solved. This would prevent the need for more groups to be obtained, as there will always be at least four still living that could be observed for experimentation.
