Title: Effects of Precor Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta Mass Development

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a nectar collecting moth, commonly referred to as a tobacco hornworm. It is a member of Lepidotera Order. The average mass of a tobacco hornworm is 11.3 grams +/- 1.5 [Doucet: 2015] but pupae and adults do not grow so size is determined by the size of the hornworm prior to molting [Davidowitz: 2006]. The Manduca sexta follows 8 stages of development: egg, 1st instar larva, 2nd instar larva, 3rd instar larva, 4th instar larva, 5th instar larva, pupa and adult moth. The development cycle of the moths is 39 to 48 days. The Manduca sexta is controllled by 3 hormones: PTTH, 20E, and JH. The Precor used in this lab is a juvenile hormone. The last larval instar includes the secretion of the PTTH and 20E are inhibited by a juvenile hormone. In early instars, the juvenile hormone prevents the hornworm from successfully molting but as the JH esterase inactivates the juvenile hormone so that pupation can occur [Davidowitz: 2006]. When there is a lack of or no JH, tissues are able to change into the next metamorphic stage [Browder: 2001]. The JH acts as the driving determinant on an insect’s ability to molt. The JHE enzyme works in insects to strongly push them towards molting by blocking the juvenile hormone and allowing the PTTH and 20E to effectively transform the tissue [Sanburg: 1975]. Insects are models for showing endocrine systems and the release of hormones throughout development. [Rowland: 2017] In this lab, the interest is in how mass development of the Manduca sexta is different when juvenile hormone, Precor, is added to the food source. This study shows how juvenile hormones impact the growth and development of the Manduca sexta hornworms measured through mass. The hypothesis tested in this lab states that when 5 drops of Precor are added to each insects’ food source, their average mass will be less than that of the controll group at the end of 2 weeks. 

Materials and Method:
The procedure is carried out with two groups: a controll group and a treatment group. There are eight hornworms used in this experiment; each of the two groups contained four hornworms. Manduca food was measured out, 10 grams for each of the eight hornworms. The four pieces of food for the treatment group were measured out and using a dropper, five drops of Precor were added to each set of food. The worms and food were placed in separate, labeled containers (a plastic box with four separate openings). Two holes were punched into each of the individual habitats to provide air for the hornworms.  The four pieces of food for the controll group were measured out and five drops of water were added to each. The worms and food were placed in separate, labeled containers. The containers follow the same format as those used for the treatment group. The hornworms were weighed daily for two weeks as they developed. The hornworms were kept in an incubator set to room temperature for the duration of the experiment. The food was changed out when it became dry and the containers were cleaned daily. The statistical test used will be a 2-sample t_test to test for the differences between mass measurements for the two groups. The p_value used to test the hypothesis is 0.05.

Results:
The mass of each individual hornworm was measured daily and this can be seen in Figure 1. It is necessary to note that caterpillar 1 in the controll group died between day 12 and day 13. There is a large range of variability in the controll group, as seen in Figure 2. The rate of change (mass day 15 minus mass day 1 divided by 15 days) in mass can be seen for each caterpillar in tables 1 and 2, table 1 referencing the controll group caterpillars and table 2 referencing the treatment group caterpillars. Through observation, it can be seen that there is a difference in the color in the treatment and controll groups. The treatment group has a lighter, whiter tint to them while the controll group is more of a blue green color.  A 2-sample t_test was run using the difference in mass between day 1 and day 15 for the two groups (controll and treatment). (t_stat=0.9834, d.f.=6, p=0.1817)

Discussion:
Based on the 2-sample t_test run above, the p_value is significently larger than our significance level of 0.05 so we will not reject our null hypothesis. The null hypothesis stated that when the juvenile hormone, Precor, is added to the insects’ food, the treatment group will weigh less than that of the controll group. While the results found were not completely consistent with this, the p_value is significent, and we therefore are unable to reject our hypothesis. In a large sense, juvenile hormone causes for a smaller mass in tobacco hornworms. Juvenile hormones are effective in inhibiting the molting stage and keeping insects from developing and growing further. From this test, we can say that the juvenile hormone did have somewhat of an effect on the growth development in terms of mass for the tobacco hornworms. There is not a huge change in the data between the treatment and controll group mass and this can be traced back to the mass being finalized prior to pupation and adult phases [Doucet: 2015].   In future studies, it would be important to have larger testing groups to account for potential mortalities. In this data set, one of the controll hornworms died which may have significently skewed the data. The test should also last for longer so that it can be seen if molting does occur in the treatment and controll groups as the tissue transforms from the hormones [Sanburg: 1975]. Other research shows that the removal of the JH via JH esterase around the 5th instar is critical to Manduca sexta reaching the pupation period [Browder: 2001] and later removal of JH can cause a longer latency period [Dominick: 1984]. In the experiment completed in this lab, JH was fed to the hornworms on a regular basis which would cause a longer latency period because there is more JH than JHE in the hornworms. JH has an inhibitory effect on the release of PTTH and thus blocks the ecdysone’s secretion [Safranek: 1980]. The experiment we completed had hornworms that were not able to pupate when the JH was added to their food, and this is due to the inhibitory effect that the JH has on the PTTH release.  Other research agrees with results that were found in this lab, stating that JH is required for pupal development and differences in the amount of JH in prepupal development can cause dramatic effects [Jones: 1985]. Overall, through research and experimentation, it has been seen that JH levels can act as an inhibitor to pupation and therefore can stunt mass development in some ways for Manduca sexta hornworms.
