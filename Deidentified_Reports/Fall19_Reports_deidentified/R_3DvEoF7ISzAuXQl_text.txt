Title: Effect of Low Salt Stress on Photosystem II in Spinacia oleracea.

Abstract:
Plants, like all other life forms, are sensitive to environmental factors like pH and salt stress. Changes to these factors can easily damage or destroy plants. Unlike most animals, plants rely on photosynthetic activity to generate energy. Through a complex of photosystems, like photosystem II (PSII), plants are able to generate chemical energy from light. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of low salt stress on PSII activity in Spinacia oleracea. To test this, a controll group was compared to an experimental group of Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts containing a 0.1 M NaCl solution. Control and experimental groups were placed in sunlight and percent change absorbance (as an indirect measurement for activity) were recorded with a spectrophotometer. The experimental group had a statistically significent increase in PSII activity as compared to the controlls. This result was not expected, but possibly explained by understanding that low concentrations of NaCl may increase PSII activity and that high concentrations of NaCl may be more likely to decrease PSII activity. 

Introduction:
In order for humans to survive, it is essential that we inhale copious amounts of oxygen while exhaling carbon dioxide. The equilibrium of oxygen and carbon dioxide in blood is delicate and must be maintained to prevent the blood from becoming acidotic or alkalotic. In order to have adequate oxygen in the ambient air, humans rely on plants to preform photosynthesis and to convert of carbon dioxide and sun light to from sugars and oxygen as a waste product. Photosynthesis is a multistep process involving the transfer of electrons along an electron transport chain between photosystems that convert light energy. The first of these photosystems in the electron transport chain of plants is photosystem II (PSII). PSII absorbs light at about 680 nm and ultimately helps to convert the light energy into chemical energy. Additionally, previous research has shown that PSII is easily affected and denatured by variables like pH and temperature [Weng et al.: 2004] [Thompson et al.: 1988], thus preventing it from converting light energy. Consequently, other research has also suggested that PSII is negatively affected by the presence of high cation concentrations [Lu: 2002]. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of low salt stress on PSII activity. For this experiment, Spinacia oleracea is an ideal model organism as it is readily available, and chloroplasts are easily isolated from the leaves. We predict that if salinity is increased in experimental groups then they will demonstrate a lower percent change in absorbance when compared to controll groups. 

Materials and Method:
To test this hypothesis, five medium spinach leaves (veins removed) were obtained and ground with grinding buffer until a thick paste was formed. The thick paste was strained with cheesecloth to separate liquid from debris. 200 μl of the filtered liquid was then transferred to a storage microtubule and the remainder was placed into a chilled centrifuge tube and spun at 200 x gravity; 1200 rpm at 4 degrees Celsius in a centrifuge for three minutes. The supernatant was then removed from the centrifuge tube leaving a pellet at the bottom. 50 Ml of the liquid solution was then centrifuged again at 1,000 x gravity; 2800 rpm for ten minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was then removed and grinding buffer was added to resuspend the pellet. The resuspended pellet was determined to have the highest concentration of chloroplasts to debris. Eight individual samples were then created to serve as the experimental, controll, and negative controll groups. Control groups contained 5.9 Ml of water, 100 μl of chloroplast suspension, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP and 2 Ml of buffer. Experimental groups contained 5.4 Ml of water, 100 μl of chloroplast suspension, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of buffer, and 0.5 Ml of 0.1 M NaCl. Negative controlls contained the same reactants as experimental or controll group minus the chloroplasts. The absorbance of each reaction was measured at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer at time=0 minutes. The reactions were then placed in light (2.28 lumen/m) for 20 minutes. The absorbances were then re-recorded at 20 minutes. Percent change of absorbance was then calculated for each reaction and compared between experimental and controll groups. A two-sample t_test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
The controll group had an average percent change in absorbance of 17.31 ± 4.062% and the experimental high salinity group had an average percent change in absorbance of 62.28 ± 8.236% (Figure 1) (t=8.47, d.f.=4, p=5.31E-4). The experimental salinity group had an obviously light color after 20 minutes when compared to the controll group which appeared dark blue.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment do not support the biological hypothesis. Instead, the results support the alternate hypothesis that low salt stress would increase the percent change of absorbance when comparing the experimental group to the salt free controll. The increased activity in experimental groups was statistically significent when compared to controll groups. This result was not expected and differs from previous research that showed salt stress decreases PSII activity [Lu: 2002]. ¬¬This result may be explained by the concentration of NaCl added to experimental reactions (0.1 M). This concentration was lower than other previous research and may suggest that low increases to salinity of about 0.1 M actually increase PSII activity and that at a certain threshold of NaCl concentration PSII decreases. This idea is supported by a previous study that found low ion concentration increases may actually increase PSII activity and at the expense of photosystem I (PSI). This means that PSII activity is temporarily increased, but PSI activity would decrease [Baker: 1978]. Further study is required to better understand the effect of salt stress and increased salinity on PSII. In the future, it would be reasonable to repeat the previous experiment with varying NaCl concentrations such that there is a range of low, medium, and high salt stress. It could be expected that low concentrations of NaCl would contribute to increased PSII activity and that higher concentrations would decrease PSII activity. These findings are still relevant as densely populated urban areas often use granulated NaCl in winter months to melt ice from roadways. The salt accumulates over a few months before being washed from the roads. Once rinsed from the roadway, the salt enters the surrounding topsoil where it is readily absorbed by plant life and this salt stress is known to cause osmotic stress on plants [Davison: 1971]. It is possible that these plants would initially demonstrate increased PSII activity as a result of increased NaCl concentrations. However, it is possible that over many years salt concentrations would become too high thus inhibiting PSII activity. Further research on NaCl and PSII activity is required and necessary to assess the potential long-term effects of salt stress on plant life.
