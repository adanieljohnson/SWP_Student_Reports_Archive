Title: The Effects of Blue and Red Light on Electron Transfer Between Photosystems II and I using a Hill Reaction

Abstract:
The ability of autotrophic plants to capture food energy from light energy in the process of photosynthesis involves many complex steps. A well-known colorimetric assay that determines the rate of electron transfer between photosystems II and I of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is called the Hill reaction. As the artificial electron carrier and dye DCPIP becomes reduced, the solution will lose its color and absorb less strongly, which can be measured using a spectrophotometer. It was hypothesized that incubation under blue light will more quickly reduce the DCPIP electron carrier, than either white light or red light. Based on the results of this experiment, the hypothesis was rejected because there was no statistically significent difference between blue and white light incubation, nor was there one between red and white light. From the data collected in this experiment and similar ones, it is possible that the reaction itself was unsuccessful due to reasons that do not involve the reduction of DCPIP or photosynthesis. Rather, given the overall increases in absorbance for all types of light over the course of 30 minutes, it is more likely that the reaction did not work because of the failure to isolate effective chloroplasts.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from CO2 and H2O. This is a critical characteristic of plants that makes them self-sufficient organisms or autotrophs. The process itself is very complicated to follow and has many components but three distinct steps. The system of interest in this lab is the light-dependent reactions and more specifically the energy transfer between photosystem I and II. These two systems create high energy products by reducing molecules such as NAD+ into NADH. Consequently, this molecule acts as a carrier of electrons that can reduce oxygen into water. Since it is difficult to quantify and determine specific information about this flow of electrons between the two photosystems an easier method to utilize is the Hill reaction. This reaction utilizes an alternative electron acceptor/carrier DCPIP that in its oxidized form is blue in color and absorbs in a photospectrometer at a lambda max of 600nm. When reduced, it becomes colorless, which will thus indicate the flow of electrons and the reduction rate. It would be interesting to see how altering the type of light available to plants would affect the rate of electron transfer. Other groups have looked at the effects of utilizing red and blue light to alter photosynthetic rates in spinach, radish, and lettuce [Yorio: 2001]. Their results showed that photosynthetic rates were greater under white light light than under red light with or without supplemental blue light. After discovering this information, it was interesting whether photosynthetic rates would be better with blue light alone, rather than red light and blue. Would higher intensity blue light increase the rate of electron transfer between photosystem II and photosystem I? We hypothesize that there will be more chloroplast activity in chloroplasts incubated under blue light than red light because blue light has a higher intensity which could potentially increase the rate of electron flow.

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, first the chloroplasts needed to be isolated from spinach leaves. A mortar and pestle, beaker, as well as three 50 Ml centrifuge tubes were cooled on ice. The veins of 4 spinach leaves were removed, the leaves were rinsed with water, and then crushed and grinded with mortar and pestle. To aid with making the leaves into a thick, dark green paste, two portions of 20 Ml of grinding buffer were utilized. This mixture was then strained using 3 layers of cheesecloth, with the filtered solution going into a chilled beaker. This solution was then transferred to a 50 Ml conical tube so that it could be spun down in a centrifuge at 200 x G. The supernatant of this solution was decanted into tube B, leaving the pellet undisturbed. Tube B was centrifuged under the same conditions and its supernatant was placed in the 50 Ml conical tube labeled C. The pellet from Tube B was resuspended by adding 20 Ml of grinding buffer and stirring gently. This was the solution of chloroplasts utilized for testing. To begin the assay, 13 large test tubes were labeled and the spectrophotometer was turned on and set to 600 nm. Three replicates of each trial were shown for the purpose of data analysis.

To start the assay, 100 uL of the chloroplasts were added to all tubes, mixed and placed into cuvettes for the ease of testing. The blank solution prepared as described above was utilized to equilibrate the spectrometer. Immediately upon adding the chloroplasts, the absorbances of all samples were taken in order to obtain a time of t=0. After reading, the blank and samples 4-6 were placed under white light, samples 1-3 were placed under normal (room) light, samples 7-9 were under blue light, and samples 10-12 were under red light. After 10 minutes, the absorbances were read again and their change in noted. This process was repeated two more times to obtain data for at least 30 minutes. In order to determine if there was a statistical difference in absorbance between the blue and red light, a two sample t_test was utilized. 


Results:
After taking all of the required measurements, the percent changes in absorbance were recorded for each ten minute time interval. As noted in Figure 1, most percent changes in absorbance were close to zero and demonstrated minimal change in absorbance. This was the case for the positive and negative controlls, white light and normal room light, respectively, as well as blue light and red light. There was no statistical significent difference in absorbance observed between red light and white light (p=0.519) after 30 minutes, nor was there one observed between blue light and white light (p=0.988). Moreover, there was not a statistically significent difference in absorbance between red and blue light (p=0.091).


Discussion:
We hypothesized that using higher energy light, the blue light, would cause a decrease in absorbance faster than red light because the higher light intensity would cause electrons to be transferred between photosystems II and I faster. Given the fact that there was little change absorbance between each time point, we have to accept our null hypothesis that blue light does not increase photosynthetic rates in spinach leaves. Yorio and his colleagues had previously found that white light had increased photosynthetic rates faster than red light with or without blue light supplementation [Yorio: 2001]. From the data collected, it was observed that there was not a statistically significent difference between white light and red light nor the white light and blue light. This directly contradicts the data collected from the Yorio group, which did find a difference in photosynthetic rates. Consequently, it could be possible that blue light does have an effect on photosynthetic rate, and rather the error lies within the method of this experiment. Since neither the positive or negative controll decreased in absorbance, and overall increased in absorbance for every type of light tested, it is possible that the reaction itself was not set up properly in that reagents needed to have been added in a specific, appropriate order. The Hill reaction is a commonly employed method to test the reduction rate of electron carriers and thus photosynthetic rates, so it is likely that there was an error in how the experiment was conducted. Perhaps, the chloroplasts were not properly isolated during the first stage or that the chloroplasts themselves were defective. 
Moreover, it is possible that the experiment did not work because of delayed reading times of the cuvettes. Some cuvettes could have been reacting longer than others, which would have increased the error. If this experiment were to be repeated again, minimizing the time between readings for each trial would be ideal. Also, it would be beneficial to see if these rates changed over the course of a longer period of time than 30 minutes. The Yorio group had collected their data over a period of 21 days [Yorio: 2001]. Perhaps to truly see the effect, we would have needed to have seen the reaction over the course of a longer time span. If the reaction had worked, perhaps we would have seen a statistically significent difference between the blue light and red light. This observation could have had profound influences on how to maximize solar energy. Greenhouses could have added blue lights to help increase photosynthetic rates. Additionally, these results could have been applied to changes in climate change. A group found that with increased ozone exposure, plants had slower reaction to increases in blue light intensity [Dumont: 2013]. With climate change and increasing ozone exposure to plants on Earth, more investigations into the effects of blue light on our vital autotrophs need to be explored.
