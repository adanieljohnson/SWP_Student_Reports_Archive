Title: Impact of IGR Juvenile Hormone on Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca Sexta)

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Hormones are a critical aspect of the endocrine system. They controll many important aspects of the body such as growth and development. The development and growth of insects is dependent on the presence of certain hormones such as juvenile hormone, ecdysterone, and PTTH. This experiment studies the impact of juvenile hormone on The Tobacco Hornworm. The Tobacco Hornworm is considered a garden pest because it consumes large amounts of leaves of solanaceous plants. This causes many problems including defoliation. A more significent issue presented by this species is the economic impact. The Tobacco Hornworm consumes large amounts of tomato, tobacco, potato crops, and eggplant. [Byron: 2017] [Kaufman: 2017]. Research done on the Tobacco Hornworm could be very significent for the agricultural and food industry. The life cycle of the Tobacco Hornworm is roughly 19-23 days. It includes five instar larval stages and a pupa stage before reaching full development as an adult moth [Anon: 2019]. The insect receives neural and hormonal signals throughout development that tell the body how to respond. A large amount of insect development, molting, formation of pupa, and emergence of adults is controllled by three hormones; PTTH, ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH) [Anon: 2019]. During the final larval instar, there is a spike in the secretion of PTTH [Nihjout: 1974] [Williams: 2974]. PTTH is a second order hormone that stimulates the secretion of ecdysterone, triggering metamorphosis. Studies have shown that a decrease in JH levels is required for this spike in PTTH to occur. This experiment focused on the impact increased levels of juvenile hormone, IGR, have on the development of the worms. Under normal conditions, JH levels stay fairly high up until the fourth larval instar. Near the end of the fourth larval instar, the JH levels start to drop slightly. Since IGR is naturally present throughout the majority of the worms developmental stages; it was hypothesized that the growth and development of the worms will not be impacted by the injection of IGR. 


Materials and Method:
Eight Tobacco Hornworms were provided and separated into two groups of four. They were stored in a temperature regulated environment at a constant temperature of 26.5 degrees celsius. Every day for two weeks, each worm was fed 10 grams of food. The food from the previous day was discarded before providing the fresh food each day. The food given to the first four worms was injected with 9 drops of IGR hormone. The food given to the second four worms is injected with 9 drops of water. The weight of each caterpillar was measured and recorded daily. A two sampled two-tailed t_test will be run to determine any significent trend in results. 


Results:
Throughout this experiment, no clear difference was observed regarding the size of the caterpillars in relation to the treatment of IGR hormone. This observation is reiterated through the t_test’s P-value of 0.57483. The mean of the IGR treated group was found to be 11.29 +/- 0.96. The mean of the controll group was found to be 9.7267 +/- 4.11. The data collected each day showed no evidence that the IGR treated worms were growing at an accelerated rate. According to Figure 1, there is a slight acceleration in the growth of the IGR treated caterpillars around day 8. The P-value of the t_test contradicts this. Towards the end of the experiment, several caterpillars in the controll and treated groups slightly decreased in weight. This trend can be seen in Figure 1 on day 13. On day 6, a slight color variance was observed between the controll and hormone treated groups. The IGR treated caterpillars were notably lighter in color when compared with the untreated caterpillars. This trend persisted throughout the end of the experiment. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment align with the proposed hypothesis. It was hypothesized that the presence of IGR would have no significent impact on the growth of the caterpillars. The P-value of the t_test is also significently higher than the acceptable value. This implies that the trends in the data cannot be confirmed to be a result of the juvenile hormone. Any variations instead are most likely due to chance. While fluctuations in the caterpillars weight occurred from day to day, a consistent trend was not able to be observed. The apparent trend that is visible in Figure 1 is most likely a consequence of one abnormally small caterpillar in the controll group. This worm was almost 7 grams lighter than all of the other caterpillars, therefore, should be considered an outlier. Other than this worm, there was almost no difference in weight between the controll and IGR treated groups. This conclusion is supported by the high standard of deviation found in the controll group. Aside from the slight color variance observed in the IGR treated group, there was no observed difference between the two experimental groups. According to some biological research, the IGR treated worms should have been significently smaller than the controll group. During natural insect development, JH levels are high during early pupal stages/development. The JH levels start to decline as the insect develops, allowing the insect to begin developing adult characteristics as it nears pupation. When the insect is injected with JH in latter stages of development, the insect’s growth and development is negatively impacted. [Liu: 2001] [Chen: 2001] This trend was not observed in the Hornworm study. This could be due to various experimental factors such as; the concentration of JH used in the food, variances in the amount of food consumed by each of worm, and a limited amount of observational time. Another study conducted found similar observations in the color variance between the JH treated group and the controll group. In this experiment, the effects of a juvenile hormone were observed on various larval stages of mosquitoes. It was observed that any insect that pupated successfully maintained an “albino” color and eventually died. It was concluded that this observation is due to the presence of JH not allowing the cuticle to fully form, harden, and darken [Bridges: 1977] [Cocke: 1977] [Olson: 1977] [Mayer: 1977]. In the Hornworm experiment, the worms did not die, but the albino color was observed. This could also be due to the concentration of IGR used. The Hornworm experiment has significance for the agricultural world as Tobacco Hornworms are pests that pose a threat to crop success and cultivation. Although other experiments have had different results, based on the results of this experiment, IGR is not a worthwhile pesticide agent.
