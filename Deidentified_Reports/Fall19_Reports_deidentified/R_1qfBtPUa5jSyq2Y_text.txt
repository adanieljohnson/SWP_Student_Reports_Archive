Title: Effects of excess juvenile hormone on the development and growth of Manduca sexta larvae

Abstract:
not needed for this lab

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is a moth present throughout the majority of the Americas and is commonly considered a pest. With four major life stages (egg, larvae, pupa, and adult), this insect is termed holometabolous and in order to progress to the ensuing life stage, the organism must molt. Molting is the process of an insect shedding its old outer layer and replacing it with a newly secreted cuticle. This development in the life of a Manduca sexta is controlled by the following three hormones: prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). This lab is specifically interested in the latter two and their unique relationship involved in an insect’s growth. Depending on the changes in the relative levels of these hormones, JH and 20E control the molting and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta [Johnson: 2019]. There is extensive evidence to suggest that a decrease in the concentration of JH occurs prior to the process of molting [Nijhout: 1974]. With this knowledge in mind, the lab is interested in understanding how essential the precision of these relative levels of hormones is to the growth and development of the insect. What would happen if the relative levels of these hormones were artificially adapted during vital stages of the insect’s development? Due to the insect’s classification as a pest, this information could be vital to developing new methods of pest control as well as accumulating a greater understanding of how these insects grow and develop. This classification as a pest is one of the main reasons that the Manduca sexta was selected as the subject organism for this lab. Other reasons include the ease of obtaining them, their relatively short life cycle that is easy to track and control, and the minimal resources required to keep them alive. Specifically, in this lab, we were looking at the effect that excess JH would have on a 4th instar larva’s growth. Keeping in mind the fact that after this instar, JH levels normally drop drastically, we predict that adding JH to counteract this decrease will have detrimental effects on the larva’s ability to grow, thus decreasing its weight, and will most likely result in death. 

Materials and Methods:
This lab required eight Manduca sexta in the 4th instar larva stage that were split into two groups of four organisms: the control group and the treatment group. Each individual organism was placed into its own plastic cell and provided with ten grams of food that had been mixed with seven pipette drops of a specific liquid. For the control group, the liquid mixed with the food was water and for the treatment group, the liquid was IGR juvenile hormone (concentration of 1:1250). All eight Manduca sextas were stored in an incubator for two weeks and every day, the food and organism were checked and replenished if necessary. Data was taken by measuring the mass of each organism daily and recording any observations about their movement and general habits. After data was collected, a one-tailed, two-sample t-test was used to compute statistics for analysis. 

Results:
Over the course of the experiment, both the control and the treatment groups grew significantly from their original sizes. At the beginning, the size and growth rate of the two groups were very similar until day 6. At this point, the larvae in the control group began to grow more and faster (seen in Figure 1). The average growth rate of the treatment larvae was significantly lower than the growth rate of the control larvae (t-stat = 0.509, df = 28, P = 0.307). Standard deviations for these two groups were both high (5.13 for the control group and 4.57 for the treatment group). The colorations of the two groups of larvae were also different: the control group was a vibrant green, while the treatment group had lost its vibrancy and was a much paler white pigment. Another difference between the two groups was there movement. The control group exhibited relatively normal movement, while the treatment group was visibly more lethargic and lacking energy. In general, both the treatment and control groups ate the same amount of food each day and produced around the same amount waste per day. There was one anomaly larva in the control group (Manduca sexta #3) that refused to eat its food and, thus, was much smaller and less energetic than the other larva. 

Discussion:
The results from this experiment supported the hypothesis that the addition of excess juvenile hormone into the food supply of 4th instar larva would stunt the growth of these organisms compared to a group whose food supply was diluted with water. As pointed out in other studies, the presence or absence of juvenile hormone dictates the differentiation in larva and pupal stages of the Manduca sexta [Kiguchi: 1978]. This experiment adds to this extensive collection of data because it shows that by reversing the expected drop in juvenile hormone that normally occurs around the 6th day [Johnson: 2019], the growth rate of the larvae is significantly decreased. This is because the comparative levels of JH and 20E are not what the organisms expect and, thus, they cannot grow as they intended to. The changes in appearance and movement of the larvae can most likely also be explained by this excess JH. To further this study, more trials need to be recreated with a larger sample size of Manduca sexta in order to decrease the risk of skewed data from anomalies. This experiment demonstrates the importance of hormones in the development of insects and shows how precise the concentrations of these hormones need to be in order to produce the desired results.
