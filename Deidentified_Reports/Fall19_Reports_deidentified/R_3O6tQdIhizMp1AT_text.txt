Title: Effects of Varying pH Conditions on Resource Allocation in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity, or the phenomenon in which plants change the way they allocate resources due to changing environmental conditions, can be studied under the presence of varying pH conditions in soil. To demonstrate resource allocation, Vigna radiata, commonly referred to as Mung Beans, were planted in soil watered with concentrations of 3.5 pH, 7.0 pH, and 8.5 pH. Since most plants thrive in slightly acidic to neutral pH soils, it is hypothesized that average root to shoot length and weight ratios will be smallest in Vigna radiata watered with a neutral concentration compared to those watered with highly basic and acidic concentrations. Three groups of Vigna radiata, consisting of five plants each, were identically prepared respective to their assigned pH conditions. Each plant was routinely monitored for two weeks and harvested at the conclusion of maturation to determine average root to shoot length and weight ratios. Neutral soil yielded the smallest average weight root to shoot ratio and average length root to shoot. An ANOVA test was conducted to determine statistical significance between environments. Studies of phenotypic plasticity aid in the determination of optimal plant growing conditions and environments. 

Introduction:
Plants adapt and interact with one another in an ecological community where they are rooted. These interactions depend on obtaining essential resources, such as sunlight and water; however, these resources are limited. This is in part due to the cost of extraction of these resources and resource allocation [Johnson: 2019]. Resource rich environments are often reflected in a plants resource acquisition and growth. If resource availability is altered due to natural or artificial intervention, plants will adapt to the environment to stay alive. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson: 2019].
Standard pH conditions for successful plant growth is between 5.0 and 6.5. pH is a common measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. On a scale 1-14, a pH of 7 is neutral, below is acidic, and above is basic. The pH of soil impacts how a plant will grow; strongly acid soil will not uptake nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, whereas basic soil will not uptake zinc, iron, and copper [Bower: 2005]. Natural occurrences in nature such as acid rain or exposure to calcium carbonate in arid or dry environments alter pH. Both low and high pH’s reduce nutrient uptake and symbiotic relationships. This is due to the alteration of plant cells that disrupt internal mechanisms and cellular respiration [Yi-Shen: 2018]. Under acidic and basic conditions, plants lack health and fitness. Under extreme pH conditions, necessary nutrients for plant survival are near absent in the soil. To compensate, plants must compensate and expend energy to the growth of their roots and shoots. However; most plants do not survive long under acidic and basic conditions, thus, decreasing fitness. Hence, soil conditions play a direct role on plant attributes such as root and shoot growth.	
Mung beans, or Vigna radiata, are an ideal model organism to study resource allocation in in varying environments as root and shoots are readily available. Mung beans grow best in fertile, sandy loam soils, with a pH in the range of 6.3-7.2. soils [Bower: 2005]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that Vigna radiata prepared under neutral conditions will have smaller root to shoot ratios compared to those prepared under acid and basic conditions as less energy will be expended changing physical characteristics to obtain nutrients for survival.


Materials and Methods:
A total of fifteen Vigna radiata plants were prepared. Seeds were soaked 24 hours in advance to planting. Pots (4in. x 6in.) were obtained, filled with soil, and watered with the addition of 500 mL of miracle grow. Nine indentation holes were made in each pot, and 2-3 seeds were placed into the holes. Plants were labeled and divided into three groups containing five plants each: acidic, basic, and neutral. Additional water and Miracle-Gro was added before being placed in a greenhouse. 
	All plants were routinely watered daily with 50mL of respective sustenance (concentration pH 3.5 water, concentration pH 8.5 water, or neutral water). Plants remained in greenhouse for two weeks before harvesting. After the plants matured, they were separated from the soil. One plant was randomly selected from each pot to collect data from. Roots and shoots were measured and weighed for each plant from all respective pH conditions. Average root to shoot length and weight was collected and analyzed using an ANOVA test.


Results:
The average root to shoot length was analyzed and displayed in Figure 1. Acidic conditions yielded an average ratio of 0.713 cm (0.302 cm), neutral conditions yielded an average ratio of 0.583 cm (0.246 cm) and the average ratio in basic conditions yielded a value of 0.761 cm (0.234 cm). Neutral conditions produced the smallest root to shoot length. An ANOVA test produced an insignificant p-value of 0.558. 
	The average root to shoot weight was analyzed and illustrated in Figure 2. The average root to shoot weight ratio in acidic conditions yielded an average of 0.887 g (0.547 g), neutral conditions yielded an average ratio of 0.436 g (0.153 g), and the ratio average in basic conditions yielded a value of 0.742 g (0.324 g). Average root to shoot weight was smallest in plants grown in neutral pH conditions. An ANOVA test produced an insignificant p-value of 0.198.


Discussion:
At the conclusion of the experiment, it was found that the initial hypothesis that the average root to shoot ratio of plants grown in neutral conditions would be smaller than those grown in acid and basic conditions, was not supported. Without the application of a statistical test, the data collected demonstrates trends that do support the hypothesis. The average ratio for both weight and length was lowest in neutral pH plants. Plants grown in acidic conditions yielded a higher average length ratio compared to basic conditions, while basic plants yielded a higher average weight ratio compared to acidic conditions. However, an AVNOA test was conducted and produced a statistically insignificant result. This suggests that varying pH conditions have no effect on phenotypic plasticity. 
	These findings go against accepted literature in ecology. Studies have found that Vigna radiata grow best in slightly acidic conditions (pH=6.3); therefore, it would be expected that root to shoot length and weight would be larger [Bower: 2005]. In acidic conditions, Mung beans can grow roots to help reach desired nutrients [Munns: 1979]. Yet, there is a caveat that this pH is fairly close to neutral. The acidic pH used in this experiment was 3.5 (very low), hence, plant growth was not expected. No evident literature suggests Mung beans would grow well in basic conditions. 
	Error in this lab can be attributed to poor choice of pH concentrations and growing environment due to limited knowledge of Mung bean preferences. However, this study advances known knowledge in the field that can be used to optimize plant growth. Studies of phenotypic plasticity can advance the agriculture sector though the determination of optimal plant growing conditions and environments.
