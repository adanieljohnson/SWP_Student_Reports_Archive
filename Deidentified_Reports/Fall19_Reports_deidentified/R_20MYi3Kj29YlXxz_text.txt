Title: Hormone Regulation in the Manduca Sexta: Addition of the Precor Juvenile Hormone and How it Stunts the Molting Process

Abstract:
Not necessary for this lab.

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is an insect that feeds exclusively on Tobacco plants. These insects are categorized as pests because they feed on, and kill large quantities of tobacco leaves, doing major damage for tobacco farmers [Brinkmann: 2008]. Because they are pests, we are able to easily use them as test subjects. The average amount of time that it takes the larvae of a Manduca Sexta to reach the pupa stage is estimated to be 18-23 days. There are certain types of hormones that conduct and inhibit the molting process of the Manduca Sexta, these are called Juvenile Hormones (JH).  Juvenile Hormones regulate types of molt during its development, such as the hormone Precor [Johnson: 2019]. Since Manduca Sexta are often used as a test subject, they can be used in order to study the effects of Juvenile hormones on their bodily systems. During an experiment that compares larvae treated with JH to a control group, the independent variable would be the amount of Juvenile Hormone added to the food of a treatment group, whereas time and weight of the growing larvae would be the dependent variable. We hypothesize that this experiment will provide data to show that, with the varying addition of Juvenile Hormone (JH), the larvae should take a longer amount of time to reach the pupa stage than the control group.

Materials and Methods:
In order to test our hypothesis, we used two different groups in this experiment, the control group and the treatment group. In order to set up the experiment we began by acquiring 2 plastic containers that each had 4 compartments in them, one compartment for each of the 4 Manduca Sexta larvae to have their own space. We poked small holes in each of the compartments to allow air to enter the space. We labeled the first container for the control group, each of the larvae compartments getting a name- C1, C2, C3, and C4. We then labeled the other container for the test group and also gave each compartment a name- T1, T2, T3, and T4. In their space, we gave each of the larvae 10g of food along with 5 drops of their perspective treatment in order to keep the food from drying up: 5 drops of water for the control group and 5 drops of Precor Juvenile Hormone for the treatment group. After the initial setup, we came back into the lab daily for the next 15 days. The containers were cleaned out and the larvae was weighed each day and we also changed the food whenever necessary. During the first week, the treatment group received 5 drops of JH, while the second week they received 10 drops. After obtaining the data we used a paired, one-tailed T-test to find the p-value of the data and compare the control group and the test group. 

Results:
After repeatedly weighing both groups of Caterpillars for 15 days, we were able to collect enough data to observe and make inferences about the validity of our hypothesis. Figure 1 shows each of the daily average weights for each group and how they compare to each other. After comparing our two testing groups, one control and one treated with the juvenile hormone Precor, we found that they grew at a similar rate. The mean for the control groups tended to be higher for the first nine days, while the last six days tended to be lower in comparison. The standard deviations for the experiment tended to follow the same trend as the mean in reference to the control group and treatment group. The average for the ending weight for the control group was 6.8127g while the ending average for the treatment group was 9.5427g, which was significantly greater than we had expected. The average standard deviation for the control group was ±1.9329 and the average for the treated group was ±1.9969. After obtaining this data, we used a paired one-tailed T-test to find the p-value, which was 0.3724.

Discussion:
When learning about juvenile hormones and the effects of it in the Manduca Sexta, we found that one of its functions is to inhibit the type of molting that takes place throughout the caterpillar’s life span. After learning this information, my groupmates and I made the hypothesis that with additional amounts of Juvenile Hormone (JH), the larvae would take a longer amount of time to reach the pupa stage than the control group. We had hypothesized that the test group would be much smaller than the control group, but after observing and carrying out the experiment we found very little difference between the two when comparing their means. Then, from comparing the mean weights of each of the test groups and placing them in a paired one-tailed T-test (shown in Figure 1), we were able to determine that the experiment had a statistically insignificant result. Due to the fact that it was statistically insignificant we were able to infer that the likelihood of the results was due to chance. The p value, being significantly larger than 0.05, shows that there is not enough significance between the results from the control and treated group to show that the groups were different from each other statistically. If this experiment was to be done on a larger scale- that is with more larva, for a longer period, and with more addition of Precor hormone- then the hypothesis we initially made might be supported. There are many factors that could have helped to lead to this unexpected outcome, such as inaccuracy in the addition of Precor or unequal amounts of food given to the larvae. If the food had been replaced each day, along with a fresh amount of Precor placed in it, then the results might have been more conclusive. Another possible hurdle in this experiment could have been due to the Precor hormone itself. While there are elements of Juvenile hormone that are inhibitory, there are also other aspects of it that encourage growth in the larvae. Juvenile Hormone is often even used by the bodily processes in an insect to cue transformation within it and initiate maturation [Riddiford: 2008], but this is not what we had expected when first creating our hypothesis. By looking at our p value and comparing our results, we can make an informed decision to reject our initial hypothesis. Now that we have acquired more knowledge about the use of JH, the results make clear sense and bring our experiment to a logical end.
