Title: The Effects of Precor (Methoprene) on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The main objective of this study is to see both the observational effects that precor (a type of juvenile hormone) has on Manduca sexta larvae. It is hypothesized that larvae given doses of precor will grow at a slower rate and be observably unhealthy compaired to that of larvae given water in their food. Eight larvae will be used (four controll and four experimental). The controll larvae were given four drops of water to 2 and eight drops of water to the other 2. The experimental larvae were given four drops of precor to 2 and eight drops of water to the other 2. These doses were given on an every-other-day basis. The experimental results show that, precor did little to nothing observable throughout the 5 instar stages of Manduca sexta, but it is likely that there would be effects in molting and in metamorphosis.  

Introduction:
 Manduca sexta is an insect in the order lepidoptera [Sadava: The Science of Biology]. Three hormones act on the development of this insect: Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH or BH), Ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) [BIO 114 Laboratory Manual]. This experiment will be looking at the effects on Manduca sexta development, based on different dosages of Methoprene (precore) (a type of juvenile hormone). Juvenile hormone is produced in declining amounts from the corpus allatum. When juvenile hormone reaches a low enough level (after fifth instar lava) the caterpillar can molt into a pupa [Sadava: The Science of Biology]. Methoprene is a growth regulator that regulates the type of molt during development and multiple functions in adult insects. Hormones are commonly used as insecticides, so it is valuable information to know their effects in different doses. This is especially true for Manduca sexta, since they are large pests in their larval stages, causing a significent amount of defoliation of important crops. Manduca sexta are great subjects for experiments like these that study immune response because they are easily collected and can be analyzed up to their last instar larva stages [Kanost, 2004]. The independent variables in this experiment are the amount of food and water each caterpillar will receive, as well the amount of precor (predetermined based on caterpillar). The dependent variables are the physical observations and mass of each caterpillar. It is hypothesized that if more Methoprene (precor) doses are added to Manduca sexta, then they will grow at a slower rate and will therefore weigh less and appear smaller.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta first instar larva caterpillars were obtained. Four caterpillars were used as controll given 10g of food each with 4 drops of water to two (controll #1 and #2) and 8 drops of water to the other two (controll #3 and #4). The other four caterpillars were given 10g of food each with 4 drops of Methoprene for two (experimental #1 and #2) and 8 drops of Methoprene for the other two (experimental #3 and experimental #4). These food + hormone/water mixtures were restored every other day. The mass of each caterpillar as well as general observations were taken daily. The independent variables were the amount of food, water and Methoprene each organism received (predetermined based on individual). The dependent variables were the physical observations and daily mass of each caterpillar. A two tailed t_test was used to determine significance of the daily mass data collected between (4 drop H2O & 4 drop Methoprene; 8 drop H2O & 8 drop Methoprene)

Results:
The results of differing amounts of precor and water added to Manduca sexta are summarized in figure 1. As is shown, the general trends in this graph show that there was very little difference in growth among the different Manduca sexta groups. The trials were consistent throughout the two week time span. The mean of the 4 drop H2O controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the 4 drop precor experimental group (t_stat=0.20, d.f.=16, P=0.842). The mean of the 8 drop H2O controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the 8 drop precor experimental group (t_stat=0.28, d.f.=16, P=0.784).

Discussion:
The results conclude that a significent difference in both samples exist, therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The reasoning for this is due to the fact that both two sample t_test p_values were greater than 0.05. The hypothesis formulated was flawed due to the fact that it stated: if more Methoprene (precor) doses are added to Manduca sexta, then they will grow at a slower rate and will therefore weigh less and appear smaller. Biologically speaking this does not follow the true effects of Methoprene (JH) since it does regulate larval growth but rather, effects are only shown after the fifth instar stage (Beckage 1982). Additionally, temperature and air availability plays a large role on the Manduca sexta growth pattern (Grunert 2015). This means that there are quite a bit of influences on larva development that this experiment did not totally take into account. Some possible sources of error in the experiment were that caterpillars air quality were lacking if placed on the bottom of our two apparatuses, due to the fact that for the first several days the air holes were blocked by the apparatus on top of them. The visualization in Figure 1. Shows that there was no observable difference between the amount of water or precor added to food, and that there was no observable difference between whether the Manduca sexta were given water (controll) or precor (experimental). With this being said, there were some observational differences in the final days of this experiment. The larva that was treated with water appeared to be of a brighter blue color and more mobile, while the larva that was treated with precor appeared ot be of a duller blue color and less mobile. The simple explanation for this is that precor’s effects were just beginning to show. In the future, this experiment could be replicated, yet carried out to molt formation to see observable differences in molt timing between the controll and experimental groups.
