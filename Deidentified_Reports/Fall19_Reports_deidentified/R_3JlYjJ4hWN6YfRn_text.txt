Title: Effects of JH on Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
No abstract

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is a type of moth commonly found in the Southern United States. While in its larval stage, Manduca Sexta is a small, bright green worm, known as the “tobacco hornworm”. The larva will go through a series of five instars before reaching pupation, going through a different molt each time, and throughout these instars sees fluctuation in its levels of certain hormones that help the larva throughout development. One of these hormones is known as juvenile hormone, which inhibits promotion of development in the larva and keeps it from developing into a mature adult as it goes through the molts in each instar stage before the final one (Subramanian, 2016). Just before the final instar stage, the larva will see a decrease in the amount of juvenile hormone it secretes, as it is now ready to pupate into a full adult. The development of Manduca Sexta is important because when in its larval stage, the worm is seen as a pest (Pavuk, 2009). It feeds off of certain farmland crops, most notably tobacco plants. In the southern US, tobacco is a staple crop and the feeding habits of Manduca Sexta are negative and harmful to the farming economy in the area. Adding juvenile hormone to the diet of controlled hornworms will alter their growth and will cause the pupa to ultimately fail and the worm will not develop into a moth. 

Materials and Methods:
The independent variable for this experiment was the amount of JH put in the food of the Manduca Sexta, while the dependent variable that it altered was the development of the larva over time. The controlled variables that may have also played a part in the experiment was the amount of food given to the larva, as well as the temperature of their environment. For the first step, eight larvae were collected, and then separated into two groups. One group of four was used as the control group, they were given ten grams of food with no additional JH added. The other group was the treatment group, they were also given 10 grams of food, but with 6 drops of the JH hormone added and mixed in with their food. Next, the habitats for the larvae were created. Two 4-cell plastic containers were taken and had two holes punched in each cell to provide air for the subjects. The holes were punctured through the sides of the cells, not the top. The cells were then labeled to make sure to know which hornworm was which as observations were recorded over time. The larvae were then added to their assigned cells and the food was collected from the container and weighed out for each worm to receive ten grams along with their assigned amount of water or hormone, depending on the group. The food was stirred into large clumps to keep it from drying out faster, and then the drops of food or hormone were then added as it was placed in the cell. The hornworms were then weighed to get their starting weights for the experiment and start the observations. For the next fourteen days, the hornworms were checked everyday to see their progress and record observations. The subjects were taken out of their cells and weighed on scales to monitor growth. The cells were also checked to see the current condition of the food that was left. If there was no food, or if the food had dried up, it had to be replaced. The cells were also cleaned out if there was any waste inside them. In the case that a subject had died, they were not replaced unless a significant number of the hornworms had died. For example, a second control group was introduced and observed once two of the original four were dead, but there were no more treatment hornworms introduced after the death of one. 

Results:
Significant differences were observed between the control group results and the treatment group results. Looking at the weights from the final day of observations, the control group had 6 members with a mean average of 4.86 grams with a standard deviation of 1.01 grams. A second group of four control hornworms were added halfway through the experiment after the death of two subjects from the original group. The treatment group had 3 members with a mean average of 11.05 grams with a standard deviation of 8.67 grams. The treatment group only had three members after the death of one from the group early on, but was not replaced. From a mere glance, it appeared that the data would be significantly different from the large difference in means. A trend seen in all of the control subjects is the drop in weight in the last few days of the experiment, which can be seen in Table 1 and Table 2 below. On the opposite side of that, the treatment group never saw any type of drop or decline in weight the entire time of the experiment. Moving onto a more provable form of evidence, there was the statistical test that was used. We used a chi-squared test of independence with a 95% confidence interval to see if there was a true statistical difference between the groups. The test provided a p-value of .0014, which was lower than the significance level of .05, rejecting the null hypothesis and showing that there was a significant difference between the groups. 

Discussion:
After rejecting the null hypothesis, we can see there is a significant difference in the control groups and the treatment group, meaning that the juvenile hormone had an impact on the development of the larva. Our group’s hypothesis seems to be proven relatively true. The effects of the hormone can be seen in both the numbers of the experiment and the physical details of our hornworms. Taking a look back at the data will show that the treatment group grew much larger than the control groups, some of which being upwards of around twice as large as the control ones. This shows that juvenile hormone could potentially play a part in determining the final size when the hornworm develops into an adult (Mirth, 2014). The control group saw a drop in weight a few days before the end of the experiment. This drop is normal as the larva excretes some of its own body fluid to prepare for pupation (Joesten, 1981). None of the treatment group experienced this drop, meaning none of them were ready for pupation. There were physical differences between the groups as well. All of the treatment hornworms were a different color than the control groups. All of the treatment group was a paler shade of green than any of the control groups. The biggest difference between them was the pupation. Some of the control hornworms actually pupated around the time the experiment. With more time, the hypothesis could have gotten a more complete conclusion to see if the treatment group ever did pupate, but while it is unsure if the pupa failed, it was certainly delayed and behind all of the control hornworms and showed an effect of using the juvenile hormone. This experiment could be taken and applied to something such as the use of pesticides. In the event that tobacco hornworms become a serious threat, research would look into what could help to eliminate some of them. In this instance, the use of juvenile hormone in pesticides would not be effective, as it would prolong the larval stage, which is the only time that Manduca Sexta is a pest. More tests could be done to see if the results of this experiment are supported, or if with a much larger sample size, the results could be different and there would be little or no difference in the two groups. In this experiment however, it was statistically proven that juvenile hormone altered the development of the Manduca Sexta larva.
