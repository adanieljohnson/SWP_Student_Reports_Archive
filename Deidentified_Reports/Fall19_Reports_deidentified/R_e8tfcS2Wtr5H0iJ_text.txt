Title: Effects of E20 on Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The hornworm Manduca sexta caterpillar resides in North Carolina with a short life span. The passage of one life stage to the next requires molting, resulting in 8 stages. The insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and emergence of adults are all controlled by three hormones.  Prothoracicotropic is produced by the corpus cardiacum and regulates the release of ecdysterone by prothoracic glands. Ecdysterone (E20) is produced by prothracic glands and regulates the timing of molting. The juvenile hormone is produced by the corpus allata and relates the type of molt during development [Johnson: 2016]. Larvae may feed on unripe, green fruit, leaving large wounds and exposing the fruit to opportunistic plant pathogens. The Manduca sexta is a pest at its larva stages before pupating. Once the pupal cell is excavated, the prepupal stage transitions into the pupal stage as the insect’s cuticle hardens and darkens, forming the pupa [Li: 2014]. Our null hypothesis was that if we inject the caterpillars' food with seven drops E20, then the caterpillars would grow at the same rate as the controlled caterpillars and would stay the same. Because the group initially thought that the ecdysterone was a juvenile growth hormone, our alternative hypothesis was that if we inject the caterpillars' food with seven drops of E20, then the caterpillars will grow at a faster rate  than the controlled caterpillars that were just fed with water.

Materials and Methods:
We fed the Manduca sexta caterpillars 10 grams of moistened nutrients daily and gave four of them the ecdysterone hormone seven drops daily. We gave the other four caterpillars water for their food to remain moist. We replenished the food and cleaned the containers when needed be. We observed the mass daily to determine change in mass from the start of the trial to the end. The caterpillars were kept in a temperature controlled incubator. Our statistical test was a one tailed t-test to compare the difference in mass between the tested caterpillars versus the controlled caterpillars. The independent variable in our experiment was the ecdysterone hormone as that was the variable that we tested as the dependent variable was the mass of the caterpillars over the course of fourteen days. The controlled variables were the caterpillars who were not treated with any hormone and had seven drops of water added to their food portions while the constant variables were temperature of the environment, the mass of the food given, and the seven drops of the hormone in their food.

Results:
After the fourteen days, we found that the total change in mass for variable one was 0.01g, variable 2 was 0.01g, variable 3 was 0.01g, and variable 4 was 0.01g. The total change in mass for control one was 0.12g, control 2 was 8.5g, control 3 was 6.47g, and control 4 was 8.6g. In general, control 3 grew more rapidly than any other caterpillar, treatment or control. By day 13, all of the treatment group died and the controlled group remained growing. The average total change in mass for the variable was 0.01g and the average total change in mass for the control group was 5.92g. In general, the control group grew more than the treatment group. We found a p-value of 0.012 for the one-tailed t-test. The average mass for the variable was 0.09g with a standard deviation of 0.07 and the average mass for the controls was 3.24g with a standard deviation of 4.25.

Discussion:
We found that overall the mass of the controlled variables grew larger and more rapidly than the treatment group. Because the treated caterpillars showed little to no change, we came to the conclusion that the ecdysterone hormone was a blocker hormone rather than a growth hormone as we had predicted. Because the p-value was 0.012, we reject the null hypothesis that nothing would happen. However, because we did not see a growth in the variable groups either, we have to reject the alternate hypothesis as well. Because the ecdysterone was a blocker, the caterpillars did not grow and some rather shrank. This would contribute to how the variables all died out after 12 days, so we did not have data for their masses by day 13 and day 14. As a new alternate hypothesis, we would see that the ecdysterone hormone would block the growth of other Manduca sexta in another experiment as well. If we were to replicate this experiment, we would not inject seven drops of the 20E into the variables’ food as it may have been too concentrated causing the inevitable death of the caterpillars. Also, we noticed that two of the caterpillars did not have a hole poked into their section of the container which means we may have inhibited their airflow and oxygen intake which may have also led to the death of the two variable caterpillars. In addition, the caterpillars feasted on plants outside of the laboratory and  larvae can compensate behaviorally for the deleterious effects of induced plant responses [Van Dam: 2000]. Therefore, we should give the caterpillars food that can also impact their growth and/or their behavior so that it is in a more normal growing environment. Overall, the ecdysterone did not promote growth in the hornworms.
