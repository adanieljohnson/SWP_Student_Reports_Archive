Title: The Development of Manduca Sexta when Juvenile Hormone is Increased.

Abstract:
	The main objective of this experiment was to determine what effects Juvenile Hormone had on the insect Manduca Sexta during its development. We hypothesized that the introduction of Juvenille Hormone (JH) would slow the growth during development, and not allow for the caterpillar to reach its adult stage as a moth. The Manduca Sexta is a pest as an insect so determining what hormones stunt its growth would be valuable in creating pesticides. We had a control group that was given water and food, and we had an experimental group that was given food and precor (Juvenile Hormone). We continually massed our caterpillar’s to determine growth. We determined that Juvenile Hormone had no effect on the growth of the Manduca Sexta, and we were unable to determine whether JH would stop metamorphosis to the adult stage because our experiment was not long enough. There is no correlation between growth and increased Juvenile Hormone because JH is constantly at a relatively high level in the Manduca Sexta until it is ready to transition to its adult stage [Johnson: 2019].

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is an insect that relies mainly on two hormones to control molting (Ecdysterone E20 and Juvenile Hormone JH)[Johnson: 2019].The Manduca Sexta is very useful in analyzing development because of its large size [Kanost: 2016]. The insect is a caterpillar in its larva state and a moth in its adult state. When the Manduca Sexta is a larva they are pests, but when they are adults they are not. Many insecticides utilize hormones therefore it would be beneficial to know the effects of different hormones. The hormone E20 regulates the timing of the molt as well as other adult functions. The hormone JH, produced in the corpus allatum, regulates the type of molt, in other words, JH maintains the Manduca Sexta’s larva state until it has developed enough to become an adult. When there is a decline in Juvenile Hormone the caterpillar begins metamorphosis and begins to take on adult traits [Johnson: 2019]. If we add precor (methoprene, a juvenile hormone) to the Manduca Sexta’s food then the Manduca Sexta will grow slower, and not be able to grow to the adult stage. The growth of the caterpillar would be the dependent variable, the amount of precor in the food would be the independent variable, and a group of caterpillars given only food and water would be the control.

Materials and Methods:
	For this experiment we had two groups of caterpillars with four caterpillars in each group. We gave our control group food mixed with water. Two control caterpillars received four drops of water in their food, and two caterpillars received eight drops of water in their food. We gave our variable group precor mixed with food. We gave two caterpillars four drops of precor in their food, and we gave the other two caterpillars eight drops of precor in their food. We would store the caterpillars in individual containers in a temperature regulated fridge, and we would continually return to lab to feed and mass our caterpillars. For the analysis of our results we will use a two sample T-test.

Results:
During our experiment the Manduca Sexta from both the control group and the experimental grew at relatively the same rate. If you look at figure 1 and 2 on day five and six the caterpillars that we gave precor appeared to be growing slower, but on day seven they began to grow faster than the control group. There was no significant difference in growth. The Manduca Sexta that received precor did appear to move in a more sluggish manner than the control group, and the experimental group had a slightly lighter green color. The mean of the control group was not significantly different than the mean of our experimental group so we fail to reject the null hypothesis (Group that received 4 drops of assigned liquid: t-value: 0.280345, df: 16, Two Tailed p-value: 0.782) (Groups that received 8 drops of assigned liquid: t-value: 0.016412, df: 16, Two Tailed p-value: 0.98). 

Discussion:
Our experiment did not support our hypothesis which was that if we add Juvenile Hormone to the Manduca Sexta’s food then they will not grow as fast and they will not reach the adult phase of their life. We were unable to determine whether the Manduca Sexta would reach the adult part of its life because our experiment was ended before our caterpillars could reach their final instar. Our control group didn’t even reach their adult stage. Also, the growth of our experimental group was not significantly different than the growth of our control group, which is evident in figure 1, 2, and their p-values (4 drops: 0.782 and 8 drops: 0.98). This means that there was no effect on the caterpillars growth due to adding precor to their diet. This could be due to the fact that the Juvenile hormone is kept constant until the larva is ready to molt to their adult form, when JH levels drop that is when the larva is signaled to begin metamorphosis [Nijhout: 1975]. JH does not have an affect on the growth of Manduca Sexta. Juvenile Hormones determine the type of molt and whether or not to trigger metamorphosis. When given Juvenile hormone it merely delays or stops metamorphosis [Safranek: 1980]. This fact would support part of our hypothesis, but there is no way to tell from our results. The next step we would take in this experiment would be to run the experiment again, but this time allow for enough time to pass for the caterpillars to reach their final instar where they would molt. We would also want to find a hormone that could possibly cause the growth of the Manduca Sexta to slow, possibly E20 because this controls the timing of the molt not the type of molt. Overall, our hypothesis was rejected, and we failed to reject the null hypothesis.
