Title: Effect of Water Temperature on Betta Splendins Aggression

Abstract:
Different animals exhibit both interspecific and intraspecific behaviors in response to their environment. In this experiment, we looked at agonist or aggressive intrapecific behaviors in Betta splendins. B. splendins typically live in warm climates and do best in warm temperature water. Increased temperature has also been shown to increase aggression and violence in other ectotherms as well as in B. splendins. We hypothesized B. splendins would exhibit more agonist behaviors in warmer temperature water. Although B. splendins in warm temperature water exhibited more agonist behaviors than controll individuals, this finding was not significent. This may because water temperature was outside B. splendins’ ideal temperature range for both groups. Little is currently understood about temperature and animal behavior and this link will become increasingly important to study as global temperatures change. 

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior and it focuses on how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. Different animals have different behaviors that evolve over time to match their environment. Two categories of animal behaviors are interspecific and intraspecific. Intraspecific refers to behaviors within a species and interspecific refers to interactions between different species. In this experiment, we will be observing intraspecific behaviors in Betta splendins. B. splendins are a good study species because they exhibit many distinct behaviors, specifically agonist or aggressive behaviors [Johnson:2019]. We will be looking at two types of agonist behaviors, broadside movements (when the fish is turned to the side of its opponent) and facing movements. We want to see how these behaviors are displayed in different water temperatures. B. splendins typically live in warm climates and do best in warm temperature water [Forsatkar: 2016]. Increased temperature has also been shown to increase aggression and violence in other ectotherms [Magoulick: 1998] as well as in B. splendins [Forsatkar: 2016]. However, more studies are needed to understand the relationship between water temperature and aggression in ectotherms and B. splendins specifically. As the earth’s temperatures continue to rise, it is critical to observe how increasing temperatures effect the behavior of different animal species. We hypothesized B. splendins would exhibit more agonist behaviors in warmer temperature water. This may be a result of a variety of different biological factors such as temperature increasing overall metabolic rate in ectotherms, which could increase overall activity and aggression [Biro: 2009]. However, more work still needs to be done to understand these biological links more closely. 

Materials and Method:
Two tanks will be set up, each with 3 chambers separated by clear and opaque dividers. In both tanks, one chamber will have a male fish, the next chamber will have a different male, and the third will be empty. One tank will be filled with room temperature water at 19oC and the other with heated water around 21oC. First, the behavior of the isolated males in the room temperature water will be observed to determine which is the more aggressive fish. The fish were observed for 5 minutes and one fish was then chosen to be the main study subject for the room temperature water trials. Next, the opaque barrier between the two male fish in room temperature water was removed so the two fish could see each other, but could not make physical contact. The number of each of the following behaviors: pelvic tail flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, pectoral fin upright, spreading gill covers, and red mane was observed and recorded for 3 minutes. The opaque divider was then returned and the fish were allowed to rest for 5 minutes. The following steps were repeated 3 additional times for a total of 4 trials in the room temperature water. Then, the same exact procedure was repeated another 4 times using a male fish in warmer temperature water as the main study subject and measuring its responses to seeing the more aggressive fish from the room temperature trials. Number of aggressive behaviors of the warm temperature and controll fish were summed and compared using a two-sample t_test. 

Results:
As displayed in Figure 1, the fish kept in warmer temperature water did on average exhibit more agonist behaviors per trial, however, this difference was not significent. The controll group displayed an average of 17.75 +/- 1.5 agonist behaviors and the warm water group displayed 18.5 +/- 4.2. As shown the standard deviation was larger for the warm water group. The p_value was 0.3741 which is not significent, our conditions for significance were p_value less than 0.05 (N=4, d.f.=6, t_stat =0.3361). 



Discussion:
Our hypothesis that male B. splendins would exhibit more agonist behaviors in warmer temperature water compared with males in room temperature water was not supported by our results. Although males in warm water did exhibit more agonist behaviors on average, this finding was not significent. One reason for this finding may have been because we used two different fish as the main study subjects for the experimental and controll groups. Due to our very small sample size, individual differences in personality and behavior may have greatly impacted our findings. Repeating this study with a larger sample size or using the same fish as the main study subject in the room temperature and warm temperature water could yield better results. Another reason for our results may have been that our water temperature was not high enough for the controll or experimental group. B. splendins’ typical habitat is closer to 25-26oC as opposed to 19 and 21oC which are the temperatures we used in this experiment. In previous studies they used higher temperatures, closer to the B. splendins’ ideal temperature range, to measure temperature effects [Forsatkar: 2016]. Our overall temperature for both groups may have needed to be higher to elicit a response to the temperature change. Another reason may be that temperature variation does not have a large effect on B. splendins’ aggression and they may be just as aggressive across various temperature ranges. Further, studies could replicate this study with a broader range of temperature conditions and with different ectothermic species. Even today, little is understood about the real effects of temperature and it’s influences on different animal’s behavior. As our global climate change it becomes increasingly important to monitor animal behavior in varying temperatures.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This figure shows the difference in the average number of agonist behaviors between B. splendins kept under controll conditions (19oC) and warm temperature water (21oC). The sample size for each group was 1 and these fish were observed over four trials each. The error bars represent +/- 1 standard deviation. *************************************************************************
