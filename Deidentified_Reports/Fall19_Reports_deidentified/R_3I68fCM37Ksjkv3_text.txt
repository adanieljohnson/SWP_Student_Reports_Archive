Title: Intraspecific agnostic behaviors by Betta splendins based on size

Abstract:
Agnostic behavior is commonly seen intraspecifically, where two members of the same species show aggression towards each other. These behaviors often stem from sexual selection and mating preferences but may also be to claim territory [Bronstein, 1981]. Betta splendins are one of many species that display aggressive behaviors to other males. Because the fish show agnostic, intraspecific behaviors towards other members of its species, it can be inferred that Betta are able to easily recognize other Betta fish, as well as themselves [Takeuchi, 2009]. In this experiment, different sized fish cutouts were placed in the tank with a Betta to determine the level of aggression displayed towards small, medium, and large fish. It was hypothesized that, because the Betta fish can easily recognize its own species, a mock fish that is most similar in size to the real fish will trigger the highest amount of agnostic behaviors. It was found that there was a shorter recognition reaction time to the small fish cutout, as well as a higher number of aggressive behaviors shown. This suggests that the more similar the fish is in size, the more likely the Betta is to recognize it as a member of its own species, which leads to more aggressive behavior. 

Introduction:
Recognition among species is crucial for animals to mate and reproduce as well as determining territories and hierarchies in a group. Intraspecific behaviors, behaviors done within a single species, are often indicative of species recognition, often times leading to agnostic behaviors. These behaviors are present in the Betta splendins fish. Male Betta fish are known to be aggressive towards other Betta males. These behaviors can be categorized based on the movement of the fish’s body, either broadside or facing movements, and color changes in the fins [Alton, 2012]. Broadside movements in Betta fish include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements, which are even more threatening, include expansion of the pectoral fins and opercula, and protrusion of its branchiostegal membrane [Robertson, 1974]. If two Bettas are competing for a nest site, they will first show these agnostic behaviors, in order of increasing aggression, and then fight until one fish proves dominance [Bautista, 2019].
Before displaying signs of aggression, it is important for Betta fish to easily recognize its own species. The fish must determine if it should expend energy on displaying aggressive behaviors [Alton, 2012]. If the Betta recognizes the other fish as another Betta, aggressive behaviors will likely be performed. It is also shown that Betta fish are highly aggressive towards their own reflection [Takeuchi, 2009]. This recognition of self, and of other Betta fish, is strongly based on phenotypic features: such as body size and color [Blakeslee, 2009]. Fish tend to associate themselves with other fish that they resemble. This recognition is crucial in reproductive success and fitness, as well as the strategic expenditure of energy. If the fish mates, or fights, with a fish out of its species, this can be considered a waste of energy [Blakeslee, 2009]. 
To test species recognition in Betta fish, the aggression behaviors towards a “mock” Betta fish will be observed. It is hypothesized that the more similar in size the fish is to the cutout fish, the more agnostic behaviors performed. Preference towards a specific color will not be accounted for; however, Bettas may feel more inclined to fight with fish of vibrant color, or a color that is more recognizable [Amiri, 2012]. If Betta fish use size as a tool to recognize their own species, they will recognize the small cutout fish, the cutout most similar in size, to be of their own, and immediately showing aggressive behaviors.


Materials and Method:
Three male Betta fish were obtained and placed in separate tanks (the fish could not visualize each other). Three cutouts of small, medium, and large fish were made out of red foam and attached to a wire. Individually, the cutouts were placed in the tanks for 4 minutes. The time it took for the fish to recognize the cutout was noted. The amount of aggression behaviors, including broadside movements (pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail flashing) and front facing movements (erect pectoral fins, opercula spreading, and branchiostegal membranes) were recorded. Observations of the reactions were also recorded. The fish were given a 5-minute rest period after their cutout encounter. The next sizes were tested on the fish and data was recorded. 

Results:
Reaction time was measured by when the fish made its first aggressive behavior towards the cutout. The reaction time across biological replicates was shown to be the lowest in regard to the small fish cutout (Figure 1). The fish took longer to recognize and respond to the middle-sized fish cutout. All fish took the longest time to recognize the presence of the large cutout. Aggressive behaviors included any front facing movements: expansion of the pectoral fins and opercula, and protrusion of its branchiostegal membrane, and broadside movements: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Each behavior was counted individually. All three replicates responded with the most aggressive behaviors to the small fish cutout, and the least amount of aggression towards the large fish cutout (Figure 2). Additional observations regarding specific agnostic behaviors were observed (Figure 3). 

Discussion:
Due to the data not being significent (p=0.471 and p=0.337), the hypothesis is refuted. However, the general trends of the data are consistent with the hypothesis stating that the fish will recognize and respond most to the fish cutout most similar in size (the small cutout). The reaction time for all biological replicates (Figure 1) was the lowest in response to the small fish cutout. As the cutout got larger, the longer it took for the fish to recognize its presence. This general trend is consistent with previous findings stating that a Betta fish is most likely to display aggressive behaviors towards fish that are recognizable as Betta fish, or have similar phenotypic qualities [Takeuchi, 2009; Blakeslee, 2009]. In this case, the data trends suggest that the cutout most similar in size to the actual fish was recognized in the shortest amount of time. The smallest cutout also received the most aggressive behaviors (Figure 2). Before the agnostic behaviors are displayed, the Betta determines if it would be beneficial to expend energy on the fight [Blakeslee, 2009]. This decision comes from information about the opponent’s size and other phenotypic quality that represent fighting ability [Arnott, 2016]. Based on this, the larger sized cutouts may not have registered as a threat to the fish, therefore it would not be worth the fish to display aggressive behaviors. This parallels the findings for reaction time. Because the large cutout seemed unrealistically large to be a Betta fish, it took a larger time for the Betta to recognize its presence. 
A possible confounding variable in this study could have been the color of the foam cutout, or the lack of movement. The fish detects other fish based on phenotypic qualities, so the color of the foam may have affected how aggressive the fish acted, or how quickly it was recognized. It has been shown that the body color, as well as size, has an effect on mating preference, proving the fish’s ability to differentiate different colors [Blakeslee, 2009]. It is possible that this same mechanism of detecting color preference is used to determine how much aggression would be shown. This is something that could be tested in future experiments: if the color elicits a more intense aggressive response.
