Title: Decreasing the roots to shoots ratio of Fagopyrum esculentum by providing a nitrogen solution in the soil

Abstract:
The manipulation of the amount of nitrogen present in the soil of growing Fagopyrum esculentum was used in order to see the impact of the roots to shoots ratio of both weight and length. This relationship is important to understand phenotypic plasticity and to recognize the importance of the availability of resources on energy allocation in plants. Two groups of three pots with twelve buckwheat seeds each were grown in the same environment except one group received 32% nitrogen solution to their daily water supply. After two weeks, the results indicated that the experimental group with the added nitrogen in their soil had reduced weight and length roots to shoots ratios compared to the control group, implying growth was allocated to the stem and leaves. A two sample one tailed t test was conducted and confirmed the statistical significance and establishing a relationship between nitrogen present and the roots to shoots ratio in our experiment.


Introduction:
Plants adapt different patterns in order to successfully grow and reproduce. Phenotypic plasticity can be defined as differences in physical appearance or behavior of an individual due to factors of the environment. Both just slight adjustments to biotic and abiotic factors impact plant growth. Solar energy and carbon dioxide and elements in the soil are allocated for storage and for growth of new and existing parts of the plant. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient for plants because it is a component of chlorophyll and is critical for growth of different structures. In many environments nitrogen is limited so plants form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen producing bacteria which is then allocated among the roots and shoots in order to obtain the crucial nutrient. In most cases, it is absorbed by the plant’s roots and distributed. Roots primarily absorb underground nutrients and maintain the placement of the entire plant. The leaves are the location of photosynthesis and stems support the structure. The roots to shoots (leaves and stem) ratio provides information about how the plant adapts to its specific environment to effectively compete and obtain resources in the environment. Biologists pay attention to this relationship to better under the health of their plant and to understand if they are lacking in above or underground resources. A study revealed that nitrogen has a significant impact on the roots to shoots ratio in that increased nitrogen nutrition decreased the ratio but there is an optimal amount [Shangguan: 2004]. Fagopyrum esculentum, more commonly referred to as Buckwheat, was used in our experiment to understand the relationship between the roots to shoots ratio and the amount of nitrogen present. This species is native to Asia and has been an important crop as it has nutritional values. We hypothesized that Buckwheat plants consuming extra nitrogen added to their water will have a lower roots to shoots ratio because growth would be allocated to leaves and stems because of the plentiful underground nutrients, the nitrogen, being readily absorbed by the roots. 


Materials and Methods:
The independent variable our experiment was the presence of added nitrogen and the dependent variable was the roots to shoots ratios. In order to understand the relationship of our variables, first the control and experimental groups were set up. We used three pots with twelve seeds each in both groups. The groups were placed in identical conditions and received almost identical treatments. Both plants were placed the same quantity and type of soil and put next to each other in the greenhouse. The seeds grew in uniform amounts of light, humidity, and temperature. Both groups were given 200 mL of water every day for two weeks. Half of the daily water supply for the experimental group was 32% nitrogen solution; so 100 mL of water and 100 mL of Nitrogen solution while the control group was receiving only 200 mL of water. (Mixed with water the plants were receiving 16% nitrogen solution). At the end of the two-week period, we recorded the root length, root weight, shoot weight, and shoot length, for six plants in each group (2 plants picked randomly from each pot) and calculated the roots to shoots ratio of both weight and length to compare the ratios of the control and experimental group. The means and standard deviations of each ratio were also recorded and a two sample one tailed t test was conducted to understand the relationship between the two variables.


Results:
The results of the experiment reveal that the roots to shoots ratio consistently decreased when nitrogen was added to the daily supply of water of Buckwheat plants. Mathematically, this communicates that the length and weight of the shoots was growing more than the roots throughout the duration of the experiment. The mean ratio of the weight of roots to shoots of the control group was 0.56 and the mean average of the ratio of the weight of the roots to shoots of the control group was 0.28. The same trend was revealed in the comparison of the length ratios. The mean length root to shoot ratio of the control group was 1.21 and the experimental was 0.54. Finally, the two sample one-tailed (non paired) t test revealed the p value for the weight ratios to be .007 and 4.5 x 10-6 for the length, demonstrating statistical significance for both values and establishing a relationship between the presence of add nitrogen and the roots to shoots ratio. The t-test for the weight ratio revealed a t-stat of 2.9 and degree of freedom of 10. Lastly, the t -test length ratio had a t-stat of 8.2 and degree of freedom of 10.


Discussion:
The results of our experiment support our hypothesis. Before conducting our procedure, we predicted that providing an experimental group with a nitrogen solution would decrease the roots to shoots ratios of Buckwheat plants. Analyzing both the weight roots to shoots ratio and the length roots to shoots ratio reveals that adding nitrogen decreases the ratio. This means that growth was allocated to the leaves and stems above ground rather than the roots underground. Other studies have found similar results that parallel ours. In a study conducted on many different types of crops, for example maize, wheat, barley, and potato, it was found that low levels of nitrogen lead to an increased root to shoot ratio because the plant increased the content of the root system when nitrogen levels were low [Engels: 1995]. This study supports our finding because it helps to explain why growth would be allocated to the roots or shoots depending on the availability of nitrogen, a vital resource: Growth occurs less to the part of the plant that can easily obtain resources. In our experiment, with extra nitrogen, the weight and length of the shoots increased in order for the plant to obtain more solar energy and other atmospheric elements while nitrogen was plentiful. Further, Engel’s study demonstrates how growth was allocated to the roots when nitrogen was depleted in order to increase surface area to maximize absorption efficiently. These findings are extremely important for many reasons. Understanding phenotypic plasticity of plants can help determine the health of the plant and about the environment around them because plants will allocate available resources best suited to compete with other living organisms around them depending on the specific condition of biotic and abiotic factors they experience. Another study to complete this one is to do a similar experiment with controlling amounts of other resources, particularly with atmospheric to see if the roots to shoots ratio would increase if sunlight, for example, is limited.
