Title: The Effects of Precor on the Pupation of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Insect hormones are neurosecretory products which are responsible for the differentiation of physiological and developmental processes [Nijhout: 1994]. The purpose of this lab was to determine the effect insect growth regulators (IGRs) have on the psychological regulatory development that is significent for the growing of insects. There are two main hormones in insects. The first being Ecdysterone; this hormone is secreted by the prothoracic gland and ultimately regulates the molting process [Johnson:2019]. The second hormone is the juvenile hormone which is produced by the corpus allata [Johnson:2019]. Ecdysterone and juvenile hormone work together to controll growth and molting which can potentially result in abnormalities that reduce the possibilities of survival by blocking the hormones [Tunaz:2004]. The hornworm caterpillar, Manduca sexta, is being used in this experiment to test hormone regulation of insect development. This organism is being used because it is a pest and has a specific life cycle that can be observed.  Meduca sexta goes through eight life cycle stages in which these insects go from eggs, to 5 instar larvae, to pupa, and finally to adult [Johnson:2019]. This insect is classified as holometabolous which means the insect changes form all together when it goes through metamorphosis to mature from juvenile to adult. Metamorphosis is used in the transition from larval stage to pupa stage. The pupa stage is the stage just before the becoming of an adult for the Manduca sexta [Johnson:2019]. During the last stage of development, undergoing molting requires the presence of ecdysteroids and a depletion of juvenile hormone [Dhadialla: 1998]. Juvenile hormones are responsible for the repressing of the secretion of ecdysones and allows for growth until the insect is able to reach its appropriate adulthood [Sakurai: 1989]. Thus, in this experiment, to test the potential repressing of ecdysteriods, a specific juvenile hormone, Precor, will be used to in turn test the result of juvenile inhibition on caterpillar’s growth to the stage of adult. The hypothesis of this experiment is to observe the result of the juvenile hormone, Precor, that will be used to advance the weight of the caterpillars in juvenile while also inhibiting the growth of the caterpillars to the stage of being an adult. 

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta larvae were randoMly assigned and separated into two groups of controll and treatment, 4 of which are in each group. Each group of four was split into two plastic containers separating each caterpillar. There were holes poked into each plastic container which allowed for oxygen to flow into the containers for the Manduca sexta. All eight Manduca sexta larvae were weighed to record the original starting weight. The first group of caterpillars were fed food mixed with 5 drops of Precor 1: 1250 added and mixed together. The second group was fed the same food instead mixed with 5 drops of water. After the drops were added, we rolled the food into a ball in hopes of maintaining moisture. Each day for two weeks, our group replenished the food as well as add the drops. A group member also weighed the caterpillars and documented the results on the shared spreadsheet. The data was thus shared with everyone. After the data was collected, a two-tailed sample t_test was performed in order to compare whether the average difference between two groups is due to random chance or is actually significent. This is return determines the significance of the experiment through a p_value.

Results:
Throughout the two weeks of feeding and observing Manduca sexta caterpillars, obvious changes became clear in their appearance and weight. Original observations of our particular caterpillars include soft, sticky, and light green. As the weeks continued, observations were made on the drastic changes that continued to occur.  The Manduca sexta that were fed food mixed with Precor grew considerably more than the Manduca sexta caterpillars fed food mixed with water. The caterpillars fed food mixed with Precor grew to appear swollen to which they doubled in size. The final observations of the caterpillars were drastic size growth as well as stiffness and swelling of the overall body. Figure 1 displays the average weight data recorded from day one until day fourteen. The data showed continual growth in weight between both groups of caterpillars. The total MEAN for the controll group was 5.74 grams with a SD of 3.98. The total MEAN for the experimental group was 9.01 grams with a SD of 6.07. A two-tailed sample t_test was performed on the average data and that p_value was 0.046227. 


Discussion:
The p_value is lower than 0.5 and therefore means that the growth of the two groups was significently different at the 95% confidence interval. Based on the statistical test for significance, the null hypothesis was rejected. It can thus be concluded that Precor does in fact enhances the increasing weight of juvenile Manduca sexta while also inhibiting its growth into an adult. The Precor blocks the levels of endocrine which induces molting. With this blocked, the caterpillars are able to grow and increase in weight without going into the last stage of development; adulthood. The ultimate increase in size in the experimental group was due to the endocrine being stumped which resulted in the receptors lacking the ability to connect the hormone regulating negative feedback to the commitment pulse [Johnson:2019]. Thus, the experimental group showed drastic swelling which has to do with the effect of hormonal blocking and increasing [Hughes: 1989]. If this experiment was done again, our group could increase the number of Precor drops from 5 to 10. These results could be compared to ultimately determine how much the weight of the caterpillars can be increased while also inhibiting the final stage of development. It would be interesting to see the difference in weight just by changing the procedure by 5 drops of Precor. With this conclusion being made, scientists can now further research to study the larval cycle in the development of insects and compare them to humans. A teacher by the name Lynne Kepler, allows her students to choose three caterpillars per year to feed and analyze their growth. Her students are continuously amazed at the drastic changes in which take place within their life cycle. They analyze each stage of metamorphosis and are also encouraged to compare the butterfly’s growth and changes to their own development [Kepler: 2019]. Just as Manduca sexta go through obvious changes during development, so do humans. This awareness can ultimately help us to better understand our own development.
