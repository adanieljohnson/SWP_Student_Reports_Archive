Title: Manduca sexta juvenile growth hormone experiment 

Abstract:
None

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta also known as the tobacco horn worm is in the Sphingidae family [Johnson:2019]. The horn worm goes through states all the way up to the adult stage which is a moth. The stage in which the subjects were in during the lab was the horn worm stage otherwise known as the larva state. The insect starts in eggs then goes through 1st instar larva up to 5th instar larva, then the Hornworm enters its pupa stage to finally end the cycle as an adult moth. The Hornworm is found throughout the united states and are considered a pest at their larva stage [Johnson:2019]. The Manduca Sexta itself is bright green in color and its nickname is from the horn located at the end of its body. Juvenile hormone otherwise know as JH is produced in the Corpus allata and this is what regulates the type of molting during the insect’s life cycle. During the cycle up until the 5th instar larva the Juvenile hormones levels are high, once the 5th stage hits the juvenile hormone drops and Ecdysterone (20E) rises to start triggering the next stage of development. If the Manduca Sexta is given a synthetic juvenile hormone activator, then the Manduca Sexta will not develop as fast as the Manduca with no activator.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment there were two separate sets of 4 Manduca’s each in their own individual slot in the plastic containers. Before placing each hornworm into the containers all the subjects were weighted individually. After the weight was taken each slot was labeled and each one was punctured with 2 holes on the sides to allow oxygen flow. The first set of Hornworms which were the controll group were given the same amount of food (10g) and 10 drops of water was added to the food. The second group is in a separate container and is given the same amount of food with 10 drops of water and 5 drops of the juvenile hormone. The experiment continued for 15 days, everyday each individual worm was weight and recorded, if the food was dry more water was added to the controll and more of the juvenile hormone (JH) was added to the opposite test group.

Results:
After the 15 days that the lab took place the data shown in (Figure 1) shows the change in weight over time for each individual Hornworm.
(Figure 1)
The second (Figure2) which is showing the means from the two groups using the “Two-sample t_test”. The data shown below has a P value of .000467 this means that the hypothesis “If the Manduca Sexta is given a synthetic juvenile hormone activator, then the Manduca Sexta will not develop as fast as the Manduca with no activator.” was rejected and an alternative was accepted.

Discussion:
The hypothesis of the group that If the Manduca Sexta is given a synthetic juvenile hormone activator, then the Manduca Sexta will not develop as fast as the Manduca with no activator was rejected by the experiment. The results from the mean values of both the controllled and the activator groups shown by the two-tailed p_value rejected the hypothesis. The group could have made mistakes during the experimental process which could have affected the results. If the food was too dry and more water and or activator wasn’t added, then that could have caused the weights of the Manduca’s to change. If more time was allowed for the experiment there could have been different results, if the experiment went till the subjects reached the pupa stage that could have altered the data and possibly accepted the groups hypothesis. Another possible error could have been the amount of oxygen flow for the worms, 2 holes were punctured that could have been in the wrong fashion. This error may have been the cause of the early death of controll subject number 4. This experiment is important because juvenile hormone (JH) is in many other insects and it affects them in different ways such as molting and the production of eggs [Noriega:2014]. If more research is done like this with the juvenile hormone more discoveries could be made from it in insects and other species.
