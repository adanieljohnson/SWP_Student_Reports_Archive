Title: Manduca sexta Growth Experiment

Abstract:
N/A


Introduction:
During the lab on 9/5, I read a scientific article about the effects of the pesticide Methoprene on morphogenesis and shell formation in the blue crab Callinectes Sapidus.
Methoprene is a chemical analog of the juvenile hormone and the result is that Methoprene will produce deleterious effects on the blue crab maturation.
Besides, there are other pieces of information from a review article published by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry. The information all show that IGRs (insect growth regulators) can lead to abnormalities that reduce insect survival.
As a result, I am interested in finding out the effect of hormones (Juvenile Hormones) on the organisms (the larvae of Manduca sexta) growth. More specifically, I will test if Juvenile Hormones will have an effect on the growth of Manduca larvae with a comparison experiment. The hypothesis is that the Manduca larvae treated with Juvenile Hormones will experience better growth than those treated without Juvenile Hormones. The comparison of growth will be analyzed by comparing differences in the weight of two groups.


Materials and Method:
Materials:
two lids covering the boxes;
two plastic boxes (each have four subsections) used as the cell containing the caterpillars;
several ten-gram food blobs as the nutrition supply for caterpillars;
five drops of water added in each food blob or five drops of IGR solvent as a source of Juvenile Hormone;
a fridge to put the caterpillars (providing essentially the same living condition for their living).

Method:
I will set up two groups of caterpillars (four caterpillars in each group).
They will be fed with the same food (ten-gram food blob) and raised in the same fridge (growing in the condition with same illumination, same moisture, and same temperature). For the controll group, I will add five drops of water to the food for each caterpillar. For the experiment group, I will add five drops of IGR solvent to the food for each caterpillar.
Record their weight every day.
If there is not enough food in the cell containing caterpillars, I will change the food of every caterpillar with a ten-gram food blob along with the treatment assigned at the start of the experiment (either five drops of water or five drops of IGR solvent).
Analyze the data at the end of the experiment to determine if Juvenile Hormones will have an effect on the caterpillar (the ones treated with IGR solvent will gain higher weight than the ones treated with water).


Results:
A difference between the weight of caterpillars was detected. The average weight of each group (the controll group and treatment group were collected every day). The t-value of the statistical test was 0.274 and the One-tailed p_value was 0.393. The caterpillars were all tiny at the start of the beginning with similar color—bright blue. As time went on, caterpillars in both groups grew up quickly, developed horns, and gained different colors. The color of the controll group was a brighter blue, while there was a touch of green in the blue of the treatment group. On the last day of measurement, one caterpillar in the controll group was dead. As a result of which, the average weight on the last day for the controll group was calculated with three caterpillars instead of four. At the beginning of the experiment, the average weight of the controll group was 0.3g and that of the treatment group was 0.25g. In the end, the average weight of the controll group was 13.77g and that of the treatment group was 15.35g. The largest difference in weight was on Day14: 1.925g. Based on the One-tailed p_value (0.393), the p_value was way higher than 0.05, which failed to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, I couldn’t use the experiment’s data to support the statement that the Manduca larvae treated with Juvenile Hormones will experience better growth than those treated without Juvenile Hormones. Although basically, the weight of caterpillars treated with Juvenile Hormones (IGR in this case) did have a higher weight than the caterpillars treated with water.

Discussion:
According to the paper that I read before the lab, the Juvenile Hormone ought to impact the growth of the caterpillars with significance. But as our t_test shows there was no significance in the difference between the weights of controll and treatment groups. In other word, the difference can be caused by chance despite that the figure shows a slightly constant higher growth rate of the treatment caterpillars.
Thus, I have done some research about the Juvenile Hormone’s effect on the caterpillar. One paper has the conclusion that: although JH analog can stimulate development in diapausing pupae of M. sexta, the level required (-2.5 pg/g) is quite high. And after some calculation, the paper shows that the listed level is considerably higher than the known physiological levels of the hormone. As a result, the caterpillars can be rather insensitive to the JH stimulation.
Besides, I checked the method (in the second paper I found) examining the role of JH in pupal development. They did allatectomy to the instar as the controll group, which ensured that the innate gland that would produce JH couldn’t affect the data. 
Combining both pieces of information that I have found, I suggest the reason why our data have failed to verify the hypothesis is probably that we didn’t take the innate JH hormone generated by the instar. The treatment (five drops of IGR) doesn’t make a significent difference in the concentration of the hormone, which caused the failure of the p-test.
However, the reality is that: there is a difference in the weights of two groups (the caterpillars in the controll group are generally heavier) and the colors of them (controll—blue, treatment—bluish-green). I think the reason behind it is still the extra Juvenile Hormone that was cast on the caterpillars. Although it is true that the five drops of IGR don’t change the hormone level, IGR still influences the caterpillars to some extent.
My conclusion of the experiment will be: the experiment has failed to verify the hypothesis that adding Juvenile Hormone will boost the growth of the Manduca sexta larvae. Nevertheless, by searching online for further information and direct observations on the caterpillar, extra Juvenile hormone will have an impact on the caterpillars such as making them into “superlarvae”. In order to obtain a similar result, the method of the experiment needs to be adjusted by mimicking the method described in the paper of citation.
