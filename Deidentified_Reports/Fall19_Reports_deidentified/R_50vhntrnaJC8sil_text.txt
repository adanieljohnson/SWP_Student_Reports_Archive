Title: Increasing the growth of Manduca Sexta with the exposure of the Juvenile Hormone, Precor.

Abstract:
Manduca sexta are a type of insect that tend to prey on plants such as potato, tobacco, tomato [Lotts and Thomas: 2017]. It is more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm; named after its food source and the protruding structure on its tail. Eventually, the hornworms will metamorphosize into moths, which is their final adult stage. With only having a life-span of about 30 days, the tobacco hornworm is ideal when studying the effects of insecticides on insects, specifically methoprene. Two hormones that have a significent impact on the growth cycle of the caterpillars are ecdysterone,impacts the timing of molting, and juvenile hormone, which determines the type of molting [Laboratory Manual: 2019].

 Since the insect is considered a pest to major crops, the purpose of using methoprene is to interrupt the growth-cycle. Methoprene is categorized under a type of insecticides called Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) and is an analog of juvenile hormone meaning it mimics the effects of the hormone. In this experiment the insecticide, Precor, was used which contains methoprene [Wick, Bond, Buhl, and Stone:2012].

Introduction:
Manduca sexta are a type of insect that tend to prey on plants such as potato, tobacco, tomato [Lotts and Thomas: 2017]. It is more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm; named after its food source and the protruding structure on its tail. Eventually, the hornworms will metamorphosize into moths, which is their final adult stage. With only having a life-span of about 30 days, the tobacco hornworm is ideal when studying the effects of insecticides on insects, specifically methoprene. Two hormones that have a significent impact on the growth cycle of the caterpillars are ecdysterone,impacts the timing of molting, and juvenile hormone, which determines the type of molting [Laboratory Manual: 2019].

 Since the insect is considered a pest to major crops, the purpose of using methoprene is to interrupt the growth-cycle. Methoprene is categorized under a type of insecticides called Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) and is an analog of juvenile hormone meaning it mimics the effects of the hormone. In this experiment the insecticide, Precor, was used which contains methoprene [Wick, Bond, Buhl, and Stone:2012].

To further prove the impact of excess juvenile hormone on the tobacco hornworms, Precor was introduced to their diet. This will answer the question on how insecticides controll pest reproduction rates. It is expected that the caterpillars who have the excess hormone will continue to grow larger, without fully maturing into their adult state. The caterpillars who do not have the excess hormone will continue to molt, grow, and mature at their regular rate.


Materials and Method:
In conducting the experiment, eight hornworm caterpillars were obtained; four of which are used as a controll and the others were to be treated with the hormone. The caterpillars were measured in centimeters using a ruler and given 10g of food. The controll caterpillars received food with three drops of water and the treated caterpillars were fed food with three drops of Precor. The hornworms were placed in an incubator at 26.5 degrees Celsius, until they were fed again.

The food was changed and the caterpillars length was measured daily. After each daily procedure was performed, all of the test subjects were placed back into the incubator until the next feeding and measuring. After the 15 days were up, the lengths and growth rates of the controll and treated caterpillars are compared using a line graph. 


Results:
The measurements of the controll group and the measurements of the treatment group were combined to calculate an average length for each group over the course of 15 days (Figure 1). Each average was plotted on a graph that illustrated the time in days as the independent variable and the length in centimeters as the dependent variable.  From the data, it was noted that the difference in measurements was not significently statistically different (P=0.389764).  Over the course of the 15 days, the general trends of the average length of each experimental group was positive. This takes into consideration that these averages could have varied with a standard deviation of 2.66 for the controll group and 2.46 for the hormone treated group. Towards the three days of the experiment, the controll group was observed to have higher length averages than that of the hormone treated group, and towards the last two days, both groups showed a negative trend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                


Discussion:
In conducting this experiment it was found that the hypothesis was not supported because the data concluded that introducing the hormone to the diet of the Manduca-sexta. Although it is known that the molting hormone is set in place for molting to occur, the presence of the juvenile hormone determines whether the cuticular structures laid down by the epidermis are to be of larval or adult type [ Wigglesworth: 1962]. It was expected that the hornworms who were fed food with Precor would continue to molt, but each molt would just be a larger version of the larval type of Manduca-sexta. From the data collected this was not concluded. The experimental data showed no real difference in the growth patterns of the two experimental groups and when comparing the daily means of the lengths, the controll group had a trend measuring higher lengths. One thing to take into consideration when observing the patterns of the averages collected is that two of the controll organisms died. Control organism one died after the sixth day and controll organism two died after the twelfth day. When removing their data from the averages, this skewed the data toward the controll group and made the mean higher. To get better results, collecting another set of data over the course of 1-3 more days would be able to determine if the controll group would successfully go into a pupation phase and if the hormonal treated group would continue to increase in length. From the observations in this experiment, to further prove the effectiveness of the insecticide, more research would need to be conducted.
