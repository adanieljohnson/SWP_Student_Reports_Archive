Title: The Use of a Ecdysterone (20E) Inhibitor and its Effect on the Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
	The process of growth and development is something that occurs in all living species and is a result of hormones released by the endocrine system. In this experiment, the group will look at the hormones involved in the growth and development in Manduca Sexta, and alter them to investigate their effects on one another. Manduca Sexta larvae, also known as Tobacco Hornworms “have been used for a series of important studies that contributed to the understanding of insect endocrinology and development. [Nijhout: 1974]. This, along with the short life span and their pest status, was the group’s reasoning for choosing the Manduca Sexta as their experimental organism. 
To better understand the stages of development in Manduca Sexta, it must be understood what causes the transition from one stage to another. Hormones are what cause the transitions from one stage to another in the life cycle of Tobacco Hornworms, specifically the hormones Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Ecdysterone is part of the steroid hormone family and is secreted by the prothoracic gland. 20E regulates the timing of molting and metamorphosis in the development stages of insects. [Johnson: 2019]. Juvenile Hormone is produced by a pair of glands called the corpus allata. JH regulates the type of molting that occurs and helps keep the insect’s juvenile physical characteristics. 
	Manduca Sexta larvae have been found to destroy crops by eating them, causing them to gain their pest status. In order to prevent the hornworms from being a pest for long periods of time, the group wanted to investigate how altering the production of 20E would affect their lifecycle. Since 20E regulates the timing of molting, the group wanted to investigate what would happen if the production of 20E was inhibited. 
	In order to investigate how 20E affects the life cycle of Manduca Sexta, the group created an experiment where one group was given food with 20E inhibitor inside, while the control group was given food with just water added. The group hypothesized by inhibiting the production of 20E the larvae will have a slower development to pupate while the control group will develop on a normal Manduca Sexta life cycle. The group will measure development by measuring the mass of each hornworm used in the experiment.

Materials and Methods:
First, the group obtained eight Manduca Sexta larvae. Four of them were part of the control group (food contains water droplets) and the remaining four were  part of the experimental group (food contains 20E inhibitor droplets). Next, we gathered two containers with four compartments to place each larvae into their own compartment. One container contained the four control larvae and the other contained the four larvae that ingested the 20E inhibitor. Then the group collected larvae food provided by the laboratory and placed 10 grams of food into each compartment: 80 grams in total. In the container containing the four control group larvae, the group wet each larvae’s food with five drops of water from a pipet. In the container containing the four 20E inhibitor group larvae, they wet each larvae’s food with five drops of 20E inhibitor from a pipet. 
	Before placing the larvae into their designated container their initial mass was recorded. For two weeks the group returned each day to record the mass of the larvae each day. Their food was replaced when it appeared dry or about every three days. This was done by simply repeating the above steps involved in weighing and wetting the larvae food. 
After two weeks, the group had finished collecting their data and proceeded to interpret the data by using a one-tailed t-test.


Results:
Over the two weeks the group spent recording the mass of both the control and experimental group, the group conducted the experiment twice. At the end of the first week, all larvae in the 20E experimental group were dead, while the control group was developing regularly. In order to test if this was a result of the use of the 20E inhibitor, the group restarted the experiment, and continued to collect data each day, but as a new experiment. At the conclusion of the second week, the group saw similar results; all except one larva in the 20E experimental group was dead, while the control group was developing as normal. Not only did the group notice that a large majority of the 20E group in both experiments died, but they also grew in mass at a significantly slower rate than the control group, as shown in figure 1 and figure 2. Instead of developing a line on the graph for each larva, the group decided to average the mass of all four larvae in each group each day to represent the mass of each group on that particular day. In order to determine if the data found amongst these two groups were statistically significant, meaning the differences found among the two groups were not due to chance, the group completed a one-tailed t-test for both experiments. The group used a one-tailed t-test because the group was looking for one group to be statistically significantly greater than the other group. The first-week experiment’s one-tailed t-test p-value was 0.0349 and the second-week experiment’s one-tailed t-test p-value was 0.0112. In order for statistical significance to be assumed the p-value must be below 0.05  For both the experiment conducted the first week and the experiment conducted the second week, the group found their data to be statistically significant, meaning this data was not found simply due to chance. This allows the group to believe the addition of the 20E inhibitor to the larvae food had a significant effect on the development of Manduca Sexta.


Discussion:
At the conclusion of the experiment, the group was able to determine that their results support their hypothesis that adding the 20E inhibitor will slow down the development of the larvae in comparison to the control group larvae which will develop on a normal Manduca Sexta life cycle. The group did not hypothesize that many of larvae whose food contained the 20E inhibitor would die. However, the death of many of the experimental group larvae still supports the group hypothesis. By wetting the experimental larvae’s food with a 20E inhibitor there was no hormone to tell the larvae when to molt, it also most likely resulted in higher production of JH, meaning the larvae would keep their juvenile characteristics and not develop at a proper rate. Because JH and 20E work together on a concentration ratio to determine the insect's development when 20E was inhibited, the production of JH most likely skyrocketed and caused the insect to break homeostasis causing its death.  [Johnson: 2019]. In a study conducted by H. Frederik Nijout and Carroll M. Williams, they studied the timing of PTTH hormone, a hormone that regulates the release of ecdysterone, and the rate of growth of Manduca Sexta. They found that Manduca Sexta in the fifth instar stage that released PTTH on the third day grew at a faster rate than Manduca Sexta in the fifth instar stage that released PTTH on the fourth day. This is thought to be a result of the third-day group obtaining more PTTH hormone than the fourth day  [Nijhout: 1974]. These findings help readers better understand the findings of the group’s experiment by showing another study in which the ratio of a hormone affects the growth of Manduca Sexta. 
	Moving forward, the next logical step for this study would be to complete the experiment several more times and see if similar results are obtained, or add more drops of 20E inhibitor to the larvae food and see if the rate of growth in the experimental group is even slower.
These findings help us better understand the processes that occur in the endocrine systems in many living species. Based on these findings it can be understood how the endocrine system is a type of chemical messenger system, that works on feedback loops. Feedback loops are important because they help organisms maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis allows organism to keep their internal environment constant. The type of feedback loop that is at work in this experiment is a negative feedback system. Since JH and 20E work together in a ratio, when 20E is low, the large amount of JH in proportion to 20E signals the endocrine system to produce more 20E. However, in this experiment, the production of 20E was inhibited, meaning it could not be produced even when it was signaled to. Because of this homeostasis of the insect was disrupted resulting in its death.
