Title: Effects of pesticide AzaGuard on Manduca Sexta growth cycle 

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Hormones play a crucial role in developmental changes of many organisms. Therefore, the ability to manipulate hormone levels can dramatically alter the development of an organism.  Manduca sexta serve as an effective model organism for endocrine function research due to their relatively short life span and the ability for researchers to quickly and efficiently obtain these organisms. [Schwartz: 1983] Manduca sexta begin their life cycle as eggs, then develop into larvae and later a pupa, ultimately resulting in an adult moth. This model organism is relatively simple in comparison to a human model and is therefore a useful tool for studying the endocrine system and other human systems [Hussa: 2012]. Two hormones of importance in insects include ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH).  Both hormones work together to carry out appropriate caterpillar development. JH controls the type of molt in development and 20E controls the timing of the molt [Johnson: 2016]. As previously established, the Manduca sexta general life cycle is relatively fast (ranging from 39 to 48 days), are abundant in nature, and are considered pests to the majority of the human population [Johnson: 2016]. For the purpose of this research, 20E will be studied. Ecdysteroids, such as 20E are necessary hormones in Manduca sexta for development into adulthood. Two groups of Manduca Sexta (1 group exposed to Azaguard and 1 group control with water) were evaluated over a two-week period. The Manduca sexta in this experiment were in their 3rd-4th larval instars on day 1. 
It was hypothesized that two-week exposure to AzaGuard pesticide would significantly decrease overall growth and maturation of Manduca sexta treatment group in comparison to the Manduca sexta control not exposed to AzaGuard. The control group was expected to show significant increases in weight and show faster signs of development when compared to the ecdysterone blocked group.


Materials and Methods:
2 plastic containers with 4 compartments were used to grow the Manduca sexta and 2 holes were punched into each compartment to allow flow of air. Caterpillars were incubated at 26.5 C Containers were appropriately labeled. 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were studied in the experiment, 4 served as control and 4 as treatment. During the two-week study, Manduca sexta food and waste was replenished and cleaned daily. 10 g of Manduca sexta food was mashed in container and prepared for each caterpillar. Water is a crucial resource for survival in the organism, so the food was moistened daily. In each 10g food sample, 8 drops of either dH2O or 8 drops of Azaguard (1:1250 concentration) were placed on top of the 10g of food and then mashed/stirred. After food preparation was complete, the 10g of food were compacted in the side of each caterpillar compartment (10g sample placed appropriately in either control or treatment group based on presence of Azaguard or water control). With each daily visit, the Manduca subjects were weighed individually on a table-top scale. Qualitative observations were also recorded in the form of notes and pictures. Statistical analysis in the form of a t-test was performed to determine a statistical significance difference between the control and treatment groups.

Results:
Both groups of caterpillars on day 1 of the experiment were around the same age and weight. By day 3 (as represented in Figure 1), the average control weight had increased at a faster rate than the average weight of the experimental group, this can be seen graphically. Qualitative observations were primarily in regard to increased size. The caterpillars were in the 3rd to 4th larval instar at the beginning of data collection and none arrived at the pupal stage. Coloration was largely the same across both groups, the control group visibly developed faster than the experimental group. By day 11 of the experiment, three of the experimental group were dead. The following day, day 12, all of the experimental were dead and #2 of the control group was found dead. Before conducting statistical analysis, the data points that corresponded to dead caterpillars were taken out of the mean calculations per day. 11 values (corresponding to 11 days) were used in the t-test, the average of the control was found to be MEAN 3.78 +/- SD and the experimental was found to be MEAN 0.293 +/- SD the course of 11 days. Statistical analysis (two sample, one tailed t-test) was performed and resulted in a p value of 0.002717. Seeing that the p value was less than 0.05, the results are statistically significant. 

Discussion:
The results of the experimental and control groups were statistically significant. This supports that the pesticide had a significant effect on the development of the Manduca sexta treatment group. Thus, the alternative hypothesis is supported. This is due to the role of ecdysterone in the Manduca sexta development cycle. Ecdysterone is present throughout the Manduca sexta natural growth cycle and when an ecdysterone blocker such as Azaguard is used, the amount of ecdysterone is diminished. Ecdysterone is necessary before the timing of molt as it affects the timing of molting in the species. The statistical significance of this research supports the statement that ecdysterone slows the molting during insect development as well as slowing development of additional functions in adult insects. When ecdysterone is blocked with a form of a pesticide such as AzaGuard, the ability for further development is hindered and the pupal stage often cannot be obtained [Johnson: 2016]. Ecdysterone inhibits the initiation of eclosion, which is necessary in order for caterpillars to prepare for each new stage of pupal development. The delay in pupal development as well as the inability to move out of earlier larval instar stages (due to lack of ecdysterone surges) leads to the significantly lower average weights of the experimental group. Application of these findings could be of particular importance to those in an industry where pests can dramatically alter crop yield. The ability to manipulate development to cause an organism to remain in a larval stage when it is considered a pest after it pupates is useful technology. The ability to control hormone levels in an organism that is considered a pest allows scientists to decrease development or cause rapid development of an organism to move it out of its development stage where it is classified as a pest. A recent study within the California strawberry industry highlights the importance of insect growth regulators to the agricultural world [Dara: 2018]. Three variations of an insecticide and known insect growth regulator azadirachtin were studied, including AzaGuard (3% azadirachtin) in the 2018 study. This study represents the potential for future research on pesticides that have the ability to target and disrupt a specific hormone in one particular insect rather than targeting a broader range of insects, some of which may not be pests. Another organism that also contains E20 and JH is the mosquito. In early 2015, at the beginning of the zika outbreak, the ability to manipulate mosquito hormones to stall development would lead to lives saved. The technology of manipulating certain hormones in insects that are a threat to the good of public health is of high importance for humanity.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Effect of Azaguard pesticide on average Manduca Sexta growth, measured in the form of mass. Four 3-4th larval instar caterpillars were placed in each group (8 total). The experimental group (MEAN 0.293 +/- SD) were exposed to Azaguard pesticide in their food for eleven days. Control had no pesticide exposure (MEAN 3.78 +/- SD). Error bars were construed by taking the standard deviation of each group average mass per day, explaining the difference in error bar length. T-test showed data to be statistically significant (p= 0.002717). 
*SD was calculated per day for each individual group.
