Title: The Influence of IGR on Manduca Sexta Caterpillar Growth 

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Within laboratory settings, insects are an ideal model for the analysis and review of adult insects’ behavioral and physiological processes by their endocrine and circadian systems [Petryk: 2003]. Within these insects, there are a wide variety of hormones that influence their growth and development. One of these hormones is 20-hydroxyecdysone, and it is the hormone which initiates the molting process and is regulated by the Prothoracicotropic hormone, PTTH [Petryk: 2003]. PTTH, on the other hand, has the essential role of regulating the production and/or the release of ecdysone, a steroid hormone that stimulates the actions of molting and metamorphosis [Yamanaka: 2016]. Another hormone which has a significent influence on these insects is the juvenile hormone, vJH, which has the role of regulating development and reproductive maturation in insects, and as a result, it influences the type of molting the insect undergoes during its critical life periods [Noriega: 2014]. A specific insect which is influenced by all of these hormones is the Manduca Sexta, which is also known as the tobacco hornworm, an insect in the family Solanaceae that is known for “causing significent defoliation of economically important crops” [Gillet-Kaufman: 2019]. The Manduca Sexta’s ability to do this is why the regulation of their growth is desired to a significent extent. The Manduca Sexta has five larval stages within which both 20E and JH occur resulting in the Manduca Sexta’s growth, molting, and metamorphosis throughout [Gillet-Kaufman: 2019]. With regards to the hormones present in the Manduca Sexta, the JH presence is strong in the first four stages along with the other hormones, but it reduces in the fifth and final larval stage in order for the pupal commitment [Noriega 2014]. My colleagues and I wanted to see the influence of 1: 1250 IGR, an insect growth regulator (IGR) with activity against a multitude of insect species on the weights of these Manduca Sextas during their growth stages [Hallesy: 1972]. In this experiment, the hypothesis states that if the Manduca Sexta caterpillars are treated with the 1: 1250 IGR, then their growth, measured in mass, will be less than the growth of caterpillars that aren’t treated with the 1: 1250 IGR. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, our independent variable is the amount of 1: 1250 IGR used between both of the caterpillars' foods. The dependent variables are the growth and development of the caterpillars, which were measured in grams. The controll variables included the caterpillars’ environments and the type of food distributed to them. For the testing of the hypothesis, two groups of Manduca Sextas were used. Each group had four caterpillars which were in similar environments that consisted of plastic containers with air and food holes. The group that was used for our controll group acted as a controll by having no addition of the 1: 1250 IGR added to their food with 8 drops of water as well in order to account for moisture. The other group had eight drops of 1: 1250 IGR, added to their food every time it needs to be replenished. Over the span of two weeks, the caterpillars were monitored and were weighed in grams with the use of a scale in order to measure their growth. To analyze this data, we used a 1-tailed paired t_test. The t_test was used to determine the significance of our results.


Results:
In regards to the growth and looks of the Manduca Sextas, both the controll group and experimental group looked the same for the most part with little difference in color as they both were of the vibrant green variety and had little to no size differences. Figure 1 shows the masses and standard deviations of the experimental and controll groups as recorded intermittently over the span of 15 days. The average mass of the controll group at the experiment’s conclusion was 11.3 grams while the experimental group’s average mass was 12.4 grams. From the one-tailed t_test, the p_value was 0.35. Figure 2 depicts the weight over the fifteen days based off averages.


Discussion:
In our experiment, the alternate hypothesis that says that weight will increase at a slower rate with increased amounts of IGR was rejected. From our one-tailed T-test, our group got a result, specifically the p_value of 0.35 being greater than 0.05 which rejects the alternative hypothesis and led us to believe that a significent difference does not exist. Furthermore, the results support that we are unable to reject the null hypothesis, which stated that the caterpillar weight would stay the same as the weight of the controll. Our results indicated that the controll group’s average mass was lower than that of the treatment group’s. In theory, the inclusion of  IGR in the Manduca Sexta’s diet is expected to promote reduced growth of the Manduca Sexta throughout its various stages compared to a Manduca Sexta that is not subject to IGR treatments [Hallesy: 1972]. The growth of the treated group being far greater than those of the controll was a very unexpected development. There are many reasons as to why this could have happened. A predominant one is the genetics of the Manduca Sexta. There is a significent possibility that there was an irregularity in the genes of the hornworm leading to issues with the ability of the worm to absorb the receptor. Another reason can be that the IGR we used was not efficient enough in doing its job. A similar experiment involved the use of the IGR azadirachtin on the Manduca Sexta which led to lower mass for the treatment group due to the inhibitory effects of the IGR on the Manduca Sexta’s feeding and disruptive effects of development [Beckage: 1988].  Another way in which we can build upon this research by extending the experiment’s duration of time as well as using more 1: 1250 IGR to determine significance as the two week time table may have not been long enough to find out the true effects of the 1: 1250 IGR. Another very interesting potential experiment that can be done involves the evaluation of mass during each larval instar stage after the insertion of IGR which has similarly been performed in the past, but not with a focus on mass [Kingsolver: 2007].
