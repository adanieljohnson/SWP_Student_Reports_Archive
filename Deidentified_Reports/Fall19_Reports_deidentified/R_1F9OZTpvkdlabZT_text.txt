Title: Effects of reduced visual acuity on agnostic behavior in betta splendins

Abstract:
Understanding the interaction between animal morphology, physiology and behavior is essential to getting a clear picture of how ecosystems operate across the globe. Species exhibit many different behaviors based on numerous factors from the environment that surrounds them. One species, betta splendins, is well known for displaying territorial behaviors between males. Our study focused on the caudal tail beating and how this behavior changes when the vision between two betta splenden males is frosted. We found that as the level of frosting increased, the number of tail beatings decreased between the males. This conveys that is it essential for the details of the opposing male to be recognized in order to elicit aggressive behavior from either conspecific. This study helps to emphasize the importance of intraspecies physiological and morphological differences in the expression of different behaviors.  

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior, also known as ethology, is aimed at understanding how physiology and morphology inform and shape different behaviors. Even within a single species it is possible to observe differences in behavior in interactions between mates, parents and their young and conspecifics fighting for territory or mating rights to females. One model system that has consistently been used to study aggressive behavior is the Betta fish, or betta splenden. Native to southeastern countries such as Thailand and Vietnam, the betta fish is also bred for use in the aquarium trade. However, it is fairly widely known that these fish are quite territorial. When exposed to other males, betta fish will exhibit a host of aggressive behaviors. One of the most common is a broadside movement where one male will turn sideways to the other and beat or “flick” its caudal fin toward the opponent. While this is only one of many signs of aggression betta fish are known to exhibit, our study will focus on this behavior specifically. Based on previous research by Meliska et. al, betta fish will display this behavior both when looking at themselves in a reflective mirror and when looking at another male through glass [Meliska: 2004]. In the present study we are interested in observing this aggressive behavior and how it changes with increasingly foggy glass partitions placed between two male subjects. We hypothesize that as the fogginess of the partition increases, blurring the view of one male to another, the number of tail beatings displayed by both males will decrease.

Materials and Method:
This experiment used two male betta splendins picked randoMly from a large group. The two males were placed into a three sectioned fish tank, with each section separated by a solid white and clear acrylic divider. Each fish was placed by itself into adjacent sections, with the third section remaining empty for the entirety of the experiment. Both fish were given a three-minute acclimation period where they were allowed to settle into the tank environment. At the end of the acclimation period the solid white divider between the two sections with fish was removed, leaving the clear glass divider. This divider allowed both fish to see each other but not physically interact. The fish were observed for two minutes and the number of tail beatings of each fish were recorded. This motion is generally defined as a concerted, quick flick of the fishes’ caudal fin toward the other fish. Three recorders watched and collected data to reduce variability in the measurement. After the two-minute period the solid white partition was returned so that the fish could no longer see each other. Another two-minute rest period was allowed before removing the white divider and exposing the fish to each other again. After a total of three, two-minute trials with the clear glass divider the same procedure was repeated with a slightly frosted divider and again with an even more frosted divider. Averages and standard deviations were obtained for each trial and paired, two sample t_tests were used to analyze changes of each experimental group from the controll. 

Results:
The mean and standard deviation of the number of caudal tail flips over three tials was calculated for each treatment: controll (clear), Frost 1 and Frost 2. The data was plotted using a bar graph. Two one-tailed, two sample t_tests were used to compare the statisitical significance of the controll group to Frost 1 and Frost 2, respectively. The p_value between controll and Frost 1 was 0.047 and 0.009 between the controll and Frost 2. The data shows that the difference between each group was statistically signficant and that the signficance increased between Frost 1 and Frost 2 when compared to the controll. 

Discussion:
Our results for this experiment support our hypothesis that the aggressive behavior displayed when two betta males are exposed to one another will decrease over time with an increase in the fogginess of the divider between them, blurring their vision. The main behavior that was used to evaluate aggressive behavior in this experiment was tail beating. Compared to controll conditions, where the glass divider between the two fish was completely clear, the number of tails beatings decreased significently (p = 0.047) under the first level of frost (Frost 1) and also under the second level of frost (Frost 2, p=0.009). These results show that direct vision of another male fish is needed to elicit an aggressive behavior. Under the frosted conditions it was possible to see the vague outline of the other male across the divider but colors and details were blurred. According to a study by Allen et al., betta fish will respond aggressively to computer animations of other males that exhibit similar colors and tail features to their natural counterparts. This research is in alignment with what we found in our study, that features such as color and fin shapes are essential in eliciting consistent, aggressive behavior. 
	One future study that would build off the results from this present study would be to test males of different body and fin sizes. Allen et al. also found in their research that there is a correlation between larger fin size and the expression of multiple aggressive behaviors. It would be interesting to investigate whether increasingly large body and fin size of some males causes their conspecifics across the frosted barrier to elicit more aggressive behaviors based on the fact that they would create a larger shadow/outline. Some limitations of our present study that should be addressed in future studies include sample size the diversity of the data points collected. For sample size, using only two fish could create unwanted variables that might skew some of the data. For any future study using multiple fish for observations would probably create more reliable data. In addition, using only tail beatings limits the full spectrum of aggressive behavior that could have been shown between the two males. In the future it would create a more complete and clearer picture to observe multiple different movements when assessing aggressive behavior. Overall, observing this betta spenlendens system shows how morphology ad physiology can impact behavior, even on a relatively simple, small scale.
