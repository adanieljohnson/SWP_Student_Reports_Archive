Title: Effect of color and phenotypic variation on frequency of agnostic behavior in Betta splendins

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of phenotypic variation and color on aggressive behavior in Betta splendins. Our original hypothesis stated that Betta splenden males of the same color will be more aggressive towards each other than towards males of a different color, as males of the same phenotypic appearance present a greater threat in overall mate selection. However, this hypothesis was not supported as the controll trial between males of the same color (blue) elicited a lower frequency of aggressive behaviors than the experimental trial between males of differing colors (red and blue). This may be due to the fact that the red Betta tended to escalate the aggressive behavior of the monitored blue Betta, while the opposing blue Betta in the controll experiment showed little to no aggressive behavior towards the monitored blue Betta. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of intraspecies color on aggressive behavioral patterns in Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish. Betta fish are known for their colorful displays and visual communication patterns that are displayed and used to regulate social action in the presence of members of their own species, an interaction known as intraspecific behavior [Johnson: 2019]. When observing aggressive or “agnostic” intraspecific behavior, movement can be sorted into two categories: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are displayed when a fish turns its side towards an opponent and includes pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing (all increasing in order of aggressiveness). Facing movements occur when a fish faces its opponent directly and includes erection of the pectoral fins, spreading the gill covers (opercula) and protruding the branchiostegal membrane (again all in increasing order of aggressiveness). The last facing movement, the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane, is the most aggressive threat behavior and is used to create a “red mane” used to warn off opponents. Once such agnostic behaviors are displayed, the opposing fish will either ignore the behavior, match it, or escalate it, showing an aggressive behavior at a higher intensity. While these displays are consistent for Betta splendins as a species, they can differ in frequencies, tempos and sequences based on each individual interaction [Laudien: 1965]. These differences can be affected by the gender and color of the opponent, as Betta males often show more frequent displays of aggression towards similarly-colored males than they do towards differently-colored males, and may be classically conditioned to do so [Thompson et. al: 1965]. For this experiment, the controll group will include Bettas of the same coloring and the experimental group will include Bettas of two different colorings, with color acting as the independent variable and frequency of aggressive behavior as the dependent variable. Betta splenden males of the same color will be more aggressive towards each other than towards males of a different color, as males of the same phenotypic appearance present a greater threat in overall mate selection. 


Materials and Method:
Three Betta splendins, two blue and one red, were used to observe the effect of color on aggressive behavior. A small aquarium was compartmentalized into three sections using white plastic dividers, each containing one fish. The fish were visually isolated from each other and monitored for five minutes to observe behavioral patterns without exposure to an opponent. After the isolation observation period was complete, the plastic divider between the two blue fish was lifted and replaced with a clear divider to monitor aggression between the two same-colored Bettas (controll), without any physical interaction. After a five minute test period, the white plastic divider was placed back into the tank and the two fish were given a five minute rest period. The controll experiment was repeated two more times, with intermittent rest periods in between each aggressive interaction. The blue fish that showed the highest frequency of aggressive behavior towards its opponent was then placed in a compartment next to the red fish and monitored for the same frequency of agnostic displays (experimental). A five minute rest period was also given in between interactions, with a total of three experimental observational periods taking place. For both the controll and experimental observations, overall frequency of broadside movements (pelvic tail flickering, tail beating and tail flashing) as well as facing movements (pectoral fins upright, spreading opercula and red mane) were measured and compared for the blue Betta used in both experiments. The data was analyzed using a one-tailed two-sample t_test.

Results:
A one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to analyze the average frequency of aggressive behaviors shown between the controll and experimental groups. It was discovered that the blue Betta elicited a higher frequency of aggressive movements towards the red Betta (experimental) (+/- sd: 15.00) than it did towards the other blue Betta (controll) (+/- sd: 10.67). The monitored blue Betta also had a higher frequency of both broadside behaviors (+/- sd: 8.00) and facing behaviors (+/- sd: 5.60) in the experimental trial, compared to broadside behaviors (+/- sd: 5.00) and facing behaviors (+/- sd: 7.00) in the controll trial. The data was found to be significent for frequency of aggressive movements displayed (p=0.02).  


Discussion:
The original hypothesis stating that Betta splenden males of the same color will be more aggressive towards each other than towards males of a different color, as males of the same phenotypic appearance present a greater threat in overall mate selection, was not supported as the average frequency of aggressive behaviors towards the opponent of a different color (red) was higher than the frequency of aggressive behavior shown towards the opposing male of the same color (blue) (figure 1). This included a higher frequency of both broadside and facing behaviors elicited by the monitored blue Betta (figure 2). However, our null hypothesis was rejected as the data was found to be significent. This result may be due to the fact that the red Betta tended to match and escalate the aggressive behavior shown by the blue Betta in the experimental trials, with both males having spreading gill covers as the most frequent sign of agnostic behavior. In the controll trials, the blue Betta opponent showed little to no movement, let alone agnostic behavior, and often swam into the corner rather than face the monitored blue Betta. During potential conflicts, aggression can be escalated by Betta splenden males if the opponent shows high intensity and is willing to engage in a fight, whereas conflict may de-escalate on both sides if a male is unwilling to fight and is no longer displaying threatening behavior [Bronstein: 1989]. Based on past research, the blue Betta may have elicited a greater number of aggressive responses towards the red Betta as a way to escalate or match the opposing movements, despite phenotypic color differences. Future experiments should be conducted which monitor physical interactions of both blue and red Bettas in the same tank, in order to observe agnostic behavior and potential escalation with increased stimuli, as behaviors may change when facing a physical threat rather than one that has been partially removed through separation. Information Betta splendins and behavioral, ethological studies are important when regarding the physiological purpose behind behaviors such as aggression, and can be used to see how agnostic actions have been shaped by evolution and genetic factors. This information can be used to monitor the differences in behavior between both wild and domesticated Bettas, especially when considering the effect captivity has on animal behavior and aggressive movements.
