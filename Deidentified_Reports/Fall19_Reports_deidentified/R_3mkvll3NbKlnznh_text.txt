Title: The effects of methoprene on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Manduca sexta commonly known as the tobacco hornworms are a pest. Manduca sexta has been a
model organism since the 1960s in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of hormonal controlls
and developmental stages. [Kingslover:2007] It has a holometabolous life cycle that includes four life
stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult stages. This entire process takes about The Manduca sexta’s
life cycle makes it a prime model organism due to the life stages being very distinguishable from one
another. Larvae and adults don not compete for the same resources. Manduca sexta larvae eat leaves
and while adults sip nectar.[Johnson:2019]. Insects generally rely heavily on hormones to dictate
when and how certain developmental stages are reached in their life cycles. Manduca sexta is no
exception, they rely on multiple types of hormones to trigger the progression of life stages. Our focus
will be on Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone(JH). 20E regulates the timing of molting during insect
development and addition functions in adult insects; it is produced in the prothoracic glands. JH is produced mainly in the corpus allata. It regulates the type of molt during development and like E20,
regulates multiple functions in adult insects[Johnson:2019]. Manduca sexta has 5 larval instars, each
separated by molts. Depending on which stages, the Manduca sexta is in the levels of JH and E20
hormone vary. Our biological question is what would occur if Methoprene, an IGR that mimics JH
functions, would affect the development of Manduca sexta. Insect growth regulator (IGR) affect the
growth processes of them. This is relevant due to Manduca sexta is known to be a pest and hindering its
developmental process is extremely important. Why? They can be detrimental to the growth of tobacco
and tomato crops. In previous experiments done by Wolfgang state that the application of a juvenile
hormone analog Methoprene prevented this change in protein synthesis and in lamellar structure by
preventing the observed rise in the intermolt ecdysteroid.[Wolfgang: 1985] In our experiment, we will
observe if Manduca sexta reacts to certain dosages of IGR present in their environment? We
hypothesize that the development of the Manduca sexta that are treated will not grow and reach
developmental stages that are typical for this organism. We will measure this via mass in grams.

Materials and Method:
Prepare containers by puncturing holes in containers to allow airflow for insects. Label containers accordingly 1-4 for the controll and 5-8 for the treatment group. Measure 10 grams of food for each Manduca sexta in a small white container. For the first four caterpillars, when preparing their food in a small white container by adding 10 grams of food, adding 7 drops of water with a pipet, and mix thoroughly. Do the same for the treatment group but with the [Concentration] of the IGR with a clean spoon. Once food has been prepared for each group, the 10 grams of food was clumped together to avoid dehydration. This process was done so for both controll and treatment group accordingly. The Manduca sexta were kept in an incubator to maintain a consistent environment. Each caterpillar must be monitored daily by replacing food with new food, weighing them, and taking note of their physical appearance. A two-sample t_test was done to see if there is a significent difference between both groups.

Results:
Overall there was an upward trend in terms of mass for both the controll and experimental group.
The controll group grew as expected, the color was consistently green, and movement was observable. The experimental group grew at a slower rate than the controll group. Discoloration and limited movement were observed.

Discussion:
Our results do not support our hypothesis due to our p_value being above 0.05. In previous experiments done by Kingsolver and Wolfgang, Methoprene did inhibit Manduca sexta from pupating. There could have not been a significent difference in our results due to not adding enough Methoprene added to the Manduca sexta food. In Kingsolver's experiment, the Manduca sexta were treated with Methoprene grew about 50% larger than expected.[Kingslover:2007]. JH hormone is supposed to hinder pupation and that it did but there was not a major difference between the controll and experimental. Only observable differences were apparent such as color, the Manduca sexta that were treated with Methoprene were pale green while the controll group had a more vibrant green color. To determine the effects of Methoprene on Manduca sexta further experiments with varying concentrations should be conducted in order to learn more as to how much is the appropriate concentration and dosage is required to stop growth in the organism. Although our experiment was unsuccessful there is still much room for improvement to efficiently inhibit the development of Manduca sexta.
There possibly could have been very little methoprene to actually affect the growth of the Manduca sexta, due to the finding the JH hormone does affect growth but given in large amounts that exceed 5 micrograms of methoprene. The Manduca sexta from Kingsolver’s experiment that was treated with methoprene on average grew almost 50% percent larger than they normally would.[Kingsolver:2007
