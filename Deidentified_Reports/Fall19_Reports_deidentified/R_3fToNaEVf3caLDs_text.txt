Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta instars

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, or tobacco horn worm, is a breed of moth found commonly in North America. They are regarded as a pest because they will eat a lot of crops. Hormones play a large role in the growth and maturation process of insects that undergo a complete metamorphosis. Juvenile Hormone, or JH, effects the instars transition to pupa. “[Decline] of JH is a prerequisite for pupation” [Nijhout: 1974]. JH levels drop in instars as they reach pupation, and then disappear entirely. Methoprene is a JH analog [Satyanrayana: 1994]. 
In this lab, the effects of excessive JH on instars will be tested. If Manduca sextas are treated with 10 drops of JH analog, Methoprene, in their food, then there will be a negative effect on their transition to pupal stage and they will lose weight. 


Materials and Method:
Our independent variable for this study is the presence of Methoprene, a synthetic JH, in the experimental groups food. To track its effects, the caterpillars will be weighed daily. Controls for this experiment are the amount of food given, 10 g, the size of the container, and location in an incubator. 
	To begin the experiment we randoMly selected four controll and four experimental caterpillars from a communal supply. They were weight and assigned to their designated box and labeled accordingly. Next the food was prepared, 10 g of caterpillar food for each caterpillar. The controll had 10 drops of water mixed with their food and the experimental has 10 drops of Methoprene (concentration). For the next 14 days the caterpillars were weighed daily, containers cleaned of poop, and were given food when food seemed dry or gone. 
	At the end of data collection, the total growth of each caterpillar was calculated, and an average was derived for the growth of the controll and experimental group. A p test was then run to determine the probability the difference was due to chance or significent. 


Results:
The total weight changes for each caterpillar were calculated and then the total weight change for each group was averaged. The controll group had an average total weight change of 14.1g with a standard deviation of 0.66. The experimental group had an average total weight change of 13.1g with a standard deviation of 1.52. 
To test if the difference in average growth for the groups was due to change a P test was used. The degrees of freedom for the data was 6. The one tailed p_value was 0.171. This shows that our difference was not more than 95% significent. 
This graph shows the weight of the caterpillars in a regression of time. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis JH in the food will make the caterpillars lose weight and have an overall negative effect on pupation was not supported by the date. The data did show a difference in the average weight between the two groups but this difference was not significent, therefore the hypothesis was not supported. Some factors that could have affected this outcome is that the study did not go on long enough to observe the caterpillars begin to pupate. Another study, however, found the deadly effect of Methoprene on Manduca sexta did not significently affect them until they were in the pupation stage. “Treated larvae did not show any delay in pupation (pupation on day 9), and the resulting pupae were normal in appearance. (However, all pupae underwent a second pupal molt within 10 days after pupation and subsequently died)” [Satyanarayana: 1994]. This means had our study gone on for longer, it is possibly the caterpillars in the experimental group would die once they underwent pupation. 
Although the averages in weight gain did not show a significent difference, the line graph tracking each caterpillars growth over the two weeks shows the experimental group had a larger weight gap with the controll group around days 7 to 11, only after catching up more. “The corpora allata cease to secrete JH when the larvae attain a weight of approximately 5 g” [Nijhout: 1974]. This would have happened on days 8 through 12 for our caterpillars. Around this time the growth per day appears to grow steadily upward. 
In conclusion, studying insect hormones can be an effective way of controllling insect populations, and therefore protect crops against pests.
