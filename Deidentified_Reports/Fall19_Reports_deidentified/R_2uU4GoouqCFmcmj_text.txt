Title: The Effects of Precor on the Pupation of the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab was to determine the effect insect growth regulators (IGRs) have on the psychological regulatory development that is significent for the growing of insects.  IGRs such as ecdysterone and juvenile hormone can potentially result in abnormalities that reduce the possibilities of survival by blocking the hormones. [Tunaz, 2004] The hornworm caterpillar, Manduca Sexta, is being used in this experiment to test hormone regulation of insect development. The Meduca Sexta goes through eight life cycle stages in which these insects go from eggs, to 5 instar larvae, to pupa, and finally to adult. [Johnson,  2019] This insect is classified as holometabolous which means the insect changes form all together when it goes through metamorphosis to mature from juvenile to adult. Metamorphosis is used in the transition from larval stage to pupa stage. This pupa stage is the one in which is just before the becoming of an adult. [Johnson,  2019] During the last stage of development, undergoing molting requires the presence of ecdysteroids and a depletion of juvenile hormone. [Dhadialla, 1998] Juvenile hormones are responsible for the repressing of the secretion of ecdysones and allows for growth until the insect is able to reach its appropriate adulthood. Thus, in this experiment, a juvenile hormone of Precor will be used to in turn test the result of juvenile inhibition on caterpillar’s growth to the stage of adult. The hypothesis of this experiment is that the juvenile hormone, Precor, will be used to advance the weight of the caterpillars in juvenile while also inhibiting the growth of the caterpillars beyond the stage of being an adult. This will be done so through the feeding of half the caterpillars food mixed with Precor and the other half being fed food mixed with just water.


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca Sexta larvae were randoMly assigned and separated into two groups of controll and treatment, 4 of which are in each group. Each group of four was split into two plastic containers separating each caterpillar. All eight Manduca Sexta larvae were weighed to record the original starting weight. The first group of caterpillars were fed food mixed with 5 drops of Precor 1: 1250 added and mixed together. The second group was fed the same food instead mixed with 5 drops of water. Each day for two weeks, a group member went to the lab to replenish the food as well as add the drops. The group member changing the food also weighed the caterpillars and documented the results on the shared spreadsheet. This is the way in which information and data were shared efficiently with everyone. After the data was collected, a two-sample t_test was performed to determine significance of the experiment through a p_value.


Results:
Throughout the two weeks of feeding and observing the Manduca Sexta caterpillars, obvious changes became clear in their appearance and weight. Original observations of our particular caterpillars include soft, sticky, and light green. As the weeks continued, observations were made on the drastic changes that continued to occur. The Manduca Sexta caterpillars that were fed food mixed with Precor grew considerably more than the Manduca Sexta caterpillars fed food mixed with water. The caterpillars fed food mixed with Precor grew to appear swollen to which they doubled in size. The final observations of the caterpillars were drastic size growth as well as stiffness and swelling of the overall body.
Figure 1 displays the average weight data recorded from day one until day fourteen. The data showed continual growth in weight between both groups of caterpillars. The red plot and line indicated the experimental averages while the blue plots and line indicated the controll averages. The total average for the controll group was 5.74 grams with a standard deviation of 3.98. The total average for the experimental group was 9.01grams with a standard deviation of 6.07. A two-sample t_test was performed on the average data and that p_value was 0.046227. This is lower than 0.5 and therefore means that the growth of the two groups was significently different at the 95% confidence interval.

Discussion:
Based on the statistical test for significance, the null hypothesis was accepted. It can thus be concluded that Precor does in fact enhance the increasing weight of juvenile Manduca Sexta caterpillars while also inhibiting its growth into an adult. The Precor blocks the levels of endocrine which induces molting. With this blocked, the caterpillars are able to grow and increase in weight without going into the last stage of development; adult. The experimental group showed drastic swelling which has to do with the effect of hormonal blocking and increasing. [Hughes, 1989] If this experiment was done again, our group could increase the number of Precor drops from 5 to 10. These results could be compared to ultimately determine how much the weight of the caterpillars can be increased while also inhibiting the final stage of development. With this conclusion being made, scientists can now further research to study the larval cycle in the development of insects.
