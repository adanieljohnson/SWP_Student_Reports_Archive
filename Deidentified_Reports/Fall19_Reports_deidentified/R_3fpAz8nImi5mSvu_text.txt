Title: The effects of increased salinity on photosystem II activity in Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts

Abstract:
Photosystem II is a vital component of the photosynthetic process, necessary for the maintained metabolic function of photoautotrophs, which can be influenced by environmental factors. An increase in salinity levels could disrupt photosystem II function in the chloroplast, causing decreased levels of activity over time. Three test sets were prepared, one control and two varied treatment groups, to test the effects of increased salinity on photosystem II function in the chloroplast of in Spinacia oleracea, S. oleracea. The collected data was analyzed to observe the change in activity over time and comparing trends to determine significant differences. The results showed that there were significant differences in the percent change of photosystem II activity levels over time between each test group. There was little change in the trends of the control group, while both treatment groups showed significant change in activity over time. These trends of change in activity level in the treatment groups support the hypothesis that increased salinity will inhibit functions of photosystem II in the chloroplast which will result in decreased activity. 

Introduction:
Photoautotrophs are dependent on photosynthetic processes to maintain vital metabolic functions and harvest energy which fuels all activity within the organism. Among these processes is photosystem II, a key component of photosynthesis that influences the function of many other metabolic components [Johnson:2018]. Photosystem II, however, can also be affected by numerous environmental factors that necessitate a maintained state of homeostasis in photoautotrophic organisms [Johnson:2018]. Given the wide variety of different biomes and ecosystems which are host to innumerous autotropic species, the optimal abiotic factors of each organism differ greatly by the environment, but still, require their ideal environment for maintained performance [Yan:2012]. This is apparent in Spinacia oleracea, S. oleracea, known widely as common spinach which has its own specific range of optimal environmental factors to grow and develop [Johnson:2018]. One significant abiotic factor that affects autotrophs regardless of the environment is salinity, the density of salt present in a given environment. The varying levels of salinity in different environments can drastically impact ecosystems and the organisms within, including photoautotrophs [Chen:2019]. An excess or deficiency of salinity in a particular environment can affect the chemical reactions occurring in the metabolism of an organism, leading to imbalanced chemical gradients and inhibition of certain functions [Chen:2019]. This experiment seeks to quantitatively analyze the activity of photosystem II under the effects of varying levels of salinity and over time to observe the impact of suboptimal salinity on this metabolic process. It is hypothesized that increased levels of salinity will negatively affect the photosystem II processes in S. oleracea, leading to a greater change in activity as activity decreases over time.

Materials and Methods:
The chloroplasts of S. oleracea leaves were tested in three parts, the control, and two treatment groups, to determine the effect of salinity on photosystem II activity. All samples were tested simultaneously to assure identical external conditions. Prior to the beginning, all materials and solutions were kept on ice to maintain a cold environment which would preserve the chloroplasts throughout the experiment. To prepare the sample, a handful of destemmed, deveined S. oleracea leaves were initially ground using a mortar and pestle, mixing in 10 mL of grinding buffer and adding as needed to produce a thin paste. The slurry was strained through layered cheesecloth, yielding about 15 mL. This first sample was run in a centrifuge at 1200 rmp for 3 minutes at 4℃ with a balance. Once the cycle had completed, the pellet was separated from the supernatant, and the liquid was again run through the centrifuge at 2800 rmp for 10 minutes at 4℃ with a balance. The pellet removed from the liquid following the second centrifuge cycle was used as the sample to test photosystem II activity due to a high density of chloroplast and relatively low debris content. This pellet was prepared by gently mixing with 20 mL of grinding buffer before transferring 200 μl into a microtube and being put on ice. To measure photosystem II activity, three triplicates of samples were prepared in addition to a blank sample. The two treatment solutions were first prepared from a stock concentration of NaCl, diluting each to produce a 0.3 NaCl solution and a 0.8 NaCl solution. Ten test tubes were individually prepared with one for the blank solution and a triplicate set for each of the testing solutions, the water control as well as the 0.3 NaCl and 0.8 NaCl treatments (Table 1). Once each tube sample was prepared, 100 μl of the chloroplast sample was added and mixed gently. All samples were tested immediately using a spectrophotometer set to 600 nm. Each sample was then additionally tested in 10-minute intervals for 20 minutes at 600 nm and all data was recorded. Between tests, all samples were kept at room temperature under a 1786.81 lux light source. The collected data were analyzed by calculating percent change at 10 minutes and 20 minutes to assess change over time and an ANOVA test was used to determine statistical significance. 

Results:
The difference in photosystem II activity of S. oleracea chloroplasts at varying levels of salinity was statistically significant regarding both the percent change in activity over time (p-value: 0.03) and the different activity levels of each individual sample set. The percent change in the control group was 10.75 ± 7.96 at 10 minutes and 9.35 ± 9.33 at 20 minutes (Figure 1). The percent change in the treatment groups for 0.3 NaCl was 25.12 ± 3.68 at 10 minutes and 34.14 ± 7.06 at 20 minutes and for 0.8 NaCl group was 17.27 ± 5.16 at 10 minutes and 16.09 ± 4.73 at 20 minutes (Figure 1).  

Discussion:
The hypothesis that an increase in salinity levels would decrease activity in S. oleracea chloroplasts over time was supported by the findings. The collected data shows that over time, while the control had little change in activity level, both treatment groups had statistically significant changes in photosystem II activity. While initially, the data points show the 0.3 NaCl treatment solution as having a greater change in activity than the 0.8 NaCl treatment group, this can be explained upon further analysis [Gong:2008]. It is likely that, due to the time it takes to initially prepare test samples for spectrophotometer testing, the NaCl solutions had already begun to affect the photosystem II activity during the immediate test. Given this, the more extreme 0.8 NaCl solution could have significantly affected activity in the chloroplasts, leading to less percent change over time as it had such a quick effect [Gong:2008]. Comparatively, the more moderate 0.3 NaCl solution could have taken longer to decrease activity, causing the change to be shown over time, as opposed to immediately [Gong:2008]. This experiment could potentially be improved if performed with a method of absorbance testing that required less preparation time to observe a more accurate initial baseline which would give a more precise change over time. The control test using only water shows little tends of change over time as standard photosystem II activity was maintained and not hindered by the level of salinity in water. These findings are supported by previous studies and reiterate the importance of environmental conservation, not only of biotic life but of abiotic elements in changing ecosystems as these changes over time can lead to greater effects on plant life and other photoautotrophs [Neale:1989]. It is concluded that fluctuations in environmental saline levels can affect the photosystem II activity within chloroplasts of photoautotrophs, potentially leading to a cascade effect which limits other vital metabolic functions to the detriment of the organism. This experiment could be expanded upon by including more plant varieties with differing saline optima to observe if certain plants could have greater ranges of livable salinity levels or reactions to changes in environmental salinity.
