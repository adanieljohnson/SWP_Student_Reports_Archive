Title: Effects of Excess Magnesium on Photosynthesis in Vigna Radiata

Abstract:
Plants require a particular concentration of Magnesium to grow properly. Mg content below this critical value causes Magnesium deficiency, and above this value, Magnesium toxicity. Magnesium is important for plant growth because it is essential to photosynthesis. It coordinates the porphyrin ring of chlorophyll, and without it, chlorophyll lacks its characteristic dark green color, an important characteristic in the plants’ ability to capture sunlight for ATP production. This study looked at the effects of Mg toxicity on the mungbean plant (Vigna radiata) predicting that excess Mg would cause stunted growth and increased leaf wilting compared to a control. After 14 days, we found that the experimental group exhibited signs of Mg toxicity, such as wilted leaves and decreased overall growth. The mass of the experimental group was significantly lower than the control, and the percentage of wilted leaves was lower in the control group, but not significantly. These finding show that magnesium toxicity can occur when small amounts are administered to a plant over an extended window, and that Mg toxicity or deficiency need not be limited to soil Magnesium content. 

Introduction:
The Mungbean (Vigna radiata) is a warm weather legume, of which over 12 million tons are harvested annually. [Kang: 2014] Due to a high protein and nutrient content compared to other legumes and ability to fix nitrogen into soil, the mungbean is an important staple crop. [Kang: 2014] The mungbean is easy to grow, and requires little maintenance, making it an ideal model for this study. To test our hypothesis, we administered magnesium to a group of three mungbean plants for two weeks and compared these plants to a control group We predicted that lack of magnesium would cause the leaves of mungbean plants to wilt and have overall lack of growth. 
It is well known that Magnesium is essential for photosynthesis in plants, and without it, they cannot photosynthesize. [Farhat: 2016] Mg is necessary to give a chlorophyll its characteristic dark green color that allows for maximum absorbance of solar energy in the form of photonic excitation inside of the thylakoid membrane—the impetus of the electron transport chain that allows plants to perform autotrophy. [Dean: 2006] A decrease in photosynthesis in a plant will limit chemical energy available for growth. A decrease in magnesium should render leaves useless to a plant as they will be unable to contribute to the photosynthetic pathway and wilt. In summary, one can infer that a deficiency in magnesium will cause a decrease in photosynthetic activity, which we predict to cause lower growth rates, and wilting of leaves in our control group. 


Materials and Methods:
Following To test our hypothesis we first potted six (6) mungbean plants with ten seeds per pot in approximately 250mL of vermiculite. We added 20 mL of Miracle-Gro to each plant before watering all six plants with tap water on day 0. These six plants were divided into two groups of three plants each, experimental and control and placed into a greenhouse where they received approximately 12 hours of sunlight per day. For days 1-13, both groups were watered 150mL per day; however, the control group received tap water (150mL) and the experimental group received 2x MgSO₄ (150mL). Plants were photographed after watering. On day 14, the plants were collected from the greenhouse, removed from their soil, and the following data was collected: number of total leaves per pot, number of wilted  leaves per pot, and average mass of three plants from each pot representative of the entire pot. To measure the mass of the plants, the soil was removed from the roots by supersaturating the soil in a bucket of water. This released the roots from the soil, allowing them also to be washed and cleaned of any residual soil and dried before calculating the mass of plants. The total mass and percent wilted leaves were measured as indirect representations of photosynthetic activity as related to Mg availability to the plant. Percent wilted leaves was calculated by counting the total number of leaves per pot, as well as the number of wilted leaves per plant and representing the wilted leaves a ratio of the total leaves to account for total leaf number variability between pots. Total mass was calculated of three representative plants from each pot, which were then averaged. The averages for each pot were used in statistical analyses. The collected data, total mass and percent wilted leaves, were analyzed by separate two-sample t-tests assuming equal variances to determine significance of data. (α=0.05) 

Results:
The control group had lower average percentage of leaves as shown in Figure 2; however, there was no significant difference between the percentage of wilted leaves between the two groups (t(4)=-2.54, p=0.064). As shown in Figure 1, the control group had significantly higher whole plant mass (t(4)=9.43, p&lt;0.001).

Discussion:
The data from both the wilted leaves and total mass do not support our alternate hypothesis, rather our null hypothesis. While there was significant difference between the mass of the control and experimental groups, it was the opposite of what we predicted. Guo et al found that concentrations of more than 20mM of Mg caused phenotypic changes in Arabidopsis thaliana. [Guo: 2015] While we do not know the exact concentration of MgSO4 used in this experiment, as it was only labeled 2X, we assume that it was above the upper threshold of Mg soil concentrations found in nature (125µM-8.5mM). [Guo:2015] The research of Guo et al shows that for A. thaliana, a model organism for plants, there is an optimum Mg concentration for growth of 1.5mM, and that any values above or below this can cause either Mg toxicity or deficiency. [Guo: 2015] While we had predicted to observe signs of Mg deficiency in our control group, we may have seen signs of Mg toxicity in our experimental group in the form of stunted growth. Most of the leaves of the experimental group were wilted, but more importantly, had a white crystalline substance on them. It is possible that the excess Mg was partially removed from the plants at their leaves, in a similar manner to the desalination mechanism of the mangrove (Bruguiera parviflora), which excretes excess NaCl onto its leaves to be washed away by rainfall. [Parida: 2004]
 	We had predicted that the control group would display signs of Mg deficiency, such as drooping wilted leaves and stunted growth. This was not the case, and likely due to the fact that the MiracleGro administered to both groups on Day 0 likely had enough Mg to support the growth of the control, and that Vermiculite is a magnesium containing crystal. [Abollino: 2008] An interesting finding noted on Day 14 is that the higher up the leaves were on stocks of plants in the control group, the lighter their color was, and the more wilted they became (see Figure 3). Further experimentation with sub-critical concentrations of Mg is necessary to determine whether these newer leaves exhibit such phenotypic variation compared to the lower, older leaves as a result of decreased Mg content in the soil at the time they budded. All of the leaves of the experimental group were darker in appearance. It cannot be concluded from the data whether this was the result of Mg toxicity, or simply a lack of growth. Excess Mg has been shown to inhibit the uptake of other ions such as Ca+ or K+, and our results may not be the result of too high magnesium, but the interference of magnesium with these ions. [Guo:2015]
A future direction for this research could involve the replication of this study in hydroponic media, allowing for more precise control of the concentrations of Mg ions available to each plant because, although the vermiculite soil used is low in nutrients, it likely had enough Mg to support the growth of the control group.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 shows the average mass of the average mass per plant for the control and experimental groups. Error bars represent ± one standard deviation from mean. Mass is measured in grams. Experimental group significantly lower in mass than control (p&lt;0.001)
Figure 2 shows a the averages of the ratio of wilted to total leaves for the control and experimental groups. Error bars represent ± one standard deviation from the mean. No statistical difference between groups (p=0.064)
Figure 3 shows the plants on September 23, 2019 (Day 13). The lack of growth as well as darker colored leaves is clearly visible in the three experimental pots on the bottom. In the control group, one can also note the increased wrinkling and lighter color in higher and presumably younger leaves. *************************************************************************
