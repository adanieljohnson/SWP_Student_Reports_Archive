Title: The Effect of Nitrogen on Fagopyrum esculentum Resource Allocation

Abstract:
This experiment tests the effect of root-to-shoot length ratio and root-to-shoot weight ratio in Fagopyrum esculentum as an indicator of resource allocation. The lack of significent results failed to support the hypothesis that the root-to-shoot length and weight ratios would be lower in plants grown in nitrogen-rich soil. 

Introduction:
	Plants allocate energy and resources to developing certain anatomical features based on their environment [Chapin: 1987]. In environments that are limited in a certain resource, plants will allocate more nutrients and energy to developing the anatomical feature responsible for collecting that limited environmental resource. It follows, then, that plants allocate less energy to the anatomical component responsible for collecting a certain resource in environments where that resource is abundant. 
This experiment will test this assumption on Fagopyrum esculentum, or as it more commonly known, Buckwheat. As a high protein food source, Buckwheat is an important crop in the scope of global food production [Sure: 1955]. Knowing how to manipulate the development of different anatomical features, then, could make a contribution to the international challenge of feeding the world. One way to measure the effect of an environmental resource on resource allocation within an organism is to comparatively assess the development of roots and shoots when the environment is changed. In this experiment, the dependent variables of root-to-shoot weight ratio and root-to-shoot length ratio were measured to assess the effect of the independent variable, the addition of nitrogen into the soil of the treatment buckwheat plants. It was hypothesized that the root to shoot weight ratio and root-to-shoot length ratio would both be larger in the treatment plants, to which nitrogen was added, than the controll plants, to which no additional nitrogen was added. This prediction was made based on the idea that in nitrogen rich environments, F esculentum would allocate less resources to the anatomical feature responsible for the uptake of nitrogen, the roots.


Materials and Method:
5 Fagopyrum esculentum seeds were planted into each of 10 pots, about 2 inches under the soil. The pots were randoMly divided into a controll group and a treatment group, each with 5 pots. All pots were watered daily, and 200Ml of N2 solution was added to each treatment pot daily. On the 14th day, all of the plants of the controll group were removed from the pots and five were randoMly selected for measurement. The mass and length of the root and shoot for each of the 5 replicates were measured and recorded. Then, the root-to-shoot length ratio and the root-to-shoot weight ratio was performed for each replicate. The same procedure was repeated for the treatment group. At the end of data collection, a two-sample t test was performed on the root-to-shoot weight ratios of the controll and treatment groups and another was performed on the root-to-shoot length ratio of the controll and treatment groups.

Results:
The mean root-to-shoot weight ratio was higher in the controll group than in the treatment group. The one-tailed p_value for this was 0.1177. The mean root-to-shoot length ratio was higher in the treatment group than in the controll, with a one-taied p_value of 0.3016.



Discussion:
With the one-tailed p_values for the root-to-shoot ratio for both weight and length being greater than 0.05, the results of the two-sample t_test are insignificent and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
