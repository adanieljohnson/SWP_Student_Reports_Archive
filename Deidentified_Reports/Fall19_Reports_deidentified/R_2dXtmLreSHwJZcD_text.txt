Title: The Effects of High Concentrations of Salt on Leaf Surface Area in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied the effects of a 6M saline solution on the leaf surface area of Vigna radiata, commonly called mung bean plants.  We hypothesized that the mean surface area of V. radiata plants given a 6M saline solution over two weeks would be smaller than that of the control group. We watered three trays of the control group with 150 mL of freshwater every day, and we watered the experimental group with 150 mL of the 6M saline solution every day for this period of time. Since the concentration of the saline solution was high, we expected the water potential to be lower in the roots than in the leaves. As a result, water would be drawn from the leaves toward the roots, decreasing the amount of water being transported to the leaves. Our data did not support our hypothesis. Our two-sample p-value was very high, implying that the control and experimental groups were not statistically significantly different. 


Introduction:
Vigna radiata, or the mung bean plant, is a member of the legume family and is mainly cultivated in Southeast Asia [Kang: 2014]. Some characteristics of these plants are the presence of wide, flat leaves and long green pods of beans. The wide leaves characteristic of V. radiata were useful in this experiment, as the main variable being measured was leaf surface area. This type of legume is distinctive of others because it is relatively tolerant of changes in salinity and salt stress [Rao: 2016]. In this experiment, we tested the effects of a solution with a high concentration of salt on the leaf surface area of V. radiata. The purpose of the experiment was to determine how V. radiata alters its resource allocation in response to a hypertonic environment. The purpose of this experiment was also to determine how tolerant V. radiata is to the environmental stress of soil salinity. Using our knowledge of water potential and water transport in plants, we hypothesized that the experimental group, the collection of V. radiata plants given the 6M salt solution, would have a smaller mean leaf surface area than the control group, the collection of V. radiata plants given freshwater. We expected the salt solution to have a lower water potential and higher concentration of solutes than the roots. As a result, water would be drawn from the roots by osmosis and the leaves of V. radiata plants would receive less water. This decrease in water transport to the leaves would cause them to decrease in size and shrivel. Water transport in plants is dependent on the cohesiveness of water and water potential. Water transport in plants relies upon the difference in water potentials between the roots and leaves because the low water potential of leaves causes water to move from the roots to the leaves [Boyer: 1968]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the mean surface area of the V. radiata plants given a 6M saline solution over two weeks would be smaller than that of the control group and expected the saline solution to disrupt the water transport process in this species. By analyzing the effects of different saline solutions on V. radiata leaf surface area, we can determine how tolerant this species is to changes in salinity and how disruptive salt solutions are to the process of water transport in these plants. 


Materials and Methods:
In this lab, we planted 15 Vigna radiata seeds in six different trays. We labeled three of the trays control and the other three experimental. The trays were kept in a greenhouse. Every day at 4:00 PM 150 mL of freshwater was given to each plant in the control group. The experimental group plants were given 150 mL of a prepared 6M salt solution at 4:00 PM every day. The experiment was two weeks long, so each plant was watered 14 times. We used two separate beakers to measure each solution. After two weeks, we collected all of the plants and measured the largest leaf from each plant in each tray was cut off. We took the largest leaf of each plant in each tray, because it would be too tedious to measure every single leaf on each plant. We used 0.5 cm by 0.5 cm grid paper to measure the surface area of each leaf. We traced the edges of each leaf on the grid paper and counted the number of boxes within the borders. We recorded the mean leaf surface area for each tray. We calculated and compared the means of each treatment group as well as those of each individual tray.  We used a two-tailed two-sample t-test to compare the mean leaf surface area of the control and experimental group.


Results:
As can be seen in Figure 1, the mean leaf surface area of the control group was smaller than that of the experimental group. One of the control trays had Vigna radiata plants that were almost dead. They were pale and shriveled. The leaf surface area of this tray was 2.375 cm2, which was about one cm2 lower than all of the other control trays and experimental trays. This tray was accidentally given 150 mL of pH 4.5 buffer one of the 14 days. The other control group trays contained plants that looked similar to the experimental group plants. These plants were about eight cm high and their leaves were green and full. The two-tailed p-value was 0.270. 


Discussion:
The data does not support our hypothesis. The saline solution appeared to have no effect on the Vigna radiata plants. As mentioned before, the two-tailed p-value was high. This indicates that there is no significant difference between the two groups’ means. Our results imply that the concentration of salt in a solution given to V. radiata plants has no significant effect on their leaf surface area. Even though the mean leaf surface area of the control experimental group was larger than that of the control group, it was not statistically significantly larger. We accidently watered one of the control trays with 150 mL of a pH 4.5 solution on one of the days. This may have caused the plants in this tray to die. According to a University of Wisconsin-Madison study, V. radiata prefers soil environments above a pH of 6.3 [Doll: 1990]. As a result, the plants in that tray may have been unable to survive an environment with such a low pH. Excluding the mean leaf surface area of this tray from the total control group mean, would shift the mean from 3.35 cm2 to 3.84cm2 and reduce the high standard deviation as depicted in Figure 1. The new mean is still very close to that of the experimental group, 4.14 cm2. In addition, the control group plants were not in the sun for as long as the experimental groups. As I watered the plants at 4:00 PM, I noticed that the control group plants were in the shade while the experimental group plants were in direct sunlight. I was unable to move the container holding all of the plants, as the table was filled with other groups’ samples. This may have allowed the experimental group to be more productive, as they had a longer period to perform photosynthesis. Looking at the results of the experiment, it appears that V. radiata is tolerant to environments with high concentrations of salt. It also appears that it is able to allocate water regularly in these environments. The results of this experiment conflict with those of an experiment performed in 2019 testing the effects of salinity stress, using 250 mM salt solutions, on V. radiata. In this experiment, there was a decrease in water content of the V. radiata plants and an increase in root:shoot ratio, indicating that this species is not very salt tolerant [Alharby: 2019]. In a subsequent experiment, a solution with a higher salt concentration can be used. In addition, more attention can be made to what solution is being used to water the plants. The tray containing the plants subjected to the pH 4.5 solution is an example of what can happen if the wrong solution is used. Testing the salinity tolerance of V. radiata is important because it is an important crop throughout Southeast Asia. Changes in salinity can cause disruptions in agriculture [Rao: 2016]. According to our results, salinity does not have a significant impact on leaf surface in V. radiata, contradicting the results of past experiments like Alharby’s experiment. Our data implies that salinity may not be a factor that farmers should consider when they plant V. radiata plants.
