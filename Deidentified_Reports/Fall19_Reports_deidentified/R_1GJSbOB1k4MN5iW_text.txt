Title: The Effect of Fish Cutouts on Habituation Levels of Betta splendins

Abstract:
How fish respond to certain stimuli has questioned scientists for years. In this experiment, we ask if a male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins) shows similar aggressive behavior to blue cutouts of fish in different shapes. We want to see if the fish can distinguish between these shapes and if the red mane is a true aggressive trigger for these fish. Our findings demonstrate the fish’s ability to not distinguish between these different cutouts and does not habituate in any of the trials. Due to the results being statistically insignificent, the null hypothesis is accepted.


Introduction:
The response fish have to certain stimuli is significent in an organism’s fitness in its community. These behavioral responses that fish have allow them to protect themselves against others and reproduce successfully. In this experiment, the effect of changing the shape of the cutout fish is analyzed. Understanding how fish react to certain stimuli and environmental conditions Is important to understanding evolutionary biology in terms of behavior. In other words, we want to see and understand their world as they see it and try to explain the evolutionary basis for their behavior. The target species in this lab is Betta splendins, which originated in Southeast Asia [Ramos: 2019]. The study of animal behavior is known as ethology, and it brings together observational skills from natural history and laboratory method. In addition, ethology combines theories from ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology. Most of the time, behaviors are thought of in isolation to each other. But it is important to see how these behaviors have been shaped by evolution and natural selection. With these fish, habituation, or fish showing a decreased response to a repeated stimulus, can be measured easily because they don’t depend wholly on their gills [Johnson: 2016]. Rather, if they need air because of exhaustion or fatigue, they come to the surface. In addition, Betta splendins are known to show aggression and they have been selected across centuries for paired-stage fights [Ramos: 2019]. Because these fish are known to be aggressive, any signs of habituation will be easily detected in the fish. In order to fully collect data for the experiment, specific aggressive behaviors of fish need to be analyzed and observed. It is useful to know key actions and signs of behavior of these fish before starting the experiment. Specific signs of aggression include flapping of the pectoral fins, tail fluttering, exposing the red mane, and swimming up for air [Javanshir: 2019]. We are asking how habituation is affected depending on the shape of the cutout fish. And in addition, if the shape of the fish creates anymore aggression in the fish. It is hypothesized that the fish will habituate the least when exposed to the most realistic cutout fish. 


Materials and Method:
One male Betta splendins fish was acquired and placed into a fish tank. A most realistic fish with a red mane, a round-fin fish with a red mane, and a realistic fish without a red mane were cut out. So, there should be three main cut outs. The male fish was exposed to each of the three cut out shapes. First, the fish was exposed to the most realistic fish with the red mane. In this process, the fish was left in the fish tank and the cutout fish was planted up against the outside portion of the tank wall along the glass. The fish was introduced to the realistic cut out with the red mane for five minutes, and then the fish was given a five-minute rest. This was then repeated for the round-fin with red mane and the realistic fish without a red mane cutouts. The fish was exposed to each cutout in three separate trials. During this procedure, the rate of habituation was measured by measuring the total duration of aggressive behavior that the fish showed towards each cutout. An ANOVA test will be used to analyze the data.


Results:
The total average duration of aggressive behavior for shape 1 was 287 seconds out of a possible 300 seconds. The total average duration for shape 2 was 288 seconds, and the total average duration for shape 3 was 289 seconds. The standard deviation for shape 1 was 15.37. The standard deviation for shape 2 was 11.53. The standard deviation for shape 3 was 2.52. The degrees of freedom were 2 and the p_value was 0.959.


Discussion:
The null hypothesis is accepted due to the p_value of 0.959. The results are statistically insignificent. In other words, the shape of the fish cutout had no statistically significent effect on the habituation of the Betta splendins male fish. The alternative hypothesis is rejected. In merely every trial of all three shapes (realistic, round-fin, and realistic without red mane), the male fish showed a long duration of aggressive behavior towards the cutout shapes. During this time, the fish tilted its body slightly downwards, slapped its tail around, fully flourished its red mane, fluttered its pectoral fins, and swam up to the surface for air. In a study performed by Dzieweczynski in 2018, they found how an antiandrogen affected the original behavior of Betta splendins. They found that these same aggressive effects took place in the controll group (unaffected) [Dzieweczynski: 2018]. This behavior was definitely an aggressive action by the fish in response to the shape. Interestingly enough, the fish reacted to every shape regardless of the red mane showing. This was another biological question before starting the lab. We also wanted to see if the red mane had any effect on the fish’s aggressive behavior. From our data, the red mane alone was not responsible for the aggressive response since the fish was aggressive the realistic fish without the red mane. In other words, the fish reacted to the blue cutout shape alone. In a study performed by Neri in 2019, scientists explained how we have limited knowledge about complex visual representations. In the specific case of these Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins), it is unknown whether they can represent much more than mere color and size [Neri: 2019]. They found that fighting fish can integrate different features like shape and motion for visually guided behavior. The fish in their experiment used the shapes and motions of other organisms in order to recognize predators. In our experiment, the red mane was tested as a visual stimulus, and it showed to not have an effect. And the male fish may have shown aggression merely based off the shape or color of the fish itself. Therefore, our male fish merely responded to the cutout stimulus, and the red mane was not a determining feature for aggressive behavior. Our experiment determined that the blue color most likely stimulated an aggressive response. Further testing should be done if the fish would have responded aggressively to a large rectangle blue cutout, or something that looks nothing like a Betta splendins. Interestingly, the fish rarely habituated during the experimental trials. Further testing should be done to see if the fish would have habituated after a longer period of time, like ten minutes. Further experimentation should also be done with different cutout colors and larger and smaller shapes to certainly verify how these Siamese fighting fish respond to different kinds of stimuli.
