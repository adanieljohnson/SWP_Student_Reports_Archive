Title: The Effects of Excess Water on the Growth of Morphological Characteristics in Vigna radiata 

Abstract:
Vigna radiata (mung bean) is a crop grown throughout the world for nutritional and medicinal use. Mung beans absorb moisture through their roots, which vary in length and volume. Abiotic and biotic factors alter the morpho-physiological characteristics in bean sprout. During development, the quantity of water might affect energy allocation: variations in environmental conditions can promote phenotypic variability. The effect of excess water level on developing mung bean sprouts is unclear. The objective of this study was to observe the influence of water level on mung bean energy allocation, as measured by the ratio of root size to shoot size, length and weight. It was hypothesized that mung bean sprouts treated with excess water would have higher growth in their roots relative to shoots, due to the incremental value of moisture in the soil. The variation in water quantity between mung bean sprouts did not significently alter the root:shoot ratio after two weeks of treatment. When grown under conditions with low-nutrient soil and constant water supply, a surplus of water does not appear to cause differential root:shoot growth. 


Introduction:
Due to its high nutritional content and sweet flavor, mung bean (Vigna radiata) is cultivated in human agriculture. Mung bean is a legume crop with a short life span grown in Asia, southern Europe, and warmer parts of the United States  [Yi-Shen: 2018].  Mung beans have been shown to possess medicinal properties, such as anti-diabetic effects [Tang: 2014]. Environmental stress factors, such as limited water and low-nutrients, expose bean sprouts to adverse developmental conditions, impairing their ability to consume resources in the future. The high level of environmental instability caused by climate change has contributed to decreased mung bean production worldwide [Sehrawat: 2019]. Uncovering the influence of various abiotic factors on root and shoot development may provide valuable insights on the phenotypic plasticity of mung bean sprouts.

 Mung bean seeds typically germinate for 4-5 days and the seedlings continue to develop for up to 60 days. The amount of water introduced during development can influence the growth of roots, the primary agent for water absorption [Rachaputi: 2019]. Past studies have shown that root length and root volume decrease under severe water deficits [Habibzadeh: 2015]. Moisture levels have been shown to affect the growth rate of mung beans, but the direct effect on length and size is unknown. 

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of water level on energy allocation in mung beans sprouts with constant sunlight and limited nutrients in their soil. We hypothesized that mung bean plants receiving 300Ml water daily would divert more energy into root growth, with respect to shoot growth, compared to mung bean sprouts taking in 100Ml of water.


Materials and Method:
Mung bean seedlings were soaked in water for 24 hours prior to treatment initiation. Seedlings were placed into independent pots containing Vermiculite, low-nutrient soil. Each pot was soiled with water and drained. The mung bean seedlings were placed on two separate trays and labeled according to treatment group. Plants were grown in an indoor greenhouse at a stable temperature and the water provided had a neutral pH.  The mung bean sprouts in the controll group (n=3) received 100Ml of water every day for two weeks. The experimental group (n=3) received 300Ml of water daily for two weeks.  

After the experimental period, mung bean plants were removed from sunlight and extracted from the soil. Each plant was cut at the line between the roots and shoots, estimated by a change in coloration. Roots and shoots were weighed separately for each replicate, and the mass (g) was recorded. The length of the shoots was measured from the bottom of the stem to the top of the leaves, the seedhead, and the root length was measured. The root:shoot weight ratio for length and weight was calculated for each of six replicates. A two-tailed two sample t_test was performed to analyze the difference in root:shoot ratio results between the 100Ml water cohort and the 300Ml water group.


Results:
The mean (s.d.) root-to-shoot weight ratio was 1.26 (.09) for sprouts treated with 100Ml of water and 0.99 (.21) for sprouts treated with 300Ml of water (Table 1).  The average R:S length ratio was 1.22 (.04) for 100Ml and 1.32 (.23) for the excess water (Table 1). The difference in root:shoot ratio between the normal (100Ml) water group and the excess (300Ml) water group was not statistically significent for either weight (p =0.17) or length (p=0.53) (Figure 1).


Discussion:
In nearly all samples, the roots were greater in size than the shoots.  This indicates that developing Mung beans allocate slightly more energy towards their roots compared to shoots, when under conditions with no competition for sunlight and low-nutrient soil.   Mung beans receiving excess water (300Ml) did not have higher relative growth in their roots in comparison to controlls (100Ml), as was predicted. The lack of difference in the R:S ratio between the two groups suggests that additional water does not influence the allocation of resources towards root growth in mung bean sprouts (Table 1). 


Variation in the root:shoot ratio in response to water level may not offer an advantage, except in an environment with sub-optimal conditions. When a deficit of water occurs, the water level may significently impact root and shoot growth. However, both treatment groups received abundant sunlight and stable water supply. Under such conditions it is likely that differences in root allocation do not provide an observable fitness advantage.  This study is limited by its small sample size and short plant growth period. More data is needed before a conclusion can be reached.   Previous studies have shown that low water availability alters morpho-physiological characteristics [Habibzadeh: 2015]. When resources are bountiful, a lower amount of phenotypic variability is expected. Adverse conditions provide more selective pressure [Johnson: 2016], therefore, future studies may be needed to limit water level further to examine incremental difference.   


Understanding the abiotic factors that influence plant growth provides important insights. This information is valuable for scientists and horticulturists seeking to uncover the optimal conditions for growing nutritious crops in the face of a changing climate and scare resources. Research provides insights into the factors causing intraspecies phenotypic variation and the plasticity of plants in their environment. Predicting plant response to environmental stressors and environmental variance may help inform agricultural decisions, maximize nutritional crop yield, and eliminate wasteful resources in agricultural practice.

The difference in root:shoot ratio between the normal (100Ml) water group and the excess (300Ml) water group was not statistically significent for either weight (p =0.17) or length (p=0.53). The average R:S ratio was greater than 1.00 for all treatment groups and size variables, except for R:S weight in the 100Ml group.
