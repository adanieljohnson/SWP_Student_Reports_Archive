Title: Effects of Martin’s IGR Juvenile Hormone on the mass of larval stage in Manduca caterpillars

Abstract:
This experiment set out to determine the effect that an addition of a hormone, in this case Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone, to a Manduca caterpillar’s diet would have on the mass of the Manduca caterpillar over the course of two weeks. We predicted that the caterpillars introduced to Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone were expected gain less mass on average than the caterpillars which were introduced to water. The change in growth for the Manduca caterpillars was observed in eight Manduca caterpillars, four of which had Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone added to their ten grams food, whereas the other four Manduca caterpillars had just water added to their ten grams of food. The average change in mass of the caterpillars was taken over the course of two weeks. This average was separately calculated, by taking the final minus the initial mass of each of the Manduca caterpillars with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone and comparing this average to the average change in mass of the four Manduca caterpillars that were only exposed to water. As a result, it was found that the Manduca caterpillars whose food contained Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone had an average mass gain of about 2.7 grams more than the caterpillars whose food contained water. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta (Manduca caterpillars) range in various locations across the United States and typically serve as pests on tobacco and tomatato crops in their larval stage. Due to Manduca caterpillars being so prevalent and pesky in the United States, it’s important to understand their life cycle. Manducas caterpillars go through a number of instars, or stages. These instars are terminated by molting which is promoted by ecdysteroids [Smykal: 2014]. Juvenile hormones are crucial in terms of regulating insect development [Dubrovsky: 2014]. Juvenile hormones help to promote further growth by means of signaling that the molt will produce another larva and as a result, juvenile hormone will cease only when the larvae reach a certain size or stage in which the larvae will be transformed into adults [Smykal: 2014]. Martin’s IGR is a growth regulator. A growth regulator can accelerate or in this case inhibit a physiological regulatory process necessary for the normal development of the insect [Siddall: 2004]. Therefore, Martin’s IGR’s purpose in this experiment is, in essence, to inhibit caterpillar transformation from a larva to a moth in order to act as a pest control. For our hypothesis, we predicted that the Manduca caterpillars observed with water would have a higher mass on average than the caterpillars exposed with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone. 

Materials and Methods:
We used eight total Manduca caterpillars split equally into two groups of four. Each of the caterpillars was given a number 1-4 and either the letter C or T, with C standing for control group, and with T standing for treatment group. Two plastic containers were used, with each container having four separate compartments. One container contained Manduca caterpillars that were designated by the labels 1C, 2C, 3C and 4C. This indicated that there were four different caterpillars in the container, one in each compartment. However, these four caterpillars were all given the designated letter C, showing how all four would be given the control, which in this case was water. Conversely, the other four caterpillars were given the labels 1T, 2T, 3T, and 4T, meaning that these four caterpillars were given the treatment hormone, which in this case was Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone. We punctured a small hole in each compartment of the eight containers, in order to give each of the eight caterpillars air. After having placed each of the caterpillars in the eight different compartments, they were each given 10 grams of premixed caterpillar food. The caterpillars in the control group (C) were given 5 drops of water in their food, whereas the caterpillars in the treatment group (T) were given 5 drops of Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone. A lid was placed on both containers and they were stored in an incubator for two weeks. Throughout those two weeks, the caterpillars from both groups were monitored and weighed using an analytical electrical balance lab scale. In addition, if needed, we replenished 10 grams of premixed caterpillar food with the 5 drops of with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone, or water, depending on what group the caterpillars were in. We recorded the mass of each caterpillar over this time period and noted each’s increase or decrease in mass (in grams). At the end of the two-week interval, we took the average mass gain of the caterpillars in each group by taking the final – initial mass of each caterpillar and averaging those masses of the T group and those of the C group. A two-tailed two sample T test was used to note the differences between the average mass gain of the C and the T groups.

Results:
The data in Figure 1 indicates that the Manduca caterpillar had a higher average mass when given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone as opposed to having a lower average mass when given water. Manduca caterpillars when given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone gained an average of 13.06 grams whereas the Manduca caterpillars treated with water had an average mass of 10.36 grams in two weeks. The results indicate that in the two weeks there was about a 2.70 gram difference on average between the mass growth between those treated with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormones opposed to water. Therefore, the average mass of the control (water) group was slightly higher than the treatment (Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone) group (t= 0.748324, df=6, P= 0.482556). 

Discussion:
Because the results indicated that there was a higher average mass when being given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone than water, our hypothesis was not supported. We figured that Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone was supposed to inhibit growth and development of larvae compared to water, making the results of this experiment not only go against our hypothesis, they also go against what you would expect from this experiment. There could be a myriad of different reasons as to why this was the case including forgetting to refill food for a day or a transcription error. In particular, 3C of the control group brought down the average significantly as it was nearly 11 grams lighter than the average weight of the other three control caterpillars. This indicates that this caterpillar acts as an outlier and may not be representative of what the actual average mass should be whether that be from a growth/hormone defect or whatever the case may be. Furthermore, repeating this experiment would be extremely beneficial and recommended, as through repeating this experiment, we would be able to see if the average mass of Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone caterpillars should truly be more than caterpillars with water in their premixed food, or if the data in our original experiment was skewed due to an extreme outlier. However, it can be said that removing juvenile hormone alone does not induce metamorphosis or growth at any stage of the caterpillars’ lives [Smykal: 2014]. In other words, there are other factors which go into helping caterpillars grow and develop that may have been more present in the caterpillars with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone than the ones with the water. On a broader level, humans have a great deal of control over insects like caterpillars and can choose from a variety of ways to try to limit Manduca caterpillar damage to crops. It is important, therefore to understand what a juvenile hormone does and the overall life cycle of insects, this case Manduca caterpillars. Especially for farmers, knowing this information can be vital in combating insects in general in order to find out which growth regulator best prevents them from developing, thus potentially ceasing to destroy crops. In general, being conscientious of the life cycle of insects gives a frame of mind of how insects like the Manduca caterpillar come into being, and what has to go right for their transformation or growth to occur.
