Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta are insects in the Order Lepidoptera and are commonly referred to as the tobacco hornworm.  Manduca sexta caterpillars were the chosen model organism because there has been prior research done on their hormone-based and neuron-based signaling processes.  The average life cycle of Manduca sexta insects lasts around 39-48 days and includes four major stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult.  Molting, when insects change in size and/or morphology, is required to move forward from one stage of development to the next [Johnson: 2019].  Insects use endocrine signaling to controll growth, development, behaviors, and physiological processes.  Signals sent out by the brain include hormones or electrochemical signals that are carried by nerves and can have activation or organizational effects [Johnson: 2019].  
There are three main hormones that controll insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and the emergence of adults.  Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH) regulates the release of ecdysterone by prothoracic glands.  Ecdysterone (20E) is a steroid hormone that controlls timing of molting during insect development, and Juvenile Hormone (JH) affects the type of molt and regulates multiple functions in adult insects [Johnson: 2019].  This experiment focuses on ecdysterone, specifically 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), and its effects on growth and pupation in Manduca sexta larvae.  
The presence of ecdysteroids (such as 20E) initiates and organizes the insect molt by triggering a cascade of changes at the molecular and cellular level.  Ecdysteroids work by inducing genes that encode proteins which then serve as transcription factors to help regulate the development of insects [Riddiford: 1993].  The production of ecdysteroids by the prothoracic gland is controllled by the neurohormone prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH).  Modification of ecdysone receptors on the prothoracic gland could affect its ability to synthesize ecdysteroids [Gilbert: 1997].  
In the experiment, Azaguard (a pesticide) was used to inhibit 20E production.  Azaguard contains the active ingredient azadirachtin, which is a powerful natural pesticide found in neem tree seeds [Gilbert: 2010].  Over 400 species of insects are susceptible to the effects of azadirachtin, which include abnormal or delayed molts and mortality.  Azadirachtin works by blocking the release of PTTH, the hormone that induces the synthesis of ecdysone [Gilbert: 2010].  Azadirachtin has strong antifeedant impacts, the ability to block the biosynthesis of hormones, and causes the inhibition of reproductive organ development [Lynn: 2011].  In addition, it damages nuclear DNA and alters the activities of genes and proteins [Lynn: 2011].  Based on this information, it is hypothesized that feeding 20E inhibitor (Azaguard) to the Manduca Sexta larvae will slow the timing of the molting process during development, resulting in lower mass gain, and prevent it from pupating at the proper time.


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were collected and separated into two groups of four caterpillars.  The initial masses of the caterpillars were recorded and entered into an Excel document.  The first group of caterpillars was fed 10 grams of food mixed with seven drops of water.  This group was the controll group.  The second group of caterpillars was fed 10 grams of food mixed with seven drops of 20E inhibitor (Azaguard).  This group was the experimental group.  The mass of each caterpillar was recorded once a day for 15 days to track development.  In addition, the food was replaced and the containers were cleaned as needed.
	Because two caterpillars from the experimental group died within the first week, another experimental group was created (Experimental Group #2).  An additional four caterpillars were collected, weighed, and placed into a container.  They were each fed 10 grams of food containing seven drops of 20E inhibitor.  Their masses were recorded each day for eight days.
	The Manduca sexta caterpillars were kept in a plastic container with four compartments: one caterpillar and 10g of food in each.  Two holes were poked through each side of the plastic containers so that the caterpillars received ample oxygen, and they were kept in an incubator throughout the duration of the experiment. The masses of the caterpillars were collected by placing them on an electronic scale each day.  In order to evaluate the results, a two-sample t_test was used.  The two-sample t_test compared the growth rates of the caterpillars in the controll and experimental groups.  The p_value set at the beginning of the experiment was 0.05. 


Results:
The results of this experiment show that there is a significent association between the growth rate of Manduca sexta caterpillars and the administration of 20E inhibitor.  The two-sample t_test produced a t-value of 6.768, a one-tailed p_value of 0.000254, and a two-tailed p_value of 0.000508.  The average growth rate of the controll group shown in Figure 1 was 0.796 grams per day, while the average growth rate of the experimental group fed 20E inhibitor was 0.0728 grams per day.  Figure 2 illustrates the general trends of average mass gain over the fifteen day period for the controll and over the eight day period for the experimental group.  The average mass of the caterpillars in the controll group on day one was 0.05 grams, and on day 15 it was 11.996 grams, showing a 23880% increase in mass.  On the other hand, there was only a 51% increase in the average mass of the caterpillars in the experimental group that averaged 0.528 grams on day one and 0.896 grams on day eight.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment were significent and reject the null hypothesis.  This is because the value found using the t_test was less than the p_value set before the start of the experiment.  Thus, the alternative hypothesis was supported and it can be concluded that the use of 20E inhibitors on Manduca sexta caterpillars resulted in stunted growth and development.  20E inhibitors prevent insect development by controllling gene expression involved in molting [Johnson: 2019].  By inhibiting the release of 20E hormone, the experimental groups of Manduca sexta caterpillars experienced much slower development and premature death.  
Without ecdysteroids, the genes that serve as transcription factors and regulate growth cannot be turned on.  A study done in 2014 by a group of scientists who injected larvae with a form of 20E inhibitor showed similar results, as 65% of the model organisms died shortly after the injection [Cai: 2014].  In addition, another study showed a decrease in pupation rates when insects were fed azadirachtin, the active ingredient in Azaguard.  The larvae had lower weights and a higher mortality rate because azadirachtin changes the rates and patterns of protein synthesis.  Specifically, “azadirachtin inhibits the activity of ecdysone-20-monooxygenase, an enzyme that converts ecdysone to 20E, the active form of molting hormone.” [Lynn: 2011].  Finally, a study done in 1985 concluded that Manduca sexta larvae treated with azadirachtin did not complete development or died in the larval stage because of the inability to reach the critical weight necessary to pupate [Schluter 1985].  This evidence supports the results of the experiment conducted and proves that suppressing the production of ecdysteroids with the 20E inhibitor prevents the development of the larvae to pupa and adults.  
In future studies, it would be possible to further test the effects of 20E inhibition on Manduca sexta by feeding the caterpillars food with varying concentrations of 20E inhibitor.  This would enable scientists to make additional observations about the extent 20E affects growth and the molting process.  If conducting a similar study, it would be beneficial to ensure that all Manduca sexta caterpillars are approximately the same age and/or mass at the start of the experiment to better controll the influence of other variables.
