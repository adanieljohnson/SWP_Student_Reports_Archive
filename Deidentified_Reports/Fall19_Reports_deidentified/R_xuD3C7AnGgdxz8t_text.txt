Title: The Effect of the Hormone Ecdysterone Inhibitors on the Weight and Development of the Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca Sexta)

Abstract:
-

Introduction:
Hormones are very important to both animal and insect development and can regulate the timing and extent of their development. The importance of this lab is to delve into the area of growth hormones that play a role in insect growth cycles. Two of the most important hormones are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (E20). Both hormones are key for the regulation and timing of insect growth cycles. The JH helps regulate the type of molting, for example when a larva changes from a 1st instar to a second instar larva. The other hormone, E20, regulates the timing of the molting for the insect which means both E20 and JH must work together in order for the larva to pupate [Wyatt: 1996]. For this lab, the focus will be on the effects of using E20 inhibitors to stop the production of that hormone within an insect. The insect that was chosen for the lab is the Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca Sexta) for its short development cycle and for the ease of care for the organisms. The Manduca Sexta will be given E20 in its juvenile state so that the observations of the worm can be limited to when it is in the first developmental state. Since the E20 helps with the worm’s developmental states the inhibition of the hormone will majorly affect the growth and development of the worm. Similar studies have also found a correlation between the reduction of the E20 hormone and the reduced ability of insects to gain and maintain that weight [Nijhout: 1974]. The hypothesis for this experiment will be that by feeding the Manduca Sexta E20 hormone inhibitors the molting and growth process will be slowed thus affecting the weight of the organism.

Materials and Method:
To start the experiment two groups of Manduca Sexta were selected one for the controll and the other for the experimental hormone inhibitor treatment. In each group, there were four pupas that had their own contained compartment inside a plastic bin. After selecting the pupas, the bins were labeled and had holes poked into them so that the pupas had air to breathe. For food, the controll group was fed ten grams of food each day with seven drops of water to hydrate the food. The experimental group was also given ten grams of food every day but with the seven drops of Ecdysterone (E20) inhibitor. The time that the pupas were fed was around six P.M. to keep the variable of time consistent between feedings. For each day, the weight of each organism was recorded for both groups and shared with every member of the group. After the final day is completed then the data was compiled and averaged for the use of graphs, charts, standard deviation, and statistical testing. The statistical test that was used for the lab was a two-sample t_test so that differences in the growth between the controll and the experimental group could be shown [Johnson: 2016].

Results:
The results for the experiment were interesting due to the deaths of the first experimental group halfway through the experiment. The group started another experimental group and used their growth data and still compared it to the growth rates of the controll group. The averages of each group’s weight were put into a graph and had the standard deviation applied. In figure one this is represented by both lines and the standard deviation applied to each point. For the statistical two-sample t_test, the mean of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 2.5, d.f. = 21, P = 0.019). The p_value of the experiment was greater than 0.05, which means that the results are not due to chance there is a statistical difference between the two groups. These results could be due to the deaths of the initial experimental group; however, since the effects of E20 inhibitors are to limit the amount of growth and development the group’s death is possible. 

Discussion:
With the information from the results section, the originally proposed hypothesis is accepted, and the null hypothesis, which was that the addition of E20 to the experimental group's diet did not have a significent or statistical difference in the experimental group, is rejected. This means that the E20 did influence the weight of the experimental group. The results are expected that the controll would gain more weight than the experimental group because with the E20 inhibitors the experimental group would not be able to continue in the growth cycle and thus not gaining as much weight as the controll group [Wyatt: 1996]. These results are similar to the results of Nijhout’s tests because in their test the E20 inhibitors were found to also decrease the weight gained by the Manduca Sexta [Nijhout: 1974]. With this acceptance of the original hypothesis, the results make sense and additional experiments can be performed so that additional information can be added to the findings. One possible way that the experiment could be improved would be not having the experimental group die so early on and having additional groups that could also be treated so that there would not be such a statistical difference between the two. Also, constant care for the worms could also be introduced so that there are not times where the worms do not have food if they eat it all. An additional direction that the lab could go in would be to see the differences between the effects of E20 inhibitors on both females and males. An experiment by Warren and Gilbert also delve into the different levels of production of E20 in both sexes and the results show that females normally have increases rates of E20, so introducing E20 inhibitors to just the females would show levels of E20 similar to normal male Manduca Sextas [Warren: 1986]. Overall, the experiment was a success and will allow for this hypothesis to be taken and tested in many more directions.
