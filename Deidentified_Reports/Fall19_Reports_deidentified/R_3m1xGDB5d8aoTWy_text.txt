Title: Examining the effect of the addition of Juvenile Hormone on the growth of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. Referred to as a tobacco hornworm, found around the United States and Central America. 
The growth of insects from one stage to another is referred to as molting when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer. Metamorphosis refers to the transition from caterpillar or worm-like larvae to the pupal adult stage[Hammer:2019].
The average life cycle or metamorphosis of Manduca sexta from egg to reproductive adult is anywhere from 39-48 days. The lifecycle starts by being in eggs for 3-5 days until 1st instar larva and then 2-3 days until 2nd instar larva. This leads to 2-3 days until the 3rd instar larva and 2-3 days until the 4th instar larva. After comes 4 days until the 5th instar larva leading to 5 days until pupa and 19-23 days until the emergence of an adult moth. The metamorphosis of Manduca sexta can be either shortened or elongated due to strength of diet, outside temperature and conditions of the environment in which growth is occurring.
There are two hormones necessary for regulating growth, Ecdysterone (20E) produced in Prothoracic glands and Juvenile Hormone (JH), which are produced in the Corpus Allata[Rolff: 2019]. 20E is important for regulating the timing of molting during insect development while Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molt during development. Both work together in controllling growth, molting, and the metamorphosis of the adult Manduca sexta. The elimination of either hormone can largely inhibit growth and may cause death. Ten genes are potential insecticide targets which code for enzymes involved with juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta[Yin:2019]. A decline in Juvenile Hormone production near the later stages of the metamorphosis allows the Manduca sexta to undergo pupal commitment[Kingsolver:2007]. Used in this experiment is Precor which is a Juvenile hormone analogue which are insecticides that interfere with hormonal action in insects by mimicking their juvenile hormones.[Precor:2019] This experiment hypothesizes that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are treated with Precor, then their growth in mass will be less than the growth of caterpillars that aren’t treated with Precor. 

Materials and Method:
A pair of 4 cell containers had each cell marked 1-4 and assigned either to the juvenile hormone experimental group or the controll. Added to each cell was 10 grams of Manduca sexta food. In the container that was marked controll, 5 drops of water were added to each clump of food in each cell with a transfer pipet. In the other container marked Juvenile Hormone, each clump of food in each cell was given 5 drops of Precor, an insecticide that contains a juvenile hormone analogue called methoprene. Two holes were punctured in each cell to allow for air to get to the caterpillars. One caterpillar was then placed in each cell, a top was placed on the container and the containers were placed in an incubator. Every day for two weeks, the caterpillars were weighed on a scale to account for changes in mass in grams. 
To statistically test this experiment, a paired t_test was used. A paired t_test is used best to test paired data with a null hypothesis. In this case, the average growth of Manduca sexta over the length of the experiment. A significance cutoff of 0.95 was assigned.

Results:
There was not a noticeable difference in size between the masses of the caterpillars from the controll group and the group that was exposed to the Precor. The largest of the caterpillars all come from the group exposed to the Precor at 14.6g. (Figure 1) One stand-out from the group is the 4th caterpillar from the controll group which achieved by far the lowest growth of any caterpillar at around only 10.7g. (Figure 1) Except for the two largest growers from the Juvenile Hormone experimental group, the two other caterpillars all sustained less growth than any caterpillar from the controll group at 11.7g and 12.04g. (Figure 1)
A paired t_test was used for statistical analysis. (P=0.572).
Although there was a very obvious difference in the appearance of the caterpillars that were exposed to the Precor and the Control Group. The controll group had white and black stripes while the Juvenile Hormone group had white stripes, but the darker strips looked darker and more profound. (Figure 2 & 3) The Juvenile Hormone group of caterpillars also had a darker shade of green. (Figure 4) The caterpillars in the Juvenile Hormone group also appeared to be slightly thicker than the controlls. 


Discussion:
In order to statistically test this experiment, a paired t_test was used. A paired t_test is used best to test paired data with a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis was rejected as no there was no significent difference in p_values (P=0.572). 
The experiment ended after about 14 days when the Manduca sexta would be in about its 5th instar larva, so it would make sense as to why the full effects of the Juvenile Hormone were not fully seen. Juvenile Hormone is meant to be absorbed through an insect’s cuticle to be used as a pesticide that will not allow normal development[Riddiford: 1994]. Yet in this experiment, Juvenile Hormone seems to not have made enough of an influence on the molting of Manduca sexta. Except for the fourth caterpillar, the one that achieved the least amount of growth might have been further along the lifecycle and the effects of the Juvenile Hormone worked. Another issue could have been the fact that only 5 drops of Juvenile Hormone were added to the food which might not be enough to be fully absorbed by the caterpillars and a number closer to 10 drops needed to produce full effects of the Precor.
