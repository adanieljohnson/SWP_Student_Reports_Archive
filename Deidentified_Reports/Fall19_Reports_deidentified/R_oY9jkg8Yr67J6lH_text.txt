Title: The Effect of Excess Water on the Development of Morpho-Physiological Characteristics in Vigna radiata Grown in Low-Nutrient Soil and Steady Sunlight Conditions

Abstract:
Vigna radiata (mung bean) is a crop grown throughout the world for nutritional and medicinal use. Mung beans absorb moisture through their roots, which vary in length and volume. Abiotic and biotic factors alter the morpho-physiological characteristics in bean sprout. During development, the quantity of water might affect energy allocation: variations in environmental conditions can promote phenotypic variability. The effect of excess water level on developing mung bean sprouts is unclear. The objective of this study was to observe the influence of water level on mung bean energy allocation, as measured by the ratio of root size to shoot size, length and weight. It was hypothesized that mung bean sprouts treated with excess water would have higher growth in their roots relative to shoots, due to the incremental value of moisture in the soil. The variations in water quantity between two groups of mung bean sprouts did not significantly alter the root/shoot ratio after two weeks of treatment. 


Introduction:
Mung bean (Vigna radiata) is a legume crop with a short life span grown in Asia, southern Europe, and warmer parts of the United [Yi-Shen: 2018]. Due to its high nutritional content and sweet flavor, mung beans are cultivated in human agriculture. Mung beans have been shown to possess medicinal properties, such as anti-diabetic effects [Tang: 2014]. Environmental stress factors, such as limited water and low-nutrients, expose bean sprouts to adverse developmental conditions, impairing their ability to consume resources in the future. The high level of environmental instability caused by climate change has contributed to decreased mung bean production worldwide [Sehrawat: 2019]. Uncovering the influence of various abiotic factors on root and shoot development may provide valuable insights on the phenotypic plasticity of mung bean sprouts. 

Mung bean seeds typically germinate for 4-5 days and the seedlings continue to develop for up to 60 days. The amount of water introduced during development can influence the growth of roots, the primary agent for water absorption (Rachaputi: 2019). Past studies have shown that root length and root volume decrease under severe water deficits [Habibzadeh: 2015]. Moisture levels have been shown to affect the growth rate of mung beans, but the direct effect on length and size is unknown. 
 
 
The objective of this study was to examine the effect of water level on energy allocation in mung beans sprouts with constant sunlight and limited nutrients in their soil. We hypothesized that mung bean plants receiving 300ml water daily would divert more energy into root growth, with respect to shoot growth, compared to mung bean sprouts taking in 100ml of water.  The high levels of moisture in the soil may provide high value at a low cost. 


Materials and Methods:
Mung bean seedlings were germinated prior to the start of the experiment. Six mung bean sprouts were acquired and placed in independent pots.  The seedlings were potted and divided into two groups, each with three replicates. The low-nutrient soil, Vermiculite, was used in a constant quantity. Each bean sprout was watered and drained. 

Plants were divided into separate trays according to experimental group. The mung bean sprouts (n=3) in the control group received 100ml of water every day for two weeks. The experimental group (n=3), received 300ml of water 5-7 days a week for two weeks. Plants were grown in an indoor greenhouse at a stable temperature and the water provided had a neutral pH. 
 
After the experimental period, mung bean plants were removed from sunlight and extracted from the soil. Each plant was cut at the line between the roots and shoots, estimated by a change in coloration. Roots and shoots were weighed separately for each replicate, and the mass (g) was recorded.  The length of the shoots was measured from the bottom of the stem to the top of the leaves, the seedhead, and the root length was measured. The root/ shoot weight ratio for length and weight was calculated for each of six replicates.

A two sample T-Test was performed to analyze the difference in root/shoot ratio results between the 100mL water cohort and the 300mL water group. 


Results:
 For mung bean sprout under treatment with 100ml of water daily, the mean (s.d.) root to shoot ratio was 1.26 (.09) for weight and 1.22 (.04) for length (Table 1).  The energy allocation towards roots was greater than the energy allocation towards shoots in all samples. The difference in root/shoot ratio between the normal (100mL) water group and the excess (300mL) water group was not statistically significant for weight (p =0.17) or length (p=0.53). No difference was found between treatments was found (Figure 1). 

Discussion:
The lack of significant difference between the two groups suggests that additional water does not influence the allocation of resources towards root growth in mung bean sprouts (Table 1). Under abundant sunlight, variations in root/shoot ratio in response to water level may not offer a marginal advantage or disadvantage. Alternatively,  the effect of water quantity may significant impactly root and shoot growth only when a deficit of water occurs. Previous studies have shown that low water availability alters morpho-phsyiological characteristiscs  [Habibzadeh: 2015]. When resources are bountiful, a lower amount of phenotypic variability is expected. Adverse conditions provide more selective pressure [Johnson: 2016], therefore, future studies may need to limit water level further to examine incremental difference. More research must be conducted to establish and adequate water level for mung bean sprouts developed in vermiculite. 

Among all mung bean sprouts, the roots were greater in length and weight than the shoots, with one exception. Mung beans collectively allocate slightly more energy towards their roots compared to shoots, when under conditions with no competition for sunlight. This study is limited by its small sample size and short plant growth period. More data is needed before a conclusion can be reached. The impact of abiotic resources on growth size reflects the plants response to adverse conditions. This information is valuable value as scientists and horticulturists seek to uncover the optimal conditions for growing nutritious crops when faced with changes in the climate and scare resources. Research provides insights into the causes behind individual intraspecies variation and the plasticity of plants in varying external environmentasl. Predicting plant response to environmental stressors and environmental variance may help inform agricultural decisions, maximize nutritional crop yield, and eliminate wasteful resources in agricultural practice.
