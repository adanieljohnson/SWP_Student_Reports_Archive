Title: Betta Splendid Aggressivity towards Body Shape

Abstract:
Studying animal behavior requires the consideration of biology, genetics, and ecology, as well as observational and laboratory skills. Betta Splendids are known for their aggression to other fish, but specifically to members of their own species. We tested whether Betta Fish respond aggressively towards body shape or another outside stimulus. We hypothesized that if Betta Fish are exposed to a realistic decoy, a circle, and a live fish, then the live fish will display equal aggression towards the live fish and decoy, with little aggression displayed towards the circle because of their fixed action pattern. This hypothesis was supported as we found that for all of the trials, the decoy fish and the live fish caused the fastest response by the test fish. This means that the fish use body shape for determining aggressivity. This finding validates current scientific articles.

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior using and combining laboratory method and observational skills as well as insights and theories from biology, genetics, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Genetics, in particular, has been found to link heavily with behavior, as deletions in an organism’s genome can lead to completely altered responses to various stimuli. Behavior in intraspecies relationships is especially important as it can be a result of territorial behaviors, mating displays, or group dynamics, is are often shaped by natural selection. Often times, these behaviors have such a strong genetic component that they are categorized as fixed action patterns, instinctive behaviors with little variation in the species that almost always go to completion. An example of this can be seen in the male red-bellied sticklebacks, who will attack anything red [Peeke: 1969]. No matter the shape or size of the red object, male sticklebacks will attack the red object or animal. Betta Splendid, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are famous for exhibiting intraspecies aggression but are not always aggressive to other fish. They originate from freshwater ponds in South East Asia but became a common household pet [Dzieweczynski: 2010]. Due to their high population, cost-effectiveness, and known behavioral responses, we chose them to study. We wanted to test whether Betta Fish have a fixed action pattern towards their own body shape, or whether their aggression came from another stimulus. We hypothesized that if Betta Fish are exposed to a realistic decoy, a circle, and a live fish, then the live fish will display equal aggression towards the live fish and decoy, with little aggression displayed towards the circle because of their fixed action pattern.


Materials and Method:
First, five healthy male Betta Fish were obtained, along with a realistic Betta decoy, a tank with three chambers, and a red foam circle attached to a wire. Four of the Betta Fish became test subjects, and the fifth was the live fish used later in the experiment. Each of the four test fish was put through three trials. In each trial, the fish was in the tank next to an object divided by an opaque and glass barrier. At the beginning of the trial, the timer starts when the opaque barrier is removed. Each trial ended after the test fish made the first aggressive move. The timer was then stopped and the opaque barrier was restored. If no display of aggression happened, the trial ended after five minutes had passed. The time it took for the trial to end was recorded. The first trial exposed the first test fish to a live fish. This was the controll. The second trial exposed the test fish to a life-like decoy, and the third trial exposed the fish to the foam circle.  These were the experimental groups. In between each trial, the test fish was given five minutes to rest. ANOVA  was run on the data to determine the significance of the data set and a Tukey-Kramer test was used to tell which groups were significent from each other.


Results:
For all of the trials, the decoy fish and the live fish caused the fastest response by the test fish. In Figure 1, it is seen that the standard deviation for the red circle trial is zero because none of the test fish reacted to the circle as the maximum time elapsed, while the other two trials had large standard deviations. The ANOVA test run on the data set had a p_value of 0.000293, and the subsequent Tukey-Kramer test found that there was a significent difference between the Decoy fish-circle trials and the live fish-circle trials. There was no significent difference between the decoy fish-live fish trials. 

Discussion:
The null hypothesis was rejected, meaning that the hypothesis was supported. The fish did display equal amounts of aggression towards the decoy and live fish with less aggression towards the circle. 
Turkey Kramer test ran on the difference between the trials found that the Betta Fish were more aggressive to the live fish and the decoy fish than the foam circle. This means that our data support the idea that Bettas rely on body shape to determine members of their own species and what to expend the energy of being aggressive towards. Furthermore, since they can distinguish their own species, it is likely that the extreme aggressive response generated by the fish, making them famous, is a fixed action pattern for the Betta’s own body shape. For example, Bettas are aggressive to many species, but their own elicit the strongest response because of this fixed action pattern. Seeing a betta body shape elicits a response the bettas cannot controll-maximum aggressivity. 
Finding that bettas are aggressive towards their own body shapes, and not specific behaviors found within the species can be applied to future scientific research and Betta care. In one article, researchers studied Betta aggressivity when given the choice between a mate and a display of dominance [Dzieweczynski: 2010]. Their study used decoy Bettas for the test, and our findings support her claim that the decoys elicit the same response as live fish. Furthermore, another study, using robotic fish that looked and acted like Bettas caused an even more aggressive response than live fish [Romano: 2017]. This supports our data that the fish use body shape to determine aggressiveness. 
Overall our findings both support and are supported by existing research, though if the experiment were to be repeated, a higher sample size and more non-betta decoys should be used.
