Title: Impact of Juvenile Hormone Precor on weight of Manducta Sexta

Abstract:
None 

Introduction:
Manducta Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. It is also called Sphinx Moth, tobacco hornworm, among other names. In about 19-23 days, the Manducta Sexta becomes an adult moth. One of the most important hormones present in the Manducta Sexta is the Juvenile Hormone (JH). They are produced by the Corpus Allata and is a naturally occurring hormone in the Manducta Sexta, however can be used as insect control as it can “adversely affect insect growth and development” [Tunaz:2004]. JH regulates the type of molt and regulates functions in adult insects. Juvenile Hormone is unique because it has a different structure and has certain effects on insect development [Wyatt:1996]. JH is a type of insect growth regulator (IGR), which can have an effect on the regulatory processes for normal growth of the Manducta Sexta, among other insects.  Excess Juvenile hormone can inhibit certain processes, especially when the Manducta Sexta begins to molt. Precor is a specific type of JH that will be used in this experiment. Precor is a specific type of Juvenile Hormone and is an IGR. Given this information, a hypothesis was made. When five drops of precor are added to each the control group’s food source, their average weight gain will be less than the average weight gain of the control groups at the end of the two weeks (more weeks will be added if needed).

Materials and Methods:
Eight caterpillars were obtained and the initial weight of all was taken. They were randomly divided into two groups of four, one was the treatment group and the other was the control group. Each group received a 10 gram piece of food. The food for the treatment group was treated with 5 drops of precor each. The food for the control group was treated with 5 drops of water. 2 plastic bins were obtained, each with four compartments for the four caterpillars. Each compartment was labeled 1-4 and control versus treatment. The Manducta Sexta were stored in an incubator. There were daily check-ins to record the weight of the caterpillars along with general observations. 
The independent variable is the amount of precor added to the food supply, the dependent variable is the average weight gain of the Manducta Sexta. The control is the average weight of the larvae that is not treated with precor. 
A 2-sample t-test will be used to determine whether the results are statistically significant or not and if the null hypothesis can be rejected. A p-value of less than .05 will allow the null hypothesis to be rejected. 


Results:
The weight gain of the Manducta Sexta treatment group over the course of two weeks was not statistically significant compared to the control group. Our one-tailed p-value was .181693, the t-value was .983402, degrees of freedom= 6, and N=4, and SD of .4 for the treatment group and 6.23g for the control group. The average weight gain for the treatment group was 12.178 grams and 9.108g for the control group. For the most part, both the control group and treatment group grew a large amount over the course of the two weeks, but the control group’s average weight gain did not exceed the treatment group’s average weight gain enough for the scores to be statistically significant.

Discussion:
This experiment was to test the effect the specific Juvenile Hormone precor on 8 different Manducta Sexta. The hypothesis alluded to the average weight of the control group being higher than the average weight of the treatment group. However, our p-value of .181693 did not support this hypothesis. With a p-value&gt;.05, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and are unable to accept the alternative hypothesis. The majority of the Manducta Sexta remained alive in this experiment, except for one of the control Manducta Sexta, which died on Day 13. However, even before day 13, this caterpillar was an outlier, which had a large impact in our data. On day 12, a day before the caterpillar died, the weight was .39 g. In total, it grew .34 grams, which is much different than the average growth of 9.1 grams. This particular caterpillar significantly lowered the average weight gain of the control group, thus negatively affecting the hypothesis. When taken this caterpillar out of the equation completely, the average growth of the control group was 12.03 grams, which is much closer to the average growth of the treatment group, which was 12.178 grams. This also greatly affected the standard deviation, as shown in the Table 1 is 6.23 for the control group versus a standard deviation of .4 for the treatment group. 
	Yet, even with the outlier removed, the average weight gain of the control group was unexpectedly smaller than the treatment group. Some errors that could have occurred in this experiment could include not cleaning the caterpillar’s waste every day which could negatively affect their growth, not having the exact same portions of food for each caterpillar, or not properly using the scales. In the future, one could add more than 5 drops of precor into the food, so the precor would have a strong affect. This correlates to research regarding the effects of JH precor on the development of the bed bug Cimex lectularius. In this study, 1x and 2x amounts of Precor used against bed bugs had no effect in their development, but at 3x and 10x, it had an effect on their development [Goodman]. The results from this could be expected to be different, in that the treatment group would have a lower average weight gain than the control, which would support the hypothesis. Also, in the future, one could measure the length and see how the length of the control group and the treatment group differed, and if this length growth was proportional to the weight growth.
