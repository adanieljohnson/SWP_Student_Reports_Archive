Title: The examination of the change in Manduca sexta growth patterns due to the addition of Precor in their diet

Abstract:
This experiment was performed to study the effect of Precor Insect Growth Regulator on the Manduca sexta. We hypothesized that the larvae treated with Precor would be smaller than the control since they would be larvae for longer and their growth processes would be disturbed leading to potential growth complications. To test this hypothesis, we used 8 larvae, 4 for control and 4 for treatment. We fed them 10 grams of food with 5 drops of water for the control group and 5 drops of Precor for the treatment group. During our experiment we averaged the largest difference for each subject. The overall mean for the control was 5.17 grams and the mean for the treatment group was 6.48 grams. Our control group standard deviation was 1.0 and our treatment group standard deviation was 1.2. This means, on average, the treatment group was 1.31 grams larger. This difference is insignificant because our p value is 0.245. This value is greater than 0.05 so we fail to reject our null hypothesis. However, I still believe with more testing, we will find out that Precor has potential benefits in pest control.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta (MS) is an organism that starts as a caterpillar and through many developmental stages, becomes a moth. The Manduca sexta is a pest in its infantile stages, when it is a caterpillar, but it out grows its pest-like behavior as an adult moth [Byron: 2017]. For this experiment we are focusing on one of the more important hormones, Juvenile Hormone [JH], which keeps the Manduca sexta as a larvae for as long as it is abundant in the organism. We are going to test the effects of a JH inhibitor on Manduca sexta growth and maturation. We found this particularly important because, if altering the amount of Juvenile Hormone in a Manduca sexta would prompt it to develop into an adult moth faster, then the Manduca sexta would be a pest for shorter amount of time. This would be extremely beneficial for farmers. Precor IGR a JH inhibitor used to control pests and as previously mentioned, Manduca sexta is a pest in its infantile stages. With that said, we posed the following question based on information gathered from outside literature, if Precor is used, will it alter Juvenile Hormone levels in Manduca sexta to inhibit growth and make the caterpillars treated with it smaller than the controls [Byron: 2017]. From this question we derived our hypothesis. We hypothesized that the Manduca sexta’s growth and ability to molt would be inhibited by Precor; thus, the treatment group will weigh less and molt slower. This makes our null hypothesis a statement of no difference between weights of caterpillars treated with water or Precor. 

Materials and Methods:
Our independent value is the amount of Precor added (in grams) and our dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillar (in grams). In order to accurately test the effect of Precor in a Manduca sexta’s diet on their growth we selected eight total caterpillars and split them in half, four in a control group and four in a treatment group. We put two airholes at the top of each cell.  We gave each caterpillar 10 grams of food with 5 drops of liquid. The treatment group got Precor and the control group got water. We fed the caterpillars when the food ran out or if the food became dry. We also cleaned out all excrements in the cells daily. For 15 days straight, we monitored our caterpillars. We measured their masses every day and took observations. To determine the overall growth of our caterpillars from day 1 to day 15, we averaged the weights of the control group and the treatment group daily and made a figure. To calculate our p-value, we took the same daily average sand subtracted each day by the final mass for each group to find our average growth per day. We used a one-tailed T-test to find out our p-value and compared it against 0.05 to see if our experimental data is significant or not. Materials in this lab included: two 4 cell containers, two lids, food, a spoon, a balance, Precor, water, and transfer pipes.

Results:
After collecting the data we formed Figure 1 to display our results. We found that on average, our treatment group was 1.3 grams larger than the control group. We also discovered that day 10 was the day when the growth rate of the control group decreased but the rate of the treatment did not. The overall mean for the control group was 5.17 grams and the overall mean for the treatment group was 6.48 grams. Our control group standard deviation was 1.0 and our treatment group standard deviation was 1.2. Our p-value, calculated with a one-tailed T-test, was 0.245. We observed that most of the control caterpillars had the same weights at the same time and we saw the same to be true for the treatment group caterpillars. There was no one caterpillar larger than the test. On day 10, the caterpillars seemed to shrink and get a black line on them down their bodies. They also all stopped eating around then.

Discussion:
After observing our experiment with Manduca sexta for two weeks, it became evident that our hypothesis was not supported. A better possible alternate hypothesis could have been used. For example, we hypothesize that the Manduca sexta’s growth and ability to molt would not be inhibited by Precor; thus, the treatment group will weigh more. The treatment group was actually larger than the control group, even though our alternative hypothesis stated that we thought the treatment group would be smaller [Figure 1]. This comes as no surprise because Manduca sexta larvae entering their 5th interstellar stage, before pupation, becoming quite large reaching around 10-12 grams [Johnson: 2018]. Our p-value was greater than 0.05 so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Precor did not have a statistically significant impact on inhibiting the growth of our caterpillars.  One error we could have made was not changing the food often enough when they got bigger. There were days where there would be some food left so, we would not change it but we most likely should have because the caterpillars were large and there was not much food left. This could have hampered the caterpillar’s growth in both the control and treatment group. This could explain why Precor did not have an impact on inhibiting Manduca sexta’s growth. The most interesting part of our experiment was at day 10. Our caterpillars were around the same size, but then our control group shrunk, and our treatment did not. For the rest of the experiment the treatment group would be larger than the control group. This experiment indicates that pesticides, such as Precor, do not make pests smaller. However, we also observed the external factors that influenced our results that are detailed above. At this point it is difficult to conclude how effective of a pesticide Precor IGR is. To further test this study, more experimenting should be done with a sample size larger than eight total caterpillars.

The blue line represents the control group and the orange line represents the treatment group. The control group was treated with 5 drops of water and the treatment group was treated with 5 drops of Precor IGR. This experiment ran from 9/4/19 to 9/18/19. Figure 1 represents the average weight and standard deviation of the caterpillars each day. *************************************************************************
