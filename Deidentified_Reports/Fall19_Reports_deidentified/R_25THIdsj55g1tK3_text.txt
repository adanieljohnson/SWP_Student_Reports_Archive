Title: The effect of Methoprene on the growth and life cycle of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This study worked to determine how Manduca sexta reacts to the introduction of Methoprene into its environment. The chemical was mixed into the caterpillar’s food to examine how it would affect the life cycle of the caterpillar as compared to a control group. Methoprene acted as a substitute for Juvenile Hormone, which helps regulate the stages of growth within Manduca sexta’s life cycle. Changes in the caterpillars’ development were tracked by mapping the change in weight over time. The hope was to establish a clear connection between the Juvenile Hormone, the weight of caterpillars during development and the larvae’s overall life cycle progress. A two-tailed t test was used to examine the results. The results did not show a clear connection, this may be due to the fact neither group began to molt by the end of the experiment, making conclusions on the data difficult.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a species of moth that is found throughout the Southern United States. The goal of the lab was to use this moth to study the effect of insect hormone on the larvae’s growth and development. The Manduca sexta has a holometabolous cycle, meaning the organism has distinct phases between egg, larval, pupal and adult stages. [Mallison:2016] This experiment focused on the transition of Manduca sexta from larvae to pupa. The Manduca sexta is a common pest to many crops, including the tomato. This data could be later studied by farmers to inspect whether using IGRs is an effective way of reducing pest contamination of crop fields. A chemical substitute for the moth’s Juvenile Hormone, Methoprene, was used for this experiment. Within the moth’s life cycle, levels of Juvenile Hormone decrease beginning at the fifth instar stage and continue to be low as the moth becomes ready to molt and pupate [Mallison: 2016].  This Methoprene came in the form of the pest control agent Martin’s Insect Growth Regulator, IGR. In order to examine whether the life cycle is disrupted by the IGR, the weight of the moths was examined since the moths need to grow in size and weight before molting and moving on to their pupal state. Molting occurs after five larval stages within the Manduca sexta’s life cycle. The alternative hypothesis states that, if five drops of IGR per ten grams of food are introduced to Manduca sexta larvae, then the larvae will continue to gain weight despite reaching the size to pupate, altering its life cycle and increasing its weight [Rowland;2017]. Juvenile Hormone has an anti-metamorphic effect and should keep the larvae from advancing in its life cycle [Palli:1994].  

Materials and Methods:
The experiment began with the selection of two groups of four moth larvae which were placed within plastic cages. These plastic cages were shallow tubes divided into four sections with two holes poked on the side of each node. Once placed in the cages the larvae each received ten grams of food each. For the control group of larvae, a dropper was used to place five drops of water within the larvae’s food which was mixed until the food had paste like consistency. For the test group of larvae five drops of Martin’s IGR, which contains Methoprene, was placed and mixed until the experimental group’s food had the same consistency as the control group. The larvae were weighed daily. More food was also provided as need, always with the addition of 5 drops of water or IGR per ten grams of food. The caterpillars were returned to a climate-controlled area after weighed and feed. This experiment was carried out over fifteen days and the caterpillars had their physical characteristics monitored. All changes in physical appearance were recorded.  

Results:
Throughout the course of the experiment, caterpillars in both groups grew is mass, however the growth of the caterpillars with Methoprene in their diet appeared to be accelerated compared to that to the control group. The test group of the Methoprene grew to an average of 1.59 grams heavier than its control group counterpart. Neither group of caterpillars showed heavy signs of molting, however the caterpillars with the IGR in their food turned a pale white tint throughout the experiment. As the caterpillars grew, both groups of caterpillars became more lethargic. This sluggishness was especially apparent in the control group caterpillars. Despite the increased growth of the test group the two-tailed p-value  was .78 which is greater than the value needed to support the alternative hypothesis. Since the p-value is greater than .05, we can say this experiment did not reject the null hypothesis and did not support the alternative hypothesis. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment support the null hypothesis due to a two-tailed p-value of .78 which is a large enough value to state that any variation of data was caused by chance. While this value was too low to present data with clear supporting evidence for the alternative hypothesis there were some trends seen within the caterpillars that may show a slight change in caterpillar life cycle due to Methoprene introduction. Juvenile Hormone tends to slow down in production as caterpillars age and this slowing down of production could be why the experimental group continued to grow at a quick rate while the control group’s weight gain slowed. The Methoprene may have acted similarly to the Juvenile Hormone on the caterpillars in the test group causing them to continue to eat despite reaching the weight of a matured larvae. While the hypothesis was not supported, there was an observable trend matching the hypothesized effect of the Methoprene. For this reason, a longer trial, perhaps one with higher concentrations of IGR and a longer duration, may be beneficial when testing the effects of Methoprene on Manduca sexta in the future. This extended test window would allow the caterpillars to reach pupal stage. Furthermore, the increased amount of Methoprene might show a more pronounced effect on the caterpillars’ weight. Based on research when Juvenile Hormone was removed from the caterpillars the pupal stage rapidly followed [Nijhout:1974 ].  This is why a longer test period should have been allowed as this would allow for the effects of Juvenile Hormone to be more thoroughly observed. Extending the experiment to the onset of pupation would allow for the correlation between weight, Juvenile Hormone, and pupation to be evaluated.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 shows a comparison in the average weight of caterpillars over time. The figure shows the growth of both groups of caterpillars and how their average weights compare to each other. The control group had a mean weight of 7.55g while the experimental group had a mean weight of 8.09g. The standard deviation was also higher in the experimental group with a value of 5.39 compared to the control groups 4.92. The p-value between the two groups was .78.*************************************************************************
