Title: The Effects of Water Color Change on Broadside Movements and Red Mane in Betta splendens

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment is to test the effects of visual cues, specifically changes in water color, on the broadside movements displayed by Betta splendens. Our hypothesis was if the color of the betta fish matched the color of the water, then that fish would be more aggressive quantified by the time it spent in broadside movements and red mane than the betta fish who did not match the water color. In this experiment, we recorded the amount of time each betta fish was in broadside movement and red mane in three different colored water treatments. Clear, normal water served as our control, while red and blue water colors served as our treatment group. We observed the interactions between a red male and a blue male betta fish for three minutes with at least a five-minute rest in between each trial for a total of three trials. To compare the groups, a two-sample, two-tailed t-test was used and showed there was not a significant difference between water color and aggressive behavior in Betta splendens with the exception of comparing red bettas in blue dye vs. red dye for red mane. This experiment is important to understanding how Betta splendens interpret and respond to visual cues, specifically color. 

Introduction:
Many animals, including humans, rely on their senses to provide them information about the surrounding environment. Specifically, visual cues are an important mechanism for animals to gather data about predator presence, food location, and mate selection. For example, one study found cows who were given overt visual cues improved their foraging efficiency compared to cows who were not given visual cues [Howery: 2000]. In addition, color visuals can provide information about the health and reproductive fitness of an animal. For instance, a study showed female strawberry poison frogs use color visuals to discriminate amongst mates with whom they wanted to reproduce with [Summers: 1999]. Furthermore, the dominant sense in fish is vision where fish can sense color change compared to other vertebrates [Rowland: 1999]. Therefore, it is essential to understand how animals use, interpret and respond to visual cues because it is a vital component to an animal’s survival and reproduction for the reasons listed previously. 
The organism of study in this experiment – Betta splendens (betta fish) – use color visuals to show aggressive behavior in males. When two male betta fish come into contact two types of intraspecific behavior may be displayed, broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements is when the fish turns its side toward its opponent and can include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2019]. Facing movements include erect pectoral fins, spreading of its gill covers and protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane (red mane) which is considered the most aggressive behavior in this category [Johnson: 2019]. Therefore, conducting research on the association of color visuals and aggression in male betta fish may help explain the animal behavior in this species. We hypothesize if the betta fish matches the water color, then that fish will spend more time in broadside movements and red mane than the fish that is not the same color as the water. For example, if the water color is red, then we would expect the red betta fish to behave more aggressively than the blue fish in red water. 

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we obtained two red male and two blue male betta fish and placed them in a tank with clear water. The betta fish were laboratory reared. Each fish was separated by an opaque and glass partition. First, we removed the opaque partition, so we could observe the interaction between a red and blue betta fish in clear water for three minutes. We did not remove the glass partition because we did not want the fish to come into physical contact with each other and risk death. In addition, we thought it would be difficult to observe the behaviors while making sure they did not attack each other. We recorded the amount of time each fish spent in broadside movement and red mane behavior. After three minutes, we replaced the opaque partition and allowed the fish to rest for at least five minutes. The clear water trial served as our baseline to make sure the betta fish behaved appropriately. Next, we obtained another tank and we put one red and one blue betta fish together, so we had a total of two tanks each containing one red and one blue betta fish separated by the partitions. We added five drops of red and blue food coloring to their respective tanks. Similar to the control, we removed the opaque partition and observed the interaction between the fish in each color treatment by recording the amount of time spent in broadside movement and red mane behavior. We observed for three minutes with at least a five-minute rest in between each trial for three trials (n = 3). To compare each type of behavior within the same colored fish but different water color treatment, we conducted a two-sample, two-tailed t-test. 

Results:
The mean time spent in broadside movement for the red fish in blue water was 27.667 seconds while the mean time spent in broadside movement for the blue fish in blue water was 139 seconds (Figure 1). The mean time spent in broadside movement for the red fish in red water was 68.667 seconds while the mean time spent for the blue fish in red water was 115.333 seconds (Figure 1). The mean time spent in red mane behavior for the red fish in blue water was 0 seconds; whereas, the mean time spent in red mane behavior for the blue fish in blue water was 192.667 seconds (Figure 2). The mean time spent in red mane behavior for the red fish in red water was 108.333 seconds; whereas, the mean time spent for the blue fish in red water was 92 seconds (Figure 2). To determine if these results were statistically significant, we ran a two-sample, two-tailed t-test with an alpha value of 0.05. The mean time spent in broadside movement for the red fish in red and blue water (t-stat = 1.125, df = 4, P = 0.324), the mean time spent in broadside movement for the blue fish in red and blue water (t-stat = 0.464, df = 4, P = 0.666), and the mean time spent in red mane behavior for the blue fish in red and blue water (t-stat = 2.322, df = 4, P = 0.081) were not statistically significant. However, the mean time spent in red mane behavior for the red fish in red and blue water was statistically significant (t-stat = 12.257, df = 4, P = 0.000254). 

Discussion:
The purpose of this experiment was to test if a change in water color had an effect on aggressive behavior, specifically broadside movements and red mane, in red and blue male betta fish. We concluded that our hypothesis was not supported according to the two-sample t-test because our p-values were larger than our alpha value of 0.05, and therefore our results were statistically insignificant with the exception of the red mane behavior in red betta fish for red and blue water color treatment. Thus, our results indicate overall water color changes, with the one exception, does not significantly affect aggressive behavior in male betta fish. Perhaps, betta fish cannot sense a color change in water as one explanation to why our results were not statistically significant. However, one study found that when the model betta fish was the same color as the betta fish being observed, the betta fish had little response; whereas, if the model betta fish’s color was most unlike the betta fish being observed, then it responded the most [Thompson: 1965]. Thus, our results should have indicated the blue betta fish should have behaved more aggressively while in the red water than the blue water and vice versa for the red betta fish. 
	An error in our experiment was not using the same red and blue betta fish in each water color treatment. For example, we had a red and blue betta fish in blue water and had a different red and blue fish in the red water. Thus, we recorded the behaviors of different fish instead of the same fish and their reactions in each treatment. We opted for this method because we were not sure of the chemical effects of dye on the fish nor if there would be a difference in the order of the color they were exposed to first. For instance, would putting them in blue water first affect their perception of red; thus, changing how they would behave and vice versa. This error affected our results because two of the fish were more aggressive than the other two which may have biased our results. In addition, we only ran three trials which resulted in a small sample size which makes it difficult to extrapolate the results and make prediction. Further experimentation could include conducting more trials, so we have a larger sample size. Also, using the same fish for each color treatment to produce more accurate results. Moreover, future experiments could test the same color betta fish in different water color treatments instead of two variables – color of fish and color of water. This experiment is important to study because it gives us insight into visual cues among Betta splendens. It suggests how this species interprets and responds to different color visual cues and further testing could provide information how betta fish to other visual cues such as shape and size.
