Title: Differences in the Rate of Habituation Based on Opponent of Bettta splendins 

Abstract:
Betta fish are known for their intraspecific aggressive behaviors. Habituation rates are the length of time that it takes the betta fish to adapt to their opponent and stop acting aggressively toward them. It was hypothesized that the mirror condition would have the fastest rate of habituation and the controll would have the slowest. Betta fish were timed for their rates of habituation for 3 scenarios, which was collected in seconds. The controll scenario consisted of two betta fish directly next to one another with a glass partition between them, the mirror scenario was one betta fish with a mirror, and the last scenario consisted of two betta fish separated by a portion of their division. There was no statistical significance between the controll and the mirror condition with a p_value of 0.067 or the controll and the distance scenario with a p_value of 0.448. The trends seen were the same as predicted with our hypotheses. Future experiments could examine these conditions with more fish in order to expel the potential for an outlier to impact the results. Understanding how long it takes these fish to habituate to their opponent is useful for determining the detrimental effects of intraspecific aggressive behaviors. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins, commonly known as betta fish, are a type of fish known for their intraspecific agnostic behaviors. Betta fish will act aggressively or try to damage other fish of the same species. One betta fish can respond to another betta fish’s aggressive behaviors by either ignoring it, matching it, fleeing, or behaving in a submissive way [Johnson:2016]. The most common way that a betta fish responds to another betta fish is by matching its behavior and acting very aggressive toward the other fish. After a certain period of time, the betta fish will habituate to the other fish, meaning that they will stop acting aggressively toward the other fish when they realize that they or no longer a threat to them [Meliska: 1976]. Understanding how the rate of habituation differs when the betta fish are separated by distance and how a fish responds to its own mirrored image will help researchers understand betta fish physiology. It is hypothesized that the rate of habituation of one male betta fish exposed to his own image in a mirror will be faster than the two fish next to one another. Similarly, it is hypothesized that the rate of habituation of two male betta fish separated by distance will be faster than the rate of the two fish next to one of another. 


Materials and Method:
3 male Betta fish were obtained and placed in equal and separated portions of the same water. They were rested for 5 minutes after being placed into the tank. Then a mirror was placed on the end of the tank in front of 1 Betta fish. The timer began once the fish first saw its reflection. This 1 Betta fish was observed and then after the fish habituated for 30 seconds, the timing was stopped. Habituation was defined as the fish seeing itself and not reacting aggressively for 30 seconds; this indicated that the fish had habituated to its aggressive behavior. After habituation, the fish were rested for 5 minutes in between each trial. This scenario was repeated 3 times. Between 2 fish, the opaque screen was removed and the fish were then observed and their aggressive behaviors were recorded. The timing began once the fish first saw the other fish. The time of the fish was recorded after habituation. The final results were recorded. After habituation, the fish were rested for 5 minutes in between each trial. This scenario was repeated 3 times. Then the fish in the middle section was removed from the tank. After this fish was removed, the two opaque screens were removed, but the fish were separated by the distance of one portion. The timing began once the fish had seen each other and aggressive behaviors of the two male Betta fish were the recorded.  Timing was stopped after 30 seconds had passed with zero aggressive behaviors toward the other fish. Then the screens were placed back down and the fish were given time to rest. This scenario was repeated 3 times. After all habituation data was recorded, two one-tailed two-sample t_tests were used comparing the mirror scenario with the two male fish next to one another and the two male fish separated by distance with the two male fish next to one another.

Results:
The average rate of habituation for the mirror situation was 49 seconds. The rate of habituation for the two fish next to one another was 201.67 seconds. The rate of habituation of the two fish separated by 1 partition was 190.33 seconds (Figure 1). There was no significent difference between the mirror condition and the two fish next to one another (t=1.87, d.f.=4, p=0.067). The p_value obtained was 0.067, indicating that there was a 6.7% chance that our results were due to chance. There was no significent difference between the two fish next to one another and the two fish separated by a partition in the middle (t=0.13, d.f.=4, p=0.448). The p_value was 0.448, meaning that there was a 44.8% chance that these results were due to chance.

Discussion:
Prior to conducting this experiment, it was hypothesized that the mirror condition would have a lower rate of habituation than the other two conditions and the separation scenario would have a lower rate of habituation than the controll scenario. The results from this experiment did not significently support the hypotheses made earlier. The betta fish followed in the general trends of our hypothesis; however, the results were not statistically significent (Figure 1). Previous research supports our findings by concluding that the betta fish shown live opponents habituated at slower rates that their own mirror image [Meliska: 1976].   The betta fish habituated slower to their live opponents because of the strength of the stimulus. Another betta fish will move around and not fully mimic the expressions like a mirror image will clearly do [Rhoad.: 1975]. Thus, the strength of the stimulus is dependent on how drastically it differs from the individual subject, which in this case was the betta fish. The distance differences between the fish have been seen to impact the context of the betta fish fighting; thus, the male betta fish are less aggressive when a male opponent is farther away  [Dzieweczynski:2005]. This trend supports our experimental results because if the betta fish are less aggressive in the distance condition as a whole due to the distance, then their habituation rates would be faster than that of the betta fish right next to one another.   One potential error from this experiment includes the inadequate amount of trials from the betta fish. In order to expel potential error from the experiment, the increased number of trials will get rid of the impact of an outlier. This would have been incredibly useful in the controll situation, which had one large outlier that created a very large standard deviation. Future experiments could run these same experimental conditions with the more trials in order to expel outliers that may have a significent impact on the final results. This experiment helps to further understand the aggressive behaviors of betta fish and their habituation patterns in different artificial scenarios.
