Title: The effects of Precor on the growth of Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to determine if Manduca Sexta caterpillar’s growth will be affected if Juvenile Hormone (JH) is added to their food. Manduca Sexta, part of the order Lepidoptera, are affected by the Juvenile Hormone because this hormone interrupts the caterpillar’s normal development. [Tunaz: 2004]. These caterpillars have two main stages of development, the pupal and larval stages, thus making them model organisms for the effects of Juvenile Hormone. As the levels of JH decrease, different stages of molting occur. Without the presence of JH, the caterpillars turn into their metamorphic phase and thus are finished developing [Browder: 2001]. A type of JH is precor, which is the exact hormone given to the caterpillars through their food in this experiment. Adding precor interrupts the caterpillar’s normal stages of development. Thus, when five drops of precor are added to each insect’s food source, their average weight will be less than the controll group at the end of two weeks. 

Materials and Method:
To set up the experiment, two containers, each with four compartments were obtained. Each compartment was labeled one through four, one as the controll and the other as treatment. Then, 10 grams of food were placed in each compartment. For one of the two groups, 5 drops of water was mixed into the food. This group was the controll group. The other group had 5 drops of Precor mixed into their food and this group was the treatment. These two containers were placed in an incubator. Every day for two weeks, the caterpillars were weighed and fed the same amount with the same amount of water and precor added to the perspective groups. Fecal matter was removed as necessary from the containers. 
The independent variable is the amount of precor added to the food supply. The dependent variable is the average weight of larvae. The controll is the average weight of larvae not treated with Precor.
To analyze the data, a one-tailed t_test was performed to determine a p_value. This was used to determine if there was statistical significance or not. The raw data was put into a bar chart form, where error bars are added. 


Results:
The weight measurements over a two-week period of the controll group was not statistically substantial from that of the controll group weight (d.f.=6; t-value=0.983402; p_value=0.181693; N=4). Although the weight of both the controll group and treatment group did increase over time, there was no notable difference between the two groups (Figure 1). 







Discussion:
This experiment involved testing to see if the addition of the Juvenile Hormone Precor had an effect on the rate of growth of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The initial hypothesis was rejected due to the statistical insignificance between the controll and treatment groups. Since the p_value&gt;0.5 (table 1), the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is unable to be accepted. Since the caterpillars in the controll group as well as the treatment group both increased in growth at about the same rate, the Precor did not appear to have an effect on the treatment group (Figure 1). All of the caterpillars except for one remained alive throughout the experiment. The one controll caterpillar died on day 13 but was an outlier in the data from the beginning of the experiment. This outlier lowered the average weight of the controll group, thus contributing to the hypothesis being false. The results of this experiment could be due to the low dose of the Juvenile Hormone precor [Dominick 1984].  
	In order to improve this experiment, one could add more drops of Precor to the treatment group. By adding even more of the hormone that affects the growth rate of these caterpillars, a greater effect might be able to be seen in the results. Another option is to measure the length as well as the weight in order to see if the length and weight growth were proportionally affected by the Precor. Additionally, one could have a bigger sample size of Manduca Sexta in both the treatment and controll groups.
