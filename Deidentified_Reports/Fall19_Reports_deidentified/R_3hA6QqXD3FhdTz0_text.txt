Title: The Effect of Acidity on Root to Shoot Ratio of Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted in order to determine the effects of acidity on resource allocation in plants. 
In this experiment, we measured the effect of adding a 3.5 pH solution to buckwheat plants in comparison to a controll group (only water). This was conducted to determine the effects of acidic conditions on plant growth and more specifically, root to shoot ratio in order to explore resource allocation in plants. We hypothesized that the plants in the experimental group would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the plants in the controll group due to a different resource allocation and photosynthetic inhibition.  The data illustrated that the experimental group plants had a higher root to shoot ratio as we predicted, but our alternative hypothesis was rejected due to our results being statistically insignificent. It is important to explore different conditions for buckwheat growth as they are very commonly used for cooking and feed. 


Introduction:
This experiment is conducted in order to determine the effects of acidity on resource allocation in plants by measuring their root to shoot ratio. Root to shoot ratio is a commonly used indicator of where a plant is allocating its nutrients in order to favor different growth processes over others. More specifically, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is studied in order to determine the effect of acidity on the growth rate of these plants. Buckwheat has been grown in America since the 1700s and the crop is common on farms in the Midwest and Northeastern regions of the country. Buckwheat grain is commonly used to produce flour and other human foods with secondary uses including grain food for livestock and seed [Biddington: 1982]. Buckwheat is a very versatile crop as it can grow in a multitude of climate conditions. Buckwheat grows best in soils with medium texture and good drainage and can even tolerate a slightly acidic soil pH (5-6) unlike most plants [Biddington: 1982]. Because of this, we should test the growth of buckwheat in different soil pHs to find how pH affects root to shoot ratio. Acidity is an abiotic factor (a stimuli that comes from a non-living source) that inhibits growth in most crops [Johnson: 2019]. The use of a 3.5 pH solution in this experiment is meant to replicate the effects of acid rain. Acid rain is any form of precipitation that is acidic and it is caused by emissions of Sulfur dioxide and Nitrogen dioxide [Lal: 2016]. Acidic solutions enter the leaf tissue through the cuticle and inhibit enzymes utilized for photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism, creating a negative effect on plant growth.  Roots and shoots are typically more sensitive to low pH conditions than other parts of the plant so they are measured in the experiment [Lal: 2016]. According to a similar experiment, if acid is given to the plants, the shoot length will be reduced due to photosynthetic repression and the roots will grow more than them in comparison [Biddington, 1982].  We hypothesize that if buckwheat plants are given water and an acidic solution, then they will have a higher root to shoot ratio than the controll group of plants that are given only water.

Materials and Method:
First, six different containers filled with soil were gathered and one scoop of Miracle-Gro was added to each container. Then, Containers 1-3 were labeled as part of the controll group and Containers 4-6 were labeled as part of the experimental group. 15 buckwheat seeds were added to each container and these seeds were mixed into the soil. The containers were then given 50 Ml of water and placed in the greenhouse. For the next two weeks, the experimental group of plants were given 200 Ml of water and 50 Ml of a 3.5 pH solution The controll group was given the same amount of water but was not given any acid. At the end of this data collection period, the roots and shoots of three plants in each container were weighed in order to analyze the data. The root to shoot ratio of each plant is calculated by dividing the root weight by the shoot weight. The statistical test used to analyze the data of this study was a two-tailed two-sample T-test. 

Results:
According to Figure 1, the average root to shoot ratio for the controll group overall was 0.28. The average root to shoot for the experimental group was 0.39. The standard deviation between the controll group containers was 0.117 while the standard deviation for the experimental group containers was 0.140. A two-sample T-test was used to determine whether or not the results were statistically significent. The test determined that the t-value was 1.30 and the p_value was 0.262 with 4 degrees of freedom. 

Discussion:
The p_value of 0.262 (greater than 0.05) exemplified that the results of the study were statistically insignificent. This means that the hypothesis that the experimental group would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the controll group could not be confirmed. Future studies would need to be conducted to prove that the data from this experiment was not due to chance. This could be attributed to a multitude of factors but the most likely reason was that the buckwheat seeds were not given enough time to all germinate. A confounding factor leading to the buckwheat seeds not germinating could have been overcrowding in the containers and not giving the plants sufficient room to grow without interference from other roots. Also, our experiment was started around one week after the other lab groups because the original study using mung beans was stopped early because the mung beans were not given sufficient water each day to grow. Experiments similar to this one have been conducted in the past and have shown similar results. In another study using cauliflower plants, acid has been shown to contribute to higher average root weight and a higher root to shoot ratio [Biddington: 1982]. This can most likely be attributed to the roots of the plant growing away from the acid in an attempt to reach more optimal growing conditions. The increase in root weight may also be caused by acid inhibiting shoot growth and directing the movement of growth metabolites away from the shoots and to the roots [Biddington: 1982]. The lower shoot weight in the experimental group is also correlated with photosynthetic inhibition. Photosynthetic inhibition occurs in acidic soil conditions because many enzymes involved in photosynthesis do not work optimally at an acidic pH [Murakami: 2002]. The leaves of the plant collect light energy for photosynthesis and when that process is inhibited, the nutrients in the plant will reallocate to the roots [Murakami: 2002]. Finding ideal growing conditions for buckwheat plants is important because buckwheat produces human food. We need to be able to find a cost-effective and efficient way to grow plants like these and experiments like this one are an important part of agricultural science. Finally, we need to able to predict the effects that acid rain has on plants because it is common on farms where there is a lot of runoff.
