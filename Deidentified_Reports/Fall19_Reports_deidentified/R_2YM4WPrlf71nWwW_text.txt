Title: Effects of Excess Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
nope

Introduction:
The Tobacco Hornworm, or Manduca Sexta, was the subject of our experiment for this lab. When fully grown it is classified as a moth in the order of Lepidoptera. Manduca Sexta goes through the typical stages of a moth: larva, pupa, and adult. These stages are controlled by two main hormones ecdysterone (E20) and Juvenile Hormone (JH), both play big roles in the growth and development of the organism is very crucial ways, that allow the insect to grow and transition from each stage to the next as smooth as possible. For example, both affect molting, and though ecdysterone initiates the timing of each molt, the JH levels determine the type of molt [Berger: 1992]. JH plays a big role in the early development of the insect, where it is most abundant. There are 5 stages called “instars” that mark different sizes of the Tobacco Hornworm leading up to the point where the worm has enough nutrients to pupate. When the pupating process occurs, the JH levels drop significantly and the ecdysterone has a small peak in presence, causing metamorphosis to start [Riddiford: 1978]. Since the JH hormone is so crucial in the early life of Manduca Sexta, we hypothesize that the size of the organism will grow quicker if it is given more of this hormone, and if it keeps eating the excess JH, it will grow much larger than a worm not receiving the JH that is being provided.

Materials and Methods:
In order to test the experiment, we started with eight first instar Tobacco Hornworms, four experimental subjects, and four control subjects. They were put in their own, isolated environment which was a plastic container consisting of four equal-sized compartments. In these compartments, they were each fed 10 grams of food with 9 drops of either water or IGR (our Juvenile Hormone). The experimental group was numbered 1-4 and the control group was labeled 5-8. The worms were kept in an incubator at all times, except when they were taken out to be fed and to be weighed. They were treated with care when being handled, and were always fed their 10 grams of food after cleaning out their food from the day before, no matter how much they were actually eating. They were weighed with an electronic scale, and that weight was kept on a document shared by the group on Google Docs. As said before, the Hornworms were numbered by their compartment, and that is how we kept up with which was which. We used a two-tailed two-sample t-test. The values we used were the average weight of one group on a given day, subtracted by the weight of the day before, to give the change in weight over a one day span. This allowed for an analysis of the increase in weight. 

Results:
The statistical test that we used was a two-sample t-test, and the difference between the change in weights in these two sets is what was tested in this experiment. The p-value that was acquired from this test was too large to support the hypothesis. This means that there was no significant difference between the two groups, as the two-tailed P-value ended up being 0.6425 (degrees of freedom: 26, t-value: 0.4695). As shown by the graph, the standard deviations of the values throughout the whole process are overlapping by a significant amount, and even the line itself at one point. All of the subjects grew quickly for almost all 15 days, but around day 11 and 12, they actually started to lose mass. 

Discussion:
Before this experiment, we hypothesized that the additional JH hormone (IGR) would cause the tobacco hornworm to grow significantly more than a tobacco hornworm without the additional hormone. We believed this because of the role that it plays in the early stages of the life of a tobacco hornworm. This hypothesis was not supported. The graphed values foreshadowed our conclusion pretty clearly give the blatant similarities in the plots. Our graph and averages make it appear that there is still a difference, although it is quite small. This is deceiving because there was an outlier in the control group. Worm #5 appeared to not be eating its food, it must have been eating it though, or else it would not have lived this long. This worm ended up being approximately a quarter of the size of the other control worms, causing a significant decrease in the mean of the control group. Needless to say, this was not expected. This experiment begs the question, what would happen if we blocked this hormone in Manduca Sexta[Truman: 2002].
