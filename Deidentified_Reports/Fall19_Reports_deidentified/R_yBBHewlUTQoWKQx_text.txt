Title: Water Temperature and Aggressive Behavior of Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Aggressive behavior is common among Betta Splendens, especially between two males. Aggression of Betta Splendens can be categorized into two groups (broadside and facing movements). In this experiment, the aggressive behavior of male Betta Splendens in ideal water temperature (19 degrees Celsius) and warmer water temperature (21 degrees Celsius) was examined. After statistical analysis, we found the results to be statistically significance, revealing that Betta Splendens under warm water conditions (experimental group) displayed higher counts of aggressive behaviors than Betta Splendens under ideal water conditions (control group). Betta Splendens of the experimental group not only exhibited more aggressive behaviors numerically, but also displayed more frequently dominant behaviors under the category of facing movements than the control group. 

Introduction:
Betta Splendens, better known as Siamese Fighting Fish, originate from southeast Asia, and are most widely recognized for their aggressive behavior. Domestic Betta Splendens and non-domesticated Betta Splendens display differing intraspecific and agonistic behaviors. For instance, domesticated Betta Splendens retain their “fighting colors,” even at rest [Johnson: 2018]. Intraspecific behavior refers to an organisms’ behavioral display in the presence of a member of the same species, and agonistic behavior is the overall demonstration of aggressive behavior toward something perceived as threatening. Betta Splendens display aggression in a variety of physical manners, and these physical behaviors can be categorized into two groups – broadside movements and facing movements. Within the category of broadside movements, pectoral flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing are archetypal behaviors of Betta Splendens in this position. Within the category of facing movements, which are increasingly more aggressive, an erect pelvic fin, the spreading of the gill covering (opercula), and the protruding of the branchiostegal membranes or “red mane.” 

In terms of water temperature, ideal temperature for Betta is around 19 degrees Fahrenheit. A Betta Splendens’ size and color can change when its environment changes. When can Betta Splendens live in larger tanks, their overall body size increases. Betta Splendens’ level of activity and ability to create a bubble nest, which indicates sexual maturity in and environmental satisfaction, can also be influenced by variations in water temperature [Jaroensutasinee and Jaroensutasinee, 2000]. In this experiment, we are comparing the number of aggressive behaviors displayed by Betta Splendens in both water at room temperature and at 21 degrees Celsius. We hypothesize that Betta Splendens exposed to a warmer water temperature of 81 degrees Celsius (experimental group) will exhibit signs of increased aggression compared to Betta Splendens exposed to room temperature water. We hypothesize this because warmer water temperatures will loosen the fish’s muscles and stimulate a heightened fight-or-flight response.

Materials and Methods:
The behaviors of two Betta Splendens were observed in this experiment. One Betta Splendens was placed in a tank with water at a temperature of 19 degrees Celsius (control group). The second Betta Splendens was placed in a tank with water at a temperature of 21 degrees Celsius (experimental group). The behavior of the Betta Splendens in the control group was examined over a period of five trials. Each trial lasted two minutes. Before each trial, a plastic slide, which was separating the control Betta Splendens from another Betta Splendens not being observed, was lifted so the two Betta Splenden could see each other through a clear glass but not make physical contact. Between the five trials, the Betta Splendens rested the five minutes. Next, the behavior of the Betta Splendens in the experimental group was examined over a period of five trials as well. Before each trial, a plastic slide, which was separating the experimental Betta Splendens from the control group Betta Splendens, which was not being observed this round, was lifted so the two Betta Splenden could see each other through a clear glass but not make physical contact. The independent variable is the varying water temperatures (19 degrees or 21 degrees Celsius) and the dependent variable is the number of signs of aggression (broadside movements and facing movements). To quantify the observed behavior, the number of times each control and experimental Betta Splenden displayed aggressive mannerisms from the two categories of broadside and facing movements was recorded, and a one-tailed t-test was used to analyze the data collected. 

Results:
Overall, the experimental Betta Splenden exhibited a greater number of both broadside and facing aggression movements than the control Betta Splenden. The mean for the total number of broadside movements for the experimental Betta Splenden is 18.2 +/- 2.7. The mean for the total number of broadside movements for the control Betta Splenden is 9 +/- 1.6. The mean for the total number of facing movements for the experimental Betta Splenden is 11.2 +/- 2.2. The mean for the total number of facing movements for the control Betta Splenden is 7 +/- 1.1. The degrees of freedom is 8, and the p-value was found to be p=0.000264. As seen in Figure 1, the experimental group recorded a higher number of total aggressive behaviors than the control group. The total average number of aggressive behaviors recorded for the experimental group is 29.4 +/- 3.9. The total average number of aggressive behaviors recorded for the control group is 16.2 +/- 1.9. 

Discussion:
Our results revealed that our hypothesis was proven to be correct as the p-value (p=0.000264) was statistically significance. The intraspecific and agonistic behaviors of Betta Splenden were proven to be heightened due to exposure to warmer than ideal water temperatures of 21 degrees Celsius. Through examining the differing types of aggressive movements of Betta Splenden, we found that the experimental Betta Splenden reported higher average totals of both broadside and facing movements than the control Betta Splenden, as explained in the results. The experimental Betta Splenden reported an especially high number of facing movements such as the “red mane,” which display a more intense aggression and dominance toward another fish compared to broadside movements. Researchers at the University of Illinois conducted a similar study in which they examined the “effects of cold and heat on behavior and cerebellar function in goldfish.” They found that increased heat of water led to “exaggerated reflexes” of goldfish characterized by spasms and found that the act of heating and cooling water acts on the fish’s cerebellum and motor centers [Friedlander, Kotchabhakdi and Prosser, 1976]. This may give us some insight into our findings. The experimental Betta Splenden may have experienced a chemical change in the brain, specifically in the cerebellum which controls a vertebrate’s voluntary movements, from being exposed to warmer water. Since these changes in the cerebellum influence a fish’s motor ability, this may be a potential cause for higher levels of aggression in the experimental group. Water at room temperature does not stimulate an abnormal or heighted change in behavior because there are no environmental irregularities that would indicate a neurological change. Likewise, in an experiment conducted with Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, or convict cichlid fish, researchers found that Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum displayed higher levels of aggression in warmer water temperatures as well. They concluded that warmer water temperatures were associated with pressures to secure territorial boundaries for spawning [Ratnasabapathi, Burns and Souchek, 1992]. Although research was not conducted on the relationship between spawning and water temperature in this experiment, it could provide an alternative reason as to why Betta Splenden, exhibit more extreme levels of physical aggression in warmer waters. For Betta Splenden, warmer water temperatures as associated with spawning, and during times of potential reproduction, Betta Splenden demonstrate increased levels of aggression toward competition. For future experiments, the mating process of Betta Splenden in relation to their levels of aggression and fluctuations in water temperature could be examined. Female Betta Splenden can also be involved for future experiments when testing to see if differing water temperatures impact levels of aggression for different genders of the fish. Understanding behavioral responses of Betta Splenden when exposed to differing water temperature is important for scientists and pet owners alike. For scientists, research with organisms in relation to fluctuations of water temperature is important to conduct especially in the wake of climate change, as the environments of aquatic creatures are changing and will continue to change in the future, and these changes have environmental impacts on living beings. For pet owners, understanding the importance of maintaining ideal water temperature for Betta Splenden is key in allowing them to live a life as healthy as possible.

Figure Legends: 
The experimental group of Betta Splenden was placed in a tank of water at 21 degrees Celsius while aggressive behavior was observed. The control group of Betta Splenden was placed in a tank of water at 19 degrees Celsius while aggressive behavior was observed. To quantify behavior, the number of physical signs of aggression (broadside and facing movements) was counted. The experimental group reported a higher number of aggressive behaviors (29.4 +/- 3.9) compared to the control group (16.2 +/- 1.9). *************************************************************************
