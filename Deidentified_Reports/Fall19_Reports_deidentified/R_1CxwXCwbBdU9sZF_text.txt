Title: The Effect of Different Cutout Fish on Rate of Habituation of Betta splendens

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted in order to determine the effects of cutout fish shapes on rate of habituation in Betta splendens. In this experiment, we compared the effect of having a realistic fish cutout with a red mane, a less realistic fish cutout with a red mane and a realistic fish cutout without a red mane in order to explore ethology. We hypothesized that the realistic cutout with the red mane would produce the lowest rate of habituation due to this shape being the closest representation of an aggressive male fish. The data exemplified that cutout shape and presence of red mane had no effect on rate of habituation as the data was not significantly insignificant. It is important to do this because betta fish are commonly used in aquariums worldwide. 

Introduction:
In this experiment, we are observing behavior of a betta fish in order to explore how a fish interacts with its environment, to explore its evolutionary biology and to measure its rate of habituation to stimuli. The study of animal behavior is known as ethology and it juxtaposes observational skills from natural history and laboratory methods. Betta fish (Betta splendens) are studied in order to determine the effect of different cutout fish shapes on aggressive behavior of these fish. Aggressive behavior is measured by the fish’s’ duration of behavior. Betta fish are commonly bought to be put in aquariums due to their rich, vibrant colors and are indigenous to Thailand. Their natural habitat are ponds and muddy waters. Betta fish are used in this lab because they have many objective signs of aggressive behavior. When two male betta fish are introduced to each other, they are often very aggressive and attack each other or exhibit aggressive behavior [Peeke: 1969]. These include broadside (a fish turning its side to its opponent) and facing movements [Johnson: 2016]. The most typical behaviors include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. These behaviors are listed in order of rising aggressiveness with tail flashing being the most aggressive broadside behavior [Johnson: 2016]. According to a similar experiment, the most prevalent behavior, however, is the fish protruding its branchiostegal membranes in order to show its red mane [Peeke: 1969]. The betta fish will expose its red mane for the entire time in an encounter with a threatening male [Peeke: 1969]. We want to be able to determine if this aggressive behavior is only shown in instances with real fish, or if the fish will respond to paper cutouts that look like fish. We hypothesize that if the most realistic cutout with a red spot is used, the fish will have the lowest rate of habituation because this cutout is the most accurate representation of an aggressive male fish.

Materials and Methods:
First, we obtained one male betta fish. Then, we cut out one realistic fish with a red spot (mane), one less realistic fish with a red spot and a realistic fish without the red spot. Then, we showed the male fish every cut out shape for 5 minutes each for 3 trials for each with a rest period of 5 minutes between each trial. We then measured the rate of habituation for each group by comparing duration of aggressive behavior between each trial. The statistical test used to analyze the data of this study was an ANOVA test. 

Results:
According to Figure 1, the average duration of aggressive behavior for the more realistic fish with the red mane was 287 seconds. The average duration of aggressive behavior for the less realistic fish with the red mane was 288 seconds and the average duration for the more realistic fish without the red mane was 289 seconds. The standard deviation for the first group trials was 15.37, 11.53 for the second group trials and 2.52 for the third group trials. An ANOVA test was used to determine whether or not the results were statistically significant. The test determined that the p-value was 0.959 with 2 degrees of freedom. 

Discussion:
The p-value of 0.959 (greater than 0.05) exemplified that the results of the study were statistically insignificant. This means that the null hypothesis was rejected. Our hypothesis that the most realistic cutout with the red spot would have the lowest rate of habituation was rejected. Regardless of cutout shape or presence of a red spot, the male fish utilized in this study showed an almost equally long duration of aggressive behavior towards the three shapes. The fish exhibited tail slapping, tail whipping, exposed its red mane, moved its pectoral fins and bit at the cutout. The fish also went up for air often, illustrating that the aggressive behavior conducted by the fish was very energetic. The results of this study were confirmed by a similar experiment where the Betta splendens showed aggression to both the control and experimental groups regardless of similarity to a real fish [Meliska: 1976]. The behavior of the fish was in response to the shape because the red mane made no difference in the results. Also, the specificity of the shape did not affect the betta fish’s’ behavior in this experiment. According to a study conducted by another scientist, we do not fully understand complex visual representations and how the betta fish respond to them [Neri: 2019]. We do not know whether or not the betta fish is able to differentiate between anything other than simple colors and relative size to its own body [Neri: 2019]. This is replicated by the results of the study as the male only responded to the cutout shape and the red mane had no effect on the fishes behavior. This exemplifies that the blue color of the cutout shape likely was the cause of the aggressive behavior of these fish as it was the only constant in the study. Further experiments need to be conducted in order to measure the effects of different colors and different variations of cutout shapes in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these fishes behavior. Also, we could use different male betta fish to measure if habituation differs between fish. It is important to understand how Betta splendens interact with their environment because they are commonly used in aquariums. We want to be able to predict what behavior they will have to certain stimuli to ensure that they don’t become overly stressed or attack other fish.
