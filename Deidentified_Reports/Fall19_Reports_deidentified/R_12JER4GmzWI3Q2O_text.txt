Title: Effects of Nitrate and P2O5 on Mung Bean Development

Abstract:
The effects of nitrogen and phosphorus levels on Vigna radiata, or mung beans, was tested to see if high concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus will affect growth and development. Growth and development of mung beans is examined through measuring the length of the roots and shoots of each plant within each group; nitrogen, phosphorus, nitrogen and phosphorus, and a controll, and with these groups. If mung beans are grown in excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous), then it will result in a longer root to shoot ratio. The results showed that the group given Nitrate and p2o5 had the highest root to shoot ratio in comparison to the rest of the groups and therefore the experiment did show that mung beans given both nitrate and p2o5 in equal concentrations would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the other groups. In other experiments it is important other variables are consistent across all groups, like amount of sunlight, to have reliable results.

Introduction:
	Plants require nutrients to grow and develop throughout its life span and it allocates its resources according to its necessities and availability of resources. To examine how nutrients affect plant resource allocation, an experiment was conducted to measure changes in root to shoot ratios in mung beans grown in varying concentrations of nutrients.  Mung beans were chosen to be the focus because of availability and it’s high rate of growth.  Mung beans have roots and shoots like all other plants. The plants shoots are made up of the stem and leaves of the plant. Stems are the principal supporting structure of the shoot. They are involved in light capture and competition through lifting the plant up [Johnson: 2018]. Roots not only serve as the primary absorptive organ, but they also anchor the plant to the soil [Johnson: 2018]. Part of plant growth is energy is taken in from the sun by the leaves. Leaves are the principal photosynthetic organ of the plant and increased with allocation of resources to leaves leads to plants with a high growth rate when light and soil nutrients are plentiful [Johnson: 2018]. If there is a high abundance of nutrients and a good source of sunlight, the plant will express longer root length while keeping a smaller shoot. This process of changing the allocation of resources based on environmental conditions is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson:2018].. The dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio for just the length. With an abundance of soil nutrients, it can be expected that the mung beans treated with both nitrate and p2o5 will have longer root systems and shooter shoots.

Materials and Method:
First, mung beans were soaked in water for 24 hours and 8 pots, Nitrate, and p2o5 were acquired. 48 mung bean seeds were divided into 4 groups with 12 seeds and 6 seeds per pot each. 2 seeds were placed in each of the four holes made in the pots. Group 1 was treated with 50 Ml of a 20% p2o5 solution. Group 2 was treated with 50 Ml of a 32% nitrate solution. Group 3 was treated with 25 Ml of the nitrate solution and 25 Ml of p2o5. Group 1 was our controll that was watered with 50 Ml of water. After 2 weeks of treatment data was collected. The plants were removed and washed in water to remove any soil left on the roots. Each plant was cut from the clear color differentiation between the root and shoot of the mung bean plant. Then, the root and shoot for each individual plant were measured from each group.  Using the measurements from each group the root to shoot ratio for length was calculated for each. After gaining all the average root to shoot ratios and standard deviations (Fig 1) the data was run through an ANOVA test. This was done to test for any statistical significance between each set of data we had.


Results:
	Shown in Figure 1 and 2, it can be seen that the root to shoot ratio in the group treated with nitrate and p2o5 was higher than the rest of the groups. Group three (Nitrate and p2o5) had the highest average root to shoot ratio of 3.4 while our controll group had the lowest root to shoot ratio of 1.31. There was a significent difference in our data to support our alternative hypothesis and reject our null hypothesis. With a p_value of (0.041) there is a significent difference in root to shoot length when treated with Nitrate and p2o5 and the null hypothesis is rejected. In conclusion, the data gained from this experiment shows that there is a significent difference in root to shoot ratio when mung beans are given excess nutrients (nitrate and p2o5) versus being treated with just water and no excess nutrients. 


Discussion:
	The results supported the alternative hypothesis because the addition of both nitrate and p2o5 yielded higher root to shoot ratios in the plants treated with it. With an abundance of nutrients in the soil and plenty of sunlight, the plants grew deep into the ground, allocating much of their resources to their root growth. Group 3 in particular had an extremely high root to shoot ratio of 3.4 because of the concentration and combination of nutrients it was given. Nitrogen was one of the 2 within the combination. Nitrogen is extremely important in the development and functionality of plants and “is the key to maintaining and improving crop growth” [Lawlor D. W.: 2001]. Phosphorus was the second of the two put into group 3, specifically p2o5. Our data showed that increased phosphorus within the soil yielded higher root to shoot ratios. Simply put, soil P[hosphorous] avail-ability was higher during waterlogging periods, roots of waterlogged plants showed a morphology more favorable to nutrient uptake (finer roots) [Rubio: 1997]. The root to shoot ratio in Groups 1 and 2 were much lower than group 3 but still showed an increase in root to shoot ratio versus the controll group. Based on the data, the combination of both important nutrients provided the greatest circumstances for high root to shoot ratios compared to  the rest of the groups. Although, this could be due to sampling/experimental error. Another set of mung beans was added to the pots after the first week due to limited germination among the seeds. Plants could have also been mishandled or kept in inconsistent sunlight conditions This could have affected our plants and their root to shoot ratios.
