Title: Increased nitrogen levels in soil decreases root to shoot weight and length ratios in Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity is an essential characteristic of plants’ adaptability and survival in specific environmental conditions. Fagopyrum esculentum, commonly known as buckwheat, is a good example of a plant that can vary its root and shoot lengths due to the allocation of resources available. In order to test phenotypic plasticity in F. esculentum, an experimental group was exposed to a 15% nitrogen solution, instead of pure water, for two weeks. After the two weeks, the experimental group of F. esculentum had statistically significantly lower root to shoot weight and length ratios than the control group of F. esculentum that was not exposed to elevated nitrogen levels. These findings, further the understanding of what affects phenotypic plasticity in F. esculentum, specifically how resource allocation can increase the amount of relative foliage in F. esculentum which can help amplify its known medicinal benefits. 

Introduction:
Plants must be able to live efficiently in slightly varying habitats and conditions. The resources available to plants at any given time are extracted from their surrounding air and soil. The amount of nutrients available directly dictates the ability of the plant to perform necessary functions for survival and growth such as photosynthesis. According to the amount of resources available, a plant may respond by presenting varying phenotypes in order to maximize its survival and reproductive abilities. The ability of organisms to manipulate their genotype in response to their current environment is known as phenotypic plasticity, and the phenotypic display has been shown to be highly dependent on the environment it is exposed to [Valladares: 2006]. 
Fagopyrum esculentum, commonly known as buckwheat, is a plant known to grow in stable laboratory conditions, in a short amount of time, and its seeds are inexpensive. The buckwheat plant also grows roots and shoots that are long and large enough to realistically measure and weigh, making it a model organism for this experiment. To quantify buckwheat’s tendency to allocate resources, it was exposed to elevated nutrient levels, and its relative root to shoot ratios were analyzed for further insight on increased nutrient levels effect on phenotypic display. Plants can extract nutrients, such as nitrogen, from the soil through their roots. The nutrients can be taken up into the individual cells where they provide energy and resources for growth of the roots or shoots of the plant depending on the individual plant’s environment [Masclaux-Daubresse: 2010].
Previous studies have shown how an increase in nutrient presence increases the efficiency of photosynthetic processes in the plant foliage [Davidson:1969]. From this previous research we predicted that exposing buckwheat plants to increased nitrogen levels will cause increased shoot production relative to root production since the plants will have more resources available to increase photosynthetic activity resulting in increased foliage efficiency and growth. This change will decrease the plants’ root to shoot weight and length values. 


Materials and Methods:
F. esculentum seeds were obtained from Wake Forest Biology department along with the other necessary supplies for the following experiment. 12 seeds were planted in each pot of vermiculite, 3 pots for control and 3 pots for experimental conditions. The pots were all saturated with 200 mL of water and placed in a greenhouse with controlled temperature and light exposure. For the next two weeks, the control pots were soaked with 200 mL each of water once a day, and the experimental pots were soaked with 200 mL each of 15% Nitrogen solution once a day. At the end of two weeks, 6 plants from each condition (2 plants from each pot) were collected. Without damaging the plants, they were separated from the dirt and patted dry. Each plant was then weighed separately for its shoot weight and root weight. To measure shoot length and root length each plant’s shoots and roots were separated at the same location, at the root—shoot junction, to ensure precision in the measurements. The root to shoot weight and length ratios were then calculated for each plant and a two sample, one tailed, T-test assuming equal variances was run on the data to determine if the experimental condition had significantly lower R:S values. 

Results:
Figure 1 depicts a smaller root to shoot ratio in the experimental group for both weight and length. Statistical testing proved the R:S weight ratio of the experimental group was statistically significantly lower than the R:S weight ratio of the control group (t-stat = 2.93, df = 10, P = 0.00750). Statistical testing also proved the R:S length ratio of the experimental group was statistically significantly lower than the R:S length ratio of the control group (t-stat = 8.24, df = 10, P = 〖4.554×10〗^(-6)). 

Discussion:
The data collected from this experiment supported the hypothesis that buckwheat plants exposed to increased nitrogen levels would display lower root to shoot weight and length ratios. This effect has also been found in previous studies that have shown an increase in nutrient presence in the form, of nitrogen and phosphorus, causes a decrease in the root to shoot ratio in clover and wheatgrass due to the increased efficiency of the foliage [Davidson:1969]. Since nitrogen was available in excess to the experimental group, it is likely that this nutrient is a limiting factor for buckwheat growth. When more nitrogen is available to the plant, it is able to allocate more resources toward photosynthetic processes. The increased ability to produce energy, along with the accompanying increased need for foliage able to perform photosynthesis, both contribute to the larger shoot length and weight values relative to root length and weight values of the plants. 
	It is important to understand what influences buckwheat growth as it has been found to be a highly nutrient dense crop with multiple health benefits including cholesterol reduction and tumor inhibition [Kayashita: 1997] [Chan: 2003]. By increasing the foliage growth of buckwheat, the medicinal benefits from each individual plant can be amplified. These findings are also helpful in furthering our understanding of crop growth in general. Different chemicals could have varying effects on phenotypic displays of crops; however, if it is desirable to increase the amount of shoots a crop produces it may be beneficial to incorporate nitrogen into the fertilizer. 
	To further the research on phenotypic plasticity in the buckwheat plant, it may be helpful to determine what compounds raise the root to shoot ratio, or increase root production in the plant. By understanding what increases root production, the benefits of longer or more efficient roots can be harnessed and applied to conditions where plants with increased root growth would thrive, such as in low moisture environments.
