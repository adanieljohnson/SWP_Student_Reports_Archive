Title: The Effects of Varying levels of Soil Concentration on the Resource Allocation in Rahpanus sativus

Abstract:
Resource allocation is a vital process to the survival and reproduction of plant life with implications for the agricultural and dietary industries. With a better understanding of the acidic soil concentrations in which the Rahpanus sativus grows, the ability to efficiently grow and reproduce this species increases, enhancing its use in the dietary marketplace. It was initially hypothesized that Rahpanus sativus exposed to soil with higher acidic concentration (independent variable) will have a greater shoot length (dependent variable) as compared to those exposed to lower acidic soil concentrations. An ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer statistical test were used to compare the growth patterns of each group with the ANOVA generating a p-value (p = 0.002288), indicating a significant difference between our data for the average root:shoot ratios, and the Tukey-Kramer test indicating a statistical significance in the relationship between the control group and treatment group 2 as well as between treatment group 1 and treatment group 2, but no significance between the control group and treatment group 1. This data indicates that more of the resources in the Rahpanus sativusof were allocated to the roots as opposed to the shoots, rejecting the hypothesize of the study. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is the means by which plants distribute and utilize their biological resources and is a vital process to the survival and perpetuation of plant life. This experiment was aimed at studying the relationship between vermiculite acidity concentration and the growth of radish plants (Rahpanus sativus). The Rahpanus sativus is a widely grown plant and is commonly harvested for human consumption. Given the agricultural and dietary implications of the production of this plant, as well as its ability to sustain life across a broad geographical range with potentially differing soil compositions, understanding the effects of the soil environment on plant development can be crucial in maximizing targeted growth in varying acidic soil environments. Studies have shown that particular plants maximize resource allocation necessary for survival specific to their specific soil conditions [Soti:2015]. Additionally, studies suggest that soil environments comprised of differing pH levels will result in varying plant development and root:shoot ratio [Walters:1983]. With an understanding of resource allocation and the role of acidic soil concentration on plant growth, it was hypothesized that Rahpanus sativus exposed to soil with higher acidic concentration (independent variable) will have a greater shoot length (dependent variable) as compared to those exposed to lower acidic soil concentrations. The basis of this hypothesis stems from the idea that the maximization of biomass will occur at functional regions of the plant, which in this study is away from the acidic soil. This study is relevant in that it grapples with plant development and the intricacies of resource allocation, which are the basis for the agricultural industry and essential in the production of food for a vast number of organisms on earth. 

Materials and Methods:
In conducting this study, the following steps were taken: nine plastic trays were collected and filled with vermiculite, followed by three Rahpanus sativus seeds being placed in each of the nine trays. Afterwards, the vermiculite in each of the trays needed to be saturated with 100mL of MiracleGro followed by a saturation of water until the vermiculite is uniformly soaked and moist to the touch. The trays then needed to be split into three groups and exposed to their respective treatment. For the control group, the soil was soaked with only water. For treatment 1 (pH3.01 HCL 5mL) the tray needed to be soaked with water and 5mL of pH3.01 HCL. For treatment 2 (pH3.01 HCL 10mL) the tray needed to be soaked with water and 10mL of pH3.01 HCL. The water saturation and respective treatment exposure procedures were repeated daily for two weeks and the trays were kept in a greenhouse with exposure to sunlight. At the end of the two-week period, the plants were extracted from the vermiculite by removing the plant and soil from the tray and soaking them until water until the plant’s roots were free of any vermiculite. The root and shoot lengths were then precisely measured with a ruler and their respective lengths were recorded. To examine the relationship between the acidic soil concentrations and root:shoot lengths, an ANOVA and tukey-kramer statistical test were used  and considered the average root:shoot ratios calculated from our measurements. All statistical results were recorded and analyzed.

Results:
The average root:shoot ratios for the control group, treatment group 1 and treatment group 2 were 0.74  ± 0.0795, 0.76  ± 0.206, and 1.38  ± 0.113 respectively. The ANOVA test generated a p-value (p = 0.002288) indicating that there is a significant difference in our data for our mean root:shoot ratios (Figure 1). Additionally, the Tukey-Kramer statistical test did not show a statistical difference between the control group and the treatment 1 group (pH3.01 HCL 5mL) for the mean root:shoot ratios. The Tukey-Kramer statistical test did, however, show a statistical difference between the mean root:shoot ratios of the control group and that of the treatment 2 group (pH3.01 HCL 10mL) as well as between treatment group 1 and treatment group 2 (Table 1). 

Discussion:
The results of the ANOVA test generated result indicative of a significant relationship between our data for the average root:shoot ratios and the acidic concentrations. Comparable studies have demonstrated findings indicative of similar results, suggesting that plants will have varying root:shoot ratios in regions with different soil makeups [Walters:1983]. The results of the Tukey-Kramer statistical test showed no statistical difference between the control group and treatment 1 group. It also showed a statistical difference between the control and treatment group 2 as well as between treatment group 1 and treatment group 2. This data indicates that the plants allocated a greater amount of resources to the roots as compared to that of the resources allocated to the shoots when exposed to higher environmental acidic concentration. The results of our statistical tests indicate that our hypothesis was not supported. This conclusion is believed to be the result of the root system responding plastically to the most viable external nutrient source [Dunbabin: 2002]. The implications of these results could suggest that Rahpanus sativus grown in soil with higher acidic concentration would be more beneficial for the agricultural industry as it produces greater root size, which is the portion of the plant typically used in dietary consumption. In future studies, a more operationalized set of procedures could be helpful, in addition to many more trials, in drawing conclusions about the relationship between this particular plant and the acidic concentration of its soil.
