Title: Effect of supplemental nitrogen on Raphanus sativus root length

Abstract:
To conserve energy, plants will allocate their resources to their structures differently and efficiently, relative to their environment. To further the study of resource allocation, we tested how additions of nitrogen to the soil of Raphanus sativus would affect root length. It was predicted that a control group of R. sativus that was not fed a nitrogen supplement would display longer root lengths than an experimental group that was fed extra nitrogen. The significant data revealed longer root lengths for the group of R. sativus that was not provided with extra nitrogen, as predicted. Based on these findings, we can conclude that in the absence of an addition of a necessary nutrient like nitrogen, R. sativus, and likely other plants, will dedicate more energy to increase root lengths to collect sufficient nitrogen. We can also predict that a similar pattern of resource allocation can therefore be further observed in other plant species in different environments with differing resources and challenges. Therefore for farmers, this understanding of root length in response to nitrogen can affect decisions that are made regarding the dispersal of resources to crops, and their subsequent care and maintenance thereafter to maximize yield.

Introduction:
Plants maximize their resources by efficiently allocating them to different areas of themselves in response to changes in their respective environments. For instance, in relatively dry environments, cacti will generally use significant amounts of their energy to preserve their water supply for as long as possible. This is demonstrated in one study done in the Great Plains, where it was observed that an Echinocactus was deprived of water for six years during a severe drought but maintained the same proportion of water over that time span. However, it had lost nearly 30 percent of its initial weight. Upon further examination, it was determined that the plant had utilized some of its sugar by oxidizing it to produce water and thus had been able to maintain its original water content [Cook: 1942]. For our experiment conducted in class, we wanted to test this concept of resource allocation by adding nitrogen in the form of a nitrate mixture to the soil of Raphanus sativus (radishes), then measure the length of root growth after two weeks compared to a control group.  R. sativus is an ideal species for this experiment due to its rapid growth rate and easy accessibility of its roots. Regarding resources, it has been found that nitrogen is an essential element that virtually all plants utilize to build amimo acids, which make up proteins. In addition, they use nitrogen to synthesize chlorophyll, a green pigment that allows plants to absorb certain wavelengths of light that they can then use for photosynthesis. It is also key to many other processes such as the generation of growth and replicating DNA sequences. Therefore, nitrogen is essential to the existence and survival of virtually all plants and makes it an ideal resource to study. To test this concept of resource allocation by utilizing nitrogen, we created a control group (no extra nitrogen) and an experimental group (extra nitrogen). We hypothesized that if a group of R. sativus was fed a nitrogen supplement, then it would produce shorter roots than a control group due to less strain on, and therefore decreased resource allocation to, its roots.

Materials and Methods:
To create the separate environments for the control and experimental groups, we labeled a tray with six plastic pots inside, with all six containing the same untreated soil. We then planted 10 R. sativus seeds in each of the six pots. To ensure uniformity, we watered all six pots 200 milliliters of tap water every day, and the three experimental pots received 20 milliliters of the nitrogen mixture daily as well. The tray containing the pots was placed in a greenhouse in full exposure to sunlight, with none of the pots receiving more sun exposure than any other. At the end of a two-week period, every pot was removed from the tray, and all plants that had sprouted were carefully and individually sorted from the soil. We then determined the longest root on three randomly selected R. sativus from each pot, for a total of 18 plants, and measured them. The longest root of each of the 18 plants was measured to ensure uniformity of methods, but also because the longest root demonstrated the maximum growth potential of the plants that could physically be observed. In total, theoretically nine plants were chosen from the experimental group of R. sativus, and nine from the control group (this was not possible for this particular experiment due to complications which are explained in detail later). Of these randomly selected 18 plants, one from each pot was also randomly chosen to contribute to an overall average maximum root length per treatment group that could be analyzed using a t test. These six root lengths representing one plant from each pot were averaged to create two means; one mean consisted of three longest root lengths from the three control pots, while the other consisted of three longest root lengths from the three experimental pots. After each maximum root length had been measured and recorded, we analyzed our data using a one-tailed two sample t-test.  


Results:
Based on our results featured in the above graph, it is evident that the control group of radishes displayed on average longer roots than the experimental group, with their average maximum root length between the three pots at 99.22 +/- 19.99 millimeters. Meanwhile, the experimental group had an average maximum root length of 58.44 +/- 35.02 millimeters. While there is some overlap of the error bars, the one-tailed two-sample t test revealed a p-value of 0.004, indicating that the difference between the average maximum root lengths of the control and experimental groups is significant. One aspect of this experiment that needs to be considered is the unaccounted-for lack of growth of the radishes in the third experimental pot; only one radish seed sprouted out of ten planted. Therefore, it was the only plant that we were able to collect from the third experimental pot, while the other five pots all had three plants chosen at random from each one to have their maximum root lengths measured. This forced us to have to place, and then run, two zeros into the t test analysis. Despite this perceived flaw, we ran a separate t test with the two zeros not accounted for in the test, and the data still came out to be significant, with the alternative p-value in this instance still less than 0.05, at 0.001.

Discussion:
Based on the data analysis indicating that the difference in root lengths between the two groups is significant, with the average maximum root length of the control group being longer than the average of the experimental group, we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported. By knowing the importance of the utilization of nitrogen in plants, we can also conclude that the control group of R. sativus that was not fed extra nitrogen likely grew longer roots in order to compensate for their lesser amount of nitrogen. The control R. sativus would have recognized that more resources would need to be dedicated to growth in their roots than say their leaves or stem, since no other part of the plants could function properly without a sufficient amount of nitrogen. The experimental R. sativus that received supplemental nitrogen in the form of the nitrate mixture, however, had a consistent and reliable supply of nitrogen that ensured that fewer resources would have to be dedicated to extending the length of their roots in search of more nitrogen. Even though we did have to run our t test with two zeros, the resulting p-value was still significant, so this solidified our conclusion of our data and did nothing to detract from the support of our hypothesis based on the data analysis. We have drawn further support for our hypothesis and theory on plant resource allocation from a study that also manipulated resource allocation in plants. This study looked at many instances of resource allocation among various plants, finding that one crop that had seeds planted much closer together reduced the number of branches produced and lengthened the main stem in an effort to maximize the amount of light captured. Another study from the same research found that protein and lipid content in Arabidopsis plants were more closely related to the number of seeds produced than the overall seed mass, indicating that the specific content of the resources in any particular area of the plant are a more accurate predictor of growth and resource allocation than mass alone [Bennet: 2012]. With these studies in mind, combined with the results of our experiment, we can conclude that the concept of resource allocation in plants is not isolated to one type of plant or environment. In the future, this experiment would need to be replicated ideally at least two more times, and then again with more R. sativus seeds per pot to increase the likelihood of having more than enough plants to randomly select a predetermined subsample to be measured. By replicating this experiment later on and furthering the research on plant allocation of resources, it is the hope that farmers would be able to better determine where and when to distribute food and resources to their crops so as to produce the greatest and most abundant yields possible with a limited amount of resources each year.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Displayed is the average maximum radish root length after two weeks of nitrogen treatment; the third experimental pot only produced one radish sprout, so therefore zeros (two) were included in the overall data analysis, and this graph reflects that analysis. The error bars represent the standard deviations of the control and experimental groups of 19.99 and 35.02 millimeters, respectively.
