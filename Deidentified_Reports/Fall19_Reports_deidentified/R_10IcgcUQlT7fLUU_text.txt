Title: The change of Plant Allocation in Buck Wheat under acidic soil environment

Abstract:
As the global population keeps growing in the past decades, food production efficiency is becoming a severe problem that we could not avoid, especially for developing countries, some population in developing countries don’t even meet their basic requirements for foods. Thus, some scientific method need be discovered in order to increase the production of agriculture. This experiment is trying to find out the influence of pH on the plant allocation process. Buckwheat is used as the targeted plant, and the root to shoot weight ratio is measured as the indication of plant allocation. The hypothesis is that as the pH of the soil decreases, the root to shoot weight ratio increases. Two-sampled t_test is the statistical method used in this experiment. Through collecting and analyzing data, and utilizing the two-sampled t_test, the null hypothesis is supported, which is that the pH of soil doesn’t have significent influence on the plant allocation. However, this doesn’t mean that there is completely no relation between the pH of soil and the plant allocation. The reason why this experiment supported the null hypothesis may be an abnormal data set in the experiment group. Further experiments could be done on collecting more data sets to overcome the randomness of the data collected. 

Introduction:
Resources in the nature are usually scarce, even in the highly nutrient areas, there may still be some other resources are lacked. For example, in the forest, water and nutrients are abundant, there are easily accessed nutrients everywhere, however, the sunlight then become a highly competitive resource because of the shade created by the tall trees in the forest. And in the desert area, the sun light is never a problem (even sometimes too much,) but the water resource and the nutrients are highly scarce. Under the selection pressure caused by the natural selection, the plants developed to have their own method to overcome the scarcity of the resources in order to keep them alive. The ways that plants vary their behavior under different environments are called the resources allocation of plants. Resource allocation leads to the fact that even for the same plant, they may appear to have minor difference in different growth environments. [Gleeson; 1992] The recourse allocation is extremely important due to the immobility of the plants. For the plants in the desert, for instance, they need to spare more resource on growing their roots longer in order to get water from the underground water resource or gather the water that may drop in a wider area. In this situation, for the same plant, the root to shoot ratio may differ because of the different source allocation. The environment in real life highly varies around the world, there may exist many different extreme environments. Acid rain, which causes the acidity of the soil to decrease, may be one of the most influential factors changing the growing pattern of the plant. [Zeng; 2010] So, a question needs to be considered that: how would the plants be influenced under the environment with different pH? Thus, change in pH is chosen as the independent variable of the experiment. In order to know how the resource allocation differs in acidic and neutral environments, the root to shoot weight ratio was tested. Buckwheat was the targeted plant that we test on, and we hypothesized that: As the acidity of the soil increases, the root to shoot weight ratio increases. The acidity of the soil was measured by the pH value.

Materials and Method:
To rest the plant allocation under different pHs, the independent variable in this experiment is the pH of the soil, which is controllled by adding acidic solution to the soil. The dependent variable is the root to shoot weight ratio. The experiment has two groups: one controll group and one experimental group. The controll group has a neutral pH around 7, while the experimental group has an acidic environment, which pH is smaller than 7. To start the experiment, added enough soil in six planting boxes, and added some fertilizer to all six planting boxes, then added enough water to rinse the soil until the water came out from the bottom of the boxes. Then, planted 15 buckwheat seeds into each planting box and covered the seed with little amount of soil. The next step aimed at separating the controll group and the experiment group: First, separated the six planting boxes into three controll group and three experiment group. Second, Added 40 Ml of pH 3.5 water to experiment group. 
After the first day settling of two groups, repeatedly added 200 Ml water to each planting box in both controll and experiment groups, and an extra 40 Ml of pH 3.5 water to the experiment group every day for two weeks. 
After waiting for two weeks, took the plant out and carefully cleaned the dusk on the plant using water. Cut the plant into two parts (root and shoot,) according to the color change from green to white around the separation of the root and shoot. Then, measured the weight of the roots and shoots of at least three plants from each planting box, calculated their root to shoot weight ratio. 
The statistical test used in this experiment is the two tailed Two-Sample T-test. The specific statistical test was used for the reason that there are two groups (controll and experimental groups) in total and we are trying to find out whether there is significent difference between the controll group and the experiment group. The Two-Sample T-test checked whether there is significent difference between the controll group and the experiment group (which has a lower pH.)


Results:
From the data collected from the experiment, the Experiment group seems to have a higher root to shoot weight ratio, 0.39, compare to the controll group, which is 0.28. The standard deviation of the controll group is 0.042 and the Standard Deviation of the Experiment group is 0.140. The standard deviation of the controll group is smaller than that of the the experiment group. P-value collected from the two-sampled t_test is 0.12, which is larger than 0.05. Since the p_value is larger than 0.05, it means that there is no significent difference between the controll group and experiment group. 

The error bar of controll group and experiment group overlaps, which also indicates that there is not significent difference between the controll group and experiment group. 

Discussion:
The controll group which in the neutral environment has an average root to shoot ratio of 0.28, which the acidic experiment group has an average root to shoot ratio of 0.39. It seems that the experiment group had an overall larger root to shoot weight ratio. The standard deviation of the controll group is 0.042, while the standard deviation of the experiment group is 0.140. This means that the controll group has a more converged data, while the experiment group has a wiser range. The two-sample t test has a result of p_value = 0.12, which indicates that there is no significent difference between the controll group and experiment group. [Stephanie; 2018] This supports the null hypothesis that: as acidity of the soil increases, the root to shoot weight ratio would increase. However, this doesn’t mean that there is no difference between the root to shoot weight ratio of controll group and that of the experimental group, since in the original data collected, there was a abnormal data set from one planting box of the experiment group, they appeared to be much taller than other experiment groups. This causes the standard deviation to increase for the experiment group, also increases the p_value from the two-sample t_test. The abnormal data may cause by the loss of acidic ion when water flushing. Or, it’s possible that the uneven distribution of acidic ions in the box cause the plants grown from the abnormal planting box may not be influenced by the acid solution added to the soil. For further experiments, more data samples in controll and experiments should be tested to decrease the randomness of the data collected. Fully understand how pH influences the plant allocation means that people can understand in which situation, one part of the plants would grow more. This would largely help the agricultural industry to do the manual selection of which parts of the plant is more desired. [Zeng; 2010] Thus, increase the yield of production. Also, how the alkaline environment influences the plant allocation could be tested to enable knowing more about how pH influences the plant allocation. 
The experiment also tried using different targeted plants in order to increase the generality of the results gained from the experiment. Mung beans are used as the alternate targeted plants to operate the experiment. To magnify the difference of pH between controll group and the experiment, we decrease the water input into both groups during the two weeks and increase the amount of pH 3.5 solution to the experiment group. However, after two weeks of growth, there is almost no seed succeeded in germinate in either controll group or the experimental group. It may cause by the too less water added every day, enough water resource is a critical requirement for Mung bean seeds to germinate. [Fyfield; 1989] It is also a kind of plant allocation, when water is under the requirement level, plant seeds prevent is from germinating, instead, they just keep the activity of the seed and wait for a better environment to germinate and grow. As more water was given to the seed, the seeds gain water and starts to allocate the resource to growth and starts to germinate.
