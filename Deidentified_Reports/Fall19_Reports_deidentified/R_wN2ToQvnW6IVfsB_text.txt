Title: Analysis of the Effect AzaGuard, a type of Insect Growth Regulator, has on the growth of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Hormones are involved in the life cycle of holometabolous insects. Ecdysone is used as insect growth regulators in insecticides, and it is known to regulate the timing of molting specifically. The objective of this study is to discover the effect of ecdysone on the growth of insects. In this experiment, Manduca Sexta is used as the model organism, while Azaguard is used as the source of ecdysone. The hypothesis was that Azaguard will incite faster growth in the mass of Manduca Sexta. Eight Manduca Sexta were divided equally into one treatment group and one controll group. A certain amount of Azaguard was added to the food of treatment group Manduca Sexta in the study to reach the goal, while those that had not were set as controll groups. Two sample T-test is utilized to statistically analyze the data. The result showed that the experimental group Manduca Sexta gained less weight than the controll groups, and their growing rate was also slower than the controll group. In conclusion, the alternative hypothesis was rejected. Ecdysone (20E), in fact, inhibits the growth of Manduca Sexta. 

Introduction:
A holometabolous insect undergoes life cycle including four major stages, from egg, larva with five instars, pupa, to adult moth [Johnson:2019]. Insects in this category have their growth and development controllled through both hormone-based and neuron-based signaling. Ecdysterone, refers to as 20E in this report, is a family of steroid hormones secreted by prothoracic glands, which is responsible for growth controll and regulating timing of molting during insect development [Purves: 2013]. 20E works together with juvenile hormone to controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis of Manduca Sexta. During the process of pupation, 20E first rises to the peak and then drops until pupation is done [Johnson:2019]. In this experiment, we aim to study how 20E could controll the pest growth and benefit the agriculture without harming other life forms, unlike most of the insecticides do. To reach our goal, we will use Azagard, a source of 20E, as the “Insect Hormone Mimics” or “Insect Growth Regulators” (IGRs) that owes to their effects on certain physiological regulatory processes essential to the normal development of insects [Tunaz: 2004]. Manduca Sexta, also known as tobacco hornworm, is chosen as the model organism because it was a typical pest, not physically harmful and had a short life span. Throughout this experiment, we will test in which way does Azaguard interferes the mass growth of Manduca Sexta and, further speaking, controll the pest in the field of agriculture. We assume that since 20E rises during pupation and it regulates the molting process of M. Sexta, it might also faster their growth. Our null hypothesis is that the addition of 20E makes no difference to the insect growth, while the alternate hypothesis is that 20E will incite faster growth in the mass of Manduca Sexta. 

Materials and Method:
For the setup of the experiment, eight Manduca Sexta larvae in fourth instar stage were picked and divided in half to a controll group and a treatment group. The independent variable for each group was the addition of a controllled amount of Azaguard, while the dependent variable was the mass of M. Sexta. The food amount, room temperature, and concentration of 20E were controllled the same to make sure they do not influence the results. 

10g of food were prepared for each caterpillar. Then we added 7 drops of water into each pile of food because we took the water amount as a controllled variable for both groups but not an independent variable. The four Manduca Sexta larvae in the controll group were treated without the addition of Azaguard (20E), while the treatment group ones had food treated with 3 drops of Azaguard (20E). The food was shaped into clumps to make sure it does not dry out. Airholes are made on the lids and box body to ensure they have enough air to breathe. Throughout the experimental process, we came to measure the mass of each insect every day for later analysis, and all of them were kept in the incubator at 27℃. To process the raw data collected, the four masses for each group of insects were taken on average, so that the means can be used for statistical tests. The average mass growth of Manduca Sexta was calculated by subtracting the initial average weight from final average weight.

We used one-tailed two-sample t_test as statistical test to see if one of our results was significently greater or lesser than another. The reason was that the masses of Manduca Sexta were measurement variables, while the groups they belonged to were categorical variables and had only two values, treatment and controll. If the probability calculated by formula is less than 0.05, then the controll group data would be considered significently greater or less than treatment group data.


Results:
The result of one-tailed two-sample t_test was that t_stats= 1.76, d.f. = 14, P Value= 0.0499.

According to our observation, the worms in treatment group appeared darker in color, and their size was decreasing from Day 5. Control group M. Sexta kept growing in both length and width throughout the process, and their green-blue color was kept as well. The feces of treatment group M. Sexta were dark brown and dry, while those of controll group were light yellow and moist. Additionally, the feces of controll group insects also increased in size as their body size grew. 

The summarized data presented in Table 1, corresponding to the observation and Figure 1, indicates that the average weight of controll group kept growing until the end, while the ones for treatment group began decreasing from the fifth day. Figure 1 shows that treatment groups grew faster in weight at the beginning, but the controll group started to grow faster at the fourth day and remained the fast speed of growth to the end of the study. Figure 2 indicates that the average weight growth over the experiment period of treatment group individuals was 0.086g, while the one for controll group is 3.928g.


Discussion:
 According to Figure 1 and Table 1 in the result section, it was shown that the mean of controll group averaged weight was bigger than that of the treatment group (X ̅_C&gt;X ̅_T). Also, since P Value of the one-tailed two-sample t_test is smaller than 0.05, the mean of averaged weight for controll group M. Sexta was significently greater than that of the treatment group. The results rejected the null hypothesis that the addition of 20E makes no difference to the insect growth. However, the alternative hypothesis of 20E inciting faster growth in the mass of Manduca Sexta was also rejected. Even though the P value was less than 0.05, the directionality of the difference was predicted incorrectly. In this case, a more likely to be supported alternative hypothesis would be that ecdysone inhibits the growth of Manduca Sexta and the masses of larvae treated with Azaguard as IGR grow slower than those are not treated. 
Referring to Figure 1 and 2, the average weight growth over the experiment period for treatment group and controll group M. Sexta showed remarkable difference. Compared to controll group insects, the growth for treatment group was discouraged by 20E from the fifth day, and their weight even decreased drastically after that. The reason for this might be that 20E was taken into the insect bodies when it was not needed. After the temporary rise near the end of 4th larval instar, the level of 20E was supposed to drop, so that they could get into the next instar [Johnson:2019]; however, for the treatment group insects, it is possible that their JH could not coordinate with an overwhelming amount of 20E, which eventually inhibited their growth. 
The possible error generated in this experiment was that we misunderstood the instruction of taking water and Azaguard as the independent variable by putting the same amount of each liquid into two different groups. Instead, we added 7 drops of water to both groups, and the treatment group insects were treated with 3 more drops of Azaguard. This mistake influenced the concentration of 20E and also negatively affected the controllled variables, which could result in the weight loss of treatment group insects. 
To further develop the experiment and test if extra amount of 20E really hinders the growth of Manduca Sexta, a new test could be designed, in which different amount of 20E added will be set as an independent variable and the speed of weight losing is the dependent variable.
