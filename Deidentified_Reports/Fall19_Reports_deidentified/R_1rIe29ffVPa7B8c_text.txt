Title: The Effect of the Amount of Light on Photosystem II in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
The light-dependent photosystem in photosynthesis is photosystem II. Electron transport in photosystem II in plants relies on photons of light exciting electrons to leave chlorophyll, which is reduced by water hydrolysis to produce gas and electrons. This experiment was done to examine the effects of the intensity of light on photosystem II in Spinacia oleracea. Chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea leaves were tested for their activity in 0 percent light, 50 percent light, and 100 percent light to determine the effects of this on photosystem II. The researchers found that the chloroplasts in 0 percent light had the smallest percent change, the chloroplasts in 100 percent light had the largest percent change, and the chloroplasts in 50 percent light had a percent change in between the two. Based on these results, it can be concluded that photosystem II was inhibited by the depletion of light to Spinacia oleracea leaves. The results supported the group’s hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Spinacia oleracea, more commonly known as spinach, is a photosynthetic plant that is common in the diet of humans and other herbivores and omnivores. Photosynthesis is the process in which autotrophs absorb photons of light from the sun and use the energy from them to produce glucose. One instance in nature where plants can be deprived of the ability to perform photosynthesis would be when they are in the shade. If a plant is in the shade, it is obviously receiving less light than if it were directly exposed to the sun, so its ability to perform photosynthesis would be lessened. Throughout photosynthesis, there are two primary photosystems that involve this process. This experiment deals with photosystem II, the light-dependent photosystem. In photosystem II, energy from photons of light causes electrons to leave chlorophyll, chlorophyll is then reduced by water hydrolysis producing oxygen gas and electrons. Protons are pumped across the thylakoid membrane along with cytochrome b6f complex. This photosystem is the light-dependent part of photosynthesis. One study that tested the effects of Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts in different styles of light was conducted by Beate Baréyeni and G.H. Krause. They tested Spinacia oleracea under red light versus normal light to test the flow of electrons. This group found that red light did, in fact, inhibit the ability for electrons to be transported throughout photosystem II [Barényi: 1985]. This study gave this team of researchers the idea to test the effects of the depletion of light, rather than a change of color in light, on photosystem II. This experiment is done in efforts to determine it the depletion of light to Spinacia oleracea will inhibit photosystem II, thereby having less energy flow through the plant and reducing its ability to perform photosynthesis. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment consisted of researchers testing chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea at 0 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent light. The chloroplasts were removed from the leaves of Spinacia oleracea with a grinding buffer and by centrifugation. The chloroplasts were combined with 130 mM DCIP and 100 mM pH 6.5 phosphate reaction buffer, and exposed to environments of 0 percent light, 50 percent light, and 100 percent. These groups tested against a controll group that consisted of no chloroplasts in order to have a standard for comparison for the treatment groups, 130 mM DCIP, the phosphate reaction buffer, and water. The statistical results of this experiment were tested with a paired t_test. 

Results:
The mean percent change in spectrophotometric absorbance for the group exposed to 0 percent light was 2.39 percent +/- 0.6. The mean percent change for the group in 50 percent light was 13.6 percent +/- 4.66. The mean percent change for the group in 100 percent light was 30.51 percent +/- 3.65. The percent change over the course of the experiment is depicted in a line graph (Figure 1). Throughout this graph the group with 100 percent light consistently has the highest percent change, followed by the group with 50 percent light, followed by the group with 0 percent light, followed by the controll group. The paired t-value for the tests was 11.475. The p_value for the tests was 0.0075. The results contained 3 degrees of freedom.

Discussion:
Based on the results of the experiment, the hypothesis that the depletion of light to Spinacia oleracea would inhibit its ability to perform photosynthesis was supported. The p_value suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected, but further tests must be done in order to completely prove or disprove this assertation. As the results suggest, the treatment group at 0 percent light had a lower percent change than the group exposed to 100 percent light, with the group at 50 percent light falling in between the two. This is evidence that photosystem II was inhibited by the depletion of light the Spinacia oleracea, thereby not allowing for photons from light to energize photosystem II as successfully as it would have when exposed to proper light. When the plants were given proper light, photosystem II allowed for the electrons to be energized and leave chlorophyll, allowing for the carrying out of this photosystem. However, it can be determined that the plants not exposed to proper light did not have as many photons of light striking its chloroplasts, therefore not allowing photons to excite the electrons in the chlorophyll, and not allowing this light-dependent chain of biochemical reactions to occur. In relation to Barényi and Krause’s study, this research group found similar results. Whereas Barényi and Krause saw an inhibition of electron transport due to a different color light [Barényi: 1985], this group saw an inhibition of electron transport due to the inhibition of light. One idea for future study would be to test how testing heat could affect photosystem II. A shaded plant would be exposed to heat to discover whether or not that would help allow the start of this light-dependent photosystem. This could be compared to a plant in light exposed to heat. This is relevant since during the summer months, plants are constantly exposed to heat during the day. This could allow farmers to more properly cultivate their Spinacia oleracea for commercial use.
