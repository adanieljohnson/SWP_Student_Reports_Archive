Title: The disruption of larval development induced by IGR in Manduca sexta caterpillars 

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
	Manduca sexta, otherwise known as the “tobacco hornworm” is a common garden pest that can be found throughout the United States, parts of Canada, Central America and the Caribbean [Cranshaw 2014]. From 1980 until present day, the hornworm became one of the most extensively investigated organisms in the field of endocrinology and has since helped us better understand the effects of hormones on the body [Bollenbacher: 1981]. Due to the fact that it is a pest, it’s important to gain an understanding of how to best controll the population of Manduca caterpillars. The tobacco hornworm undergoes five larval stages until it molts into an adult moth. There are two hormones that controll these stages. The first is the Juvenile Hormone that regulates larval development, but inhibits metamorphosis until the fifth instar larval stage when the commitment pulse is made. This commitment pulse is essentially a spike in Ecdysterone (20E), a hormone that regulates molting in the tobacco hornworm. For our experiment we are altering the timing of the distribution of 20E by adding an IGR to the experimental group’s food during early larval stages. IGR is an insect growth regulator (IGR), which, in general, exert their toxic effects by disrupting insect development [Horst: 1999]. We hypothesize that the IGR will artificially speed up the development of the tobacco hornworm causing it to molt quicker.


Materials and Method:
	To begin the experiment we used two 4-celled containers and lids for them as the homes for my experimental and controll groups. Then we distinguishing which container was for the controll or experimental group and indicated that on each container in sharpie by numerating each cell with numbers 1-4, for each container. Next, we used the “hole” tool to puncture two breathing holes in each cell of both containers for breathing holes for the caterpillar. After we finished setting up the caterpillars home, we obtained the eight caterpillars we would be using in the experiment, weighed each of them to acquire their initial weights for data purposes and placed them in their distinct cells. The last step was acquiring their food. For the four caterpillars in the controll group, we weighed 10 grams of the hornworm’s food, placed 8 drops of water in it using a transfer pipet and mixed the water into the food using a spoon in a square container. The same was done for the four caterpillars in the experimental group, but instead of using water, 1: 1250 IGR was used. To test the experiment, a two-tailed T-test was used to compare the outcomes of experimental group to those of the controll.


Results:
From Figure II, we can infer that the general trends of our data showed that the average weight of the controll group steadily trended upwards with exception of the time frame from the fifth day to the tenth day, where there was more of an increase in that intervallic time frame than any other day. Each caterpillar in the controll group tended to steadily deviate from the mean weight of all of the caterpillars showing that the caterpillars are growing steadily at their own their own rates. 
	In terms of the experimental group, these caterpillars started around the same mean weight of controll group, trended downwards slightly up until day five when their mean weight dramatically increased and surpassed the weights of the controll group. This resulted in them continually increasing in weight until the end of the experiment. In terms of the standard deviation, the error bars show that the experimental groups incrementally deviated from the mean weight more and more as the experiment went on as shown in Figure I. 
	Qualitatively, on the fifth day, we documented there was gray dead skin around one of the caterpillars in the experimental group. On the tenth and fifthteenth day, the caterpillars were turning a pale blue color in comparison to the normal, blue-green external hue of the controll group.
According to our two-tailed P value of .574461, the controll and experimental groups were not statistically different from one another. 


Discussion:
Our statistical results indicate that IGR did not have an effect on the weight and therefore the growth of the caterpillars, which did not support our hypothesis. Although, our qualitative results said the opposite. The gray dead skin around one of the caterpillars in the experimental group that we found on the fifth day may indicate disrupted cuticle formation. A study done on the blue crab indicated that when IGR was used, there was “profound ultrastructural changes in the cuticular epithelial cells of post-molt adult blue crabs studied in vitro” [Horst: 1999]. This supports our findings in that the caterpillars were in fact affected by IGR. Additionally, the caterpillars in the experimental group were turning a pale blue color in comparison to the normal, blue-green external hue of the controll group on the tenth and fifteen day, which indicates a deviation from normal development. Furthermore, the results of our experiments indicate that the caterpillars in the experimental group grew abnormally large from the fifth to the tenth day compared to the controll group. This ultimately accentuates the proposition that the experimental caterpillars were in fact affected by the insect growth regulator.
	An alternative explanation of why our statistical results differed from the results of our experiment, is that there may have been genetics involved in how the caterpillars’ bodies reacted to the IGR and therefore showed a statistical difference in weight. For future experiments, I recommend modifying the days in which the experimenter records the information from five day intervals to everyday to fully gain an understanding as to the effects the IGR has on the caterpillar. It is reasonable to assume that the volume of IGR given was not enough to produce statistical desired results. This may include giving the caterpillars a larger volume of IGR. The experimenter may also consider measuring length as an alternate way of validating the hypothesis and producing different statistical results.
	In conclusion, statistically the Manduca caterpillars were not affected by the incorporation of IGR into their diet, though our experimental results indicate the opposite, which leaves room for discussion as to how to enhance the procedure for future experiments
