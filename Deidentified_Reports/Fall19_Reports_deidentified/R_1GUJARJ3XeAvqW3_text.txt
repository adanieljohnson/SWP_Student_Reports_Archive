Title: The Effects of Inhibiting 20E Hormone in Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect commonly known as the tobacco hornworm.  They are prevalent in much of North America, and are known to infest gardens--eating tomatoes, tobacco, and other crops in their caterpillar/larval phases.  For this reason, the Manduca sexta has been deemed a pest in agricultural production, and a threat to the environment as a whole.  Many farmers have adopted the use of pesticides in an effort to protect their crops from the caterpillars.  Thus, it is worth investigating the effectiveness of different pesticides.  In this experiment, we will be treating the caterpillars with a pesticide that blocks/inhibits the hormone 20E.  Following the holometabolous life cycle, the Manduca sexta undergoes complete metamorphosis, and develops as such: from eggs, first through fifth instar larva, pupa, to finally an adult moth.  This process takes about 39 to 48 days.  In addition, Manduca sexta undergo 4 molts between the instar larval stages before pupating [Nijhout: 1975].  The Manduca sexta relies on the hormones 20E and juvenile hormone to properly develop from a larva, to a pupa, to an adult moth [Kingsolver: 2007].  In this experiment, the caterpillars will be treated with a pesticide that blocks or inhibits 20E called Azaguard.  Because we know that 20E plays a key role in proper development of Manduca sexta, we hypothesize that inhibiting 20E will delay their growth.


Materials and Method:
We began with 8 Manduca sexta in the early instar/larval phases.  We then split them into two groups of four, one group being the controll group, and the other would receive the 20E inhibitor.  For the experimental group, we dropped five drops of Azaguard into their food and mixed it thoroughly (using a dropper pipet and spoons).  For the controll group, we used drops of water instead.  Each caterpillar was given 10 grams of food, and we kept them in a controllled environment to minimize confounding variables.  This included plastic containers with holes for breathing, and storing them in an incubator with constant exposure to artificial light and a controllled temperature.  In order to track growth, we massed the caterpillars everyday for seven days and recorded it.  Waste product from the caterpillars was removed everyday to ensure a healthy environment.  Food was changed every 2-3 days to avoid it drying up and becoming inedible.  The caterpillars were handled using latex gloves for sanitation purposes.  It is also worth noting that we were able to do the entire experiment twice for a total of two trials, both lasting seven days.  Additionally, we used a two tailed t_test and observed the resulting one-tailed p_values to determine whether or not our data was statistically significent.  Furthermore, we found the standard deviations for each group of caterpillars to better understand the spread of our data.   


Results:
In both of our trials, our controll group’s growth followed a positive, linear trend, while growth for our experimental group appears to model a slope close to zero (Figures 2 and 4).  Although the experimental caterpillars’ masses initially increased a small amount, they ultimately decreased right before their deaths.  For instance, in Figure 1, the average mass initially increased from day 1 to day 2 by 0.07 grams.  Later on between days 5 and 6, however, the caterpillars experienced, on average, a decrease in mass of 0.048 grams.  They all died the following day.  This gave a net negative difference between their starting masses and their ending masses.  On the other hand, none of the controll groups’ caterpillars died throughout either of our trials.  Not only did we see a physical difference in the caterpillars’ body sizes, our data also indicates regular growth.  This can be seen by the total difference in mass (from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment) for trial two’s controll group.  The total difference is 7.61 grams, which means they gained 7.61 grams throughout our seven day experiment (Figure 3).  As for statistical testing, trial 1’s p_value is approximately 0.017, and for trial 2, the p_value is 0.011.  The standard deviation for trial 1’s controll group is 1.32 grams, and for the experimental group, it is 0.05 grams.  In trial 2, the standard deviation for the controll group is 2.97 grams, and for the experimental group, it is 0.27 grams.

Discussion:
Our p_values indicate that our data is statistically significent because they are both below 0.05. (Both 0.017 and 0.011&lt; 0.05.)  Our controll groups grew normally while growth was hindered in our experimental groups, which can be seen in Figures 2 and 4.  Therefore, we can conclude that inhibiting 20E hormone in Manduca sexta indeed delays growth.  In other words, our hypothesis is supported.  However, because we also observed that both experimental groups died within seven days of each trial, there is a larger investigation regarding the need for 20E for survival.  It is well known by the physiology community that Juvenile Hormone and 20E are essential for proper development in Manduca sexta.  They rely on 20E for orchestrating larval and metamorphic molting, while they rely on specific concentrations of Juvenile Hormone for determining whether the molt is larval or metamorphic [Ishimoto: 2010].  If the goal is to determine whether or not 20E inhibitors are effective in delaying the insect’s growth, it can be concluded that 20E inhibitor-based pesticides, like Azaguard, are indeed successful in doing so.  Therefore, it may be said that Azaguard can help to diminish the overall impact the Manduca sexta has on farmers’ crops and agricultural production as a whole.  It is also apparent in our experiment that 20E inhibitor killed our caterpillars within seven days.  However, it should be inquired if seven days is indeed the standard timeline for the pesticide to work.  Because 20E and Juvenile Hormone work together to ensure proper development, perhaps the same experiment should be performed with a pesticide that blocks Juvenile Hormone.  It is worth exploring which hormone inhibitor, 20E or Juvenile Hormone, is more effective as a pesticide so that the agricultural industry and environment can be protected from the crop-eating Manduca sexta.
