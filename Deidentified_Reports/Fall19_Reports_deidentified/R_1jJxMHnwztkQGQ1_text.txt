Title: Effects of Laundry Detergent on Photosynthetic Rates for Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Soap has an inherently basic pH level due to the components inside, and if those components were to leak into the soil or water that plants grow in, the plants themselves may be at risk. In this experiment, we tested how chloroplasts from the Spinacia oleracea, commonly known as spinach, would react when exposed to Charlie’s Soap which is a type of laundry detergent. We compared the rate of electron transfer in the Hill Reaction as a measurement of photosynthetic rate. The absorbance values of chloroplasts with and without soap were analyzed using DCIP in place of photosystem I, which is where the electrons would normally flow in the Hill Reaction. We concluded that the presence of soap decreased the absorbance values and therefore decreased the overall rate of photosynthesis in the spinach plants.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, some protists, and some prokaryotes capture and store energy from light. The rates at which photosynthesis occurs can be affected by outside factors such as amount of sunlight, water available, and the pH of the substrate in which the organism is growing. Certain aquatic primary producers are especially affected by pH levels. [Invers, Romero, Perez : 1997] Various aquatic plants and producers are affected by the pH of the water they grow in, but no reliable analogs for terrestrial producers have been documented thus far. It is not outside of the realm of possibility to think that varying pH levels in the soil can and will affect the rate of photosynthesis in land-based primary producers.The pH variation in the soil could be attributed to a variety of causes, one of which is runoff from household soaps and detergents which contain sodium carbonate. This compound causes pH to rise to above ten, thereby making the soil basic. The soap used in this experiment was Charlie’s Soap, a laundry detergent labelled to be safe for the environment. The plant used was Spinacia oleracea, commonly known as spinach. Spinach is readily available and commonly studied, both qualities lend spinach to be a good model species for study. The purpose of this experiment was to see if increased pH levels caused by soap runoff would affect the rate of photosynthesis in terrestrial autotrophs

Materials and Method:
Three large leaves of spinach were washed and had their large central veins removed. They were put into a cold mortar and pestle and mixed with 20 Ml of cold grinding buffer solution. The leaf-buffer solution was ground until it became a slurry, which was then strained through a cheesecloth into a 50 Ml tube. The tube was centrifuged at 200xG for 3 minutes. The supernatant from the first tube was then poured into a second tube which was centrifuged at 100xG for 10 minutes. The supernatant from this spin cycle was poured into a waste container so that only the pellet remained. 20 Ml of cold grinding buffer was added to the pellet, which was then shaken until the mixture was homogenous. Seven test tubes were arranged while the spectrophotometer warmed up and was set to 500nm. The first tube was the blank, which contained 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate at pH 6.5). Tubes 2-4 contained 200 microliters of chloroplast solution, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, 6 Ml of water, and 2 Ml of Charlie’s Soap. The final set of tubes, Tubes 5-7, contained 200 microliters of chloroplast solution, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 6 Ml of water. The tubes were inverted and shaken until the mixtures were homogenous. Once the mixtures were properly prepared, they were poured into cuvettes so their absorbances could be read using the spectrophotometer. The cuvettes were placed under a lamp for three ten minute increments, with their absorbances being measured at time 0, 10, 20, and 30. The results of this experiment were put into a Excel table and the percent change in absorption was calculated. A plot was made of the differences of absorption of electrons in the chloroplasts. A two-tailed T test was used to see if there was any statistical significance between the chloroplasts with no soap versus the chloroplasts with soap and their respective absorbance values.


Results:
The figure shows the Hill Reaction. Electrons from the chloroplast are absorbed by DCIP as time moves forward. When comparing the absorbances at the 30 minute mark versus the start time, there is the greatest difference between electron absorbances. The chloroplasts with Charlie’s Soap showed a lower overall absorbance of electrons than the chloroplasts that had Charlie’s Soap in their solution. The overall p_value of the completed reaction was 0.002696.


Discussion:
This experiment was conducted to measure how photosynthetic rates of the chloroplasts in Spinacia oleracea differed when exposed to Charlie’s Soap. This was accomplished by comparing electron transfer in the spinach leaves between photosystem II and DCIP. We measured this by taking the absorbance values of six separate tubes of chloroplasts every ten minutes for a total of thirty minutes for a total of four measurements (time 0, 10, 20 30). Three of these tubes had chloroplasts with soap and the other three had no soap in their tubes. During the Hill Reaction as it occurs naturally in plants, electrons are transferred between photosystem II to photosystem I, but in our experiment we manipulated the process to have the electrons move from PSII to DCIP. DCIP is naturally blue in color, and when it absorbs electrons, the color changes from blue to clear. Clear means that the DCIP is saturated with electrons and when the absorbance of the tubes was measured using a spectrophotometer, the tubes that contained DCIP more concentrated with electrons had lower absorbance values. We found there to be a statistically significent difference between the absorbance values of the chloroplasts with soap solution compared to the absorbance values of the chloroplasts without the soap solution. As mentioned above, the p_value from our two-tailed T test was 0.002696, much lower than the standard 0.05 required for statistical significance. The largest difference in absorbance values was found at the conclusion of the experiment (time 30). Chloroplasts exposed to the Charlie’s Soap solution had lower overall absorbance values than those not exposed, which led us to conclude that the soap solution interfered with and retarded the rate of photosynthetic activity in those respective chloroplasts. The soap slowed down the electron transfer and thus caused a decrease in absorption by DCIP. At time 20, there was a decrease in absorbance which can be attributed to DCIP’s inability to hold the transferred electrons for extended periods of time. These results support our hypothesis that soap, and its ability to increase the pH of the plants’ substrate, would interfere with and decrease the overall rate of photosynthesis in those plants. If, for example, plants lived near the waste systems of the soap factory or even near the runoff area surrounding a car wash, the plants would take in soap byproduct through their respective substrate. The increased pH levels from the soap in the substrate could then cause the rate of photosynthesis in those plants to decrease and they could and would eventually die. This effect could be magnified to larger scale if say, a shipload of Charlie’s Soap were spilled in South Florida. The soap would increase the pH of the soil/water and the plants, namely mangroves could absorb that and also perish leaving the coasts unprotected and everything that lives there would be at risk. This is an extreme example, but the science behind it and the point being made stills holds. Possible errors for this experiment include potential errors in reading the spectrophotometer or improper timing when it came to moving the chloroplasts out from under the light. If the experiment were to be run again, it would be necessary to ensure all machinery is functioning properly and that each lab member is operating efficiently and correctly.
