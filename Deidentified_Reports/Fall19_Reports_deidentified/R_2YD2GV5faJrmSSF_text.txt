Title: Effects of Water Color on Agonistic Behaviors in Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Male Betta splendins (Siamese fighting fish) display agnostic behaviors when in the presence of other members of their own species. These behaviors of interest because they give insight into the costs and benefits of submission, escalation, and other behaviors in terms of reproductive fitness. This lab will specifically be examining how intraspecific Betta fish aggression responds to changes in water color. It is hypothesized that a Betta fish will display more agnostic behaviors in water colors that contrast against their own color since it will be easier to identify the other fish, while they will be less aggressive in water colors that match their own color as it will better camouflage the other fish.  The time it took for a male Betta fish to notice another male Betta fish and then display gill cover erection was measured in clear, blue, and yellow waters.  The results were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test. The results between these groups were not statistically significent. It is possible that the results were insignificent due to stimulus habituation. In future studies, there should be a longer rest period between trials to avoid stimulus habituation. 

Introduction:
Ethology refers to the study of animal behavior. This is of importance because it helps to understand the physiological purposes for animal behavior and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. This lab will be studying Betta splendins (Betta fish) to quantify their intraspecific interactions. Betta fish are known as Siamese fighting fish. They are a species of interest to study because of their colorful displays in the presence of other members of their own species. They display aggressive behaviors in the form of broadside movements and facing movements. Betta fish respond to each others aggressive behaviors in one of four ways: ignore it, match it, flee, or behave in a way that signals submission. These behaviors of interest because they give insight into the costs and benefits of submission, escalation, and other behaviors in terms of reproductive fitness. This lab will specifically be examining how intraspecific Betta fish aggression responds to changes in water color. It is hypothesized that a Betta fish will display more agnostic behaviors in water colors that contrast against their own color since it will be easier to identify the other fish, while they will be less aggressive in water colors that match their own color as it will better camouflage the other fish.  A study looking at how Beta respond to colored visual reinforced supports this hypothesis as it found that they respond more when the reinforcers color is unlike their own and least when the coloration is like their own [Thompson: 1965].  

Materials and Method:
The materials needed for this lab are 2 male Betta fish with primarily blue coloration, two tanks with opaque dividers, a stopwatch, and blue and yellow food dye. Betta fish aggression was measured in three different environments: clear water, blue water, and yellow water.  The behavior measured was the amount of time it took between the Betta fish seeing each other to showing first signs of aggression (gill flaring). Before the experiment began, a pre-trial was conducted to determine which Betta fish was more aggressive, and then that became the fish of study. This was done by putting the two fish in the same tank but with an opaque divider between them. The divider was removed so nothing was separating the two fish. The fish that flared its gills first was the fish measured in the subsequent trials.  Next, a baseline for the Betta fish aggression was determined using clear water. The two fish were put in the same tank, but with an opaque divider between them. The divider was removed so nothing was separating the two fish.  A stopwatch was used to measure the amount of time it took from the fish seeing each other to first signs of aggression (flaring gills). After first signs of aggression the fish were separated, the divider was replaced, and the fish rested for 5 minutes. This procedure was repeated 3 more times for a total of 4 trials.  After all 4 trials were completed, 2 drops of blue food dye was added to each half of the tank and the fish were given 5 minutes to acclimate to their new environment. Then the same procedure was repeated. After all 4 trials in the blue water were completed, a new tank was filled with water and 4 drops of yellow food dye was added to the water. The fish were removed from the tank with the blue water, put into the tank with the yellow water, and then given 5 minutes to acclimate to their new environment. Then, the same procedure was repeated as done in the clear water for a total of 4 trials. The results were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test.

Results:
The first two trials in the yellow water were shorter than the last two trials (3 and 8 seconds vs 81 and 57 seconds). The fish that was the most aggressive was very teal in color with lots of bright blues and some greens. The passive fish was darker blue and had a lighter blue stripe down his side. For many of the trials it took the more aggressive fish several seconds to a minute to notice the other fish in the tank once the divider was removed. The p_value for the ANOVA test was 0.295. The trial in the blue water had the highest average time from noticing the other fish to displaying aggressive behaviors, the yellow trial had the second highest, and the shortest amount of time was exhibited in the clear water (Figure 1). 

Discussion:
This experiment does not support the hypothesis that a Betta fish will display more agnostic behaviors in water colors that contrast against while they will be less aggressive in water colors that match their own color. The p_value for the ANOVA test was 0.295 which is not less than the critical p_value of 0.05. Therefore, the differences between the experimental and controll groups are not significent. The Tukey-Kramer test further supports this by running statistical tests between individual groups. Nevertheless, there were not any significent differences between clear-blue, clear-yellow, or yellow-blue. The first two trials in the yellow appeared as though they were going to produce significent results as the times were less than all other groups prior. However, the last two trials for the yellow water experiment had very high times. Therefore, it is possible that these drastically varying times could be due to stimulus habituation between the fish. Prior experiments have examined the length of time it takes for the habituation of aggressive responses in Betta fish. One study found that after 115 minutes of stimulus exposure there was a significent decrease in the erection of gill covers [Peeke: 1970]. When the last two trials in the yellow water experiment was conducted, the fish had accumulated almost two hours (120 minutes) of exposure to each other. As such, it is possible that the results were insignificent due to stimulus habituation. In future studies, there should be a longer rest period between trials to avoid stimulus habituation. Applications of this lab could be useful for future Betta fish pet owners. If Betta fish are less aggressive in a certain environment, a pet owner may want to replicate that environment in their tank at home to create a more relaxed environment for their fish.
