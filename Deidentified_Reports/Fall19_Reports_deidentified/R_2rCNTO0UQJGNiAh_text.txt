Title: Effects of Azagaurd Insecticide on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
In this experiment the group tested the effects of Azaguard insecticide on the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The group accomplished this by monitoring a control and treatment group ever the course of ten days. The results showed that the presence of Azaguard prevented the caterpillars from pupating and causing some to die. This showed the effects that excess hormones or substances that mimic their effects can have on the insect. 

Introduction:
The hornworm caterpillar (Manduca sexta) goes through molting processes driven by hormonal changes in the caterpillar. In a normal life cycle hormones such as Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone rise and fall telling the organism when to begin molting into the next stage. The juvenile hormone is present in high concentrations in the youth of the caterpillar and inhibits the pupation process. Ecdysterone rises and falls in the life of the caterpillar rising as it goes through pupation. Ecdysterone essentially triggers the pupation and growth of the caterpillar. The purpose of this lab is to get a better understanding of hormones in animals. For this lab the group chose this organism to study since they have a relatively short maturation cycle and they can be reared in a lab. The lab chose to use the insecticide Azagaurd to compare how M. sexta normally mature and how this insecticide would affect them. 
H: The presence of Azaguard will prevent the caterpillars from pupating. 




Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we selected four caterpillars for the control and four caterpillars for the treatment group. We divided the caterpillars individually and gave each caterpillar roughly 10 grams of prepared food. The four control caterpillars had five drops of water mixed into the food while the treatment group had five drops of the Azaguard mixed in to the food. Over the course of ten days we observed the caterpillars, weighed them, cleaned their boxes, and replaced the food. The caterpillars were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. The independent variable of the experiment was the presence of Azaguard while the dependent variable was the growth and survival of the caterpillars. To analyze the results we used an independent samples t-test to show the difference in mass of both groups was not due to chance. 

Results:
 The group observed that the control group survived and grew rapidly. The initial treatment group died so the lab group started again with another set of caterpillars. Of the second set only one died but they rest did not grow substantially. As the graph below shows the control caterpillars grew at a much quicker rate than the treatment group. The average mass of the control caterpillars on day 10 was 10.5 grams while the average mass of the treatment caterpillars on day 10 was 2.0. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the mass of the caterpillars that were treated with Azaguard and caterpillars that were not treated with Azaguard. The p-value of 0.000308 suggest that the difference between the weights was significant and the hypothesis can be supported.  It was also observed on day 10 that two of the four control caterpillars were pupating. 



Discussion:
According to the data collected it can be determined that Azaguard does prevent caterpillars from pupating and the hypothesis can be supported. Azaguard mimics the effects of Juvenile Hormone preventing the caterpillar from molting into the next stage. Azaguard works as an insecticide by preventing the caterpillars from molting which is necessary to survive. It has been shown that the introduction of natural or synthesized Juvenile Hormone prevents M. sexta from pupating [Kiguchi : 1978]. If the study were to be repeated I would suggest comparing the effects of different insecticides on the caterpillars or possibly introducing the insecticide at different stages of life in the caterpillar. The results of this study show that excess Juvenile Hormone in M. sexta can cause death in these caterpillars. This shows how hormones play a role in the development of these organisms.
