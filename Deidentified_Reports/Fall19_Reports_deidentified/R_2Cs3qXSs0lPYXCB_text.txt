Title: Effect on leaf surface area in raphanus sativus plants when limited by saltwater

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of limitation of an essential resource on the phenotype of Raphanus sativus (radish) plants, based on previous studies into the effect of water limitation on leaf surface area in experimental populations. This procedure divided the samples into a control population watered with regular water and a sample population watered with only saltwater for a two-week duration to test the hypothesis that leaf surface area would be decreased by limiting the essential resource of water through saltwater treatment in the sample population. At the conclusion of the study, the average surface area of the leaves of each group was collected for analysis. The resulting data described the control group as having smaller average leaf surface area than the sample group, not supporting the original hypothesis. In addition, the statistical testing revealed that the data collected was insignificant with a p-value of 0.22 from the two-sample t-test conducted. 

Introduction:
When resources are limited, plants try to allocate their resources to focus on those weaker areas to make up for less availability (Johnson: 2019). That alteration in plant behavior is known as phenotypic plasticity. Limitation of essential resources, such as water, can prompt that change, resulting in different growth patterns of the plant. In this experiment, saltwater will be used to test the effect of water limitations on the phenotype of the Raphanus sativus (radish) plant. Salt would theoretically compose a portion of the set volume of water given to a plant, reducing the water volume the plant would normally receive, most likely having a negative impact on the growth of the plant. According to one study, leaf area was decreased in response to water and other essential nutrient limitations in an experimental population (Matesanz: 2018). Based on the data from that publication, leaf area will be the dependent variable tested in this experiment. If the Raphanus sativus sample organisms are watered with saltwater, they will exhibit smaller leaf surface areas than those watered with regular tap water. 

Materials and Methods:
Raphanus sativus seeds were planted in provided soil, separated into six different containers. Three containers were labeled as control and watered with regular water while three were labeled as sample and were watered with saltwater. The independent variable in this procedure was the type of water being used and the dependent variable measured was leaf surface area. All plants were watered each day for two weeks. The control population was watered with 150 mL of regular tap water and the sample organisms with 150 mL of 6 M NaCl salt solution. At the conclusion of two weeks, three representative leaves from each plant (control and sample) were selected and their surface area measured using a 0.5 cm2 grid template. The surface area of the control and sample populations were then compared statistically using a two-sample t-test. 

Results:
The average leaf surface area of the control population watered with regular water was smaller than the average leaf surface area of the sample population watered with saltwater. The error bars, representing one standard deviation of the control and sample populations, respectively, are represented on the graph and overlap with each other, exhibiting the similar nature of the results between the two experimental groups. In addition, the p-value of the two-sample t-test was 0.22, signaling insignificant results. 

Discussion:
Overall, this experimental data did not support the original hypothesis. The average leaf surface area of the control population, watered with regular water, was nearly 1 cm2 less than that of the sample population, watered with saltwater, which is opposite of the original hypothesis that predicted that the sample population would exhibit smaller leaf surface areas than the control population. In addition, none of the data collected through this experiment could draw any definitive conclusions due to the statistical insignificance of the values. The p-value of 0.22 from the two-sample t-test between the leaf surface areas of the control and sample populations proved any difference between the data of the two groups insignificant. The phenotypic variation predicted through the article on the decreased leaf surface area after water and other essential nutrient limitations in experimental plant populations (Matesanz: 2018) did not occur despite the resource allocation imposed on the subjects. Possibly, the 6 M NaCl solution did not provide enough of a limitation on the Raphanus sativus plants to force them to participate in resource allocation. In addition, some other uncontrolled variable could have been at play considering the conditions in which the plants were housed included other experimental groups using different chemicals and conditions and contamination easily could have occurred from watering vessels, etc. Another possible contributor to the invalid results could have been the condition of the third plant in the control population. By the end of the two weeks, the leaves were yellowing indicating the plant likely dying. This easily could have skewed the results and might have been caused, again, by contamination or the fact that the particular plant received significantly more sunlight each day due to its placement in the greenhouse. Possible future study could involve changing the salt concentration to impose a greater limitation, possibly producing more significant results.
