Title: Impact of IGR Juvenile Hormone on Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca Sexta)

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
This experiment is working with the Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca Sexta). The Tobacco Hornworm is considered a garden pest because they consume large amounts of leaves of solanaceous plants. This causes many problems including defoliation. A more significent issue presented by this species is the economic impact. The Tobacco Hornworm consumes large amounts of tomato, tobacco, potato crops, and eggplant. (Byron and Kaufman: 2017). The life cycle of the Manduca Sexta is roughly 19-23 days. It includes five instar larva stages and a pupa stage before reaching full development as an adult moth (Johnson: 2016). The insect receives neural and hormonal signals throughout development that tell the body how to respond. A large amount of insect development, molting, formation of pupa, and emergence of adults is controllled by three hormones; PTTH, ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH) (Johnson: 2016). During the final larval instar, the presence of juvenile hormone prevents the secretion of PTTH (Nihjout: 1974). PTTH is a second order hormone that stimulates the secretion of ecdysone, triggering metamorphosis. Studies have shown that a decrease in JH levels is required for this spike in PTTH to occur. This experiment focused on the impact increased levels of juvenile hormone, IGR, have on the development of the worms. Under normal conditions, JH levels stay fairly high up until the fourth larval instar. Near the end of the fourth larval instar, the JH levels start to drop slightly. The purpose of this experiment is to determine what impact increased levels of IGR have on the growth and development of the worms. It was hypothesized that the growth and development throughout the larval stages will not be impacted by the injection of IGR. However, when the worms reach their final (fifth) instar, the IGR injected group will molt into an unnatural sixth instar larval stage and eventually die due to the hormonal imbalance in their bodies. The controll (untreated) group will undergo natural metamorphosis and reach the adult moth stage. The independent variable in this experiment is the presence of IGR hormone in the caterpillars food. The dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillars.


Materials and Method:
Eight Tobacco Hornworms were provided and separated into two groups of four. They were stored in a temperature regulated environment at a constant temperature of 26.5 degrees celsius. Every day for two weeks, each worm was fed 10 grams of food. The food from the previous day was discarded before providing the fresh food each day. The food given to the first four worms was injected with 9 drops of IGR hormone. The food given to the second four worms is injected with 9 drops of water. The weight of each caterpillar was measured and recorded daily. 


Results:
Throughout this experiment, no clear trend was observed regarding the size of the caterpillars in relation to the treatment of IGR hormone. This observation is made clear through the two-tailed P-value of 0.57483. The data collected each day showed no evidence that the IGR treated worms were growing at an accelerated rate. According to Figure 1, there is a slight acceleration in the growth of the IGR treated caterpillars around day 8. Towards the end of the experiment, several caterpillars in the controll and treated groups slightly decreased in weight. This trend can be seen in Figure 1 on day 13. On day 6, a slight color variance was observed between the controll and hormone treated groups. The IGR treated caterpillars were notably lighter in color when compared with the untreated caterpillars. This trend persisted throughout the end of the experiment. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment align with the proposed hypothesis. It was hypothesized that the presence of IGR would have no significent impact on the growth of the caterpillars. It was also hypothesized that the caterpillars treated with IGR hormone would not pupate and develop into an adult moth. This aspect of the hypothesis remains undetermined because the caterpillars were not allowed to undergo their entire lifecycle. While fluctuations in the caterpillars weight occurred from day to day, a consistent trend was not able to be observed. The apparent trend that is visible in Figure 1 is most likely a consequence of one abnormally small caterpillar in the controll group. This worm was almost 7 grams lighter than all of the other caterpillars, therefore, should be considered an outlier. Other than this worm, there was almost no difference in weight between the controll and IGR treated groups. Aside from the slight color variance observed in the IGR treated group, there was no difference between the two experimental groups. The lack of impact of juvenile hormone is probably due to the fact that JH is already present in the Tobacco Hornworm throughout its larval stages (Nijhout and Williams: 1975). These conclusions prove that injecting IGR into a tobacco hornworm’s diet is not an effective method for pest controll.
