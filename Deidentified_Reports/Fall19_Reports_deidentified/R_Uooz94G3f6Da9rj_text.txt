Title: Additional Juvenile Hormone Added to the Diet of Manduca sexta Larva has no Significant Effect on their Average Weight 

Abstract:
No abstract

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that is similar to butterflies, moths and slippers. The tobacco hornworm goes through a well documented life cycle that can take anywhere from around 39 to 48 days to complete which consists of the following stages: 1st through 5th instar larva, which each take around 3-4 days to complete, followed by a pupa stage which is then followed by the adult larva stage [Kingsolver:2007]. Their life cycle, like all organisms, is highly controllled by hormones that affect specific cells at specific times to orchestrate the development of the organism. Specifically for M. Sexta worms, they are highly regulated by two main hormones and the interactions between them. These two are Juvenile Hormone (JH), which regulates the type of molt the larva goes through as well as multiple adult functions but is mostly associated with keeping the insect in the juvenile stage. The second is Ecdysterone (20E) which regulates the timing of the molt as well as additional adult functions but is also very associated with development in the adult stage. At first when the insect is still a juvenile, it has high JH levels and low 20E levels, this will change over time as JH decreases and 20E increases which signals the timing of molt and the development of the organism to becoming an adult. For this experiment, we attempted to add additional JH to the diet of the M. sexta larva and observe the changes it may have on their development. With additional JH added to the diet of the larva, we hypothesize that it will take more time for them to reach the Pupa stage of their life cycle thus slowing their development which could in turn be measured in a slower growth rate.  


Materials and Method:
We first obtained 8 total M. sexta larva and split them up into two containers, each with four pockets with each pocket containing one larva. The two containers were labeled as “Treatment” and “Control” and each pocket was assigned a number from 1 to 4. Then, each pocket was given 10g of balled larvae food, for the controlls, they were just kept wet and for the treatment larvae, 10 drops of JH hormone Precor was added to their food. The food was replaced however often was necessary once it was depleted by the larva and the same treatment was done with the drops. Afterwards, each day the masses of all 8 caterpillars was measured and recorded and after 15 days, the average mass of each group was taken for each day. These data were then put into a 2-sample t_test for statistical significance and the resulting average masses were graphed. 


Results:
We discovered that there was no significent difference in the masses of those with extra JH added to their diet. (t-value = 0.329, d.f. = 28, P-value = 0.372).


Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis that adding JH to the diet of M. sexta larva would cause them to take longer to reach the Pupa stage, which we measured by taking their masses over the two week trial period. This contradicts other studies done on the subject which found that injecting the larva with JH hormone should have caused a difference in size between the two treatment groups even though their growth rates may not have been altered [Hatem:2015]. This study concluded that the growth rates of the two groups were similar but the peak size of the treatment group should have been much higher which we did not find in our trials. A possible explanation for the difference in the findings could be that out treatment was simply not enough JH for there to be a significent impact on the larva. We simply added 10 drops to their food without any knowledge of the concentration of the formula or how much JH a larva has in them or uses in their life cycle, so it’s entirely possible that the amount of JH we added was simply not enough to cause any significent effect as other studies have found. Additionally we only kept data over a 15 day period, and that is roughly how long the caterpillars stay juvenile for, so if we had kept data over a longer period of time, we may have noticed more of a difference. This is supported by the data in the graph, as the time goes on, the test caterpillars start to have an average that is notably higher than the controlls so it is plausible that if the test had continued, we may have eventually noticed a significent result.
