Title: Spatial territory and the occurrence of agonistic behaviors in Betta splendens

Abstract:
For this experiment, we studied animal behavior by testing the number of aggressive behaviors shown in male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) when territory is at stake. Animal behavior is the field that focuses on placing a physiological background on social interactions between organisms. Behavior can be influenced when a resource is at risk, like territory and reproduction. We hypothesized that there will be more aggressive behaviors at smaller territory sizes, since the resource would be at risk for either fish. We used 4 male betta fish in total, and 3 different tank sizes. We recorded observations and the number of aggressive behaviors shown for 5 trials for each tank size of one fish, Blueface Baby. A new opponent was given for each tank size. We used ANOVA for statistical testing. Our results showed that our p-value was .14, meaning not of significance. We had to reject our alternate hypothesis and accept the null. Trends demonstrated that there were various behavior occurrences within the groups. Discrepancies occurred in the data due to the change of fish and lack of rest time between trials. Future studies could use larger tank sizes that reflected bettas’ territory sizes in the wild.

Introduction:
Betta Splendens, or male Siamese fighting fish, are a small freshwater fish that are naturally found throughout parts of Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. The study of their interactions with each other, animal behavior, is used to determine the physiological evidence of why they demonstrate specific behaviors. Agonistic, or aggressive, behaviors can occur between bettas when there is a resource at stake. These resources can be food, territory, or a mate. Aggressive behaviors can be broadside, which include tail flashing or pelvic flickering. Facing movements have the most aggression, with the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane from underneath the operculum, giving a “red mane” effect. When it comes to nest-building, male bettas would build in isolated areas and become fixated on the nest with the presence of another male. The agonistic behaviors that occurred depended on the distance between the nest and the other opponent [Bronstein: 1981]. Protecting their young is important to male bettas, since having successful offspring is the highest reward to fitness. To determine the amount of distance that affects the occurrence of aggressive behaviors in male betta fish we manipulated spatial territory. Territory is a resource that betta fish need to compete for, provoking aggressive behaviors to establish dominance. With less space, we hypothesize that there will be a higher amount of agonistic behaviors displayed, since there is an immediacy between the male bettas to claim resources. With more space, there should be less aggression, and territory boundaries could be established.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, we used 4 different male bettas in total. We recorded observations for 1 male, named Blueface Baby, throughout each tank size. 3 different fish were used for each tank size. We had 3 tank sizes in total: small, medium, and large. Five trials were done for each tank size. We gave the fish 1-minute intervals, with 1 minute of rest times in between for the small and medium tanks. However, due to fish stress, we increased the rest time to 5 minutes in between intervals for the large tank. We counted the number of agonistic behaviors during each trial by tallying them. For statistical testing, we did not differentiate between broadside or facing movements. However, we did record observations during each trial for specific behaviors. Our independent variable for each trial was the tank size, and the dependent variable was the number of agonistic behaviors shown. For statistical testing, ANOVA was used, with the alpha being 0.05 or less for statistical significance. We chose ANOVA because tanks sizes are qualified as categorical data.

Results:
The results of our ANOVA testing showed that our p-value was 0.14, meaning that our p-value does not have significance.  Observations for each tank size varied. Initial observations before trials began showed that the fish did not demonstrate any aggressive behaviors. When faced with another male in the small tank, agonistic behaviors occurred in every trial. For the medium tank, since the opponent fish was changed, the highest number of agonistic behaviors occurred in the first trial. However, in the following trials, there was a sharp decrease in the amount of aggression displayed, as the fish would back away from behaviors presented by the opponent. After these encounters in the medium tank, Blueface Baby became pale in the head and body, with the caudal fin drooping. We then increased the rest time to 5 minutes in between trails. However, when approached by his opponent, he would swim away and avoid conflict. In the large tank, all trials had less than 5 behaviors displayed.

In Figure 1 the graph is representing the average number of agonistic behaviors displayed during trials. Averages were as follows: Small – 3.5+/-0.71, Medium – 6.5+/-6.36, Large – 1+/-1.41. The high average and standard deviation for the medium tank could be identified by an outlier, 11 behaviors in trial 1, skewing the data. The standard deviation for the large tank could be ignore below 0, since a negative number of behaviors cannot be displayed.

Discussion:
Since our p-value was not significant, we reject our alternate hypothesis, that the number of aggressive behaviors displayed depends on tank size and accept the null. Many discrepancies occurred that could have skewed the data, producing a result that was not significant. There was a change in opponent fish for each tank change, possibly causing Blueface Baby to demonstrate different behaviors in response to that fish. Since we were studying territory size, it may have been possible that all of our tanks were not big enough for the fish to determine territory boundaries initially. Blueface Baby may have also been succumbing to submission more quickly in the later trials, because not enough time was given for rest in between the behaviors. As seen in the observations, the paleness indicated that our fish was becoming stressed, which could influence the number of aggressive behaviors displayed. Animal behavior is used to determine the physiological background of interactions between organisms. For male bettas, interactions with other male bettas can determine who has a higher fitness. Fitness can be influenced from successfully gathering resources or by reproduction. Male bettas have shown trends to build nests vertically, in areas that are found in crevices or corners. When their nests are threatened by a male challenger, the male reproducer of the nest becomes fixated on it, suggesting territorial defense [Bronstein: 1980]. Agonistic behaviors can be shown when protecting resources that contribute to fitness, like eggs and territory. For future studies, biologists could expand tank sizes to replicate a spatial landscape that’s similar to the wild in order to receive a better understanding of a bettas territory size. Understanding bettas’ behavior in territory could provide implications on how small freshwater fish engage in animal behaviors when protecting their resources.
