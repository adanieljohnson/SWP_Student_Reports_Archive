Title: Betta Put Money on the Male: Decoy Habituation on Aggression Response Time in Betta Splendins

Abstract:
All life uses behavior as a way to interact with the world around them. One of these types of behaviors is intraspecific which is the behavior with other members of the same species. In this experiment we were testing the time to aggressive response in Betta splendins after habituation with different decoys. We hypothesized that the fish habituated with a decoy would have a shorter time between showing aggression. The t_test for the comparison of red decoy vs controll got us a p value of 0.089629 (DF=8, T=1.471911). The t_test for the comparison of red decoy vs controll got us a p value of 0.215631 (DF=8, T=0.828775). Our hypothesis was not supported by t_tests that we ran however the trend graphs showed somewhat of the trend we were looking for. This is important because not all pet stores treat the fish well enough so if there was a way to prevent habituation before they made it to the store they may be able to live better lives.

Introduction:
Behavior is one of the key aspects of all of life that makes sure we carry out relations with our environment and other beings. When we talk more specifically with the latter of interacting with other beings, there are two main types of behaviors that we can talk about, Intraspecific and interspecific behaviors. Interspecific behaviors are behaviors which the organisms can use to interact with those of a different species than itself. Intraspecific behaviors are behaviors that organism use to interact with different members of the same species, much like what we studied in the experiment. The Betta Fish, Betta splendins, is a fighting fish from around the Mekong basin near Thailand. These fish, much like their names suggests, have very aggressive intraspecific behaviors that culminate in the physical biting and mauling of one another. These behaviors are only present in the males as they aim to defend their females and nest from other males [Bronstein: 1981]. These behaviors which the fishes show include two different categories. The Broadside movements are the movements that the fish exhibits when it has its side facing the other fish. This includes motions such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail lashing. The other category of behaviors are the facing behaviors which take place when the fish is directly facing the other fish. This includes such behaviors as erecting the pectoral fins, spreading the gill covers, and red mane which is the spreading of the branchiostegal membranes underneath the opercula [Thompson: 1965]. We wanted to test whether habituating the fish with a decoy would alter the time that it took to react to a male when next shown one. We hypothesized that after the introduction of a decoy the time to aggression would decrease when put in the presence of another male. We thought that this would be true as when you would put the fish in the presence of a decoy to try to habituate it, the fish would start to get aggressive in relation to the decoy. Then when the fish is exposed to the real fish it would carry over the heightened sense of aggression towards that fish and it would lower the time that it takes to display the aggressive behaviors toward the other live fish.

Materials and Method:
Materials including the separated tank, two fish, and two decoys were collected. Our independent variable was the type of habituation that the fish received, whether that was red decoy, blue decoy or no decoy. The dependent variable was the time that it took for the fish to demonstrate aggressive behaviors. Two male betta fish were chosen at random and put in two parts of a visually and physically separated fish tank. We then choose one of the two fish to do the habituation to and one to be the fish that was reacted to. The fish that was habituated was first given 5 minutes to rest and then the visual barrier between him and the other fish was removed in order to establish visual contact. The time was calculated from the time the barrier was removed until we started to see the aggressive behaviors towards the other fish. Once we saw this behavior, the tanks were once again visually separated, the results were tabulated, and the fish were given three minutes rest. This period of rest and experimentation was duplicated four more times for a total of five trials. Once the trials were completed the fish were given a full ten minutes rest. The whole process of 5 trials was then repeated with the two different decoys. The only difference between these was during the three-minute rest period, the different decoys were presented during this period in an effort to habituate the fish. We ran two different one tailed t_tests comparing the two decoys to the controll group to get our statistics. We also used two trend bar graphs to show the time to reaction.

Results:
When looking at the red decoy trend in comparison to the controll we can see that the first time was almost 1/3 of the original time it took for the fish to react to the other male under controll circumstances. We can also see that not only did it start at a lower time to reaction, but it also went lower than that of the controll graph (Figure 1). Much like the graph with the red decoy vs the controll, we saw similar trends with the blue decoy vs the controll. The value started much lower than the controll but didn’t get as low as the controll ever did (Figure 2). The t_test for the comparison of red decoy vs controll got us a p value of 0.089629 (DF=8, T=1.471911). The t_test for the comparison of red decoy vs controll got us a p value of 0.215631 (DF=8, T=0.828775).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported in either the red decoy or the blue decoy as they both has p values that were higher than the alpha level of 0.05. Although there wasn’t statistical evidence for our hypothesis that the time to aggression would decrease after being habituated with a decoy, we still feel confident that there is some truth behind what we thought. When we look at the trend bar graphs that we created with our data, we can clearly see that the time did in fact go down after being habituated with a decoy between interactions with the other fish. One of the reasons that we feel we didn’t get great p values was we did have a very small sample size which can lead to some unreliable statistics. We do feel confident with this experiment as there are many different stimuli within habituation that can alter the response of the fish to get the desired response [Dzieweczynski:2010]. The fish can be habituated to change the response that they get from other betta fish, much like how when the wild fish became tamed and they decreased the negative response to the more tame fish that we have today [Peeke: 1970]. We can also test how adding motion to the decoy could affect the habituation of the fish that we were testing. Betta fish are common pets that are sold at pet stores and often very little car is taken into them until they are in someone’s home. If there truly is a relationship between habituation and their aggressiveness, there could be steps taken to better treat these fish.
