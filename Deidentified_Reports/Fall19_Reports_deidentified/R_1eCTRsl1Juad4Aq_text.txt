Title: Betta splendens infraspecific agnostic behavior in various water colors 

Abstract:
Animal behavior observations can give scientists a lot of insight on what behaviors are evolutionarily beneficial to a species. Male Betta splendens have been previously shown to display intraspecific aggressive behaviors that are easily identifiable. To further study the evolutionary advantage of these agnostic behaviors, the effect of water color on the amount of time it took a male Betta splendens to display a characteristic aggressive behavior was studied. In order to test the effect of camouflaging water and accentuating water colors on Betta splendens aggressive behavior, the fish were allowed to interact in clear water, blue water, and yellow water. The amount of time for the dominant Betta to display an aggressive behavior was recorded; however, the times did not significantly statistically differ between conditions. These findings further the understanding of what behaviors are under the pressure of natural selection provide evidence for possible evolutionary benefits of specific animal behaviors. 

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior is an important aspect to the study of evolution. Not only do ethologist observe animal behavior, but through their observations of individual interactions they can determine what aspects of animal behavior have been selected for to increase the animal’s evolutionary fitness. Behaviors that increase the animal’s chance of survival or increase their chances at having healthy offspring are likely to be selected for across generations which in turn causes the behavior to become prominent across an entire species. This knowledge is extremely beneficial and contributes to the greater understanding of universal and predictable animal interactions, whether they are between members of the same species (intraspecific) or between members of two different species (interspecific). 
	Many animals have observable and predictable interactions such as Betta splendens. Previous studies have showed that male Bettas have qualitative and quantitative behavior displays when they come into contact with another male of the same species [Meliska: 1980]. These consistent behaviors, along with their accessibility, make Betta splendens a model organism for study of intraspecific aggressive behaviors. While there is significant research on the aggressive displays of male Bettas in the presence of other male Bettas, there is minimal evidence about an altered environment’s effect on the behavior of Betta splendens. 
To identify important environmental factors that could affect intraspecific Betta behavior, we observed varying water color’s effect on the amount of time it took for the first act of aggressive behavior to be displayed between two male Betta splendens. It was predicted if the two males were allowed to interact in a water color similar to their body color, the time it took for an act of aggressive behavior to be displayed would increase because the two fish would be camouflaged by the water and their visual cues would be concealed. Contrarily, it was predicted if the male Bettas were placed in water that contrasted their body colors, the time it took for an act of aggressive behavior to be displayed would decrease because visual cues between the two fish would be accentuated. If the Betta delayed the display of aggressive behavior, this was correlated to decreased overall aggressive behavior; however, if the Betta decreased the time to display aggression this was correlated to increased overall aggressive behavior. 


Materials and Methods:
Two blue male Betta splendens were placed in separate sections of a tank with opaque dividers and allowed to assimilate for five minutes. In every trial the temperature of the water, the location of the tank, and the same fish were used to control for possible confounding variables. For the control trials, no dye was added to the water and the separation was removed. The time was measured from when the Bettas first saw each other to the time when the first display of moderate aggression, or gill spreading from the dominant fish, was observed. The fish were then separated and allowed to rest for an additional five minutes and the same trial was repeated three more times with five minutes of separated rest in between each trial. For the experimental trials, four drops of food dye were added to the tank to alter the watercolor, two drops per section containing the fish, and it was allowed to diffuse for five minutes. The separations between the fish were then removed and the time between first sighting and first sign of moderate aggression was again documented. This procedure was conducted for four trials in blue dyed water and for four trials of yellow dyed water, each time allowing the fish to rest, separated, for five minutes in between. The mean and standard deviation of the time duration of fish sighting to display of moderate aggression was calculated for each trial. An ANOVA was then performed to determine if there was statistical significance of altered watercolor since three levels of categorical data were compared to numerical data. An additional Tukey- Kramer post-hoc test was done to compare significance between each individual category. 

Results:
Figure 1 shows increased amount of time until aggression was displayed by the dominant male Betta fish from the clear water condition in both the blue water condition and in the yellow water condition, with the blue water condition with the longest duration of time. An ANOVA, however, found watercolor did not have a significant effect on the amount of time it took from when the Betta fish saw each other until the dominant Betta displayed moderately aggressive behavior (p = 0.295). Additional Tukey-Kramer post hoc testing also showed no significant differences between any of the three conditions (Clear-Blue, Clear-Yellow, or Blue-Yellow). 

Discussion:
Since our results were not statistically significant our hypothesis was rejected, and there was no evidence provided that water color had any effect on the time taken for Betta splendens to show aggressive behavior in one another’s presence. This may be a result of many different contributing factors including the nature of natural selection and the role played by habituation.
	For natural selection to act upon a particular animal behavior, the behavior must show an evolutionary advantage [Dimijian: 2012]. Selection pressures may not have been imposed on the altered water color aspect of aggression. If the wild habitat of Betta splendens was a relatively stable water color then there would have been no evolutionary advantage of adapting aggression based on water color and therefore natural selection would not have altered the Betta splendens behavioral phenotype.   
	Habituation, or an organism’s decreased response to a repeated stimulus, may have also contributed to the aggressive displays of the Betta. Previous studies have found that Betta experience habituation to stimuli of their own mirror image or to another physically separated male [Meliska: 1980].  The same two fish were repeatedly exposed to one another in the exact same manner, and the submissive Betta repeatedly swam away from the dominant Betta in every trial which reinforced a nonthreatening response. In the later trials the time increased before the dominant Betta displayed aggression which could possibly be a result of habituation. 
	The relationship between color and aggression could be further studied in the form of Betta splendens body color. This aspect may have had a larger presence in evolutionary history and therefore could be more subject to natural selection. It is important to continue the study of animal behavior to further our understanding on the wide array of species phenotypes that have specific evolutionary benefits including animal interactions with each other and their environment.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1- The duration of time between sighting of each other to moderate display of aggression between two blue male Betta splendens. Each condition had a sample size of N = 4 trials. Each condition represents the mean amount of time it took for the dominant Betta to display aggression with error bars representing the standard deviation. The black bar represents the duration until aggression was displayed by the dominant male Betta in clear water with a mean of 13.50 seconds  2.38 seconds. The blue bar represents the duration until aggression was displayed by the dominant male Betta in blue water with a mean of 44.25 seconds  27.77 seconds. The yellow bar represents the duration until aggression was displayed by the dominant male Betta in blue water with a mean of 37.25 seconds  38.00 seconds. Any time difference observed between watercolor conditions was not significant (p = 0.295). *************************************************************************
