Title: Influence of IGR on Insect Growth

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Within laboratory settings, insects are an ideal model for the analysis and review of the “behavioral and physiological processes in adult insects by both the endocrine and circadian systems” [Petryk: 2003]. Within these insects, there are a wide variety of hormones that influence their growth and development. One of these hormones is 20-hydroxyecdysone, and it is the “initiator hormone of the molting process” which is regulated by the Prothoracicotropic hormone, PTTH [Petryk: 2003]. PTTH, on the other hand, “play an essential role in regulating the production and/or release of ecdysone, a steroid hormone that stimulates molting and metamorphosis” [Yamanaka: 2016]. Another hormone which has a significant influence on these insects is the juvenile hormone, vJH, which “regulates development and reproductive maturation in insects”, and as a result, it influences the type of molting the insect undergoes during its critical life periods [Noriega: 2014]. A specific insect which is influenced by all of these hormones is the Manduca Sexta, which is also known as the tobacco hornworm, an insect in the family Solanaceae that is known for “causing significant defoliation of economically important crops” [Gillet-Kaufman: 2019]. The Manduca Sexta has five larval stages within which both 20E and JH occur resulting in the Manduca Sexta’s growth, molting, and metamorphosis throughout [Gillet-Kaufman: 2019]. With regards to the hormones present in the Manduca Sexta, the JH presence is strong in the first four stages along with the other hormones, but it reduces in the fifth and final larval stage in order for the pupal commitment [Noriega 2014]. My colleagues and I wanted to see the influence of 1:1250 IGR, “an insect growth regulator (IGR) with activity against a variety of insect species” on the weights of these Manduca Sextas during their growth stages [Hallesy: 1972]. In this experiment, the hypothesis states that if the Manduca Sexta caterpillars are treated with the 1:1250 IGR, then their growth, measured in mass, will be less than the growth of caterpillars that aren’t treated with the 1:1250 IGR. 


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, our independent variables are the amount of food given to the Manduca Sextas (ten grams per caterpillar), the time allocated to the experiment (two weeks), and the amount of 1:1250 IGR used. The dependent variables are the growth and development of the caterpillars, which were measured in grams. The control variables included the caterpillars’ environments and the type of food distributed to them. For the testing of the hypothesis, two groups of Manduca Sextas were used. Each group had four caterpillars which were in similar environments that consisted of plastic containers with air and food holes. The group that was used for our control group acted as a control by having no addition of the 1:1250 IGR added to their food. The other group had eight drops of 1:1250 IGR, added to their food every time it needs to be replenished. Over the span of two weeks, the caterpillars were monitored and were weighed in grams with the use of a scale in order to measure their growth. To analyze this data, we used a 1-tailed t-test. The p-value of 0.05 was used to determine the significance of our results.


Results:

    In regards to the growth and looks of the Manduca Sextas, both the control group and experimental group looked the same for the most part with little difference in color and size. Figure 1 shows the masses and standard deviations of the experimental and control groups as recorded intermittently over the span of 15 days. The average mass of the control group at the experiment’s conclusion was 11.3 grams while the experimental group’s average mass was 12.4 grams. From the one-tailed t-test, the p-value was 0.35. Figure 2 depicts the weight over time based off averages.


Discussion:
Based off the results of our t-test, we reject the alternative hypothesis that the weight will increase at a slower rate with an increased amount of IGR. In addition, the results support that we are unable to reject the null hypothesis, which stated that the caterpillar weight would stay the same as the weight of the control. With a growth regulator like IGR, these results are surprising. However, we can build upon this research by extending the experiment’s duration of time as well as using more 1:1250 IGR to determine significance.
