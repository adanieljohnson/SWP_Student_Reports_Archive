Title: Temperature's Effect on the Growth of Vigna radiata

Abstract:
The temperature of an ecosystem has the ability to effect water supply and the overall growth of the plants. It has been seen that temperatures that are considered to be extreme, or fall below or above specific levels at critical times during development can significently impact productivity [Hartfield: 2015]. Plants have to adapt so that they can access water, a limited resource.   The group of mung bean plants, the organism being tested, that are in high temperature environment are more likely to have longer roots than those in normal conditions because higher temperatures can cause drier soil with less water. The root: shoot ratios were calculated for both the length and weight to determine the adaption of the plants. The averages and standard deviations were also found for this data.  A two- sample one tail test was used to test the significent of this data. The p_value for the weight t_test was 0.264 and the p_value for the length was 0.204. The hypothesis, the group of mung bean plants that are in high temperature environment are more likely to have linger roots than those in normal conditions because higher temperatures can cause drier soil with less water, was not supported.  The hypothesis was not supported due to the conditions of the environment. 

Introduction:
In an ecological community the resident organism must interact and adapt to each other.  Biotic and abiotic factors effect this adaptation but their adaptation is different than animals because they are rooted.  They have to evolve to extract resources in all conditions.  Plants have to adapt so that they can access sunlight, nitrogen, or water which are all limited resources.   One type of adaptation are trade-offs—expending more energy and mass to grow a particular structure, and reduce resources spent elsewhere.  Another form of adaptation is resource allocation, a pattern in which a species distributes and uses its natural resources.
The leaves, stems, and roots of the plants all partake in trade-offs and the resource allocation.  Leaves are the photosynthetic part of the plant and when resources are in abundance plants normally have a high growth rate.  Stems are also important, because they support the structure of the plant and involved in light capture.  Leaves and stems normally grow tall when there is little access to the sun and stay shorter and bushier when there is a lot have access to sunlight. Roots are meant to absorb nutrients for the necessary functions of the plant but it is also meant to anchor the plant.  In terms of roots, when there is little ground water the roots grow longer to access the water.  Temperature of an ecosystem has the ability to effect water supply and the over all growth of the plants. It has been seen that temperatures that are considered to be extreme, or fall below or above specific levels at critical times during development can significently impact productivity negatively. [Hatfield: 2015]
The Mung Bean, Vigna radiata, is native to several different south Asian counties.  This species is being used in this study, due to it being easy to access financially and its ability to grow in many different conditions.  The group of mung bean plants that are in high temperature environment are more likely to have linger roots than those in normal conditions because higher temperatures can cause drier soil with less water.


Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment six planting containers were filled with potting soil and 6-8 plants were placed in the pot.  This many seeds were used to make sure that there were enough plants grow it test the dependent variables of length and weight.  Three of these pots were placed on a heating pad, that reaches ten to twenty degrees Fahrenheit above the current temperature to imitate increased heating conditions but allow for the plants to be in the same environment as the controll, otherwise. This allowed for the other necessary conditions for plants to grow to not be effected. Each pot was watered well; until the soil is wet from top to bottom.  The seeds were then watered everyday for two weeks.  Once the two weeks over the plants were uprooted, by gently dumping the soil from the pots into a tub of water. Then the soil was gently removed from the stem and roots of each plant.  The plants were then weighted as a whole.  After the plants were weight the root and stems were separated and weighed separated.   Next the roots and shoots of each plant were measured.  The root: shoot ratios were calculated for both the length and weight. The averages and standard deviations were also found for this data.  All of this information was then recorded.  A two- sample one tail test was used to test the significent of this data.

Results:
After the two weeks were over ten plants grew in the heated environment and eighteen plants grew in the normal conditions.  The averages and standard deviations of the root to shoot length ratios for the experimental and controll groups were 2.117 +/- 0.44 and 2.484 +/- 1.332; respectively.  The weight root: shoot ratios for the experimental and controll are 2.781 +/- 1.491 and 2.407 +/- 1.474.   In order for a p_value to be considered significent the p_value has to be equal to or below 0.05.  The p_value for the weight t_test was 0.264 and the p_value for the length was 0.204.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, the group of mung bean plants that are in high temperature environment are more likely to have longer roots than those in normal conditions because higher temperatures can cause drier soil with less water, was not supported.  The hypothesis was not supported due to the conditions of the environment.  One article stated that in order for there to be a true effect on the growth of a plant in relation to a heated environment the temperature must be high and there has to be drought conditions [Dreseen:2012].  High temperatures and drought conditions, individually, may have a small effect on the growth and root: shoot ratios but in order to see a significent effect the two variables have to be working together [Dreseen:2012].  The increase in temperature could also have impacted the growth of the experimental groups.  The heating pad used for the experimental group only increased the temperature current temperature by 10- 20 degrees.  In many areas in the United states that 10-20 degrees is the different between fall and spring.  In both of these ranges of temperature plants are able to flourish which is what the mung bean plants did in these two different environments.
With the climate changing and the plant temperature increasing it is important issue to study how resources will be impacted.  Plants are a major resource because they provide anything from food to oxygen.  If the plants are in conditions to where they can not longer function properly other organism will be negatively affected and entire ecosystems will be impacted.  The purpose of this experiment was to determine how well plants can survive and allocate resources when they are in heated or more extreme conditions than what they are use to; resembling climate change.  However, the temperature conditions that were used were used were not extreme enough to imitate extreme global warming.  Moving forward an experiment that could be planned to test the effects of climate change and pollution is extreme heat conditions paired with drought conditions or an experiment where polluted water is used as ground water for the plants.
