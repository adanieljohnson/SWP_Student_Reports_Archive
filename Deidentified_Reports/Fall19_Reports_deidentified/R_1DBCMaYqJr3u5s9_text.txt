Title: Effects of resource scarcity on phenotypes of mung beans

Abstract:
Organisms can allocate their resources in various ways to overcome the different challenges imposed by their surroundings. This results in sometimes drastic phenotypic variations in individuals with identical genotypes. This was studied in the root to shoot ratio of mung beans planted in different soils. Using mung beans planted vermiculite as a controll group, we tested how the beans would grow when planted in a clay medium. We hypothesize that  the root shoot ratio of the plants potted in clay will increase. 


Introduction:
Every species must cope with the challenges their environment presents them. While some animals can move when an area becomes unfavorable, others are not afforded that opportunity. One major adaptation many species possess is the ability to direct their resources according to what challenges for survival. This is regulated by the environment influencing the expression of genes in an individual [Wong: 2005]. This can result in organisms of identical genotypes with different phenotypes. Plants are a model organisms for species that must cope with the environment surrounding them lest they perish. One noticeable response to plants in their environment is their allocation of resources from shoot production to root growth when in soil that does not suit them well. This results in individuals with a larger root to shoot ratio, longer roots with shorter shoots [Monk: 1966]. Mung beans are a plant which grow relatively quickly. In Response to nutrient availability, they show significent phenotypical variation in growth [Kar: 1996]. An increase of Root shoot ratios are among the variables which are easily measured. Plants can also allocate their resources from various functions to address many survival threats. This premise has been known to impact the production of many agricultural crops throughout the world. In soils which are less nutrient abound, plants direct their growth towards nutrient allocation by growing out roots into the soil at a larger rate. However, this results in the plant size being reduced, often in the desired parts of agricultural plants [Tittonell: 2005]. This premise applies back to mung beans and their growth. If they are exposed to nutrient poor and hostile soil, they will allocate their resources to overcome this obstacle. However, due to the scarcity of resources, the mung bean must divert resources from accomplishing other goals to overcome the low levels of nutrients in the soil. With these extra resources, the mung bean must create a solution. This is the question we want to answer in this lab, what is the intervention  mung beans have evolved to cope with this scenario. We expect the mung beans response will most likely will be seen in extended relative growth in roots. As a negative side effect of this, the shoot growth and size of the plant will be smaller. If nutrient availability in soil is decreased in mung beans, then the root shoot ratio will increase.


Materials and Method:
A controll group and experimental group was used in this experiment. The controll group was mung beans planted in potting vermiculite and the experimental group was mung beans planted in red clay. Each group had three pots which consisted of twelve seeds planted in their respective soils. Each group was potted and watered enough to soak the potting medium and placed in a greenhouse with adequate sunlight. For two weeks the beans were let to grow, being watered enough to soak their potting medium daily. After two weeks, the plants which took root and sprouted and their roots were recovered from their respective soils. We then weighed each plant. After determining the mass of each plant, the length of the roots and shoots of each plant were measured. The root to shoot ratio was then calculated for each plant. The average weight, length and root to shoot ratio of each experimental group and the controll group were then compared using a one tailed two sample T test.


Results:
The average root to shoot ratio and mass in the controll plants were 1.49207 (STD=0.7717) and 1.633507 (STD=.672791) respectively (figure 1). The average root to shoot length ratio and mass in the experimental group were 3.15271 (STD=4.091114) and 2.348768 (STD=1.971801) respectively (figure 2). Comparing the two groups average mass with a T test yielded a T P value of 0.014553. The T test comparing the average lengths yielded a P value of 0.02991. The clay pot groups were dehydrated in appearance. The vermiculite groups seemed healthy and in good shape. Out of the 36 beans planted per group, only 21 out of the experimental group sprouted and only 26 of the controll group sprouted. The vermiculite group had visibly talle shoots and roots than the clay group. 



Discussion:
Our T tests showed that in both length and mass of each plants, the our data was significently different. This affirms out hypothesis that the root shoot ratio would be larger in the experimental group. This sheds light of the environmental pressure of the clay pots on the mung beans in contrast to the vermiculite groups. The hostile environment of the clay pots made the mung beans devote more for their essential resources into growing roots than sprouting. Due to the dehydrated appearance of the clay plants, it seems that the biggest resource lacking from the plants was water. This most likely is the driving force behind the smaller sizes of the experimental group. The clay soil presented as much denser than the vermiculite which explains why water was scarce. The density of the clay also explains why many of the mung beans did not sprout. As the experimental plants weighed less it can be assumed that the experimental groups had less resources to work with. This shows us that the plant was under pressure to solve a problem from its environment [Monk: 1966]. This study gives us a scope of how genotypes are not the only determinant in phenotype. While genotype gives the basis of what can be transcribed, it is ultimately the environment which pressures which genes to be activated and at what level. Our mung bean plants give us a model of how every organism must adapt to survive. While our data was significent is it important to factor in that many seeds did not sprout in the clay. This resulted in a much smaller group to collect data from. With smaller sample size comes less reliable data. When attempting to recreate this experiment, it is recommended to have less solid clay that would allow the beans to take root before growing. This would give larger data pools which in turn would allow more conclusive statements to be made. Our revelations how mung beans reallocate resources to solve an issue posed by their environments can be applied to other plant organisms. This in turn may give us insight in how all plants respond to threats and potentially allow us to tend to them more effectively.
