Title:  The effect of pH on Vigna radiata root-shoot resource allocation 

Abstract:
The longevity and effectiveness of plants and their processes is largely dependent on the environment they are in. Plants may need to reallocate resources to have the best chance of survival. Environmental factors that may affect this may include soil pH imbalances, sunlight levels, or water and nutrient availability. In this experiment, pH levels were altered to determine a correlation between soil acidity and the plants’ root-to-shoot ratios. It was hypothesized that the neutral pH group would have the lowest root-to-shoot ratio, due to the plants not expending more energy on growing the roots longer. In the other treatment groups, it would be beneficial for the plants to put more energy into expanding the roots, in search of better soil conditions. Three treatment groups were tested (pH=3.5, pH=7, pH=8.5). The neutral conditions produced the plants with the lowest root-to-shoot ratio. This trend, while not statistically significent, supports the hypothesis that there is no need for resource allocation in a healthy environment. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation in plants is a crucial process in plants. Based on the environment that the plant is in, energy may be taken from one component of the plant, such as shoot height, and distribute that energy elsewhere, where it is needed more. The plant will need to distribute energy in most strategic way to promote survival [Shultz: 2013]. This is often the case in less than ideal environments. It is important to better understand which environments cause plants to carefully disperse their resources and how this allocation effects the plant. A common, unideal environment for plants is acidic or alkaline soil conditions. This may be a scenario where an allocation of resources is necessary. The pH of soil can affect plants in various ways: including the microbial community growth in the roots, the ability to intake phosphate and other nutrients from the soil, and reactions involving phytotoxic elements [Kuramae: 2011][Penn: 2019]. If the pH of the environment the plant is in is either too acidic or too alkaline, the roots may grow larger to compensate the little availability of nutrients in the soil [Robles-Aguilar: 2018]. This allocation of energy can be seen through a measure called “root-to-shoot ratio.” Root-to-shoot ratios can also be used to assess other aspects of plant health. By determining the comparison between the length or weight, the biomass allocation of resources can be observed [Ping: 2019]. If the plant has a larger root-to-shoot ratio, the roots are larger, and it can be assumed the energy for resources was used for the roots. If the ratio is smaller, the larger the shoots are, and it can be assumed that the plant would most benefit from a larger stem and leaves.  In this experiment, Vigna radiata, or mung bean, plants were used to determine the correlation of soil health to the root-to-shoot ratio. Mung beans are an ideal plant to test the effects of pH on. The non-aerial hypocotyl portion of the plant acts as a fast pathway of uptake for nutrients in the soil. The penetration into the hypocotyl depends greatly on the soil conditions, including the acidity of the soil [Aponte: 2018]. By using the mung bean plant, the effects of the varying pH may be seen in the root and shoot growth. Below ground competition in roots is a beneficial method plants use to attempt to intake the most nutrients [Kaier: 2013]. If the plant allocates its resources to expand the roots in attempt to find better soil conditions, the resulting root to shoot ration would be smaller. It was hypothesized that in this experiment the root-to-shoot ratio would be largest in the controll group, and smaller in both extreme pH conditions. This was expected due to poor soil quality from the extreme pH. The roots would grow larger, trying to take up as much surface area as possible to intake the most nutrients.

Materials and Method:
Fifteen pots each were filled with vermiculate soil, 50 Ml of MiracleGro fertilizer, and approximately 10-20 mung beans. The pots were separated in groups of five to create three different treatment groups. The pots were placed in the greenhouse and watered daily with their associated treatment. The first group was the acidic group; they were watered with a solution of 3.5 ph. The second group was the controll group; they were watered with water with a pH of 7. The third group was the alkaline group and was watered with a solution of 8.5 pH.  After two weeks, the plants were removed from their pots and their total weight, root weight, and shoot weight were measured. The root to shoot ratio for weight was determined. The plants were also measured and the root to shoot ratio for length was calculated.  An ANOVA statistical test was performed on the data, comparing both root-to-shoot ratios between all three treatment groups.

Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the controll group, in both length and weight, showed root-to-shoot ratios that were lower than the other treatment groups. On average, all plants in the controll group were similar in height, appearance, and in their root-to-shoot ratio. The root-to-shoot ratio in height and weight for the controll group ranged between about 0.4 to 0.6. In the acid treatment group, the root-to-shoot ratios were higher than the controll group and similar to the alkaline treatment group. In acidic conditions, the root-to-shoot ratio ranged from approximately 0.7 to 0.9. The alkaline group, again, had higher ratios than the controll plants. The range of root-to-shoot ratios in the alkaline condition stayed around 0.7. There were not any visual differences in the plants between all three groups. Based on an ANOVA test comparing all three treatment groups, the root-to-shoot ratios were not significently different. For the length root-to-shoot ratio, P=0.558; for the weight root-to-shoot ratio, P=0.217.

Discussion:
The general trends of the root-to-shoot ratio showed that the controll group had the lowest ratio out of all treatment groups. It can be inferred that the roots were larger in the acidic and alkaline environments than the roots in the controll group. While this data was not statistically significent, the trends of the data align with previous studies stating that resource allocation occurs when one aspect of the plant’s environment is poor [Shultz: 2013]. The hypothesis that the controll group would have the lowest root-to-shoot ratio is supported by the trends in the data but is not statistically supported. This may have occurred due to the good conditions that the neutral pH provided for the plant, and the poor conditions in the other treatment groups. The roots had difficulty growing in the surrounding soil based on the acidic and alkaline treatments. Due to this, it is possible that the roots grew longer to try to find better conditions. It’s essential for the roots to grow to find the most nutritious soil so that they can survive their environment [Sun: 2015].  It is possible that the pH of the soil didn’t affect the plant’s resource allocation because the pH may not have affected the plant in such an extreme way. If there was not a great need to reallocate resources, the plant would grow as if it was unaffected [Bennett: 2011]. Sarasketa and others [2016] state that although the extracellular environment may have an extreme pH, because of strong internal metabolism, the cytoplasm of the cell may be left unaffected. This may have been the case in the mung bean plants, where if the internal plant cells did not experience a change in pH, there would be no reason to reallocate.  It is important to understand resource allocation in the context of varying soil pH due to the fact that pH is readily changing in the soil based on other environmental factors. High pH levels in soil may be caused by nearby irrigation or an excess of minerals such as zinc or calcium carbonate [Boawn: 1971]. Low pH, often times from acid rain, can affect the water intake of plants, according to Kamaluddin [2004]. Long and others [2017] further state this, as well as stating that at pH 3.0, plants undergo acidic toxicity and an inhibition of CO2 assimilation. For future studies, the plants could be exposed to their conditions for a longer period of time or could have a larger range of pH conditions. An assay could also be performed that provides an acidic or alkaline condition on one side of the pot and neutral conditions on the other side. This would be to further analyze how the resource allocation works specifically in terms of root length.
