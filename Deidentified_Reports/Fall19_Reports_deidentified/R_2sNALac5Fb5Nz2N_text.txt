Title: Effects of Different Colored “Fish” on Betta fish (Betta splendens)

Abstract:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior, using observational skills from sources such as natural history, laboratory methods, and theories from various areas of scientific study. It is key to analyze the behavior of an organism in the presence of other organisms or stimuli rather than in isolation in order to understand how the organism evolved or was affected under selection. In this experiment, we analyzed the agonistic, or aggressive, behavior of male betta fish (Betta splendens) in response to fake fish cutouts and videos of aggressive male betta fish, both of which were blue, red, and grey. Overall, the agonistic behavior was measured by counting the number of strikes the actual fish made at the fake fish and the time until the first attack. Each trial was run was two minutes and three trials were run for each color. However, there was no data nor aggressive behavior by the actual fish. This could have been due to a multitude of reasons, but most likely due to the fish not being realistic enough. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we analyzed the agonistic, or aggressive, behavior of male Betta fish (Betta splendens) in response to other colored “fish.” Betta fish were the ideal organisms to work with and were utilized in this lab because of their easy analysis when performing aggressive behavior, small size so they are easy to contain and observe, and their ability to survive over a long period of time under somewhat stressful conditions. These fish originated from Southeast Asia. In general, by studying, analyzing, and observing the behavior of betta fish, or any organism, and their responses to certain stimuli and conditions falls under the study of ethology. This is also known as the study of animal behavior, using observational skills from sources, such as natural history, laboratory methods, and theories from various areas of scientific study. It is critical, as done in this experiment, to analyze the organism’s behavior in different environments and to different stimuli rather than in isolation so people can understand how the organism evolved or is affected under selection [Johnson: 2016]. It is also key, as done in this experiment, to be patient when observing the organisms in order to not disturb their behaviors. In one study, it was found, under repeated trials, that male betta fish responded very consistently and responded in the same manner in response to both “fake” or “dummy” fish and actual live fish in very similar conditions [Dziewexynski: 2010]. This suggests that male betta fish are not truly effective and efficient in recognizing an actual betta fish versus a fake fish, yet still exhibiting aggressive behavior. Typically, at rest and when not excited/displaying aggressive behavior, the male betta fish have a dull grey color. Although in the presence of another male or displaying aggressive behavior, a male betta fish will flare its gills and fins, changing color to a dark blue or red. However, due to decades of domestication and artificial selection, the majority of male betta fish have retained their deep vibrant fighting colors [Johnson: 2016]. Therefore, we studied betta behavior because of their many ways to respond aggressively to another fish. It was found in another study that aggressive behavior was still elicited due to multiple qualitatively different stimuli, such as a live male Betta, the mirror image of the fish, and a two-dimensional cut-out of a fish [Figler: 1972]. In terms of aggressive behavior, there are broadside and facing movements of the fish’s’ body parts. Broadside movements are when the fish turns its side toward its opponent, which are (in order of increasing aggression) pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. There are three facing movements, which are (in order of increasing aggression) pectoral fins erect, spreading gill covers (opercula), and protruding the branchiogestal membranes located under the opercula [Johnson: 2016]. These were behaviors that were also found in Figler’s study. Sometimes, a male betta fish will even attack their opponent, which is another form of aggressive behavior. In this experiment, we studied how male betta fish respond to the presence of another “betta” (cutout outline of a betta fish) of various colors, similarly to the aforementioned studies that elicited aggressive behavior of the betta fish. The outline varied from blue to red to grey/black. We hypothesized that the actual male betta fish will respond more aggressively, based on the number of attacks and the duration of agonistic behaviors, to the blue and red fish because colored fish represent excited or aggressive fish, whereas grey fish represent non-aggressive, or non-excited, behavior. 

Materials and Methods:
We first attained one betta fish and placed them in a tank that is separated into three compartments by plastic opaque partitions. The male betta fish was placed in the middle partition for ease of displaying outlines of the other “bettas.” It is critical to choose a fish that has had a long period of rest rather than a fish that was previously used in an experiment the prior day. This allows the fish to respond with the appropriate behavior to a stimulus. Once the we placed the actual fish in the middle compartment, we then observed the behavior of the isolated fish for two minutes to get baseline data. We recorded notes in our notebooks based on the fish’s color, position of body parts, how it was moving, etc. It was critical to not disturb the fish during this process and to not excite it because this was the baseline data and thus would be compared to any aggressive behavior. Next, for two minutes, we observed the fish responding to one of the three colored fish outlines (either blue, red, or grey) within tank and representing another male betta fish*. We recorded observations in our notebooks and gave them five minutes of rest after this period of interaction with the outline. We recorded the number of strikes the actual fish made, as well as the time until the first strike. We repeated this step two more times for each colored outline, totaling to three trials per colored outline. We alternated the trials and color order in order to not habituate the fish to the outlines. Once we collected all the data, we planned to perform multiple two tailed two-sample t-tests to perform statistical analysis among the multiple independent variables (colors). *When we conducted this experiment, we were not getting any results, data, nor aggressive behavior when displayed all three of the colored fish outlines. Because we performed multiple trials doing this and nothing was happening, we decided to replace the actual fish with another fish in hopes of getting some data. However, we still had no success in getting data despite swapping fish. In order to try and alter our experiment in order to get data, we decided to find live videos online of male betta fish displaying aggressive behavior. Therefore, we found three videos of male betta fish comparable in size and of the general colors, blue, grey, and red. We altered the one video of the red betta by using the greyscale to have a “grey” betta. We then simply repeated the above-mentioned procedures but simply replaced the colored outline of the fish with the videos of the fish placed against the side of the tank in order to analyze the actual fish’s behavioral responses.

Results:
We did not attain any significant results or data from this experiment. Both male betta fish tested in this experiment failed to respond to either the colored outline or male betta fish video stimuli. Occasionally, the fish would go up to the top of the water to get air and then would swim back down. Other than that, the fish displayed on agonistic behavior or attacks in response to either stimuli. If we did get data, we would perform multiple two tailed two-sample t-tests in order to analyze the significance of the independent variables (colors). Because we had no data, we also could not create any figures or graphs to represent the experiment. 

Discussion:
Based on our results, this experiment was unsuccessful. In the above-mentioned method section, there was no response of the two fish to either different colored fish cutouts or different colored male bettas in online videos. Therefore, we could not support our hypothesis. We tried exposing the fish to the red or blue stimuli first in hopes of immediately seeing any aggressive behavior but the only response the fish gave was going up to the surface of the water to get air. Throughout multiple trials, there was no response of either fish. When the fish cutouts were placed in the tank, we even tried to move the outline to imitate the movements of a fish, but this did not work. In all trials, the fish just swam very passively through the water and sat in the tank. There are multitude of possible reasons for why this experiment did not work. The fish outline/cutout most likely failed because it was too one-dimensional and had little accuracy in appearance to that of an actual male betta fish. It was seen in both Figler’s and Dziewexynski’s study that betta fish respond to various stimuli, as well as “fake” betta fish. Another possible reason was that the actual fish were still tired from prior experiments. As a result, they were resting in order to gain back energy and thus were not responding in their typical manner to certain stimuli. The fish might not have responded to the videos because of the UV light or the light coming from the phone. The light could have caused the fish to evade the light of the phone and as a result, could not have responded with agonistic behavior. It was found in one study on goldfish that they were sensitive to U.V. stimuli at wavelengths down as much as 340 nanometers. Depending on various wavelengths, there was a change in sensitivity of the fish in adapting U.V. illumination [Hawryshyn: 1985]. This could have been the case for our own betta fish; the light from the phone could have changed the sensitivity of the fish, causing it to respond not in a typical aggressive manner. In another study, it was found that Oryzias latipes, an adult fish, displayed light-sensitivity in response to varying light intensity. At certain wavelengths, there was inhibitions of cyclic AMP and could be a potential reason for changes in a fish’s response to light stimuli [Negishi: 1985].
