Title: The Average Change in Absorbance of Spinacia oleracea as a Function of Temperature

Abstract:
The process of photosynthesis is crucial to the growth and survival of plants and must be fueled by solar energy. Without the energy from the sun, redox reactions would not occur, and the electron transport chain would not exchange energy between photosystem one and photosystem two. The electron transport chain, however, is also temperature dependent therefore photosynthesis is temperature dependent. Due to global warming plants will become subject to higher temperatures under which they are expected to preform normal photosynthetic activites. The objective of the experiment was to determine the effect of high temperatures on the average absorbance of chloroplasts. It was hypothesized that if the environmental temperature was increased past normal conditions (40C) then the average absorbance of chloroplast in the Spinacia oleracea plant would decrease. The average percent change in absorbance of three sample groups from each environmental condition were measured every ten minutes for thirty minutes. It was found that past environmental conditions, the average absorbance statistically differed when compared to the negative control group. However, the absorbances did not statistically differ when compared to the positive control group. 

Introduction:
Environmental temperature influences leaf photosynthetic rates in both the short term and the long term. The photosynthetic rate is equal to the minimum rate of two partial reactions, RuBP regeneration and RuBP carboxylation. RuBP regeneration rate is generally thought to be determined by the electron transport rate in the thylakoid membranes [Yamori et al.: 2005]. Photosynthesis does not occur in one single step, rather in three distinct and separate processes. While all three processes are separate, they run concurrently inside the chloroplast. The first two stages, together, are known as the light dependent reactions. The light dependent reactions begin in photosystem II (PSII) where solar energy is used to split water, releasing energy. When a chlorophyll absorbs the energy, in the form of a photon, the electrons maintain a higher energy level. However, this energy level is unstable requiring the electrons to be transferred to another molecule. This process crates a chain of redox reactions known as the electron transport chain (ETC). These electrons flow from PSII to PSI, causing energy exchange [Alberts: 2013]. The ETC is temperature dependent at the water oxidation sites, set by the temperature at which the plant leaves are developed. This indicates that a major contributing factor to the thermal acclimation of photosynthesis is the PSII electron transport to environmental temperature [Davison: 2018]. Photosynthesis can be measured by analyzing photosystem II. Spinacia oleracea (commonly known as spinach) was chosen as a model organism because it is suitable for biochemical analysis. By measuring the average absorbance of the chloroplast from the spinach plant. The absorbance can be used to measure photosynthesis because as the pigments absorb light, electrons within the photosystems are excited to a higher energy level. These higher energy electrons are essential to photosynthesis. The higher the absorbance, the more photoreactive the chloroplasts. It is understood what happens to plants when moderate, environmental changes occur. However, the absorbance rates when the temperature increases past normal environmental conditions has not yet been fully explored. At 25 Celsius, the average absorbance is expected to increase, as room temperature is the most optimal environment for photosystem II to operate at [Yamasaki et al.: 2002]. In a dark environment, it is expected that the average absorbance will remain constant. This is because there will be no light to activate the chloroplasts and begin photosystem II, therefore there should be no change in absorbance observed. During the reaction in the increased heat, to conserve photosystem II, the organism will switch back to photosystem I [Yamauchi et al.: 2011]. Because of this, it was hypothesized that when the chloroplasts is exposed to the 40 Celsius water bath, the average absorbance will decrease.

Materials and Methods:
To begin, chloroplasts were collected from spinach leaves. Leaf pieces were ground together with 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). After a paste formed, an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer was added to solution and mixed until a slurry consistency was reached. After the slurry was thoroughly filtered, the remaining liquid was transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and spun at 200*G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for three minutes at four degrees Celsius. The centrifuged liquid from tube A was then transferred to tube B, without the pellet of debris from tube A. This new solution was spun in the centrifuge at 1,000*G for ten minutes. 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet of tube B and stored on ice. To carry out the experiment, three replicate samples of the chloroplast in light at room temperature (positive control), in the dark (negative control), and in a 40 C water bath were prepared. Note that only one blank sample is needed. For the control, 8 mL of water was added to 2 mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). In the nine experimental samples, 6 mL of water was added to 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP along with 2 mL of reaction buffer. When the assay was ready to begin, 100 l of the enriched chloroplast prepared previously, were added to all tubes. After the assay began, the absorbance of each tube was measured using the spectrometer at 600 nm wavelength. After initial readings were taken, samples were transferred to their testing environments and readings were taken every ten minutes for thirty minutes. The average percent change for each time interval was calculated. After data was collected, a paired t-test was used to analyze and interpret the data collected.

Results:
The average percent change in absorbance for the positive control (room temperature in the light) was 0.0130% (SE= 0.00413). The average percent change in absorbance for the negative control (room temperature in the dark) was 0.0040% (SE= 0.00305). The average change in percent absorbance for the test group was 0.0452% (SE= 0.02238). When compared to the positive control group, the test group did not display a statistical difference in average percent absorbance (p-stat= 0.07057). However, when compared to the negative control group, the test group did display a statistical difference in average percent absorbance (p-stat= 0.01698).


Discussion:
Our results somewhat supported the hypothesis that in a warm temperature environment, the average absorbance eventually decreases. When compared to the negative control, the results are considered to be statistically different however when compared to the positive control they are not considered different. This can be attributed to experimental error in the positive control group. At room temperature, under light, the average percent absorbance is expected to increase [Singh and Singhal: 1985]. The results may have been skewed because the light used as a substitute for sunlight was not as bright as it would be in environmental conditions. Without the proper exposure to solar energy, the water molecules would not be split, and energy would be lost. This would ensure that the chlorophyll never absorbed any energy and the electrons would be in a lower than expected energy state. A previous study proved that chloroplast development depends on light, and light affects the structure and photosynthetic changes in plants. In the dark, chloroplasts showed a disordered thylakoid which would decrease absorbance [Duan et al.: 2014]. Without the proper light provided, the absorbance rates will decrease. The heated chloroplasts acted as expected because in the presence of added thermal energy, they switched to photosystem one to conserve photosystem two. This would account for the lower activation energy displayed (Figure 1) because in photosystem one the chloroplasts are not as photoreactive as in PSII. This study can be applied to a larger global context because our planet is beginning to warm. As the planet’s temperature rises, plants will be required to adapt to new environmental conditions. However, as results have shown, in heated environments chloroplasts will eventually stop preforming photosynthesis. This will prove problematic as photosynthesis is a necessary life process for plants, and by extension animals that live off of the oxygen that they provide. In a previous study [Santarius and Müller: 1979] it was discovered that thylakoids played a vital role in the heat protection and acclimation of chloroplasts. However, the extent of this heat resistance has not yet been fully explored. Further studies should be conducted to fully understand the chloroplasts ability to withstand heat. With this knowledge, scientists will be better equipped to keep plants functional as the planet grows increasingly warmer.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The Effect of temperature on change in absorbance. The positive control (blue line) displays an observed decrease in percent absorbance as a function of time. As temperature increases to 40C (grey line), the percent absorbance increases for the first twenty minutes and then begin to decrease. 3 samples of chloroplasts were placed in each test environment and exposed for ten-minute intervals for thirty minutes. Percent change in absorbance was measured every ten minutes. Each point is the average percent change in absorbance of the three samples; error bars are 2 s.d.
