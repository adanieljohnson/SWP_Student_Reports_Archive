Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is an organism that uses metamorphosis to transition to the adult stages of life. It regulates molting and changes based on its hormone levels, specifically JH and 20E. As JH is low and 20E sees a jump, the commitment pulse is triggered, and metamorphosis begins. This experiment tests the affect on continuing high levels of JH on Manduca sexta. The conclusions draw from the experiment are that JH does not have any effect on the mass of the larvae over a period of 3 weeks when in low concentrations. At 4 drops a day, no difference can be detected. However, if given 8 drops a day the larvae are significantly smaller. Also, other studies have demonstrated that that prolonged exposure to JH prohibits the Manduca sexta from entering metamorphosis. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a type of moth commonly found in the Eastern United States. In the early stages of life, the Manduca sexta lives in its larva stage and feeds on plant leaves [Lotts: 2017]. It follows the life cycle of eggs to larvae to cuticle and finally adult. Therefore, the Manduca sexta exemplifies the a holometabolous life cycle. The larvae are considered pests frequently destroying fields of crops and are commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. As adults they feed on nectar from flowers and are pollinators [Lotts: 2017]. Metamorphosis is controlled primarily be 3 hormones: Brain Hormone, Juvenile Hormone (JH), and Ecdysteroid(20E). Specifically, JH and 20E work to control the cycles of life. As JH is low and 20E sees a sudden spike, the commitment pulse is reached, and metamorphosis begins.  If exposure to JH continues throughout the Manduca sexta, then the larvae will grow slower and never transition to the adult stages of life. The null hypothesis is that the two groups will have equal masses. The alternate hypothesis is that there will be a difference in the 2 groups.

Materials and Methods:
In order to test the hypothesis, 2 control groups were used and 2 groups received JH hormone. The control variables were that each caterpillar was kept in the same style of container that had 4 compartments. Each compartment had 1 caterpillar, 1 hole for air, and 10g of food added each day. The caterpillars were stored at 70 degrees Fahrenheit. As the first control group, each of the 2 caterpillars received 4 drops of water each day in their food. The second control was identical to the first but received 8 drops of water. The experimental group was the same as the control except instead of 4 drops of water, 4 drops of JH were added. The same was done with the second group with 8 drops of JH. The mass of the caterpillars was then recorded daily and visual observations were also taken. The independent variable was the presence of JH in the food vs the absence of it. The dependent variable was the mass of the caterpillars. A t-test was run on both groups to determine the statistical significance. The p-value must have been below .05 for the results to be significant. 

Results:
After comparing the larvae at each day, a p-value of .065243 was reached for the 4-drop groups. The 8 drop group was had a p-value of .002368. The average final weight of the control 4-drop group was 10.9961 with a standard deviation of 1.183. The average final weight of the experimental 4-drop group was 11.3344 with a standard deviation of 0.679. The average final weight of the control 8-drop group was 14.8289 with a standard deviation of 2.012. The average final weight of the experimental 8-drop group was 9.8352 with a standard deviation of 0.317.

The growth of the caterpillars is over the experimental period is demonstrated in the 2 figures. Figure one demonstrates the average growth of JH and water in increments of 8 drops. The caterpillars on average with JH grew less than that of those with just water. This begins to become evident at about the 3rd day. Figure 2 demonstrates the growth if just 4 drops of each substance is added. While the JH does affect the caterpillar at first, JH makes a return. 


Discussion:
Based on this data, JH does not affect the growth of Manduca sexta in low concentrations at 4 drops. The null hypothesis can be accepted. There was no significant difference in the data for the 4-drop group. However, for the 8 drop group a statistically significant value was reached. The hypothesis for the 8-drop group is supported because the control caterpillars grew at a significantly faster rate. The 4-drop group did not support the hypothesis because the control group did. Not grow significantly faster. Also, by then endo of the experimental period, the JH group was actually on average larger than the control group. From this data, it can be concluded that in order to full effect the larvae, the larvae must interact with a greater concentration of JH. That is not to say though that the JH had no effect on the 4-drop larvae. Both groups that interacted with the JH was noticeably more lethargic by the end. All JH larvae had much less vibrant colors as they looked sickly and white compared to the vibrantly green control group. It can be concluded that JH Hormone does in fact limit the growth of the caterpillars though. JH would have been present in high enough concentrations; therefore, the life cycle of the caterpillars is affected. JH controls the molting process which then affect limits the growth of the caterpillars. The concentration of JH is what controls the molting process; therefore, it makes sense that a greater concentration was needed to see the full effects of JH. Other studies have concluded that JH does have effect on the life cycle of Manduca sexta passed that of just mass. In Effects Of Juvenile Hormone On Ecdysone-Dependent Development In The Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta, JH is revealed to stop the larvae from entering the adult stages of life [Cymborowski: 1980]. In further study, using a larger group of larvae would be ideal and also watching the larvae all the way o the adult stages of life would be beneficial to determine the full effects of JH. On a larger scale, this study involving JH demonstrates the effectiveness of hormones. Hormones can control the balances of life and an imbalance of hormones can contribute to sickly behavior and developmental differences. Hormones can greatly alter the life cycle and appearance of organisms. Overall, the Manduca sexta is affected by JH; it just has to be in high enough concentration. This relates to the overall idea that hormones need to be present in greater concentrations in order to have the full effect on the organism.
