Title: Treatment of red U.V. light results in decreased root to shoot ratio and increased shoot length in mung bean (Vigna radiata) plants

Abstract:
The effect of red U.V. light on Vigna radiata, or mung beans, was tested in order to better understand how plants alter their resource allocation in response to environmental cues. Two groups of mung bean plants, the control and red U.V. light treated plants, were grown for two weeks in a greenhouse and the length and mass of the mung beans were then measured. We predicted that the red U.V. light treated mung beans would have a smaller root to shoot length ratio because of an increased need for sunlight resulting in increased vertical growth. Using 8 mung bean plants from the treatment group and 8 plants from the control group, mung bean root and shoot mass and length was recorded. The results show that the red U.V. treatment group had a statistically significant ( p = 0.046) difference in shoot length. This was not the case for the root to shoot length ratio and the root length (p = 0.44 and p = 0.10, respectively). Though our hypothesis was not supported, a greater average shoot length was observed which is consistent with prior experiment conducted that show red light causing an increase in shoot length. Our studies have the potential to assist farmers in recognizing variables that affect plant development and growth, allowing them to have better crop yields. 

Introduction:
Vigna radiata, more commonly known as mung beans, first originated in Asia and are now readily produced across the world [Li: 2011]. With superior nutritional benefits, and an inexpensive price tag, mung bean sprouts are rapidly booming in popularity. Like all plants, mung bean development and growth are dictated by a variety of factors, with each playing a pivotal role in the overall survival of the plant. More specifically, abiotic and biotic factors heavily influence plant development. Whereas biotic factors encompass an organism’s interactions with other living members of an ecosystem, abiotic factors involve an organism’s interactions with non-living sources [Johnson: 2019]. These non-living sources include things such as wind, temperature, and sunlight; among others. An abiotic factor of particular interest is light and it is the focus of our experiment. The amount and type of light received by a plant can affect its growth and development by altering what is known as the “root to shoot ratio” (R:S ratio). The R:S ratio is a metric used to quantify the number of roots versus shoots (stem and leaves) a plant has. Roots are critical for acquiring nutrients and water from the soil, whereas shoots allow for light capture and gas exchange to occur (Figure 1). When combined, these two components of a plant function to sustain life via the capture of essential nutrients [Johnson: 2019]. With great emphasis on the importance of roots and shoots, it is no surprise that plants allocate resources differently to these two components based on environmental conditions. As mentioned earlier, light conditions can heavily influence a plant’s resource allocation and subsequent R:S ratio. Different types of light can affect plants, with mung beans being no exception to this phenomenon. Plants rely extensively on light for energy production via photosynthesis and alterations to light can trigger major changes within the plant itself. With a growing global population and a decrease in overall farmland, understanding the variables that affect mung bean growth and development have the potential to provide valuable knowledge to farmers as they will be forced to increase crop yield with ever-diminishing farmland. In this experiment we tested the effects of red U.V. light on a plant’s R:S length ratio and also on its overall shoot and shoot length. We predict that plants treated with red U.V. light will have a smaller R:S length ratio therefore they will have a larger average shoot length. This is due to the fact that in altered light conditions, the mung bean plants will allocate more energy to the shoots in order to obtain more sunlight. The mung bean plants will try extending to reach more light, similar to a tree overcoming a jungle’s canopy. Thus, we predict that the mung beans will have longer shoots in response to the red U.V. light.

Materials and Methods:
Soaked mung bean seedlings were first planted using vermiculite. 4 seedlings were planted per tray, with 3 trays each in the control and treatment groups, respectively. 12 plants were grown under normal (control) conditions and 12 plants were grown under the red U.V light (treatment) conditions. Using piping and red U.V. film, a tent was erected to enclose the plants in the treatment group. The plants were then placed in a greenhouse and both plant groups were watered with 200mL of water daily for two weeks. After two weeks, the plants were harvested by pulling the plants out of the growing tray and rinsing them in water to separate the roots. A total of 8 mung bean plants were selected from each treatment group for data recordings. Then, the roots were separated from the shoots by cutting each plant apart at the root-to-shoot junction which was indicated by a color change. The weight and length of the root and shoot were first recorded followed by determination of the root to shoot ratio of each. Finally, a two-sample one tailed t-test was used to determine whether or not there was significance between the groups. We employed a p-value cutoff of 0.05 to indicate whether or not the results were significant. 

Results:
Figure 2 shows that the mung beans in the control condition had an average R:S value of 0.81 +/- 0.49. This was in comparison to the red U.V. light treated mung beans which had an average R:S length ratio of 0.77 +/- 0.20. Moreover, after running a two sample one tailed t-test, we obtained a p-value of 0.44 indicating no significant difference between the R:S length ratios of the two groups. For average shoot length, mung beans in the control condition had an average length of 11.23 +/- 4.17 cm (Figure 3). Furthermore, mung beans treated with red U.V. light, the average shoot length was 14.3 cm +/- 2.5 cm. A p-value of 0.046 was obtained, indicating a significant difference of average shoot lengths between the two groups. Lastly, Figure 4 shows that the mung beans in the control condition had an average root length of 8.09 cm +/- 5.02 cm. Moreover, the mung beans in the red U.V. light condition had an average root length of 10.9 cm +/- 3.1 cm (Figure 4). A non-significant p-value of 0.10 was obtained. 



Discussion:
After concluding the experiment, the results show that our hypothesis was not supported. The average R:S length for the control and red U.V. light treated plants was not significant (p = 0.44) indicating that there was no statistical difference in the R:S length between the two groups (Figure 2). Moreover, although there was a significant difference in average shoot length between the 2 groups (p = 0.046), the same was not true for the average root length between the two groups (p = 0.10). Our results also indicate that there was an increase in both average shoot length and average root length in the red U.V. treated mung beans with mean values being 14.3 cm and 10.9 cm, respectively (Figures 3,4). This was in comparison to the control group’s mean shoot length and mean root length values being at 11.23 cm and 8.09 cm, respectively. The increases in both root and shoot length offer an insight into why the R:S length ratio was small and insignificant. The treatment group plants saw an increase in both root and shoot length, when compared to the control. This indicates that the ratio also remained relatively small due to this trend. Though variables such as mung bean time spent in greenhouse and daily water amount were controlled for amongst the groups, there still may have been factors that resulted in data that was not significant. One being the structure of our tent. Though most of the red U.V. light treated mung bean plants were enclosed by a U.V. film tent, there was a small gap open which was taped together. This could have resulted in normal sunlight entering the tent and may provide a possible explanation for our results. Prior studies conducted have found interesting links between red light and plant growth. Far red light, or FR is found between 700nm-800nm [Tegelberg: 2004]. FR detection in plants is typically accompanied by an increase in height because FR is a signal that there is increased shading in the environment. Thus, when plants detect the red light, their photosensory systems trigger responses leading to plant growth [Tegelberg: 2004]. In our experiment we observed increased shoot heights in the red light treated plants which is consistent with this prior study. Red light’s effect on plant growth has been elucidated in other studies as well, which demonstrate red light trigger chemical responses within phytochromes (a type of photoreceptor) that result in plant growth [Zhou: 2002]. Understanding the complex and dynamic processes of how plants allocate energy, and variables that subsequently affect energy allocation, has robust potential, particularly in agricultural world. As farmers face an increased demand for food production, while facing an ever-diminishing capacity for farmland, they must find more efficient ways to obtain high yields with less land. Thus, understanding how plants alter their energy allocation in response to environmental cues, has the potential to unlock the answers to solve an inevitable global food shortage crisis. Future experiments will focus on testing different colors of U.V. light to determine if there are differences in plant resource allocations as light color changes.
