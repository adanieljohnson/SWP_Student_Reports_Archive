Title: The Effect of 20E Inhibitor on the Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta also known as the Tobacco Hornworm is an insect that undergoes metamorphosis similar to that of butterflies and moths. The complete life cycle of the hornworm is around 39-48 days. The Manduca sexta hatches as larvae, then molts into a pupa until it emerges as an adult (Johnson,9). The short life cycle makes the Manduca Sexta an easy insect to study development. Additionally, the larvae Manduca Sexta are considered pests because they harm the environment so they are often used for testing. Larvae Manduca sexta feed off solanaceous plants and can be difficult to remove from plants as they often blend in with the leaves. Bacillus thuringiensis is a common pesticide used to control the larvae and is only effective when the larvae consume the plant (Bollenbacher, 4). The larvae hornworm undergoes different phases called instars. When transitioning between instars, the insect molts. Molting is when the larvae sheds its epidermal skin cells and creates a new layer of skin called a cuticle. The transition between stages of the life cycle is controlled by two hormones, 20E and Juvenile Hormone. 20E regulates the timing of molting while JH regulates the type of molting. Both hormones work together to control the development of the hornworm. Certain levels of each hormone indicate it’s time for the insect to change stages. For example, a small spike in 20E and low JH levels at the 5th instar, called the commitment pulse, indicates the larva is ready to pupate. 20E is released by the prothoracic gland and binds to receptors on cell membranes creating changes in the cells. 20E levels are highest right before pupation (Johnson, 4). 20E inhibitor binds to the 20E receptors blocking 20E making the hormone less effective (Deel, 3). It is hypothesized that feeding the larvae a 20E inhibitor will delay development of the manduca sexta because 20E is essential for hornworm development. 


Materials and Methods:
Four larvae hornworms were used for the control group in this experiment and four were used for the experimental group. The control hornworms were placed in a divided plastic container and the experimental ones were placed in a separate, identical container. 10g of food was placed in each compartment of the containers. The food of the hornworms in the control group was mixed with five drops of water and balled up. The food of the hornworms in the experimental group was mixed with five drops of 20E inhibitor and balled up. The hornworms were weighed before being placed in the containers. They were then placed in an incubator and weighed each day. When the food appeared dry, it was replaced. The hornworms were weighed each day for eight days until the hornworms in the tested group died. The same procedure was repeated with another group of hornworms and weighed for 8 days until the tested group died again. The statistical test used for this experiment was a two-sample t-test. This test was used to compare the means of the average weights of the two groups. The one tailed p-value compared the means to see if one was statistically significantly greater or less than the other. 


Results:

One tailed p-value: .019
Standard deviation (control): 2.53
Standard deviation (tested): 0.21
The blue line shows the average weight of the hornworms of the control group and the orange line shows the average weight of the hornworms treated with 20E inhibitor. The x axis shows the number of days while the y axis shows the weight in grams. The standard deviation bars show the extent of deviation from the mean. 

One tailed p-value: .011
Standard deviation (control): 2.97
Standard deviation (tested): 0.27
The blue line shows the average weight of the hornworms of the control group and the orange line shows the average weight of the hornworms treated with 20E inhibitor. The x axis shows the number of days while the y axis shows the weight in grams. The standard deviation bars show the extent of deviation from the mean. 
Figure one and two show the average weights of the controlled and treated hornworms for eight days. Figure one shows the first eight days while figure shows the subsequent eight days. Two sets of data were necessary, because the hornworms in the treated group died after eight days, so the same procedure was repeated to see if the same results occurred. As seen by the graphs the control group hornworms grew at a faster rate than the treated hornworms. In both data sets the hornworms eventually died. 



Discussion:
The null hypothesis for this experiment is that the 20E inhibitor would have no effect on the development of the manduca sexta. The alternative hypothesis contrasts this stating that the 20E inhibitor would have an effect on the development of the Manduca Sexta. The P value for the first set of data was .019 and .011 for the second set of data. Both of these values fall below .05 therefore the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative is supported. On average, the hornworms grew 3.81 grams in the first data set and 7.61 grams in the second data set for the control group. On average, the hornworms grew only .91 grams and .065 grams in the group treated with 20E inhibitor. As a result, it can be concluded that the 20E inhibitor not only had a significant effect on the manduca sexta but it delayed its development. Additionally, because the hornworms died in both trials, it was concluded that 20E inhibitor leads to eventual death. Hornworms are pests at the larval stage and therefore 20E inhibitor can be used as an effective pesticide against this insect. The death, however, was gradual and therefore it would be useful to look into other substances that could kill the pests more effectively. Further studies could involve treating the hornworms with JH inhibitor as JH is essential for hornworm development as well as treating the hornworms with more inhibitor rather than just five drops. Potential sources of error could have arisen in this experiment. One source of error could be the health of the hornworms used for the experiment. The healthier the hornworms used, the better they would develop. Additionally, potential variances in the incubator would affect the quality of environment ultimately effecting their development.
