Title: Effects of Artificial Opponent Size on Agonistic Behaviors in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Agonistic, or aggressive, behavior refers to any organism’s social behavior related to fighting. Generally, organisms initiate agonistic behaviors when it is chief to survival and they are dominate in comparison to their opponent. It is hypothesized, if male Betta splendens are in proximity to a small, artificial opponent, then the Betta splenden will demonstrate agonistic behaviors sooner and more frequently, as opposed to Betta splendens in proximity to larger, artificial opponents. Three Betta splenden males were isolated in identical tanks of conditioned water. Various data, pertaining to agonistic behaviors in proximity to variously sized, artificial opponents (foam cutouts of a Betta splendens), was observed and recorded. Betta splendens that were in the presence of a small, artificial opponent yielded the smallest average time of the first agonistic behavior and largest average number of agonistic behaviors. Two statistically insignificant ANOVA results, evaluating the average time of the first agonistic behavior and average number of agonistic behaviors, suggested that varying the size of the artificial opponent has no effect on the initiation and quantity of agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens.

Introduction:
Agonistic, or aggressive, behavior refers to any organism’s social behavior related to fighting, or a lack there of. Agonistic behaviors vary across species, but these behaviors can be observed intra-specifically when an organism is in the presence of other members of their own species. Intraspecific agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens are displayed in males and is categorized into two types of movements: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are recognizable when one opponent turns its side toward its opponent. In the broadside position, a Betta splenden may exhibit agonistic behaviors such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing (increasing order of aggression). Facing movements are recognizable when one opponent turns its face toward its opponent. In the facing position, a Betta splenden may exhibit agonistic behaviors such as erect pectoral fins, spread opercula covers, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes – referred to as a “red mane” (increasing order of aggression). Other Betta splenden agonistic behaviors include a raised dorsal fin, lowered head, arching back, darkening skin, darting, biting, and nipping. If a Betta splenden does not respond aggressively to an opponent, it can submissively respond by ignoring, matching, fleeing, etc.  [Johnson: 2019].
Betta splendens, or Siamese fighting fish, are common aquarium fishes which makes them a model organism to study agonistic behaviors. One study which examined male Betta splendens suggests that maximal agonistic behavior is displayed when in proximity to a “weaker” opponent – whether due to size, color, etc. [Karino: 2007]. Another study, on a different aquatic species, expressed the same conclusions on dominance and stated that the organisms, whether physically superior or inferior, only participated in agonistic behaviors when vital [Guiasu: 1997]. The generalization of these results affirms that 1) organisms initiate agonistic behaviors when it is chief to survival and 2) the dominate organism, or “winner,” displays agonistic behaviors that are less subtle and more frequent then their opponents. Therefore, it is hypothesized, if male Betta splendens are in proximity to a smaller, artificial opponent and are threatened, they will demonstrate their agonistic behaviors sooner and more frequently.


Materials and Methods:
Three male Betta splendens were isolated in tanks of conditioned water. The Betta splendens rested for 4 minutes then baseline data, including position in the tank, color, position of fins, tail, and gill covers, and the frequency and “directedness” of swimming or fin movement, was observed and recorded. A small, red, artificial “opponent” (foam cutout of a Betta splenden) was placed in each of the tanks for 4 minutes. In the presence of the opponent, the time of the first agonistic behavior, number of agonistic behaviors, and type of agonistic behaviors of the Betta splendens was observed and recorded. The Betta splendens rested for 4 minutes, then the same procedure was conducted with a medium and large, red “opponent” (foam cutout of a Betta splenden).
The average time of the first agonistic behavior and number of agonistic behaviors of the Betta splendens were calculated for each size of artificial opponent. Additionally, the type of agonistic behaviors of the Betta splendens in the presence of each artificial opponent was compared and qualitative correlations were made. After data was collected and condensed, the average time of the first agonistic behavior and number of agonistic behaviors of the Betta splendens were employed to conduct two ANOVA tests which determined the statistical (in)significance that varying artificial opponent size has on agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens.


Results:
The relative effect of the size of the artificial opponent was positively correlated for the average time of the first agonistic behavior (see “Figure 1”) and negatively correlated for the average number of agonistic behaviors (see “Figure 2”). The average time of the first agonistic behavior and average number of agonistic behaviors in proximity to the small, artificial opponent was 15.33 ± 3.40 sec and 10.00 ± 7.63, respectively. The average time of the first agonistic behavior and average number of agonistic behaviors in proximity to the medium, artificial opponent was 29.00 ± 9.00 sec and 4.67 ± 3.40, respectively. The average time of the first agonistic behavior and average number of agonistic behaviors in proximity to the large, artificial opponent was 52.00 ± 19.61 sec and 2.67 ± 1.24, respectively. Observational data, pertaining to the specific agonistic behaviors of the Betta splendens, varied between the individual Betta splendens as well as the size of the artificial opponent (see “Table 1”). 
An ANOVA test for the average time of the first agnostic behavior between the three artificial opponent sizes yielded a p-value of 0.0990. An ANOVA test for the average number of agnostic behaviors between the three artificial sizes yielded a p-value of 0.3370. 


Discussion:
Based on the results, it can be concluded that the hypothesis was not supported. Evaluating graphical data, the average time of the first agonistic behavior and the average number of agonistic behaviors appeared to support the hypothesis since the average time of the first agonistic behavior was the lowest and average number of agonistic behaviors was largest for the Betta splendens in proximity to the small, artificial opponent. Although the results appeared to follow a trend, the ANOVA tests yielded statistically insignificant p-values which negated the implication. This suggests that varying the size of the artificial opponent has no effect on the initiation and quantity of agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens.
These results oppose current ecological knowledge. Previous studies cite that organisms, including Betta splendens, exhibit more agonistic behaviors in a shorter period when their opponent is posing physically threatening and less dominate [Guiasu: 1997]. However, two notable variations in the data provide plausible explanations to these inconsistencies. First, all the artificial opponents were colored red while one of the Betta splendens was colored blue and the other two Betta splendens were colored red. Previous studies note that Betta splendens display more aggression towards their own kind, in correlation to both species and color [Gelacio: 2019]. Markedly, the blue Betta splenden displayed submission behavior, as opposed to the other Betta splendens, which created an outlier in the data. In fact, the blue Betta splenden showed no agonistic behaviors when in proximity to the medium, artificial opponent. Additionally, due to ethical considerations, the opponents to the Betta splendens were artificial. It is plausible that the Betta splendens were cognizant that their survival was not in jeopardy and, thus, did not expend energy into agonistic behaviors. 
To enhance this research and gain further insight into these discrepancies, Betta splendens should be matched with opponents, ideally biological opponents, with nearly identical physical properties, excluding size. To expand the experiment, a more extensive data analysis on the specific types of agonistic behaviors could be conducted. Although the degree of intensity of agonistic behaviors is difficult to quantify there are a few accepted mechanisms which could aid in this more intensive categorization. Still, this study expands knowledge of agonistic behaviors which is directly correlated to hormone levels; this subject branches into many facets of biochemistry. Additionally, expanded understanding of agonistic behaviors permits improved models for operant and classical conditioning.
