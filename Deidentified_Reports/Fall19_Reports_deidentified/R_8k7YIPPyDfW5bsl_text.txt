Title: Effects of Artificial Opponent Size on Agonistic Behaviors in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Agonistic, or aggressive, behavior refers to any organism’s social behavior related to fighting. Generally, organisms initiate agnostic behaviors when it is chief to survival and they are dominate in comparison to their opponent. It is hypothesized, if male Betta splendins are in proximity to a small, artificial opponent, then the Betta splenden will demonstrate agnostic behaviors sooner and more frequently, as opposed to Betta splendins in proximity to larger, artificial opponents. Three Betta splenden males were isolated in identical tanks of conditioned water. Various data, pertaining to agnostic behaviors in proximity to variously sized, artificial opponents (foam cutouts of a Betta splendins), was observed and recorded. Betta splendins that were in the presence of a small, artificial opponent yielded the smallest average time of the first agnostic behavior and largest average number of agnostic behaviors. Two statistically insignificent ANOVA results, evaluating the average time of the first agnostic behavior and average number of agnostic behaviors, suggested that varying the size of the artificial opponent has no effect on the initiation and quantity of agnostic behaviors of Betta splendins.

Introduction:
Agonistic, or aggressive, behavior refers to any organism’s social behavior related to fighting, or a lack there of. Agonistic behaviors vary across species, but these behaviors can be observed intra-specifically when an organism is in the presence of other members of their own species. Intraspecific agnostic behaviors of Betta splendins are displayed in males and is categorized into two types of movements: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are recognizable when one opponent turns its side toward its opponent. In the broadside position, a Betta splenden may exhibit agnostic behaviors such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing (increasing order of aggression). Facing movements are recognizable when one opponent turns its face toward its opponent. In the facing position, a Betta splenden may exhibit agnostic behaviors such as erect pectoral fins, spread opercula covers, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes – referred to as a “red mane” (increasing order of aggression). Other Betta splenden agnostic behaviors include a raised dorsal fin, lowered head, arching back, darkening skin, darting, biting, and nipping. If a Betta splenden does not respond aggressively to an opponent, it can submissively respond by ignoring, matching, fleeing, etc.  [Johnson: 2019].
Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are common aquarium fishes which makes them a model organism to study agnostic behaviors. One study which examined male Betta splendins suggests that maximal agnostic behavior is displayed when in proximity to a “weaker” opponent – whether due to size, color, etc. [Karino: 2007]. Another study, on a different aquatic species, expressed the same conclusions on dominance and stated that the organisms, whether physically superior or inferior, only participated in agnostic behaviors when vital [Guiasu: 1997]. The generalization of these results affirms that 1) organisms initiate agnostic behaviors when it is chief to survival and 2) the dominate organism, or “winner,” displays agnostic behaviors that are less subtle and more frequent then their opponents. Therefore, it is hypothesized, if male Betta splendins are in proximity to a smaller, artificial opponent and are threatened, they will demonstrate their agnostic behaviors sooner and more frequently.


Materials and Method:
Three male Betta splendins were isolated in tanks of conditioned water. The Betta splendins rested for 4 minutes then baseline data, including position in the tank, color, position of fins, tail, and gill covers, and the frequency and “directedness” of swimming or fin movement, was observed and recorded. A small, red, artificial “opponent” (foam cutout of a Betta splenden) was placed in each of the tanks for 4 minutes. In the presence of the opponent, the time of the first agnostic behavior, number of agnostic behaviors, and type of agnostic behaviors of the Betta splendins was observed and recorded. The Betta splendins rested for 4 minutes, then the same procedure was conducted with a medium and large, red “opponent” (foam cutout of a Betta splenden).
The average time of the first agnostic behavior and number of agnostic behaviors of the Betta splendins were calculated for each size of artificial opponent. Additionally, the type of agnostic behaviors of the Betta splendins in the presence of each artificial opponent was compared and qualitative correlations were made. After data was collected and condensed, the average time of the first agnostic behavior and number of agnostic behaviors of the Betta splendins were employed to conduct two ANOVA tests which determined the statistical (in)significance that varying artificial opponent size has on agnostic behaviors of Betta splendins.


Results:
The relative effect of the size of the artificial opponent was positively correlated for the average time of the first agnostic behavior (see “Figure 1”) and negatively correlated for the average number of agnostic behaviors (see “Figure 2”). The average time of the first agnostic behavior and average number of agnostic behaviors in proximity to the small, artificial opponent was 15.33 ± 3.40 sec and 10.00 ± 7.63, respectively. The average time of the first agnostic behavior and average number of agnostic behaviors in proximity to the medium, artificial opponent was 29.00 ± 9.00 sec and 4.67 ± 3.40, respectively. The average time of the first agnostic behavior and average number of agnostic behaviors in proximity to the large, artificial opponent was 52.00 ± 19.61 sec and 2.67 ± 1.24, respectively. Observational data, pertaining to the specific agnostic behaviors of the Betta splendins, varied between the individual Betta splendins as well as the size of the artificial opponent (see “Table 1”). 
An ANOVA test for the average time of the first agnostic behavior between the three artificial opponent sizes yielded a p_value of 0.0990. An ANOVA test for the average number of agnostic behaviors between the three artificial sizes yielded a p_value of 0.3370. 


Discussion:
Based on the results, it can be concluded that the hypothesis was not supported. Evaluating graphical data, the average time of the first agnostic behavior and the average number of agnostic behaviors appeared to support the hypothesis since the average time of the first agnostic behavior was the lowest and average number of agnostic behaviors was largest for the Betta splendins in proximity to the small, artificial opponent. Although the results appeared to follow a trend, the ANOVA tests yielded statistically insignificent p_values which negated the implication. This suggests that varying the size of the artificial opponent has no effect on the initiation and quantity of agnostic behaviors of Betta splendins.
These results oppose current ecological knowledge. Previous studies cite that organisms, including Betta splendins, exhibit more agnostic behaviors in a shorter period when their opponent is posing physically threatening and less dominate [Guiasu: 1997]. However, two notable variations in the data provide plausible explanations to these inconsistencies. First, all the artificial opponents were colored red while one of the Betta splendins was colored blue and the other two Betta splendins were colored red. Previous studies note that Betta splendins display more aggression towards their own kind, in correlation to both species and color [Gelacio: 2019]. Markedly, the blue Betta splenden displayed submission behavior, as opposed to the other Betta splendins, which created an outlier in the data. In fact, the blue Betta splenden showed no agnostic behaviors when in proximity to the medium, artificial opponent. Additionally, due to ethical considerations, the opponents to the Betta splendins were artificial. It is plausible that the Betta splendins were cognizant that their survival was not in jeopardy and, thus, did not expend energy into agnostic behaviors. 
To enhance this research and gain further insight into these discrepancies, Betta splendins should be matched with opponents, ideally biological opponents, with nearly identical physical properties, excluding size. To expand the experiment, a more extensive data analysis on the specific types of agnostic behaviors could be conducted. Although the degree of intensity of agnostic behaviors is difficult to quantify there are a few accepted mechanisms which could aid in this more intensive categorization. Still, this study expands knowledge of agnostic behaviors which is directly correlated to hormone levels; this subject branches into many facets of biochemistry. Additionally, expanded understanding of agnostic behaviors permits improved models for operant and classical conditioning.
