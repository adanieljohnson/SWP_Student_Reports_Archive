Title: Effects of weight of increasing Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
asd.f.ghjkl;

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is a species of insect, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm, that is commonly a pest of the Solanaceae plant family [del Campo and Renwick 1999]. In the early forms of their life, they take the form of a caterpillar and are characterized by having a horn on one end of their bodies, giving them their “hornworm” name. When they grow older into their adult stage, they take the form of a large a heavy moth. The Tobacco Hornworm is found throughout the United States and Central America. It is more heavily concentrated, however, in the South of the US. The Maduca Sexta is a specialist of solanaceous plants, like pepper and tobacco. Plants in the family Solanaceae contain steroidal and triterpenoid glycosides, chemical compounds that play an important role in the biology of Manduca Sexta [Haribal et al. 2006]. The Manduca Sexta is very commonly used as a model organism in labs, mainly because they can feed on artificial food, by putting plant tissue in their diet [Byron 2017] [Gillet-Kaufman 2017]. The insect contains three important hormones: Juvenile hormone, Prothoracicotropic, and Ecdysterone. All hormones help in the development, molting and formation of Pupa into adults. In this study, the effects of the Juvenile hormone (JH) were studied. JH is Manduca Sexta regulates the type of molt during development and regulates functions as an adult. The hypotheses this study looked to prove was adding more Juvenile Hormone (precor) will accelerate the average life cycle and therefore increase the average mass of Manduca Sextas treated with hormone compared to the controll group.

Materials and Method:
Placed eight caterpillars into two different enclosed boxes with 4 divisions in each so every caterpillar would be alone. Ten grams of artificial food was placed in each container so the caterpillars would have food. In half of the cubicles, five drops of distilled water was put in the food (the controll group) and in the other half of the cubicles, five drops of precor were put into the food (the experimental group). Every day for the next two weeks, two students would check on the caterpillars, by cleaning their living areas, weighing the caterpillars daily to record their increase in mass, and adding food if all was consumed by the caterpillars. If there was no food in the containers, meaning the caterpillars had consumes it all, the students would weigh out 10 more grams of artificial food and depending on if it was the controll or experimental group, add either 5 drops of precor, or 5 drops of distilled water. On the final day of the experiment, the final masses of the caterpillars were taken and written down in a lab notebook. Then, taking the averages for all the experimental groups and controll groups, created a line graph (Figure 1) to describe the change of mass of the caterpillars depending on what they received in their food. With the final masses of each caterpillars, the students were able to determine the change in weight comparing the controll and experimental group. 

Results:
Significant results were found between the controll water given group and the experimental JH received group. The controll group got noticeably heavier and bigger faster than the experimental group did. At the end of week 1, the controll group was weight in at an average of 4.13 grams, while the experimental group only had a 2.48-gram average.  However, by the end of the experiment, both the controll and experimental group had relatively similar averages at around 12.5 each (not including the mass of one of the experimental caterpillars that died at around 0.9 grams). However, if we do account for the dead caterpillar, the ending average for the experimental group turns out to be around 9.4. The standard deviation for the controll group was 1.42 grams and the standard deviation of the experimental group was a lot higher at 5.9 grams. After conducting a two sample T test, the P-value found was 0.8 and the t-value was 0.99. Therefore, we failed to reject the null hypothesis which was that hormones would not affect the growth of caterpillars and would not change their differential in mass. That P-value is without recording the outlier (the caterpillar that died). The P-value not including the outlier 0.45, which we still fail to reject the null hypotheses. Figure 1 shows the change in average mass of the blue line (controll group) and the orange line (experimental group). 

Discussion:
It is clear that adding additional Juvenile Hormone (precor) to the Manduca Sexta caterpillars does not increase the development of the insect. Instead, it does the complete opposite, by stunting the growth of the caterpillars. If we do not include the outlier of the caterpillar that died however, at the end of the 14 days, the averages of the caterpillars were almost identical, as shown in Figure 1. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, several scientists looked at the effect of JH in the insect Drosophila, or fruit flies. They study found that the extraction of the Corpus Allata, which results in the absence of JH, resulted in no effect in the weight of the insect [Mirth 2014] [Tang, 2014] [Makohon-Moore, 2014] [Salhader, 2014] [Gokhale, 2014]. This contradicts our findings that the addition of JH may stunt growth. However, providing that our P-value was 0.8 with the outlier and even 0.45 with the outlier, it very well could have been due to a batch of slowly growing caterpillars. One factor that was not accounted for during the experiment was the amount of food consumed by the caterpillars on the daily basis. The bins were routinely cleaned; however, it was not kept accounted for which caterpillars had been defecating the most, and thus eating the most. It is in the range of possibilities that the precor added to the food was not as appetizing to the caterpillars and ate at a slower rate, which could explain the delayed growth. Another possible reason for the appeared stunted growth of the experimental group, could have been due to one of the controll group caterpillars, being overly large. This outlier could have moved the mean up for the controll group, making it seem as though the experimental group had a slower rate of increasing weight. Overall it seems that adding JH to the Manduc Sexta’s diet either has no effect on the growth of the insect, or in fact slows down the rate of growth.
