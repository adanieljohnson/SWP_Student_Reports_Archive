Title: Effect of 20E on Manduca sexta Mass

Abstract:
Manduca sexta do not eat their food when they are administered 20E.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a moth with five larval instar stages before pupation. Indigenous to the United States, Canada, Central America, and the Carribean, Manduca sexta is considered a pest for its tendency to defoliate tobacco, tomato, pepper, and ornamental plants. Accordingly, wild Manduca sexta larvae feed on solanaceous plants and unripe fruit [Byron: 2017]. The molting process in Manduca sexta is largely controlled by two first order hormones: ecdysone (20E) from the prothoracic gland and juvenile hormone (JH) from the corpora allata [Johnson: 2016]. JH is responsible for inhibiting the second order hormone, Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH) that signals the release of 20E, while 20E is responsible for inducing the molt. [Nijhout: 1974] 
In a study isolating the effect of hormone 20E, it is unclear how the progression of growth will be affected when Manduca sexta are administered ecdysone before the prothoracic glands stimulate natural production. In this study a determination of early-cycle ecdysone administration will be tested to gauge whether early and concerted administration of 20E will cause quicker growth in the mass of Manduca sexta than that of the natural hormone secretion timeline. The scope of this study can be generalized to the other insects that regulate molting processes through the secretion of ecdysone [Uryu: 2015]. In this model, the early administration of 20E hormone is expected to induce an the commencement of molting in Manduca sexta. With the molting process initiated earlier than expected, the group hypothesized Manduca sexta is predicted to grow in mass more quickly than their naturally-regulated counterparts. 



Materials and Methods:
Initially the experiment was conducted with eight Manduca sexta obtained from the Wake Forest Department of Biology Lab. These specimens were separated into two divided plastic containers with four chambers each. Each chamber was filled with ten grams of caterpillar food mixed with di-water as to ensure the food retained its moisture for the duration of the experiment. In the first container, four of the Manduca sexta received food with seven drops of Azaguard 20E hormone. The other four specimens received food that had only been mixed with the di-water. The initial experimental design involved the eight Manduca sexta specimens being massed daily for two weeks. However, the group of specimens treated with seven drops of the Azaguard experienced rapid loss of mass and death within one week of the beginning of the experiment. Being deemed inadmissible for comparison with the control group, the initial treatment group data was dismissed from the experiment. 
Four new specimens of Manduca sexta were obtained from the Wake Forest Department of Biology Lab and subjected to a restructured version of the experiment conducted with a reduced three drops of Azaguard 20E. This constituency of the Manduca sexta in the revised treatment group were weighed daily for the remaining seven days of the experimental period. The control group specimens were weighed daily for the full two-week experimental period; however, only the masses of the respective treatment and control groups averaged from the first seven days recorded for both groups were considered admissible for comparison. This data was proven significant (P= 0.049910374) with a one tailed, two sample t-test with excel statistical calculation software.

Results:
This experiment yielded statistically significant differences in averaged masses of the control and treatment group Manduca sexta specimens (P= 0.049910374). As indicated in the figure below, all of the specimens in the control group had significantly higher masses than that of the treatment group. All of the specimens in the treatment group fared little initial growth and began to decline in mass after their initial growth. Although the second group remained alive for the duration of the experiment, this finding is consistent with the initial treatment group administered seven drops of 20E Azaguard where the mass increased slowly before declining. As shown in figure 1 below, the control group grew consistently and acutely, no declines in mass were recorded for the control group during the experiment. By the end of the experiment, the control specimens weighed on average 3.775 grams more than that of the control group. The standard deviation for the control group (=1.315) was also larger than that of the treatment group (=0.3456). Qualitative differences in the appearance of the groups of specimens were also noted. The appearance of the control specimens was a light green, whereas the treatment specimens turned brown over the course of the experiment and appeared more desiccated with a layer of skin that appeared rough. As shown in figure 2 below, the control group consumed a noticeably larger amount of the food provided and produced more defecation than the control group on day seven of the experiment. The control group was extremely responsive to touch consistently throughout the experiment, yet the treatment group was less reactive to being touched during the weighing process.

Discussion:
Significant differences are found between naturally developing specimens of Manduca sexta and those administered 20E earlier than it is hormonally signaled. Therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected. The administration of earlier than natural 20E does not incite growth in Manduca sexta specimens, but rather prevented natural growth in the treatment group specimens. Thus, the biological hypothesis is not supported either because no extraneous growth is observed with the early administration of 20E. The qualitative observations of color change from green to brown and change in the appearance of the texture of the skin suggest the 20E may have induced early cycle molting or pupation the Manduca sexta could not physiologically support in early instar stages. Provided that Manduca sexta uses the relative levels of both JH and 20E to regulate its molting processes, the imbalance in the proportion of 20E could have caused this early-cycle molting [Nijhout: 1974]. However, since ecdysteroids control the other processes such as motorneuron and muscle interfaces, as well as adult differentiation the 20E could have altered either of these pathways to cause lack of growth [Hegstrom: 1998]. Lack of growth of mass in this experiment could also be attributed to the presence of ecdysone preventing larval feeding. In another study conducted on Calliphora vicina larvae, the injection of ecdysone steroid led to decreased feeding of the third larval instar and in high doses ultimately caused larvae to stop feeding. Lack of food consumption also explains the lack of defecation and eventual mass decline observed. 
20E is needed at certain critical periods in the developmental cycle of Manduca sexta, as such, in a future experiment it may be beneficial to isolate the time in the developmental cycle at which the larval instars are treated with 20E to see if different results manifest [Weeks: 20E]. In this experiment, the effect on the beginning stages of the 4th larval instars to see how the administration at this point to see if the results vary from the initial experiment conducted.  Testing whether inhibiting the release of Juvenile Hormone has the same growth stunting effect due to the relative hormonal level regulation process could also be beneficial. In this experiment measuring the levels of hormone present if possible could aid in determination of concrete factors of influence. 
 20E is released in the natural developmental cycle of Manduca sexta at the end of 4th larval instar. Having controlled for confounding variables other than the time of administration in the developmental cycle for the specimens in the experiment, the earlier than natural administration of 20E can be attributed to lack of increase in the mass of Manduca sexta specimens. Although this led to both hypotheses being rejected, this experiment demonstrates the complex interactions hormones have with one another and how the relative level of a hormone can cause severe changes or death.
