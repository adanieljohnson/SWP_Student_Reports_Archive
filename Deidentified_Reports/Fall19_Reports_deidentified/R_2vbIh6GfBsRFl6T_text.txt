Title: Resource Allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum with Excess Phosphorous

Abstract:
	Plants interact with biotic and abiotic resources in the environment, all of which influence their means of survival. Vital resources are limited, however; so they allocate their resources in order to compensate. This study aims to understand how buckwheat allocates its resources via phenotypic behaviors when given excess phosphorous via Bone Meal. Phosphorous is a vital nutrient in plant survival, as it makes other resources available and is crucial for root growth and structure. This experiment called for 16 plots of buckwheat plants, with 10 seeds in each plot. The experimental group was given 20% phosphorous daily, while the control group was given water daily for two weeks. The shoot and root lengths were measured, and root:shoot ratios were calculated. The biological alternate hypothesis was that the buckwheat with excess phosphorous would have longer roots and a larger root:shoot ratio, but this hypothesis was not supported. We found that while phosphorous is crucial in plant survival and growth, too much of it will stunt the growth. However, the results were not statistically significant, so the results were not supported. Studying resource allocation via phenotypic changes in plants explains how they survive in suboptimal conditions. 

Introduction:
In ecological communities, species interact with biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors are those that are living, and abiotic factors are those that come from non-living sources, such as wind and temperature. Plants gather these resources via leaves, stems, and roots, with leaves being the photosynthetic organ, stems capturing light and transporting nutrients, and roots gathering nutrients [Johnson: 2019]. Plants’ vital resources are limited, so when plants don’t have the amount of resources they need, they must allocate their resources. Changes in allocation patterns under varying environmental conditions have been proven to maximize plant growth, and environmental limitations or excess that reduce vital resources available to plants will lead to reduction in resource uptake. Plants engage resource allocation by phenotypic activity, changing their growth patterns over time to appropriately obtain the resources it needs for survival. It is also proven that plants that live in more variable environmental conditions have higher flexibility of allocation [Bazzaz: 1997]. One crucial resource that plants allocate to acquire is phosphorous. Phosphorous plays an important role in plant growth, including root morphology, branching, and development, and the availability of nutrients [Ruan: 2014]. Plants have developed various strategies for obtaining phosphorous from soil, including root surface area and root to shoot ratio [Razaq: 2017]. When plants are starved of phosphorous, their roots will grow (increasing the plant’s root:shoot ratio) to acquire more nutrients, because phosphorous increases nutrient availability. When there is excess phosphorous, the roots will be shorter [Shen: 2011]. Studying resource allocation in Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is easily observable and measurable, as it blossoms in 2-4 weeks, has relatively low nutrient requirements, and phenotypically responds quickly to a changing environment [USDA: 2019]. Therefore, the biological alternate hypothesis was that buckwheat plants given excess phosphate will have shorter roots and therefore a smaller root:shoot ratio than plants given only water.

Materials and Methods:
	To conduct this experiment, we gathered buckwheat plants from the BIO 113 laboratory and planted 16 plots, with 10 seeds in each plot. We planted them all with vermiculite and 1 tablespoon of Miracle Grow. We put all of the plots in a greenhouse with adequate and equal sunlight. Eight of the 16 plots were watered with 100 mL water, and the other eight plots were given 100 mL Bone Meal, containing 20% phosphorous. The plants were watered once a day for two weeks. At the end of two weeks, 16 of the phosphorus plants and 16 of the control plants were harvested by carefully removing them from the plots and rinsing them in water. Once the dirt was off and plants were dried, the roots and shoots were cut (at the same place in each plant) and separated. The root and shoot lengths were measured to the nearest millimeter, and the root:shoot ratio was calculated. The averages and standard deviations were calculated for all measurements. A one-tailed t-test was performed for each set of data, which was also used to determine p-values among the groups. 

Results:
	The buckwheat plants given 20% phosphorous had shorter roots and shoots than those given just water. The mean root length of buckwheat given 20% phosphorous via Bone Marrow was 50.31 mm, while the mean root length of buckwheat given water was 59.63 mm. The mean shoot length of buckwheat given 20% phosphorous was 101.88 mm, while the mean shoot length of buckwheat given water was 120.50 mm. The mean root:shoot ratio in buckwheat given 20% phosphorous was smaller than those given water, at 0.49 and 0.45, respectively. The standard deviation of root length in the experimental group was 12.85 mm, and the standard deviation of the shoot length was 15.29 mm. The standard deviation of root length in the control group was 17.70 mm, and the standard deviation of shoot length was 19.67 mm. The standard deviation of mean root:shoot ratio in the experimental group was 0.14, and in the control group it was 0.22.

Discussion:
	Our hypothesis, which was that buckwheat plants given 20% phosphorous would have longer roots and therefore a longer root:shoot ratio than plants given only water, was not supported. However, the mean ratios are not statistically significant (p = 0.53), so it cannot support our hypothesis. We thought that the buckwheat with excess phosphorous would allocate its resources by growing longer roots to uptake more nutrients, as plants allocate their resources to obtain more phosphate via phenotypic changes such as root growth. However, it was found that plants with excess phosphorous had shorter roots. Plants respond to phosphorous starvation by root branching and elongation, root topsoil foraging, and forming specialized root clusters. When the environment lacks phosphorous, the plant will grow longer roots (therefore increasing its root:shoot ratio) to acquire more nutrients, because phosphorous increases nutrient availability. When there is not enough phosphorous, plant must make up for less nutrient availability by growing its roots. When plants are given excess phosphorous, the opposite will happen – the roots will be shorter. These changes are related to carbohydrate distribution between roots and shoots caused by plant hormones, sugar signaling, and nitric oxide. [Shen: 2011]. These phenotypic changes are seen in our results, as the roots were shorter when given excess phosphorous. Another reason our hypothesis may not be supported is that Bone Meal is meant to be given every four months, not every day. Excessive phosphorous in soil causes plants to uptake other nutrients, such as zinc and iron, poorly [Provin: 2014]. Since we gave buckwheat 20% phosphorous daily for two weeks, the plants had trouble absorbing other nutrients that stunted their growth, leading to smaller roots and shoots as seen in the results. Since phosphorous, an abiotic factor, was tested, it would be interesting to test the effects of limited or excess biotic factors, such as certain bacteria or fungi, on plant resource allocation. Resource allocation is fundamental in plant development and survival, and since all ecosystems are constantly undergoing changes, the way plants allocate resources and change phenotypic behaviors is key in their survival and defense.
