Title: The effect of Magnesium Sulfate on mung bean plant leaf health. 

Abstract:
We initially wanted to test the effect of commercial leaf greener in the form of Magnesium sulfate on mung beans vs a group of beans given normal water every day. We hypothesized that the mung bean plants given the Mg treatment would contain more green leaves and less wilted leaves than those who were given only water. Our data failed to support our hypothesis and in fact those given treatment were less healthy than those of the controll group. We believe this is because our constant magnesium treatment was too excessive and the Mg+ ion interfered with Ca2+ ion uptake. We recommend future studies in this field in order to determine the proper quantities at which fertilizers become negative for plant growth and health. 

Introduction:
In biological species resources available to organisms can affect their growth. In extreme case a lack of one nutrient could be called a deficiency. This could have very significent effects on the health of an organism and could drastically alter the growth and health of an organism. Just as humans need a ‘balanced diet’ so do plants. [Guo, Wanli, et al 2014] They require many different nutrients in order to support proper growth and development. [Guo, Wanli, et al 2014] We are attempting to look at plant growth and health when effected by excess salts such as magnesium. One such salt would be Magnesium. Magnesium is an important element for plants during photosynthesis, as it allows the chlorophyll in the plant to capture sunlight. [Guo, Wanli, et al 2015]  Magnesium is thus an essential element for proper plant growth. Without it plants struggle to maintain appropriate amounts of photosynthesis and their leaves are likely to wilt as a result.[Guo, Wanli, et al 2015] Magnesium Sulphate MgSO4 is commonly sold as a commercial leaf greener for gardeners. It provides a source of Mg+ for plants and keeps their leaves green. It is commonplace in any gardener’s tool kit along with many other fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus, and or potassium. Excess runoff from fertilizers and pesticides is a problem with potential life altering implications. So we wanted to see what would happen if excess MgSO4 was given to a mung bean (Vigna radiata) plant. Due to the relevance that fertilizer runoff has on the agriculture industry and ecosystems around the world we knew that our research would have some significance. Most farmers want their leafy plants to look green and healthy, after all the healthy greens are more likely to sell. and to achieve this they are likely to use MgSO4. So we wanted to test the effect of excess MgSO4 on a viable model organism. We selected mung beans for multiple reasons. They have fast growth which would allow us to easily conduct our experiment over a 2 week time period. Also Mung beans are typically magnesium rich, having more than twice as much magnesium per cup than spinach. We hypothesized that the mung bean plants given the Mg treatment would contain more green leaves and less wilted leaves than those who were given only water. We believe this would be because Mg is important for healthy green leaf color, and those not given any Mg would likely cause a magnesium deficiency and thus not be able to grow healthy leaves.       

Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis we need to have a treatment group and a controll group. These groups would constitute a divided planter with 30 seeds in each group. Then each side was divided into 3 sections with 10 seeds in each section. Both would be grown in a greenhouse for 2 weeks. 
Both groups were grown in vermiculite soil and given 100 grams of miracle grow fertilizer to start off growth. The controll group was then watered everyday around 4pm for 2 weeks. The treatment group was given a 2M solution MgSO4 of equal volume to that given to the controll group. It was given the solution of MgSO4 every day at 4pm for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, the mass average mass of the plants and the number of healthy and wilted leaves were collected from both groups. 


Results:
One observation I noticed during data collection period was the accumulation of excess salt on the plant leaves of the treatment group. Most of the treatment plants appeared to be dead and had little to no growth or healthy leaves.      Our data is summarized below. Our Average controll group wilted leaves/total leaves was 58.9% wilted leaves. And an average mass of 2.21g per plant. Average treatment group wilted leaves/total leaves was 86.7% wilted leaves. And an average mass of .36g per plant     .Our null hypothesis was that the controll wilted/total would be not significently different from the treatment wilted/total ratio. Our alternative hypothesis was that the controll wilted/total would be &gt; the treatment wilted/total ratio.  Using a two tailed t_test for an α = .05 our p= .9573 thus we failed to reject the null hypothesis and we reject the alternative hypothesis for α = .05. This means that the treatment did not result in a significent decrease in the percentage of wilted/total leaves compared to controll group plants. 

Discussion:
We failed to reject our null hypothesis for α = .05 with a p= .9573. Thus there is no significent decrease in wilted leaves/total leaves in the treatment group compared to our controll group. Our proposed alternative hypothesis was rejected and thus we disproved our initial hypothesis with the data we collected. We believed that the extra Magnesium in our treatment would allow the plant to better photosynthesis and thus have fewer wilted leaves. Our Magnesium Sulphate even was named commercial leaf greener and wilt prevention. However we had completely the opposite results. The treatment group leaves were on average far more wilted and less healthy looking, the plants themselves had far less mass and grew less as well. This was a very startling contrast to our initial predictions though we believe the culprit lies in another salt, Calcium. We believe \ our constant magnesium treatment was too excessive and the excess Mg+ ion interfered with Ca2+ ion uptake. Calcium is an essential secondary messenger in cell signaling and in calcium ion channels. For plants it is very important for maintaining cell wall integrity.[WHITE, P. J 2003] In the future a repeat study with less concentrated or less frequent application of the treatment Magnesium would be beneficial to test. Then we could see if the lowered Magnesium ion would positively impact the growth of the plants. This has real world applications because excessive fertilizers and runoffs can have very negative impact on crop growth and could lead to mass famine if said crop were to fail. This is why our data is important and repeat tests should be performed in order to determine how much of these fertilizers is becoming excessive and harmful to plant growth.
