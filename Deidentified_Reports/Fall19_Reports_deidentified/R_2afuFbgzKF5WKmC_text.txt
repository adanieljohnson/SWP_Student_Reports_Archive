Title: Acidity and how low pH Affects the Root:Shoot Ratio in Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plants

Abstract:
The root to shoot ratio in plants can be affected by many different factors, but acidity, or low pH, in the soil can be extreme. In this experiment, the effect of acidity on plant growth of Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is examined. The biological question of the experiment was how low pH affects the root to shoot ratio in Buckwheat plants. It was hypothesized that the experimental group would have a higher root to shoot ratio due to lower available resources such as nitrogen, phosphorous, magnesium, and calcium [Nobili: 1997]. The control group was found to have a smaller root to shoot ratio than the experimental group. Due to the p-value of 0.262, the results are statistically insignificant and the null hypothesis is rejected. The work demonstrates how low pH in soil leads to a smaller root to shoot ratio, as well as provides a scientific opinion into successful crop production.

Introduction:
The root to shoot ratio of a plant can be affected by many different factors. In this experiment, the effect of acidity on the root to shoot ratio of buckwheat seeds is analyzed. It is hypothesized that a low pH in the soil will suppress photosynthesis. Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a pseudocereal that belongs to the Polygonaceae family [Nobili: 1997]. Buckwheat is widely grown as a grain crop, bee pasture, and soil improver. Because buckwheat growth can be detected within one week of watering, they are useful for this experiment. In addition, they also grow in a wide variety of different soils including poor, fertile, peat, sand, clay, and loam, which make them an appropriate choice for experimentation [Nobili: 1997]. Buckwheat is also a highly nutritional seed that has been shown to have a wide range of health benefits attributed to plasma cholesterol level reduction, neuroprotection, and anticancer [Batista: 2015]. It is important for growers to document how these seeds are watered and treated in order to achieve optimal conditions. Significantly enough, buckwheat prefers a pH of 5.0 to 7.0, which sets up the biological question of the lab. We are interested in how acidity, or low pH in the soil, affects the overall root to shoot ratio of the plant based on photosynthesis suppression. In a study performed by Nobili in 1997, Nobili found that a low pH soil leads to decreased amounts of nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and boron, thus limiting the overall nutrients available for the plant to grow [Nobili: 1997]. This could lead to impairments in the whole photosynthetic electron transport chain. In addition, in a study conducted by Hu and Wang in 2019, they found that elevated acidity increased the internal cycling of aluminum in plants but decreased magnesium and calcium fluxes between soils and roots. Without magnesium, chlorophyll cannot capture energy in the form of sunlight from the sun. In addition, without calcium, plants cannot undergo cell elongation and build a solidified cell wall [Hu and Wang: 2019]. One control group is grown with only water. The experimental group is grown with water and acid with a pH of 3.5. It is hypothesized that if buckwheat are given water and acid, then they will have a higher root to shoot ratio than the control group because photosynthesis will be suppressed.

Materials and Methods:
Six different empty plant containers were gathered. Then, three containers were labeled as the experimental group and three containers were labeled as the control group. Soil and miracle grow were poured into each container. Exactly ten buckwheat seeds were placed into each container. All containers were initially watered and then placed in the greenhouse. Stored in the greenhouse, each plant was watered once a day for two weeks. The experimental group was given 200mL water and 50mL 3.5pH acid each. The control group was given 200mL water each. At the end of the data collection period, data was collected and analyzed. The root and shoot length of three plants in each container were measured. The total weight of each of the three plants in each container was also found. The control group were containers 1, 2, and 3. The experimental group were containers 4, 5, and 6. A statistical two sample two tailed t-test was used to analyze the data.


Results:
The average total weight of the control group was 0.26g. The average total weight of the experimental group was 0.15g. The standard deviation for the control group was 0.025 and 0.099 for the experimental group. The root to shoot ratio of the control group was 0.28, and the root to shoot ratio of the experimental group was 0.39. The standard deviation for the control group was 0.117 and 0.14 for the experimental group. The p-value was 0.262 with four degrees of freedom.

Discussion:
The null hypothesis is accepted and the alternate hypothesis is rejected. The p-value of 0.262 implies that the results of the experiment are statistically insignificant. In other words, the data does not show more than 95% certainty to be significant. When a plant is in an acidic environment, photosynthesis ceases because it leads to a decrease in nitrogen, phosphorous, magnesium, and calcium, so they will not grow as much [Hu and Wang: 2019]. In the experiment, the experimental group plants had smaller shoots because they could not grow as much. The acid halted the growth of the shoots since nutrient-providing elements were low in abundance due to a low pH in the soil. More photosynthesis took place in the control group since they grew larger and were heavier. There was one outlier in the experimental group, as shown in container 6. Here, the buckwheat exposed to acid had similar growth to those in the control group which were given no acid. Here, the seeds may not have been exposed to the acid when it was poured. Moreover, these roots in container 6 may have been better at allocating where to move towards when finding optimal growing conditions. In this case, they may have gravitated towards the water. The water and acid may not have mixed completely in the soil. Even though the results proved to be insignificant, the general eye can tell a difference in the data between the two groups. Because of this, future studies should be performed on the affect acid has on photosynthesis as a whole. What parts, if all, of photosynthesis do not function properly? In addition, this experiment allowed for the documentation of photosynthesis, and it is important to see when photosynthesis flourishes and ceases [Wu: 2016]. In another study documented by Trinity Hamilton in 2018, scientists experimented on the photosynthesis activity of cyanobacteria in sulfidic conditions. In this experiment, it was that hydrogen sulfide concentrations as low as one micromole inhibited oxygen production [Hamilton: 2018]. Because oxygen levels were low, the organism has less energy and water for photosynthesis. In the experiment mentioned in the introduction performed by Hu and Wang, they tied these acidic conditions into how acid rain affects crop growth all around the world. Knowing these conditions and understanding how to effectively grow crops and harvest, even in not the most ideal conditions, can lead to greater crop yield and production.
