Title: Effects of Martin’s IGR Juvenile Hormone on the mass of larval stage in Manduca caterpillars

Abstract:
This experiment set out to determine the effect that an addition of a hormone, in this case Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone, to a Manduca caterpillar’s diet would have on the mass of the Manduca caterpillar over the course of two weeks. We predicted that the caterpillars introduced to Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone were expected gain less mass on average than the caterpillars which were introduced to water. The change in growth for the Manduca caterpillars was observed in eight Manduca caterpillars, four of which had Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone added to their ten grams food, whereas the other four Manduca caterpillars had just water added to their ten grams of food. The average change in mass of the caterpillars was taken over the course of two weeks. This average was separately calculated, by taking the final minus the initial mass of each of the Manduca caterpillars with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone and comparing this average to the average change in mass of the four Manduca caterpillars that were only exposed to water. As a result, it was found that the Manduca caterpillars whose food contained Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone had an average mass gain of about 2.7 grams more than the caterpillars whose food contained water. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta (Manduca caterpillars) range in various locations across the United States and typically serve as pests on tobacco and tomatato crops in their larval stage. Due to Manduca caterpillars being so prevalent and pesky in the United States, it’s important to understand their life cycle. Manducas caterpillars go through a number of instars, or stages. These instars are terminated by molting which is promoted by ecdysteroids [Smykal: 2014]. Juvenile hormones are crucial in terms of regulating insect development [Dubrovsky: 2014]. Juvenile hormones help to promote further growth by means of signaling that the molt will produce another larva and as a result, juvenile hormone will cease only when the larvae reach a certain size or stage in which the larvae will be transformed into adults [Smykal: 2014]. Martin’s IGR is a growth regulator. A growth regulator can accelerate or in this case inhibit a physiological regulatory process necessary for the normal development of the insect [Siddall: 2004]. Therefore, Martin’s IGR’s helps to inhibit caterpillar transformation from a larva to a moth in order to act as a pest controll. The purpose of this experiment, therefore, is to observe whether the introduction of Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone would impact caterpillar growth and development since, by doing this, the IGR would inevitably alter the Manduca caterpillars’ developments. This experiment will therefore show whether IGRs in general help to either expedite this Manduca caterpillar growth and development or slow this process. The results could have a widespread impact on the way people such as farmers aim to curtail and controll Manduca caterpillar development. This could potentially lead to the increase in sales of Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone if it does indeed slow development and could serve as an alternative for broadly toxic insecticides which damage crops and are detrimental to the environment. For our hypothesis, our group predicted that the Manduca caterpillars observed with water would have a higher mass on average than the caterpillars exposed with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone after two weeks. 

Materials and Method:
Eight total Manduca caterpillars were split equally into two groups of four. Each of the caterpillars was given a number 1-4 and either the letter C or T, with C standing for controll group, and with T standing for treatment group. Two plastic containers were used, with each container having four separate compartments. One container contained Manduca caterpillars that were designated by the labels 1C, 2C, 3C and 4C. This indicated that there were four different caterpillars in the container, one in each compartment. However, these four caterpillars were all given the designated letter C, showing how all four would be given the controll, which in this case was water. Conversely, the other four caterpillars were given the labels 1T, 2T, 3T, and 4T, meaning that these four caterpillars were given the treatment hormone, which in this case was Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone. A small hole was punctured in each compartment of the eight containers, in order to give each of the eight caterpillars air. After having placed each of the caterpillars in the eight different compartments, they were each given 10 grams of premixed caterpillar food. The caterpillars in the controll group (C) were given 5 drops of water in their food, whereas the caterpillars in the treatment group (T) were given 5 drops of Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone. A lid was placed on both containers and they were stored in an incubator for two weeks. Throughout those two weeks, the caterpillars from both groups were monitored and weighed using an analytical electrical balance lab scale. In addition, if needed, the caterpillars were replenished by being given 10 grams of premixed caterpillar food with the 5 drops of with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone, or water, depending on what group the caterpillars were in. The mass of each caterpillar over this time period was recorded and each’s increase or decrease in mass (in grams) over that time was noted as well. At the end of the two-week interval, the average mass gain of the caterpillars in each group was calculated by taking the final – initial mass of each caterpillar and averaging those masses of the T group and those of the C group. A two-tailed two sample T test was used to note the differences between the average mass gain of the C and the T groups. In this experiment, the independent variable was the introduction of a hormone (Martin’s IGR), the dependent variable was the Manduca caterpillars’ average masses after two weeks, and the controllled variable group was the caterpillars given water. 

Results:
The data in Figure 1 is a two tailed two sample T test and compares the average mass gained after two weeks between the caterpillars given Martin’s IGR and the caterpillars given water. This essentially tells us how big the average Manduca caterpillar given Martin’s IGR vs given water got. Figure 1 indicates that the Manduca caterpillar had a higher average mass when given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone as opposed to having a lower average mass when given water. Manduca caterpillars when given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone gained an average of 13.06 grams whereas the Manduca caterpillars treated with water had an average mass of 10.36 grams in two weeks. The standard deviation for the caterpillar’s given Martin’s IGR was 1.238648457 grams whereas the standard deviation for the caterpillars given water was 6.132701704 grams. This shows how the average mass gained from the four caterpillars in the controll group contained extreme variation whereas the average mass gained from the four caterpillars in the treatment group was pretty consistent among the four caterpillars. The results indicate that in the two weeks there was about a 2.70 gram difference on average between the mass growth between those treated with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormones opposed to water. Therefore, the average mass of the controll (water) group was slightly higher than the treatment (Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone) group (t= 0.748324, d.f.=6, P= 0.482556). 

The data in Figure 2 compares the daily average mass of caterpillars given water against the daily average mass of the caterpillars given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone. Based on this figure, one can determine the rate of the growth of the caterpillars every day. As it turns out, the caterpillars given Martin’s IGR actually weighed less than the caterpillars given water for 13 of the 14 days of the experiment. However, on the last day, the Manduca caterpillars given Martin’s IGR had a massive average increase in mass, whereas the caterpillars given water somehow actually decreased in mass, despite the fact that no other variable changed, and their food was replenished. This was not evident just from pure observation as all of the caterpillars still looked they grew roughly the same amount compared to the previous day. In general, the Manduca caterpillars given water plateaued in mass at roughly around day 10, whereas the Manduca caterpillars given Martin’s IGR slowly increased in mass every day before exponentially increasing in mass on the last day. The standard deviation of the controll group in this figure is 4.25800126 and the standard deviation of the treatment group in this figure is 4.13098849. This indicates that the variation in each of the groups was roughly the same, yet again the controll group in Figure 2, much like Figure 1, has a higher standard deviation, implying more variance. 

By the end of the two weeks, all of the caterpillars got progressively bigger; all of the caterpillars increased in length and in mass. At first the growth was somewhat noticeable, but about half a week into the experiment, one could definitely see the growth occurring and notice a difference between the Manduca caterpillars’ size at the beginning of the experiment, and the Manduca caterpillars throughout the course of the experiment. In addition, the caterpillars that were given the treatment hormone, Martin’s IGR, took on an almost pale green color, whereas the controll caterpillars, the ones which were given water, still displayed a vibrant green-blue color of skin. 


Discussion:
Because the results in Figure 1 indicated that there was a higher average mass when given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone than water (13.06 grams compared to 10.36 grams), our hypothesis was not supported. Our group figured that Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone was supposed to inhibit growth and development of larvae compared to water, making the results of this experiment not only go against our hypothesis, but also go against what one would expect to happen from this experiment. The alternate hypothesis, one our group did not expect to occur, that the caterpillars given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone would have a higher mass on average than the caterpillars given water, was confirmed. There could be a myriad of different reasons as to why this was the case including forgetting to refill food for a day or having transcription errors. This could support the data in Figure 2 as our hypothesis was supported 13 of the 14 days until the very last day where the average mass of the Manduca caterpillars given water inexplicably declined, whereas the mass of the Manduca caterpillars given Martin’s IGR suddenly shot up. Accidentally changing an experimental variable or having some transcription error would be a logical explanation for this phenomenon. Therefore, omitting data from the last day of the experiment would support our hypothesis, that Manduca caterpillars given water would have a higher mass on average than when given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone after a period of about 2 weeks. In particular, 3C of the controll group brought down the average significently as it was nearly 11 grams lighter than the average weight of the other three controll caterpillars. This indicates that this caterpillar acts as an outlier and may not be representative of what the actual average mass should be whether that be from a growth/hormone defect or whatever the case may be. If that one caterpillar were to be excluded from this experiment, the controll caterpillars would actually have a higher mass on average than the caterpillars given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone (13.61 vs. 13.06), thus confirming our hypothesis. Furthermore, repeating this experiment would be extremely beneficial and recommended, as through repeating this experiment, one would be able to see if the average mass of caterpillars given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone caterpillars should truly be more than caterpillars with water in their premixed food, or if the data in our original experiment was skewed due to an extreme outlier. 
	Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone is an insect growth regulator. Growth regulators act as pesticides which don’t usually terminate the insects but serve in the respect of limiting the ability for the insects to grow and mature normally [Pinto: 2012]. Martin’s IGR blocks the insect’s capability to become an adult or can cause it to become an adult, but an adult that is not mature enough to reproduce [Pinto: 2012]. Martin’s IGR, like many juvenile insect growth regulators takes a while to show its effects, as the process of preventing future populations takes many months to really become noticeable [Pinto: 2012]. The effect of Martin’s IGR in the context of the experiment, therefore, should be to prevent the Manduca caterpillars from maturing enough to reproduce. While none of the caterpillars in the experiment did in fact reproduce, the effect of Martin’s IGR was supposed to be noticeable only after a couple months at the minimum. On the other hand, the experiment took place over the duration of two weeks. Therefore, it is hard to conclude if the effects of the experiment correlate to what the effects of caterpillars with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone should be, failure of the Manduca caterpillars to reproduce. One would expect that the caterpillars given Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone would be less in mass on average than the growth of the caterpillars given water, since bigger caterpillars are probably more likely to have matured enough for reproduction. While this proved to contradict our group’s findings and data (Figure 1 and Figure 2) of the experiment, it would be irrational to call the experiment a total failure, as while the results of the experiment did not seem to correlate from what one would expect the effect of Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone to be, there would be no definite way of knowing, unless the experiment were to be conducted for two months, two months being the estimated time to notice and observe the effects of Martin’s IGR’s inhibition of reproduction. Since that was not the case for this experiment, the findings in the experiment should be categorized as inconclusive unless an extra month and a half of further testing were to be conducted, 
It can be said that removing juvenile hormone alone does not induce metamorphosis or growth at any stage of the caterpillars’ lives [Smykal: 2014]. In other words, there are other factors which go into helping caterpillars grow and develop that may have been more present in the caterpillars with Martin’s IGR juvenile hormone than the ones with the water. On a broader level, humans have a great deal of controll over insects like caterpillars and can choose from a variety of ways to try to limit Manduca caterpillar damage to crops. It is important, therefore to understand what a juvenile hormone does and the overall life cycle of insects, this case Manduca caterpillars. Especially for farmers, knowing this information can be vital in combating insects in general in order to find out which growth regulator, such as Martin’s IGR, best prevents them from developing, thus potentially ceasing to destroy crops. In general, being conscientious of the life cycle of insects gives a frame of mind of how insects like the Manduca caterpillar come into being, and what has to go right for their transformation or growth to occur.
