Title: The effect of temperature on Photosystem II function

Abstract:
Photosystem II is a enzyme involved in photosynthesis that is responsible for using light energy to hydrolyze ATP and sending high energy electrons to plastiquinone. Photosystem II (PSII) has a catalytic center that is not fully understood and in a time where scientists predict that global temperatures will continue to rise it is important that we study the affect of temperature on the function of PSII. In order to study this, we used chloroplast from spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea). We ran 4 ‘sections’ of data (chloroplasts in water bath of 25°C and 45°C, in room temperature, and room temperature without chloroplast). Subsequent 2-sample-2-tailed T-tests yielded that each of the samples change in absorbance (PSII function via Hill Reaction) weren’t significantly different from one another including the negative control. This lead us to believe that we had significant error because it is known that there is greater function of PSII of PSII at room temperature compared to PSII function of a sample without PSII in spinach. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a necessary process in plants that enables plants to use light energy to build glucose, which is then broken down in cellular respiration to make energy (ATP, etc.). Photosynthesis can be broken down into two components: light dependent reactions and light independent reactions. The light dependent reactions are a combination of chemical processes that use light energy to produce energy storage molecules, ATP and NADPH. The light independent reactions then use these energy molecules as well as CO2 as well as other molecules to store energy in the form of glucose. Photosystem II, (PSII) is an enzyme that uses light energy to hydrolyze water to H+ and O2 and pass a high energy electron to plastiquinone. This enzymatic activity of PSII is from a catalytic center composed of Mn4CaO5, although how this catalytic center functions is unclear[Young ID: 2016]. Scientists predict that Earth’s average temperature will increase over the ensuing centuries[Collins M: 2013], so it is incredibly important that we understand how the PSII and more specifically MnCaO5 function in response to temperature changes. We hypothesize that increasing temperature will results in higher PSII function. 

Materials and Methods:
We grinded up 3 spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves (without the central vein) in 10 mL of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine Buffer, pH 8) and then another 10mL of grinding buffer and the slury strained through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. To isolate the chloroplast, the slury was centrifuged for 3 min at 1200 rpm and then for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm (only for the non-solid products from the first round of centrifuging). The pellet after the second round of centrifuging will be resuspended using 20mL of grinding buffer. Thirteen solutions were made with nine of them being identical. The nine solutions were made with 6 mL of DI water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5) and 100 micro M of chloroplast prepared previously. Another three solutions were made very similar to the 9 identical with the exception that they did not contain chloroplast. The other solution was composed of 8mL of water and 2 mL of buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Each of the twelve nearly-identical solutions will go in a cuvete which were grouped into the following categories: 3 in 45°C water bath, 3 in a 20°C water bath, 3 at room temperature not in a water bath, and 3 also at room temperature and not in a water bath that will serve as the negative control. The absorbance of each of these solutions will be measured using a spectrometer at 600 nm (zeroed using the blank) at 0 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30min after the solutions were made. The results will be compared using several 2-sample 2-tailed T-tests at a 95% confidence level. 

Results:
According to Figure 1, the percent change in absorbance from the T=0 data point all got closer to zero over time, especially by the 30 minute mark. The standard deviations associated with the T=30 data points were also smaller than the T=10 data points.  Unlike the 25°C, 20°C, and 45°C data points, the percent change in absorbance for the negative control stayed around zero for all three measurements. The 2-sample 2-tailed T-tests had a null hypothesis that that percent change in one sample is equal to the percent change in a second sample. The alternative hypothesis was that the percent change in one sample was not equal to the percent change in a second sample. The first sample and second sample refer to all combinations of the 25°C, 20°C, 45°C data points, and negative control percent change data points with the exceptions that a sample wasn’t compared to itself. The p-values from the 2-sample -2-tailed t-tests between the negative control and 20°C, negative control and 25°C, and negative control and 45 °C were 0.35, 0.16, and 0.48 respectively. The p-values from the 2-sample -2-tailed T-tests between 20°C and 25°C, 20°C and 45°C, and 25°C and 45°C were 0.24, 0.35, and 0.15 respectively. 

Discussion:
The results of the experiment did not support our hypothesis that increasing temperatures would increase PSII activity.  This is because the 2-sample-2-tailed T-tests performed all yielded a result that the samples were not significantly different from each other because the p-values from the t-tests were greater than 0.05.  Since the Hill Reaction allows us to relate absorbance to the activity of PSII[Johnson AD: 2016],  the t-tests therefore tell us that activity of the negative control at the 30 minute mark which didn’t have chloroplasts was not significantly different than any of the samples which contained chloroplast. This leads us to believe that we made an error in performing our experiment because the PSII activity should be greater in systems with PSII at room temperature than without PSII, because it is known that chloroplasts function at room temperature. Previous research has shown that temperature has an effect on enzyme function as well as photosynthesis [Dusenge ME: 2019] also leads me to believe that we had an error in our experiment that affected our results. Future studies should perform this experiment while paying close attention to ensure no experimental error occurs.
