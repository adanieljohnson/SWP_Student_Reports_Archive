Title: Root propagation in nitrogen-supplemented radish plants 

Abstract:
The needs of plants are very specific in nature, similar to those of humans. Amongst them are the requirement for macronutrients such as nitrogen. Nitrogen is responsible for plant growth and root propagation, the focus of the present study. We aim to investigate how the lengths of the roots of Radish plants differ between controll and nitrogen-enriched environments. In the nitrogen-enriched environment we found that plants had shorter root lengths than those in the controll group, showing that with a nutrient rich environment plants do not need to propagate roots as far to absorb the same levels of essential nitrogen as do plants in a controll group. 

Introduction:
Plants are complex organisms that need a combination of many nutrients to survive. Major nutrients include water, sunlight and CO2, but there are many other micronutrients and macronutrients that are just as important. One of these macronutrients, typically found abundantly in soil, is nitrogen. Nitrogen is essential to plant growth and proliferation and it has been shown that in an enriched environment plant growth is increased compared to either a controll or nitrogen-depleted environment [Mackie-Dawson;1995]. However, in our present study we are using the Radish (R. sativus) as a model organism to study specifically how the root of the plant propagates in response to a nitrogen-enriched environment.  

Materials and Method:
A total of six plots were planted for this experiment. Three were designated as the treatment group, nitrogen-enriched, and the other tree were designated at controlls. Each plot was filled with vermiculite and approximately 15 radish seeds were planted evenly throughout each plot. The plants were then watered, and a small amount of fertilizer was added to assist with the initial sprouting period. All six plots were places together in a tray and the tray was brought to a greenhouse. Starting the day after planting, Day 1, the plants were all watered and treated once daily. The controll plants were watered with approx. 200Ml of water, every day, for two weeks. The treatment group also got 200Ml of water daily, but they also received approx. 20Ml of a pre-made nitrate solution per plant, per day. After two weeks all the sprouted plants were carefully removed from their soil. Each plant root was measured from the junction between the roots and the stalks to the end of the longest root. Data was recorded and a two-sample t_test was run to asses statistically significent differences between the groups. 

Results:
The average root length across the entire controll group, who only received daily watering, was 99.22mm. The average across the treatment group was 58.44mm. When run through a two-sample t_test the data was shown to be statistically significent at a 95% confidence level with a p_value of 0.0079. Due to the nature of the experiment we were only able to collect data from the plants that sprouted. The maximum number of plants we collected to be measured from each individual plot was three. However, some plots contained more than three sprouts and some none at all. Based on the raw data it appeared that for most of the individual measurements made the controll group had longer roots. 

Discussion:
Overall the experiment yielded results that agreed with our hypothesis that plants enriched with nitrogen would have shorter roots compared to a controll group given no nitrogen other than the residual amounts found in potting soil. We found that the average root length in the treatment group was statistically shorter than the longer roots found in the controll group. This aligns with the idea that plants propagate their roots in an effort to absorb nutrients over a larger area. These nutrients include elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the two main ingredients in fertilizer. In this experiment in particular we were able to show that, controllling for all other variables, nitrogen did in fact have an effect on root length. However, there were some possibly limitations to our study. First, our statistical tests included some zero values for root length in certain individual plots. This was because some of the nitrogen plots did not sprout any plants at all. If you run the two-sample t_test again, without those zeros, you will find that the difference between the controll and treatment group is not significent. This non-sprouting in some treatment plots could have been due to many things. Likely, it was due to a toxic amount of nitrogen in the soil. This leads into the other possibility for the general experiments results being that the root length is longer in the controll group not because of the need to find nitrogen over a larger area but because there could have been a toxically high amount of nitrogen added to the treatment groups, stunting their growth.
