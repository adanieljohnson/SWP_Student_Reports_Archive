Title: The Effects of The 20E Inhibitor Azaguard on Manduca sexta and Its Ability to Pupate 

Abstract:
This study focuses on the insect Manduca sexta which is part of the order Lepidoptera. These insects have two major growth hormones (Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH)) that controll its lifecycle and molting process to become an adult. During the larval stage these insects are detrimental to certain agricultures, and the use of different growth inhibitors in pesticides is used to controll them. This experiment looks into the use of the 20E inhibitor Azaguard and how effective it may be in stunting growth. It was hypothesized that the introduction of Azaguard would stop M. sexta from entering the pupal stage. A controll group that was given food and water and an experimental group that was given an equal amount of food and Azaguard were used to test this hypothesis over the course of two weeks. The experiment concluded that the inhibitor does in fact stop them from reaching the pupal stage, and in some cases even kills the insect prematurely. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect of the order Lepidoptera whose average life cycle from eggs to adults is about 19-23 days. This is a fairly short lifestyle, but the problem they present to agriculture occurs during the larval stage. The M. sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, tends to be a voracious feeder during its larval stage on crops like tobacco, tomatoes, and potatoes [Byron: 2017]. The lifecycle of the M. sexta is controllled by two main hormones known as Ecdysterone (20E), which controlls the timing of a molt, and Juvenile Hormone (JH), which controlls the type of molt that occurs. These two hormones work together in order to progress the hornworm through each stage of growth [Johnson: 2019]. In order to protect the crops that the hornworms feed on as they move through their lifecycle, pesticides that target these two growth hormones are used to disrupt growth and metamorphosis. The goal of these pesticides is to cause enough disruption to stunt the growth of the hornworms so that they will not grow larger and eat more, as well as stopping them from reproducing. The question that was asked during this lab was how a 20E inhibitor, known as Azaguard, would affect the life cycle of M. sexta. The 20E inhibitor being used in a pesticide works by stopping the M. sexta from moving to later stages of their life cycle. It was hypothesized that the presence of Azaguard in pesticides would prevent M. sexta from entering the pupal stage of development. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment had three separate variables: the independent variable which was the presence of Azaguard, the dependent variable which was the survival and life stage of M. sexta, and the controll group which was the hornworms who were given water and not the 20E inhibitor. The experimental and controll groups each had four hornworms. Each worm was put into a plastic container with holes in it and separated into quadrants. Each quadrant was labeled with a number 1-4 for each group. A total of 8 caterpillars were chosen at random and randoMly assigned to either the controll group or the experimental group. Once the two groups of four have been chosen, each one of the 8 sections was given approximately 10 grams of food that was weighed out on a scale. Once the food was placed into each separate space the Azaguard and water were added. The experimental group was given 5 drops of Azaguard on their food, while the controll group was given 5 drops of water on their food. To keep up with the progress of the two groups, one person from the group went to check on them each day for a period of two weeks while replacing the 10 grams of food and putting the necessary drops of water or Azaguard onto the food. The caterpillars were also weighed each day to record their progress. The feces produced from the caterpillars was also cleaned from each container during this process. The two-tailed t_test was used to determine the significance of the use of growth inhibitors and their effect on weight of the caterpillar. 

Results:
The general trends of the average weights can be seen in Table 1 and Figure 1. The Control group had a steady increase of weight until day 6 and 7 when the weights plateaued. The controll group had a decrease in average weight from 11.3 grams average to 10.5 grams average from day 7 to day 8. The total increase in weight of the controll group was 9.2 grams from day 1 to day 8 with a standard deviation of 4.1. As the controll group moved through the stages of its life cycle, it was observed that they grew larger horn-like structures on their backs as well as becoming larger in width and length. The experimental group had a very slow increase in average weight, and did not have an average weight as large at any point in the experiment. The weight did not drop towards the end, but it only went up 0.02 grams. The average increase in weight of the experimental group from day 1 to day 8 was 1.33 grams with a standard deviation of 0.89. The small amount of growth seen in the experimental group was not significent. A two tailed t test was used to test the significance of the data and came to a p value of 0.0003. 

Discussion:
It can be seen in the data that the Azaguard did in fact have an effect on the growth of the M. sexta. The controll group increased its weight on average by 9.2 grams while the experimental group only increased an average of 1.33 grams. The only discrepancy within the data is the fact that our first experimental group all died, so we were forced to create a new group. This is the reason for the data collection period being skewed toward the controll group. This does not necessarily affect the outcome of the experiment though, as the average weight gains were still very different. It may be further interpreted that since the use of 20E in a pesticide is a viable option due to the fact that it limited growth of the caterpillars and therefore stops them from reaching the reproductive stage. Without being able to grow enough to reach the reproductive stage the population in the affected area would begin to die off.  The M. sexta does become harmful to different types of agriculture in the larval stage so it would seem that an attempt to limit their growth using Azaguard would make the problem worse, but this does not take into account the benefits later on. While the 20E inhibitor may not stop the current population from eating some of the crops on which they feed, it will be effective in controllling the future population [Larry: 2012]. The two-tailed t_test indicates that the data is significent, so we are able to reject the null hypothesis. This rejection means that there is a statistical significance between the use of the 20E inhibitor and the lack of growth of the caterpillars. This further proves the statement that the inhibition of an essential growth hormone will stunt the growth of the hornworm and therefore stop it from completing its lifecycle [Johnson: 2019]. This halting of growth in turn inhibits the juvenile hornworm from reaching a mature stage at which it can reproduce—it will controll the population and decrease the harm done by the insect of crops.
