Title: Agonistic Fixed Action Pattern Behaviors of Betta splendens with Body Shape

Abstract:
Behaviors of organisms are both influenced by their genetics as well as the environment in which they live. More genetically based behaviors are fixed action patterns which are an automatic response to certain stimuli. We are examining the fixed action patterns associated with Betta splendens in terms of their agonistic behaviors. Our hypothesis is that Betta fish will have an equal response time to display any kind of color or body shape that resembles a Betta fish. Our hypothesis was not supported. Our results were significant however with an ANOVA with a p-value of 0.000293. There were no differences in agonistic behaviors between decoy betta and live betta, but there was a difference between the red circle and the other two groups. Therefore Betta fish do demonstrate a fixed action pattern which requires a general fish body shape to generate a high enough threshold to cause agonistic behaviors.


Introduction:
Ethology is the subfield of biology which focuses on examining animal behaviors with the goal of understanding how and why behaviors have been shaped by evolution. Behavior of organisms is influenced by both their predisposed genetics and the environment in which they currently reside. In this experiment we are examining the agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens. Betta splendens as known as as the Siamese fighting fish is native to Cambodia and Thailand where they typically live in rice paddies and stagnant water canals. Overtime bettas have evolved agonistic behaviors which include, but are not limited to tail beating, tail flashing, spreading opercula, and the red mane. Our goal is to determine if bettas respond to agonistic behaviors of other fish or a general body shape. Past studies have shown that the agonistic behaviors of Betta fish did not vary between other live Betta fish and dummy Betta fish [Dzieweczynski: 2010]. Others have also shown the same results when comparing Betta fish agonistic behaviors to robotic Betta fish which moved [Romano: 2017]. Our hypothesis is that Betta fish will have an equal response time to display any kind of color or body shape that resembles a Betta fish. The reason why we believe this is that the agonistic behaviors may be a fixed action pattern which causes bettas to become agonistic when viewing a general body shape including their own reflection. Therefore Betta fish should show agonistic behavior the most to actual fish which make the most realistic body shape, and the least to the red which circle which is the most unrealistic body shape. Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the response time of Betta fish agonistic behavior to the red circle, the dummy betta, and live betta. Our alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in the response time of Betta fish agonistic behavior between the three groups, with live bettas causing the fastest response.


Materials and Methods:
Across each trial there was a constant Betta fish which was exposed to each of the three different experimental conditions. In the first trial the Betta fish was exposed to a circle red and the time was recorded until the Betta fish displayed any kind of agonistic display. The Betta fish then rested for five minutes. In the second trial the Betta fish was exposed to a dummy betta and the time was recorded until the Betta fish displayed any kind of agonistic display. The Betta fish then rested for five minutes. In the third trial the Betta fish was exposed to another Betta fish and the  time was recorded until the Betta fish displayed any kind of agonistic display. The Betta fish then rested for five minutes. It is important to note that the maximum amount of time allowed for the Betta fish to display any kind of agonistic behavior was five minutes. Three other Betta fish were tested in the exact same manner as stated above. The significance of these values were measured by using an ANOVA test with an alpha value of 0.05.


Results:
There was a significant relationship between the red circle and the dummy betta. There was also a significant relationship between the red circle and the live betta. There was not a significant relationship between the dummy betta and the live betta. The ANOVA test results where: (DF: 11, p-value: 0.000293). Our among group variance was 84.57% and our within group variance was 15.43%. It is important to note that we removed and retest an outlier within the red circle group which was original 26 seconds, but after retesting became 300 seconds. Figure one shows the relationship between average response time and each category. The red circle group had a mean of 300 +/- .00 seconds. The decoy betta fish group had a mean of 75 +/- 85.80 seconds. The live betta fish group had a mean of  43 +/- 53.89 seconds. Overall, there was not a noticeable difference between the response time of the decoy betta fish compared to the response time of the live Betta fish. There was however, a noticeable difference between the red circle group and the other two groups.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was rejected, Betta fish do not have an equal response time to display any kind of color or body shape that resembles a Betta fish. The Betta fish may not be responding to color, but instead the body shape. The reason why this would have occured is that agonistic behaviors in Betta fish may still be a fixed action pattern, but the body is not able to be general, but instead must be specific enough to trigger a threshold.. The red circle did not cause agonistic behaviors to occur in Betta fish because the shape is so unrealistic and does resemble a fish and therefore is not about the threshold to lead to the fixed action pattern response. However, the decoy betta fish did produce a response because it is realistic enough to activate and surpass threshold and therefore caused the fixed action pattern response. This corresponds with our among group and within group variances being a large difference and therefore being a large and specific effect size. Hence our studies agree with those conducted in the past with agonistic behaviors of Betta fish not varying between live Betta fish and dummy Betta fish [Dzieweczynski: 2010]. Curiosity about the red circle can also be through out because Betta fish behaviors tend to be motivated by aggression instead of curiosity. In one study live Betta fish caused the most vigorous aggressive displays while other stimuli such as a marble failed to sustain or display any aggressive behavior at all [Bols: 1977]. Some limitations to our study is that we stopped the trial after five minutes in no aggonsitie behaviors had occurred and that we only counted the time until an agonistic behavior had occurred instead of counting the number of agonistic behaviors which could have produced a different result. A future experiment could focus on determining actually where the threshold for activation of the fixed action pattern is in terms of body shape or determining how long it takes for the Betta to become habituated to the decoy Betta fish compared to a live Betta fish. Our experiment can be applied to fish behavior in terms of the pet trade practices. In this case pet stores who sell Betta fish known what kind of enclosures to put them and what kind of fish look similar enough to a betta to trigger an aggressive response. This in turn will help to keep the Betta fish and the other fish safe.

Figure one shows the relationship between average response time and each category. The red circle group had a mean of 300 +/- .00 seconds. The decoy betta fish group had a mean of 75 +/- 85.80 seconds. The live betta fish group had a mean of  43 +/- 53.89 seconds. The sample size for each group was four betta fish which were all exposed to the same conditions in the same order.*************************************************************************
