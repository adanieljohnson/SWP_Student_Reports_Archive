Title: The Effects of Ecdysterone (20E) on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
This experiment strives to explore the effects of the hormone ecdysterone (20E) on Manduca Sexta. It is an insect in the order of lepidoptera--including butterflies and moths. They have a holometabolous life cycle; in other words, the caterpillars with go through four major life stages including a pupa stage where the larvae metamorphosizes into the adult insect. This developmental change is mediated by hormones such as the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone.The passage from one larvae stage to the next and eventually into a pupa requires a process called molting. Developmental hormones have become an interest for research and exploration in the realm of insecticides and E20 is the hormone that regulates the timing of molting and therefore regulates the timing of insect growth and development. Three factors are known to influence the performance of hormones: absolute concentrations, concentration ratio, and developmental stage. [Johnson: 2019]. This experiment attempts to explore the effects E20 inhibitors have on Manduca Sexta. Throughout the developmental stages of the Manduca Sexta all the way up to its metamorphosis into an adult, Ecdysterone should see a steady increase [Bollenbacher: 1981]. This increase of hormone concentration should be the driving factor for growth and pupation. Since it is studied that the concentration of ecdysterone increases with time and growth, it may be beneficial for the purposes of further understanding to test the effects of inhibiting ecdysterone release. 
It can be hypothesized that feeding E20 inhibitors to the Manduca Sexta insects will slow the timing of the molting process during development, resulting in decreased mass gain, and prevent it from pupating at the proper time. 


Materials and Methods:
8 caterpillars were picked out and separated into 2 containers that each have four different compartments. Half of the caterpillars were labeled as the control group and half of the caterpillars were labeled as the experimental group. The plastic containers were hole punched for steady air exchange. Since the goal of the experiment is to investigate the effects of E20 of the growth and development of the insect, the experimental group was given E20 inhibitors--Aza guard. Seven drops of Aza guard was mixed into the food for the experimental group caterpillars; the control group had water mixed with their food. Each of the caterpillars were given 10grams of food to begin with, and more was added during the data recording process when needed. The caterpillars were checked everyday for weight gain, and the food was checked to see if it was still moist. The containers were cleaned when feces built up. Weight gain was checked through weighing the caterpillars individually on a scale. The dependent variable in this experiment would be growth rate, which was measured in weight gain, while the independent variable in this experiment is whether the caterpillars were given hormones. A mean and standard deviation were determined each of the groups, and a t-test was performed to determine the significance of the data collected.


Results:
The mean growth rate of the control group is 0.85325g/day while the mean growth rate for the experimental group is 0.079g/day. The standard deviation for the control group is 0.223, and the standard deviation for the experimental group is 0.047. A t-test was run for the control versus experimental group, and the t-value was 6.79. The p-value for this data set is 0.000498. 


Discussion:
The p-value suggests that we can reject the null hypothesis, and that the difference of growth rate detected in this experiment is significant and not due to chance. The mean growth rate is much higher for the control group than the experimental group, although the control group has more variation. The hypothesis is supported by the results since the group given E20 inhibitors experiences significantly slower growth rates. These effects can be attributed to the lack of Ecdysterone the caterpillars are experiencing. Ecdysterone is the hormone that control growth and molting[Johnson: 2019]; therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a lack of these hormones will cause a decrease in growth rate. The azo guard that was fed to the caterpillars were effectively inhibiting the proper release the E20 hormone, which kept the growth rate of the experimental caterpillars much lower than the control group. These effects are robust and consistent of all the experimental group caterpillars.
