Title: Effect of Fungicide on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
We tested the effects of copper-based fungicide on the activity of Photosystem II in the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea, commonly referred to as spinach. Specifically, we measured the reduction of DCIP in the Hill Reaction, which renders it from blue to colorless. We hypothesized that out of 3 groups (darkness, light, and fungicide in light) that the chloroplasts treated with fungicide would have less photosynthetic activity than the chloroplasts in light, but more than the chloroplasts in darkness, as they were the negative controll. We hypothesized this because copper-based fungicides have been found to reduce photosynthetic activity. We enriched our grounded spinach chloroplasts by spinning in a centrifuge at 200 times the force of gravity, or 1200 rpm in our RT-7 centrifuge. Then, we prepared 12 test tubes with water, 130 mM DCIP, 100 mM phosphate, and fungicide for the 3 experimental tubes. Our last step was a time trial, as we added the enriched chloroplasts to the tubes and monitored their absorbance at 600nm every 10 minutes, up to 30 minutes. Our hypothesis was not proven correct, as our statistical test did not find a significent difference in photosynthetic activity between the chloroplasts in light and the chloroplasts treated with a fungicide. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we will extract and enrich chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea and then use them in a DCIP decolorization assay, which will be our model for redox reactions in Photosystem II. We will then measure the impact that temperatures of high and low extremes have on DCIP reduction. Photosynthesis consists of three processes that work harmoniously to provide energy to the plant. The two light-dependent reactions take place in PSII and PSI, using excited electrons from light to generate NADPH, and by producing a proton gradient, drive ATP synthesis [Shevela:2012]. The light-independent reactions, or Calvin Cycle, use the enzyme Rubisco and ATP and NADPH to combine CO2 with ribulose phosphate to create glucose [Johnson:2016]. We can measure chloroplast activity by measuring the uptake of CO2 and production of oxygen and glucose. However, we prefer to measure the activity of PSII by following the Hill reaction: 2H2O +2A —light—&gt; 2AH2 + O2, where A is an electron acceptor [Shevela:2011]. We will use DCIP to measure its reduction, as it turns colorless when reduced to DCIPH2 [Funkhouser and Balint, 1994]. Specifically, the activity of the chloroplasts in Photosystem II will be observed by measuring the absorbance of our samples at 600nm, which is the wavelength at which DCIP best absorbs light when it has not been reduced [Funkouser and Balint, 1994]. 

Photosynthetic activity has been shown to decrease when treated with pesticides [Ikram and Shoaib, 2018], specifically at Photosystems I and II [Chen, 2007]. This decrease is exacerbated at increasing concentrations of pesticide [Ikram, 2018]. What’s more, copper-based contact fungicides have been found to not only to disrupt photosynthetic activity but also lead to chloroplast destruction and disrupt light-dependent processes in Photosystem II [Petit, 2012]. Our experiment aims to determine and analyze the impact that liquid copper-based contact fungicides have on the activity on Photosystem II. We will have one experimental group of chloroplasts treated with fungicide, two controll groups of chloroplasts incubated in light and darkness, a blank, as well as a negative controll group with no chloroplasts. We will have three replicates of each controll and experimental group. We hypothesize that the chloroplasts in light will have the lowest absorbance at 600nm, or the most PSII activity and that the chloroplasts treated with fungicide will have the highest absorbance, after the negative controll of chloroplasts incubated in darkness. 


Materials and Method:
We had 4 test groups: a group with no chloroplasts, chloroplasts in light, darkness, and treated with a fungicide. We obtained 4 medium-sized spinach leaves, and removed the central vein, then crushed them with a mortar and pestle with pH 8 grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer). After straining the mixture, we spun it at 200 times the force of gravity for 5 minutes at 4oC. We then separated the supernatant from the pellet and transferred it to a chilled 50Ml centrifuge tube. Using a hemacytometer, this sample was found to have the least amount of debris and the highest chloroplast density. We then prepared 12 test tubes with 3 replicates of the reaction mixes, using the enriched chloroplasts. Our assay was conducted using the aforementioned chloroplasts, DCIP, water, 100 mM pH 6.5 phosphate and copper-based fungicide. Our blank was prepared with 8Ml of water and 2Ml of reaction buffer. For the 9 controll tubes, we added 6 Ml water, 2 Ml reaction buffer, and 2 Ml DCIP. Our 3 treatment tubes were prepared with 5 Ml water, 2 Ml DCIP, 2 Ml reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of the fungicide. We then added 100 microliters of the enriched chloroplasts to the controll and experimental tubes and then measured the absorbance at 600nm for all the tubes. The tubes were then placed in the appropriate lighting conditions and had their absorbance measured every 10 minutes for a duration of 30 minutes. The average percent change in absorbance was calculated for each group, which allowed us to determine which treatment resulted in the least Photosystem II activity. The average percent change was then plotted, and then an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test was used to determine if our data was significent. 


Results:
Tukey-Kramer test showed that there was no significance difference in average percent change in absorbance between chloroplasts treated with fungicide and chloroplasts kept in light. However, the Tukey-Kramer test indicated a significent difference between chloroplasts in light and no chloroplasts, as well as chloroplasts in light and chloroplasts in dark. The p_value among groups was 0.024, according to our ANOVA test. Our significance threshold was a p_value of less than 0.05. 


Discussion:
The data did no support our hypothesis that fungicides would negatively affect the activity of Photosystem II. Given our variables, a positive controll in chloroplasts in light, negative controll in chloroplasts in darkness, and an experimental of light, chloroplasts, and fungicide, our statistical tests indicated no significent difference in average percent change in absorbance for chloroplasts treated in light and the chloroplasts treated with a fungicide. However, there was a significent difference in the average percent change in absorbance between chloroplasts in light and chloroplasts, indicting that our chloroplasts functioned normally. This means that the difference in photosynthetic activity caused by the treatment of fungicide was not significent, although there was a strong trend that the chloroplasts in the light had more photosynthetic activity than chloroplasts treated with a fungicide. Additionally, the ANOVA test indicated that the difference in average percent change in absorbance between the chloroplasts in dark and the chloroplasts with fungicide was not significent, meaning that the fungicide allowed as much photosynthesis as the negative controll. As seen in Graph 1, the plots for our negative controll and experimental were very similar. Our findings may suggest that using liquid, copper-based contact fungicides on spinach leaves may negatively impact the activity of Photosystem II, but more extensive research needs to be done. A study that supports this claims that contact fungicides such as copper suppress the electron transport chain of the chloroplasts and affect the efficiency of Photosystem II [Dias, 2012]. This is due to photochemical quenching, a “decrease of fluorescence due to the photochemical charge separation in the reaction centre of PS2” [Buschmann, 1999]. This could be used in future experiments to both increase knowledge of the impact of copper-based fungicides on photosynthesis, but also the manner in which fungicides do so. Another way to further this research would be to investigate the effects of fungicides on Photosystem I. We would have to measure the rate of reduction of NADP+ to NADPH2 in order to measure the activity in PSI.
