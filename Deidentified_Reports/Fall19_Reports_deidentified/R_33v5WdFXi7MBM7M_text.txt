Title: Hormone Regulation Experiment: Inserting Additional Juvenile Hormone Drops into the Manduca Sexta To See Effects on Growth and Development

Abstract:
abstract

Introduction:
This experiment involves the Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm.  This insect of study is mainly found in the US, Central America, and Caribbean and experiences a holometabolous life cycle.  The larvae and adult do not look similar in holometabolous life cycle.  Female tobacco hornworms lay legs on Solanaceae family plants which ranges from pepper to tobacco [Rowland: 2017].    Starting off as eggs, the tobacco hornworms experience five larval phases, referred to as instars, before they pupate and blossom into adult moths.  Aside from their manageable size, the tobacco hornworm is a great insect to study in a lab setting due to their fast life cycle and large larval size.  Each instar phase typically lasts 2-3 days which allows it to be studied in a reasonable time frame.  An obvious fact in the study of life, with growth comes hormones.  The hormones of study in this lab are ecdysterone, referred to as 20E, and juvenile hormone, referred to as JH.  Both of these hormones are necessary to the insect or it will die.  The juvenile hormone is responsible for the type of molting, on the other hand, 20E regulates the timing of molting. [Johnson: 2016].    Speaking of timing, shortly before the fifth larval instar, JH levels are significently high but drop very low and 20E goes through two small rises.  That second rise in 20E and simultaneous drop in JH is called the commitment pulse. This process indicates the hornworms are sufficiently large and have enough stored nutrients to enter the pupa stage and path to become an adult moth.  After assessing and studying the various effects and systems that go into the life cycle of the tobacco hornworm to a moth, we questioned the effects of altering one of the hormone levels.  Specifically, the relationship between JH and growth levels.  Changing one hormone allows us to isolate the effects of one and draw conclusions accordingly.   In our experiment, we hypothesize that if treated with the Juvenile Hormone, the Manduca Sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the controll group of Manduca Sexta that receive no additional JH.  For our experiment, the independent variables included the following: the Juvenile Hormone, dosage level, and time.  The dependent variable is the growth (weight in these conditions) of the tobacco hornworms.  Studying the larval phase of this insect is crucial to scientific advancement because the larval stage is the point of life that they attach to a host plant.  The Manduca Sexta can caused detrimental defoliation in the crops they attach to, and crops are highly significent in today’s society, contributing directly to the vast economy.  Taking away a part of this network will lead to dangerous effects including income loss and unemployment.  

Materials and Method:
Our experiment was conducted in a span of 2 weeks.    In order to eliminate outside sources of the hornworms dying or wilting, we prepared a proper, ventilated container for the 8 tobacco hornworms, four controll and four treatment to live.  All hornworms were equally provided 10 grams of food, replenished frequently to ensure they ate.  The food of the treatment group was soaked in 5 droplets of the JH hormone using a simple applicator, while the controll group was soaked with 5 drops of water to keep the food moist and appealable.  Daily, spanning over a time of 14 days, we weighed, recorded, and managed the hornworms.  A very important element in this experiment was keeping the food moist but not ruining the concentration.  Considering we chose to study a steady rate of drops with no increase, it was important for us to completely change out the food because adding on to it would have altered the JH levels above 5 drops, making our results null.  A smaller stake we kept in mind is the fragility of the caterpillars and the fact that frequent motion puts them in an agitated state which could decrease their diet and food consumption.  Handling each with care will ensure they all receive equal environments to eat and blossom.  Due to the comparison of two groups and our desired results, a statistical, one-tailed T-test was used.  Weighing the caterpillars and adding food was straightforward but it was important to proceed with caution to ensure the caterpillars were not mixed up or treatment wasn’t added to the wrong group.

Results:
For a solid eleven days, the controll group was growing at a much more steady, rapid pace then their treatment peers that were supplied with JH.  In addition to the numbers, the healthiness could be seen much clearer in the controll group.  They were a deep, vibrant blue color and moved extremely well.  The treatment group looked like a rusted, washed out sky blue and appeared to weak to move even when touched.  In the last three days of the experiment, the controll group dropped heavily in weight, losing approximately 1-2 grams per day.  Figure 1 shows the increase in weight, then a significent drop following day 10. The final results left the treatment group weighing more than the controll group.  The change in growth was averaged and calculated daily.  The results ended up reporting the average change in growth of the controll group being 0.577342143, and the treatment group being 1.056901786.  The statistical, one-tailed t test resulted in: t-value – 0.971793, d.f.=26, and a one tailed p_value of 0.170054.

Discussion:
Technically, the hypothesis has been rejected considering the treatment group ended up weighing more than the controll group.  The results complicate the study slightly considering there is evidence to provide reason to the drop-in growth from the controll group.  Although our hypothesis was rejected, if provided more time, could be proven true.  After running our statistical test, the data comes out to be statistically insignificent.  Right before pupation, a tobacco hornworm stops eating and gets restless.  One scholarly experiment names it the “wandering phase” and says, “Development time was determined as the period from hatching to the end of the growth phase, which is the day on which larvae entered the wandering stage … wandering larvae lose weight for several days” [Grunert: 2015].   Another experiment stated, “Following this rapid growth period, larvae enter a pre-pupal phase when they lose weight as they empty the alimentary canal” [Rowland: 2017].  These ideas assist in explaining the drop-in weight from the controll group in the final three days.  Another observation we concluded is the connection between the treatments group surge in weight and the time period it occurred.  The fact that they blew up can be due to the fact that they will be stuck in this phase due to the JH hormone supplement.  “If JH levels are relatively high prior to the molt, the larva will molt to another larva.  If, JH levels drop, the insect will molt from a larva to a pupa … if higher levels of JH are artificially maintained, the insect will not molt to a pupa but remain a larva” [Rowland: 2017].  This notable surge of weight is in fact due to inhibition of development rather than development itself.  If our experiment was extended to the pupation phase and proven true, we could confidently say the controll group developed faster than the treatment group and we could draw different conclusions. In the future, in order to take this experiment to the next step, it is most logical to extend the time period of the experiment to the pupation stage of the Manduca sexta.  After running the statistical test, the results came out to be statistically insignificent meaning they are close together in results and would be likely to happen.  After further analyzation and critical thinking, we now understand why.  This further proves that if we had time to study longer, this loss in weight may be a normal expectation of the hornworms considering they checked off many behaviors of pre-pupation preparation.  Our group went wrong by failing to educate ourselves completely on the full process of the tobacco hornworms.  If we learned more about the processes they undergo, we may have had a more detailed, precise hypothesis.  Assessing the Manduca sexta is important to the environment and the society we live in because larvae phases of the tobacco hornworm feed on various plants in gardens.  When they attach to plant sites, they have the ability to kill the plants they attach to in a matter of days.  It is important for jobs in the area of the crop industry and even home growers to understand the effects of tobacco hornworms on crops.  It is crucial to study these pests to understand how to controll them because they have direct impacts on crops that are necessary to keep societal processes such as consumer-producer exchange.  Although we had a complicated result, after examination, there is a lot to draw away from this experiment.  In addition to the discussion above, it is a positive takeaway that adding this supplement did inhibit the treatment’s group mobility and energy.  They were very slow-moving, in fact, little to none.  When picked up, they appeared to be dead until further observation.  Taking away their energy source means taking away their ability to affect crops, and that is huge to preserve the economy system.
