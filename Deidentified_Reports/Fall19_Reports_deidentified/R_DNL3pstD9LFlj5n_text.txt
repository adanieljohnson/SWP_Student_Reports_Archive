Title: The effect of methoprene on the growth and lifecycle of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This study worked to find how Manduca sexta reacts to the introduction of methoprene into its environment. The chemical was mixed into the caterpillars food to examine how weight and life cycle of the caterpillar changed as compared to the control group which was given food without methoprene mixed in. Using this the goal is to examine how the Juvenile Hormone, which methoprene is a substitute for, effects caterpillars.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a species of moth that is widely available within the Southern United States. The goal of the lab was to use this moth to study the effect of insect hormone on the larvae’s growth and development. The Manduca sexta is a common pest to many crops including the tomato and this data could be later studied by farmers to inspect whether using IGRs is an effective way of reducing pest contamination of crops fields. A chemical substitute for the moth’s juvenile hormone, Methoprene, was used for this expirment. Within the moth’s life cycle, levels of juvenile hormone decrease beginning at the fifth instar stage and continue to be low as the moth becomes ready to molt and pupate. This Methoprene came in the form of the pest control agent Martin’s Insect Growth Regulator, IGR. In order to examine if the life cycle in disrupted by the IGR, the weight of the moths was examined since the moths need to grow in size and weight before molting and moving on to their pupal state. Molting occurs after five larval stages within the Manduca sexta’s life cycle.
 The alternative hypothesis states that, if five drops of IGR per ten grams of food are introduced to Manduca sexta larvae, then there will be a significant lack of weight to the moth’s larvae therefore altering its lifecycle. 
The null hypothesis states that, if five drops of IGR per ten grams of food are introduced to Manduca sexta larvae, then there will not be a significant lack of weight to the moth’s larvae and there for will not disrupt its life cycle.


Materials and Methods:
The experiment begins with the selection of two groups of four moth larvae which are placed within plastic cages. These plastic cages are shallow tubes divided into four sections with two holes poked on the side of each node. Once placed in the cages the larvae will each receive ten grams of food each. For the control group of larvae using a dropper place five drops of water within the food and mix until the food is paste like. For the test group of larvae place five drops of Martin’s IGR, which contains Methoprene and mix until the same constancy as the control group is reached. Check back on the larvae daily and record the weights of each. Provide the larvae with more food as need always adding 5 drops of water or IGR per ten grams of food and mixing thoroughly. Always return larvae to climate-controlled incubator after they are feed and weighed.

Results:
During the 15 days spanning the expirment the caterpillars were weighed regularly, and the growth of these caterpillars was tracked in this method. The caterpillars in both groups grew significantly is mass, however the growth of the caterpillars with Methoprene appeared to be accelerated compared to that to the control group. The test group of the Methoprene grew to an average of 1.59 grams heavier than its control group counterpart. Neither caterpillars showed heavy signs of molting however the caterpillars with the IGR in their food turned a white tint throughout the experiment. The caterpillars also became more lethargic as they grew, this was especially apparent in the control group caterpillars. Despite the increased growth of the test group of caterpillars the Two-Tailed T-Value was .29 which is greater than the value needed to support the alternative hypothesis. Since the T-Value is greater than .05 we can say this experiment did not reject the null hypothesis and did not support the alternative hypothesis. 

Discussion:
	The results of this experiment support the null hypothesis due to a T-Value of .29 which is a large enough value to state that any variation of data was caused by chance. The observations did follow the certain that was searched for in the alternative hypothesis, but not to an extent that it could be stated that the introduction of IGR caused a large gain in weight. Juvenile Hormone tends to slow down in production as caterpillars age and this slowing down of production could be why the experimental group continued to grow at a quick rate while the control groups weight gained slowed. Due to the fact that the hypothesis was not supported, but there was a observable trend matching what was hypothesized, it is reasonable to state that more trials should be performed, perhaps with more IGR added to the food of the test group, to see if there is any change in life-cycle or behavior. Furthermore, if the test had gone on longer, the control group should have entered a pupal stage. Research also has found that when Juvenile Hormone was removed, the pupal stage begins rapidly afterward [NIJHOUT:1974]. Inversely it would seem that introducing more juvenile hormone should delay the beginning of the pupal stage. This pupal stage was not seen in this experiment due to time constraints, again making good conclusions difficult.
