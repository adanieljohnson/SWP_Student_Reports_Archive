Title:  The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta Development: The Inhibition of Adult Structures 

Abstract:

Introduction:
The hornworm, or Manduca sexta, is found in most North American climates [Bio 114:2019]. It’s locality, short life cycle, and pest status, make the manduca a common organism for study. Before pupating, the manduca goes through 5 instar stages and reaches full development in about 40 days [Bio 114:2019]. A hormone particularly essential to larva development, is the Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH is produced in the corpus allatum and tells the body to make another juvenile stage, or instar [Sadava:2017]. By doing so, JH prevents the larva from developing adult structures until the proper weight/size is achieved. At each instar, the larva goes through molting. Molting is the secretion of a new skin cell layer, or cuticle. Molting allows for the larva to grow in size and begin building adult structures. By the 5th instar, the larva often has structures for wings, compound eyes, and a sucking rather than chewing mouthparts. At this point, the larva is large enough for pupating and the JH levels, which remain high throughout adolescence, drop significantly. But what if the larvae were to receive a continuous dose of excess JH and the drop in hormone never occurred? By treating a group of manduca with excess JH, the effects of the hormone on larvae development will be better understood. 
Hypothesis: If excess JH is added to the food of manduca larvae, then the larvae will grow faster, but adult structures will be inhibited from forming. 


Materials and Methods:
 The larvae were chosen at approximately the same weight to insure proper growth analysis over time. All larvae started at roughly 0.1g. The weight of the larvae combined with qualitative analysis of larvae appearance determined the initial stage of the larvae to be approximately the 3rd instar. The larvae were then split into two separate groups: treatment and control. Each group had four larvae. Larvae labelled 1-4 were assigned to the treatment group and larvae labelled 5-8 (and 9-12) were assigned to the control group. The control group received 10g of manduca food with 10 drops of deionized water mixed in. The treatment group received 10g of manduca food with 10 drops JH mixed in. The two groups were kept in identical conditions: clear plastic containers with four chambers each, and one larvae per chamber. Over the span of four weeks, the larvae were weighed daily and food was replaced as necessary (if dry or heavily eaten). While not being observed, the containers holding the caterpillars were kept in an incubator. Photos of the larvae were taken at the beginning of the experiment as well as the end for qualitative analysis. If significant deaths occurred during the experiment, an additional control and/or treatment group was made. In this case, the new caterpillars were chosen based on similarity in weight to the existing caterpillars of that group. A two-sample t-test was then performed to determine if differences found between the treatment and control group were significant. 


Results:
In table 1, the total weight gained after four weeks for each caterpillar is listed. After four weeks, caterpillars 3-7 were deceased, leaving only two caterpillars in the treatment group and five caterpillars in the control groups. Caterpillar 1 had an overall weight gain of 14.19g, while caterpillar 2 had an overall weight gain of .46g. Therefore, caterpillar 1 and 2 differered in total growth by 13.73g. Caterpillars 8-12 were similar in total weight gain, with the exception of caterpillar 8 (14.30g). Figure 1 shows the average total growth for treatment and control groups. The treatment group had an average of 7.325g and the control group had an average 8.586. The standard deviation (SD) for the treatment group is 9.71 and for the control group is 3.54. Using the two-sample t-test, the t-value was determined to be .28. This implies the two groups are not significantly different from one another. 


Discussion:
Due to the fact that the two groups were not found to be statistically different from one another, the null hypothesis is supported. During the study, several members of both groups died and therefore were taken out of study. With little data from the treatment group, it is hard to determine internal trends. It is unsure why caterpillar 1 and 2 differed so greatly in total growth, but it may be due to physiological differences in the caterpillars. The control group was relatively close to the mean, with the exception of caterpillar 8. Caterpillar 8 acts as an outlier in this case. Although the results of this experiment do not show a significant difference between manduca treated with JH and manduca in a control, a similar study has. A 1978 study showed inhibition of adult structures with the addition of only .001-.01 μg/animal JH 1 during the 4th instar [Kiguchi:1978]. It is essential to rerun the experiment with larger treatment and control groups to account for possible larvae death. In doing so, we will be able to investigate the effect of JH on manduca larvae more accurately.
