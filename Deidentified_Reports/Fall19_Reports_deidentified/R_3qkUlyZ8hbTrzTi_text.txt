Title: The effect of excess water on Vigna radiata root to shoot ratios 

Abstract:
Using a Mung bean model, we tested the effect of excess water on the root and shoot growth of the plants. Using root to shoot ratios of both length and weight, we predicted that plants with excess watering would have smaller root to shoot ratios due to the fact the roots would not have to grow long to find water. In normal resource allocation in plants, the resources are given to the part of the plant that must compete the most for resources. If a plant has little access to water, like in the desert, they usually grow deep roots in order to find a consistent water source and still have small shoot lengths. Using this idea, plants with the opposite issue would be able to allocate resources to their shoots since water is not scarce. Our results were not conclusive with the root to shoot ratios for weight and for length being different and not statistically significent. The weight supported our hypothesis but the length showed a smaller ratio for the controll. This was attributed to varying factors including the usual growing patterns of mung beans. Moving forward, studies like this can be used to combat crop failure due to climate change. 


Introduction:
In living organisms, the allocation of resources is key in their long term survival and for reproductive success. In plants specifically, resource allocation is split between a few different areas: roots, shoots, leaves, and the reproductive seeds. The end point of nutrients and growth is dependent upon the plants life stage and their resources in the environment in which they live. So for example, if a plant was growing in an environment where sunlight was not abundant, then more resources would be allocated to the shoots and leaves in order to obtain the most sunlight possible and photosynthesize sufficiently, while less resources would go to the roots [McConnaughay and Coleman, 1999]. Another important resource that plants compete for depending on the environment is access to water. Some plants have evolved unique mechanisms to survive extreme water environments, whether that be drought or excess water. In desert environments, the common shrubbery or grass species have root systems that allow them to maximize their water uptake. They have some very deep roots, many with roots up to five meters long, and also have upward growing roots that are short. This adaptation allows them to easily access small amounts of rainfall with the upward roots, and have easy access to the deep water reserves with their long roots [Gibbens and Lenz, 2001]. Just as in an environment with less sun, one with less water shifts resources to the area that is competing most for resources. These resource allocations can be calculated and visualized easily by using ratios in length and mass of differing parts of the plant being measured. A common measurement is that of roots versus shoots, or a root to shoot ratio. Using this measurement one can determine whether the roots or the shoots are obtaining more nutrients as well as growing more [Johnson and Mallison, 2016]. In desert plants where the search for water is needed, the root to shoot ratio is large with the roots being much longer than the shoots. Based on this information, we hypothesized that a plant with excess water access would allocate more resources to the shoots and have smaller roots, resulting in a smaller root to shoot ratio for both weight and length. In order to test this, we used two sets of 3 plants in each, one with adequate but not excess water (100Ml) as our controll, and another that received excess water (300 Ml) as our experimental variable. The plants used were Mung beans (Vigna radiata), which are a common heat and drought tolerant legumes [Delate, 2013]. 


Materials and Method:
Firstly, we potted each of the six containers with 10 mung bean seeds per container to ensure enough grow to be measured. They were each potted in identical soil that way only water was the difference between the two groups. Next, they were all thoroughly watered so that each container was saturated. Each group was labeled and placed in the greenhouse with equal access to sunlight. Each day for the next two weeks, the controll group was watered with 100 Ml of water, and the experimental with 300 Ml of water. The 300 Ml group also had plastic containers placed under them in order to make sure that the excess water did not simply run off. After two weeks of watering, the plants were carefully pulled from the soil, one sample per container so three plants per group. Each plant was washed so that excess soil was not present in the sample and did not affect that weight. After washing they were dried so this water did not affect that weight either. Each plant was cut in half at the intersection of the roots and shoots. The roots and shoots were each weighed separately and then measured. In our measurements of the length of shoots, the leaves were measured as well. With this data, the root to shoot value was calculated, as well as the means and standard deviations are the weights, lengths and root to shoot values of each group. After the measurements were complete two, two sample T test were run to determine the significance of the data. 


Results:
Our results show that the amount of water had different effects on the length and the weight depending on the group. In Figure 1, the root to shoot ratios for each groups’ length and weight is shown. The weight ratios showed that the excess water group had a mean root to shoot ratio that was smaller than that of the controll, meaning that the roots were typically lighter than the shoots, and then opposite being true in the controll group. However, the opposite was shown by the length ratios, with the excess water group having longer roots than shoots in comparison to the controll group. The standard deviations were also much larger in the excess water group than in the controll. The two sample T test between the controll and excess water group for weight resulted in a p value of 0.17. The T test between the groups for length resulted in a p value of 0.53. 



Discussion:
Our data trends are not as we expected overall. The weight root to shoot ratio supports our hypothesis but the length does not. Since the two ratios are conflicting it makes the interpretation less clear. In addition, neither one of the data points are statistically significent so there cannot be any concrete evidence drawn from this data. The data suggests that the roots of the excess water group were lighter than the shoots, and that the opposite was true of the controll group. This would support our hypothesis that less biomass/resources would be allocated to the roots due to the ease of obtaining water, with more of the plants weight being located in the shoots. The length however, contradicts our hypothesis. The roots were on average longer in the excess water group than in the controll, and the root to shoot ratio was larger in the experimental group as well. That means that while there was less weight in the roots of the experimental group, they were still longer than the controll, opposite of what we hypothesized would happen. This difference can be attributed to a few different aspects. A simple explanation is that the sample size was too small to adequately determine the differences between the groups. The time given for growth could also be too small to see the real difference between water amounts. In addition, while determining a controll amount of water there was not much research backing it, so the amount of water given as a controll might have been too little and the excess not excessive enough to have great impacts. In previous research, issues had arisen based of root growth stunted by the soil depth. In the experiment regardless of water amounts, the roots did not grow as expected due to the differences of soil depth given by the container [Zhang et al, 2019]. This study also found differences in how roots develop depending on whether the plant is a shallow or deep rooted plant. Mung beans are deep rooted plants, so this could explain why regardless of easy access to water they still grew long roots, and since there was not a statistical difference between the root lengths of the controll and the experimental groups the lengths they grew could simply be a norm of the species [Delate, 2013]. Going forward, to improve results a longer period of time under these water conditions, with greater samples to be measured in the end could result in a better understanding of the effects of excess water. This research is also relevant in an understanding of the effects of varying water amounts on plants especially due to the effects of climate change that have resulted in droughts and changing climates across the world. The reality of changing climates effects on plants is that of the increasing food shortages worldwide, caused by crop failure. Within the top ten worldwide crops there has been a negative decline in production which can lead to food scarcity directly affecting people’s livelihood [Ray et al, 2019]. If a there is greater understanding of how varying water amounts affect plant growth, there could be improved method to combat climate change caused food scarcity.
