Title: Effects of Acidic pH Concentration on Raphanus sativus Growth

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to investigate how pH concentration affects resource allocation in Raphanus sativus. Two experimental groups were used in the study, one with 5 Ml acid added to radish plants and the other 10 Ml acid added daily. Plants were grown for 14 days under these conditions, then removed from plant boxes and lengths of roots and shoots were measured. A one-way anova test was used to analyze data, and results showed a significent increase in root:shoot ratio in the 10 Ml acid experimental group. The results of the experiment demonstrate that plants grown under certain concentrations of acid (10 Ml and above) allocate resources to their roots, where their resources are the most deficient. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation, which describes the ways in which a plant can distribute and use limited resources, plays a major role in how plants adapt to selective forces. While much of resource allocation is genetically fixed, plants have a limited ability to change their resource allocation under different environmental conditions [Johnson: 2019]. The aim of this study was to determine how resource allocation in Raphanus sativus (common name radish) is affected by pH concentration. Particularly, this experiment focused on characterizing changes in root length, shoot length, and root:shoot ratio in three separate groups (controll, 5Ml pH 3 acid, and 10 Ml pH 3 acid). Previous studies assessing pH effects on Raphanus sativus growth showed evidence of resource allocation at pH 5.5, thus pH 3 was likely acidic enough to induce resource allocation [Bernal: 1994] [McGrath: 1994]. It was hypothesized that higher concentrations of acid decrease root:shoot ratios in Raphanus sativus, because plants will increase resource allocation to shoots in order to compensate for lack of healthy soil conditions. Radish plants were grown under varying pH conditions for two weeks, extracted from soil, and measured to obtain data on root length, shoot length, and root:shoot ratio. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment included three test groups—one controll, and two experimental. Each test group had an N of three, for a total of 9 plants between the three test groups. One radish seed was placed in each plant box, using Vermiculite as soil. 100 Ml of miracle growth was added to each plant box. Groups were placed in the greenhouse and were watered daily until Vermiculite was thoroughly soaked and water leaked out of the plant box. Along with watering, 5Ml of 3.0 pH water was added to one experimental group and 10 Ml of 3.0 pH water was added to the other. After 14 days of treatment, plants were removed from the greenhouse. The radish plants were extracted from Vermiculite, with emphasis placed on keeping both their roots and stems intact. After spraying the plants with water to remove particles, the stems and roots of each plant were measured using a ruler and compared to find a root:shoot ratio. A one-way anova test was used to determine whether there was a statistically significent difference between the means of test groups.    

Results:
A one-way anova test was used to compare variation in root:shoot ratio between three groups (controll, 5 Ml and 10 Ml). There was a significent difference (P=0.0025) between means of the three test groups, although the Tukey-Kramer test revealed that significent differences occurred between controll and 10Ml groups and the 5Ml and 10 Ml groups, but not between controll and 5 Ml groups. As seen in Figures 1 and 2, Raphanus sativus under more acidic conditions have significently higher root lengths compared to shoot lengths than both the controll and 5 Ml groups. However, 5 Ml acid is likely not enough to induce this effect, as the data seen in the 5 Ml group is not significently different from the controll.  

Discussion:
Data revealed an effect opposite to what was hypothesized. Figures 1 and 2 show that Raphanus sativus under more acidic conditions did not allocate more resources to shoots, but instead allocated them to roots. However, upon further consultation of external sources, it was revealed that plants should allocate more resources to the area in which they are experiencing the most limitations (i.e. their soil was limited due to acidic conditions, thus their resources should be allocated to roots) [Weiner: 2004]. This aspect of resource allocation in plants might be responsible for the results seen in this experiment; radish plants grown under most acidic conditions demonstrated greater resource allocation to roots compared to controll and 5 Ml acid groups. A limitation of this experiment is that plants were grown only for two weeks. This experiment should be repeated over a longer period of time to both ensure accuracy of results as well as to let plants grow to full-size. Additionally, an N of three for each group is relatively low, so experiment repeats should include an N of 6, at least. A confounding variable could have arisen from plants receiving different volumes of water daily. The amount of water plants received daily as well as between one another was not consistent, and this could have affected data accuracy.
