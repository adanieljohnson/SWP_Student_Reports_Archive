Title: Effects of Humidity on Root:Shoot Length and Mass in Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus (Radishes)

Abstract:
In response to environmental stressors, plants have the ability to alter their resource allocation. Plant’s energy allocation and metabolic resources vary among their leaves, stems and roots in such a way that it changes the growth pattern overtime to fit the environmental need. Measuring the root to shoot ratio is an effective method to determine how environmental factors affect a plants growth. Radishes are an excellent specimen in which  to study the effects of humidity on plant allocation. It is hypothesized that radish plants raised in a humid environment will have a smaller root to shoot length and mass ratio than radishes raised in a temperate environment. However, root to shoot length and mass were not significantly different between control and experimental groups. This may be due to the fact that the humidity was too high and caused the growth of fungi that were detrimental to plant health and growth; therefore, inhibited plant growth. As such, this gave an incomplete picture of what the  root to shoot ratios may have been had they been able to sufficiently grow.


Introduction:
In any given environment biotic and abiotic factors affect a plant’s growth, ability to capture energy, and to reproduce.  However, plants require three essential resources to grow and survive: sunlight, water, and soil nutrients. In response to environmental stressors, such as limitations in these essential resources, plants have the ability to alter their resource allocation. They will expend more energy for one thing while reducing resources for another. Plant’s energy allocation and metabolic resources vary among their leaves, stems and roots in such a way that it changes the growth pattern overtime to fit the environmental need. Measuring the root to shoot ratio is an effective method to determine how environmental factors affect a plants growth. Humidity is an example of one of these abiotic factors that may have an effect on root to shoot ratio. A study done with soybeans found that higher humidity levels resulted in increased plant height [Roriz : 2014]. Radishes are an excellent specimen in which  to study the effects of humidity on plant allocation. Their small size and quick, easy germination and growth period make them very suitable specimens for the lab [Science & Plants for Schools: 2019]. Radishes are a food eaten all throughout the world; therefore, with the increasing effects of global warming it is essential to know how this pervasive food group will react to these rising humid conditions. In a humid environment the soil moisture is higher than in a temperate environment. As such, with plenty of water available plants will not have to extend their roots deeper down to find water and will be able to allocate their energy to growing taller. Therefore, it is hypothesized that radish plants raised in a humid environment will have a smaller root to shoot length and mass ratio than radishes raised in a temperate environment.

Materials and Methods:
The materials needed for this lab were radish seeds, 6 plant pots, 2 tanks with lids, 3 weigh boats and plant soil. All 6 pots were filled with plant soil and then 12 radish seeds were planted in each pot. All pots were thoroughly watered. The two tanks were filled 1” with water. Two weigh boats were placed upside down in one tank and one weigh boat was placed upside down in the second tank. A pot was placed on top of each upside down weigh boat (2 pots in one tank and one pot in the second tank). The lids were placed back on the tanks and taped shut. This set-up functioned to replicate a high humidity environment. The remaining three pots were placed on an open tray. This set-up functioned as the control. All pots were placed in a greenhouse and watered once a day, everyday for two weeks. After two weeks the plants were measured. Six of the plants from the control were harvested. The vermiculite that help the roots together was separated and the plants were washed in a container of water and then patted dry using a paper towel. Each plant was weighed and their respective masses were recorded. The roots of each plant were then separated from the shoots by cutting each plant at the root-shoot junction. The shoots of each plant were then weighed and their respective masses were recorded.  The root mass of each plant was calculated by subtracting the shoot mass from the total plant mass. The root to shoot mass ratio was calculated for each plant. The maximum shoot and root length of each plant was measured and recorded. Then the root to shoot length ratio of each plant was calculated. This same process was then repeated using 4 plants from the experimental (humidity) group. The averages and standard deviations of all of the measurements were then taken. A one tailed t-test was used to compare the data. Lastly, a bar graph of root to shoot mass and length ratios for the control and experimental groups was created [Johnson:2019].  


Results:
The experimental plants did not grow as well as the control plants. In the control group all three pots had plant growth with an average of at least three plants per pot. In the experimental group, only a total of four plants grew. Three of these plants grew in the tank in which there was only one pot. In the tank in which there were two pots only one plant grew in one of the pots. In the other pot in this tank there was mold growth on the surface of the dirt.  On average the control plants were larger than the experimental plants (1.04 grams vs 0.308 grams respectively) as seen in Figure 1. The p-value for this comparison was 0.005857. As such, the control group had larger root to shoot mass  ratio (Figure 2) as well as larger root to shoot length ratio on average (Figure 3) with p-values of 0.062378 and 0.202449 respectively. 

Discussion:
This experiment does not support the hypothesis that high humidity will decrease root to shoot length or mass ratio. The p-value for root to shoot length was 0.202449 which is not less than the critical p-value of 0.05; therefore, the difference between the experimental and control root to shoot ratios are not significant. The p-value for the root to shoot mass was not less than the critical p-value of 0.05; therefore, the difference between the experimental and control root to shoot ratios are not significant. The overall smaller plant size of the experimental plants could be due to inadequate growing conditions. A study done on the effects of humidity on plant growth found that restricted air exchange and high humidity encourage plant diseases and fungal growth [Hand:1988]. Given that the experimental group was in an air restricted container with high humidity this would have created the perfect environment for diseases to grow. This in turn could cause root rot, and without roots deliver nutrients to the plants, the shoots cannot grow [Polygon: 2019]. As such, these diseases may have halted plant growth thus resulting in an incomplete picture of what the  root to shoot ratios may have been had they been able to sufficiently grow. However, prior studies have also rejected the hypothesis that humidity will decrease root to shoot length and mass ratio. One study on native grasslands in China found that “root-to-shoot ratio were unrelated to the level of soil moisture,” which correlates to humidity [Deng: 2019]. Based off of this experiment even though high humidity was not shown to affect root to shoot ratio, it did drastically reduce plant size and abundance. With the effects of global warming worsening by the day, this could drastically reduce food supply in the near future.
