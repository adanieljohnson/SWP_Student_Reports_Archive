Title: Manduca Sexta Caterpillar Growth Inhibition by the Juvenile Hormone

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
In laboratory experiments, insects are a perfect model for analyzing the endocrine system, specifically how the role of hormones affect growth and development [Rowland: 2017]. There are multiple hormones that affect the “molting,” development, of insects. The steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) “is the initiator hormone of the molting process” [Petryk: 2003]. This hormone, regulated by the Prothoracicotropic hormone, PTTH, affects the timing of molting [Riddiford: 2003].  Another hormone, called the juvenile hormone (JH) affects the type of molting during the critical periods of each life cycle of an insect [Nijhout: 1982]. The juvenile hormone is present during the whole development of the larva and progresses from one stage to another until it reaches its proper weight [Rowland: 2017]. The Manduca Sexta, known as the tobacco hornworm, is a common pest, which feeds on solanaceous plants, and is affected by these molting, inducing hormones [Hussa: 2012]. The Manduca Sexta has five, larval instar stages, and both 20E and the JH occur during each of these stages, collaborating to control their growth, molting, and metamorphosis [Gillet: 2019]. In the early instar stages, the JH prevents the caterpillars “actions in switching genetic programs necessary for metamorphosis,” inhibiting the full effect of the PTTH and 20E [Riddiford: 2012]. However, in the last larval instar stage, the juvenile hormone declines, allowing the 20E to cause pupal commitment [Johnson: 2016]. My colleagues and I wanted to understand what the impact of the juvenile hormone is on the growth, in mass, of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars. In this experiment, my group and I will be applying an insecticide called Precor. It contains a juvenile hormone analogue called “Methoprene.” “Methoprene” is an insect growth regulator, and it can interfere with insect growth and development, such as preventing molting from an immature phase to an adult phase [Wick: 2012].  Based on the known evidence of the juvenile hormone, we hypothesize that if the Manduca Sexta caterpillars are treated with Precor, then their growth, measured in mass, will be less than the growth of caterpillars that aren’t treated with juvenile hormones. 

Materials and Methods:
To test the hypothesis, two groups of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars were used. Each group had four caterpillars, assigned to their own, similar environment (plastic containers) with food and air holes. One group was used for the control group, and they were not given any treatment amount of the juvenile hormone added to their food; five drops of water was only added to their food. The other group had five drops of the insecticide Precor added to their food every time it needs to be replenished. Every day, for two weeks, the caterpillars were monitored. They were weighed by a machine (in grams) to measure their progression of growth. Observations were also taken on the visual progression as time passes. A statistical paired t-test was used to compare the growth of caterpillars that didn’t receive juvenile hormone treatment as well as those that did receive juvenile hormone treatment. A p-value of 0.5 was used to see if the results were significant. 

Results:
From observational data, the experimental group that received the five drops of the Precor juvenile hormone appeared lighter in color with a whitish tint (Figure 1), whereas the other group was more of a vibrant green (Figure 2). However, the development of both the control and the experimental group were very consistent when it came to mass in grams. Figure 3 shows the average mass gained of both the control and experimental group across 14 days. The control group gained an average mass of 12.22 grams, whereas the juvenile hormone had an average mass of 13.06 grams (t-stat=0.668, df=3, P=0.552). The juvenile hormone group had the greater growth in mass compared to the control group (Figure 4).

Discussion:
From our paired t-test, my group and I got a p-value that shows are results are not significant. We would reject the null hypothesis based on these findings. The null hypothesis states that if the Manduca Sexta caterpillars are treated with Precor, an insecticide that contains the juvenile hormone analog “Methoprene,” then their mass in grams will be less than the growth of caterpillars with no treatment. Our results showed that the control group average weight was smaller in mass compared to the juvenile hormone treatment group. In theory, the juvenile hormone causes the Manduca Sexta to be smaller in weight, because they inhibit the insect’s molting phase from developing any further [Riddiford: 2012]. From our observational data, we noticed that the experimental group of the Manduca Sexta was paler in color and did not have the defined markings on the abdomen compared to the control group. These effects are due to the juvenile hormone analog “Methoprene” [Whitmore: 1972]. It affects the hemolymph in insects, which is circulating liquid or blood, and by decreasing the flow of these nutrients and hormones throughout the caterpillar’s body, it gives them a paler appearance [Kanost: 2009]. Though the observational data shows that the juvenile hormone is present and effective, the juvenile hormone did not affect the mass in grams of the Manduca Sexta. In multiple studies, the results show that JH affects the growth and final body size, which is “mediated by ecdysone synthesis in the prothoracic gland [Mirth: 2014]. From research and our understanding, our results should’ve been significant; however, with further research, we could extend this experiment’s duration of time as well as using more of the Precor juvenile hormone to find if our hypothesis is significant.
