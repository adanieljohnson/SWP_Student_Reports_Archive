Title: Overwatering Does Not Affect Resource Allocation in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
All organisms are constantly interacting with their surrounding environment whether it be with abiotic or biotic factors. For plants, abiotic factors are particularly important for young seedling plants to adapt to because they cannot move environments. The way that they allocate their resources, depending on the abundance or lack of certain resources, is critical to their survival and fitness. Using V. radiata plants and a mean measurement of root and shoot length and width, we expected V. radiata that are overwatered should have a lower R:S value. Our resulting data showed no statistically difference between them. Though the controll plants seemed to be healthier. This research can be important to help farmers save money on watering their crops and by minimizing excess water and water runoff stopping artificial fertilizer from entering watersheds. 

Introduction:
For immobile organisms, such as Vigna radiata, or the common Mung Bean, a plant commonly cultivated in East Asia, the ability to adapt to abiotic factors such as temperature, sunlight, and soil composition, is critically important for its long-term success [Johnson: 2019]. With plants, environmental cues can play a large part in the production of the root system, specifically lateral roots which are sensitive to nutrient concentration [Malamy: 2001]. This is because the plant does not have the ability to leave the environment in search of a better one. A plant’s phenotypic plasticity, or the change over an organism’s life of how they allocate their resources, determines organism’s fitness and its long-term survival, and can have strong effects on hormone levels, sensitivity, and other metabolic pathways [Trewavas: 1986]. This experiment examines the short-term effects of an excess of a resource, watering 300Ml of water compared to 100Ml of water, and the resulting changes in phenotypic plasticity in the ¬V. radiata¬ days. Our hypothesis is if there is an excess of water in the soil, then V. radiata will allocate resources away from the roots to other parts of the plant, like the stem or leaves, where other resources are less abundant, like sunlight. This data, and overall research on resource allocation, can help farmers better understand the proper amount of nutrients and resources necessary to give to their plants for them to be the most productive product producers. 

Materials and Method:
Six containers of soil were taken and flooded with water. Then ten V. Radiata seeds were taken and planted into each. Three of the containers were given the experimental treatment and received 300Ml of water each day for two weeks. The other three containers were given the controll treatment and were only given 100Ml of water per day for two weeks. After the two week growth period, one plant was randoMly selected from each of the six containers. It was washed clean of soil, weighed, and then cut into two pieces, one for the stem and one for the roots. The base of the stem was decided by where the stem changes color from green to a red. Then the two pieces were measured. The stem was measured from the top edge of the leaf to the base of the stem, and the stem was measured from the bottom of the stem to the end of the longest root. Each of the respective parts were then weighed. A ratio for weight and length of the roots to shoots was then calculated. A two-sample t_test was then used for both of the ratios to determine if the difference between the ratios for the experimental and controll groups were significently different between the two groups. 

Results:
The R:S weight ratio for the controll group was 1.26 while the R:S for the experimental group was .99 (Fig 1.). The standard deviation for the controll was .09 and for the treatment it was .21 (Fig 1.). A two-sample t_test was used to analyze our data. Comparing the R:S weight ratios between the two groups did not give a statistically significent result (t_stat=1.68 d.f.=4 P=.16).The R:S length ratio for the controll group was 1.22 while the R:S for the experimental group was 1.34 (Fig 2.) The standard deviation for the controll was .04 and for the treatment was .23 (Fig 2.). A two-sample t_test was also run and the differences between the two sets of data were not statistically significent (t_stat=.68 d.f.=4 P=.53). The controll plants seemed healthy after the 14 day period, with brighter colored leaves, and less dead growth on the edge of the leaves. 

Discussion:
From the results of this experiment it seems that we reject our hypothesis that increased water levels in the soil would cause resource allocation to be moved away from the roots and toward the stem and leaves in V. radiata. This was not supported because the statistical test used was not significent for either the R:S weight ratio or the R:S length ratio. The length and widths of the normally watered 100Ml plants were very consistent and had a very low standard deviation, .09 and .04 respectively. The overwatered plants, however, seems to each react very differently to the overwatering and for both weight and length ratios had a very high standard deviation of .21 and .23 respectively. Though we cannot be certain because of the non-significance, it seems that each of the overwatered plant’s plasticity was relatively different, and that if this experiment had continued longer than fourteen days, possibly toward age of reproduction in the experimental plants, some of them would have been more fit than others. From metanalysis there does seem to be strong support for our hypothesis [Poorter: 2000], even though our data was not conclusive here. 
In future experiments, it would be interesting to test over a longer period, maybe thirty days, and test V. ¬radiata ¬at more watering amounts. Increased replicate size would also be very helpful to determine whether are data is statistically significent or not. This data and future experiments around resource allocation can help farmers around the world save money and natural resources by more efficiently watering their crops, producing less waste and a lower runoff rates of fertilizer into watersheds.
