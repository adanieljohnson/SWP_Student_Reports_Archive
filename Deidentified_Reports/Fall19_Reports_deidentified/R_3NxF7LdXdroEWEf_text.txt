Title: The Effect of Salt Water on the Root: Shoot Ratio of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus 

Abstract:
The effect of salt water on the root: shoot ratio of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus, or more commonly known as the radish plant, was studied in this experiment. To compare the root: shoot ratios of the plants watered with plain water (controll), 50% salt water, and 100% salt water, an ANOVA statistical test was run to analyze the data, from which a p_value of 0.225 was obtained. This means there is no significent difference between the root: shoot ratios of each group. As a result, the hypothesis that the radish plants in the 100% salt water will have a bigger root: shoot ratio compared to the ratios of the other plants was rejected.


Introduction:
In nature, all organisms respond to biotic factors and abiotic factors in their environment. Biotic factors include any environmental stimuli like other competing species, while abiotic factors include stimuli from nonliving sources like the temperature. These factors can affect the organisms and dictate how they grow by affecting the way that these organisms use the resources and energy available to them. There is a limit to the essential resources, such as water and sunlight, so organisms have to allocate these resources for new growth in the most efficient and beneficial way possible to better their survival. This selective allocation means that there are parts of an organism that are not getting the resources, so there is a tradeoff occurring. In plants, that trade-off is between allocating resources to new shoot growth or new root growth. The shoot of a plant is everything that grows above ground, the leaves and the stem, and they are tasked with gathering carbon compounds and photosynthesizing. On the other hand, the root of the plant is everything that grows below the surface, mainly the roots, and their job is the uptake of nutrients and water from the soil. When plants allocate their resources for growth in leaves, they tend to have high growth rates when light and soil nutrients are abundant. On the other hand, when the stems receive the resources for new growth, the plants will be strong. Consequently, if the plants allocate their resources to their roots, they will thrive in areas where deep roots are necessary to collect water and anchor the plant. This resource allocation can be assessed by partitioning and comparing the root biomass to the shoot biomass in the root: shoot ratio. If this ratio is small, it means that the plant has allocated more resources towards shoot growth rather than allocating resources towards more shoot growth [Johnson: 2016]. In an experiment done in 2006, Muhammad Jamil and his team observed the effect of salt water of varying concentrations on four different vegetable plants. Their data showed that all four vegetables had reduced shoot growth and root growth whenever those plants were treated with salt treatments [Jamil: 2006]. In this experiment, radish plants will be used, which are also a type of vegetable plants, so the data is expected to be similar to Jamil’s experiment. There will be three radish plant groups, a controll, a 50% salt water, and a 100% salt water group. It is hypothesized that the radish plants in the 100% salt water will have a bigger root: shoot ratio compared to the ratios of the other plants as the 100% salt water plants will not be getting enough water, as the salt will be drawing water out of the roots. As a result, the plants will have to allocate more resources towards the roots so that the amount of water absorbed will be similar to the controll.


Materials and Method:
First, 12 pots were gathered, filled with vermiculite, and labeled so that there would be 4 pots for the controll group, 4 pots for the 50% salt water group, and 4 pots for the 100% salt water group. There were 3 radish plants planted in each pot, and all the pots were watered every day for two weeks. The controll group got 400 Ml of plain water, the 50% salt water group got 200 Ml of water and 200 Ml of salt water, and the 100% salt water group got 400 Ml of water.  Once the plants are ready for harvesting, five plants from each group were carefully pulled out of the pots. Each plant was then rinsed so that no dirt remained on the roots and patted dry. Afterward, the total length of each plant was measured in centimeters from the edge of the leaves to the tips of the roots. Next, each of the plants was carefully cut at the top of the root to separate the shoot from the root and both the roots and the shoots of each plant were measured in centimeters. Using those measurements, the root: shoot ratio of length for each plant was found. Then an ANOVA statistical test was run to compare the data from the three groups. 


Results:
We compared the average root: shoot ratios for each group of plants as seen in Figure 1. In general, the average length of the plant, root, and shoot was smaller in the 100% salt water group than any of the other groups as seen in Table 1. Likewise, the average root: shoot ratio for the 100% salt water is smaller than the other groups. The controll group had an average root: shoot ratio of 2.46 ± 0.65. The 50% salt water had a root: shoot ratio of 2.44 ± 0.43. The 100% salt water had a root: shoot ratio of 1.46 ± 0.75. Analyzing the root: shoot ratios of each group with an ANOVA statistical test, the results gave a p_value of 0.225 and 2 degrees of freedom. 


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that the radish plants in the 100% salt water will have a bigger root: shoot ratio compared to the ratios of the other plants. While the average total length and the average shoot and root lengths were smaller in the 100% salt water, as seen in Table 1, the average root: shoot ratios were similar throughout each group as seen in Figure 1. After running an ANOVA statistical t_test to compare the root: shoot ratios, the difference between the root: shoot ratios was insignificent as the p_value obtained was 0.225, which is not less than 0.05. The test also shows that there were no significent differences between the groups as well. Since the data was shown to be insignificent via the ANOVA test, the hypothesis was rejected. This means that there is no significent difference between the root: shoot ratios of the groups, so the salt water did not have a significent effect on the root: shoot ratios of these plants. The data from this experiment contradicts a study done in 2000, where M. Ajmal Khan and his team looked into whether there was an effect of salinity on the growth and other properties of a plant. They found that root growth in their plants was promoted in low salinity water [Khan: 2000]. In this experiment, the root growth was not promoted, and in fact, the roots were smaller in the salt watered plants than in the controll. For future experiments, this experiment could be run with different plants to see if the salt water would have the same effect on other plants as it did on the radish plants. In addition, the experiment could be run with more concentrations of salinity, to see if a higher or lower salt water content would have different effects on the growth of roots and shoots, and consequently, the root: shoot ratio.
