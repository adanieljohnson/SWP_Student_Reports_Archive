Title: Effects of pesticide AzaGuard on Manduca Sexta growth cycle 

Abstract:
N/A for this experiment 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta serve as an effective model organism for endocrine function research due to their relatively short life span and the ability for researchers to quickly and efficiently obtain these organisms. [Schwartz: 1983] Manduca Sexta begin their life cycle as eggs, then develop into larvae and later a pupa, ultimately resulting in an adult moth. This model organism is relatively simple in comparison to a human model and is therefore a useful tool for studying the endocrine system and other human systems [Hussa: 2012]. Two hormones of importance in insects include ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH).  Both hormones work together to carry out appropriate caterpillar development. JH controls the type of molt in development and 20E controls the timing of the molt [Johnson: 2016]. As previously established, the Manduca sexta general life cycle is relatively fast (ranging from 39 to 48 days), are abundant in nature, and are considered pests to the majority of the human population [Johnson: 2016]. For the purpose of this research, 20E will be studied. The pesticide AzaGuard serves as an ecdysterone blocker, therefore slowing the molting during insect development as well as slowing development of additional functions in adult insects. Ecdysteroids are necessary hormones in the manduca sexta for development into adulthood. AzaGuard’s ability to block these ecdysteroids is expected to result in a prolonged juvenile stage because the hormones necessary for development will be lacking. Two groups of Manduca Sexta (1 group exposed to Azaguard and 1 group control with water) were evaluated over a two-week period. The Manduca Sexta in this experiment were in their 3rd-4th larval instars on day 1. The ability to control hormone levels in an organism that is considered a pest allows scientists to decrease development, or cause rapid development based on which form an organism is considered a pest in. 

Two week exposure to AzaGuard pesticide was expected to significantly decrease overall growth and maturation of Manduca Sexta treatment group in comparison to the Manduca Sexta control not exposed to AzaGuard. The control group will show significant increases in weight and show faster signs of development when compared to the ecdysterone blocked group. 



Materials and Methods:
2 plastic containers with 4 compartments were used to grow the manduca sexta and 2 holes were punched into each compartment to allow flow of air. Caterpillars will be incubated at 26.5 C Containers were appropriately labeled. 8 manduca sexta caterpillars were studied in the experiment, 4 served as control and 4 as treatment. During the two week study, manduca food and waste was replenished and cleaned daily. 10 g of manduca food was mashed in container and prepared for each caterpillar. Water is a crucial resource for survival in the organism, so the food was moistened daily. In each 10g food sample, 8 drops of either dH2O or 8 drops of Azaguard (1:1250 concentration) were placed on top of the 10g of food and then mashed/ stirred. After food preparation was complete, the 10g of food were compacted in the side of each caterpillar compartment (10g sample placed appropriately in either control or treatment group based on presence of Azaguard or water control). With each daily visit, the manduca subjects were weighed individually on a table top scale. Qualitative observations were also recorded in the form of notes and pictures. Statistical analysis in the form of a t-test was performed to determine a statistical significance difference between the control and treatment groups. 


Results:
Both groups of caterpillars on day 1 of the experiment were around the same age and weight. By day 3 (as represented in Figure 1), the average control weight had increased at a faster rate than the average weight of the experimental group, this can be seen graphically. Qualitative observations were primarily in regard to increased size. The caterpillars were in the 3rd to 4th larval instar at the beginning of data collection and none arrived at the pupal stage. Coloration was largely the same across both groups, the control group visibly developed faster than the experimental group. By day 11 of the experiment, three of the experimental group were dead. The following day, day 12, all of the experimental were dead and #2 of the control group was found dead. Day 9 was the first day a caterpillar was found dead, as far as conducting statistical tests based on the averages of the caterpillars in each group (the average of the 4 weights on a certain day in experimental and the average of the 4 weights for control), since one of the caterpillars in the experimental group was found dead, the average of the experimental group for day 9 was taken by the three living caterpillars. This was done in subsequent days as well, taking into account the death of each new caterpillar. 11 values (corresponding to 11 days) were used in the t-test, the average of the control was found to be 3.78 and the average of the experimental was found to be 0.293 over the course of 11 days. Statistical analysis (two sample, one tailed t-test) was performed and resulted in a p value of 0.002717. Seeing that the p value was less than 0.05, the results are significantly different. 




Discussion:
Seeing that the results of the experimental and control groups are significantly different, the data supports  the AzaGuard pesticide had a significant effect on the development of the Manduca Sexta treatment group. Thus, the alternative hypothesis is supported. This is due to the ecdysterone role in the Manduca sexta development cycle. Ecdysterone is present throughout the Manduca sexta  natural growth cycle and when an ecdysterone blocker such as Azaguard is used, the amount of ecdysterone in the manduca is diminished. Ecdysterone is necessary before the timing of molt as it affects the timing of molting in the species. When ecdysterone is blocked with a form of a pesticide such as AzaGuard, the ability for further development is hindered and the pupal stage often cannot be obtained. Application of these findings could be of particular importance to those in an industry where pests can dramatically alter crop yield. The ability to manipulate development to cause an organism to remain in a larval stage when it is considered a pest after it pupates is useful technology. A recent study within the California strawberry industry highlights the importance of insect growth regulators to the agricultural world [Dara: 2018]. Three variations of an insecticide and known insect growth regulator azadirachtin were studied, including AzaGuard (3% azadirachtin) in the 2018 study. This study represents the potential for future research on pesticides that have the ability to target and disrupt a specific hormone in one particular insect rather than targeting a broader range of insects, some of which may not be pests.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Effect of Azaguard pesticide on average Manduca Sexta growth, measured in the form of mass. Four 3-4th larval instar caterpillars were placed in each group (8 total). The experimental group were exposed to Azaguard pesticide in their food for eleven days. Error bars were construed by taking the standard deviation of each group average mass per day, explaining the difference in error bar length.
