Title: The effects of water-saturated Brassica oleracea maintaining reduction of electron carriers in photosystem II. 

Abstract:
In this experiment, the leaves of Brassica oleracea were tested under water saturated and unsaturated solutions in order to determine the photosynthetic effects it places on photosystem II. This was determined by observing DCIP reduction as it is a measurable, alternative electron acceptor in photosystem II; this hill reaction is observable because as the solution is reduced, it changes from blue to clear. The hypothesis stated that if the cabbage leaves were saturated in water, the rate of photosynthesis would decrease because it would block the porous membrane needed for gas exchange involved in photosystem II. The changes in absorbance were not significent because p_values were measured at 0.753 during 0-10 minutes and 0.278 during 10-20 minutes. In conclusion, the data showed that water saturation of plants were not statistically significent in order to determine that it would inhibit the rate of photosynthesis from photosystem II. The null hypothesis was supported because water-saturation and unsaturated cabbage leaves will have the same effects on the rate of photosynthesis as the plant regulates homeostasis. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis consists of light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions in which absorbed photons are converted into a reduced power. The light-dependent reactions take place along the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast where photons are converted into reduced energy through the electron transport chain. [214.3 Photosynthesis: 2019] The photons are absorbed by chlorophyll in Photosystems II and I along the membrane, so when there is a greater concentration of chloroplasts more light energy is converted into a reduced power. The process known as a Hill reaction allows DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) to act as an alternative, measurable electron acceptor for Photosystem II as it changes into a clear solution once it is reduced. [214.3 Photosynthesis: 2019] In this experiment, we extracted chloroplasts from the outer layers of leaves of green cabbages, scientifically known as Brassica oleracea, in order to test the effects of DCIP in normal and water-saturated conditioned leaves. The outer green leaves of the cabbage were used because they contained the most chlorophyll, and from the previous experiments done with spinach it was determined that this would likely mimic the closest results to determining the rate of reduction in photosynthesis. In this procedure, the independent variables are the saturated and unsaturated leaves and the dependent variables are the absorbance levels of the solutions as DCIP is reduced. It is important to manipulate and understand the conditions so plants grow successfully because “leaf wetting can promote the development of pathogens on the leaf surface, reduce photosynthetic gas exchange, and lead to the uptake of toxic solutes.” [Dawson: 2018] Each of these effects can keep exponentially harm other factors of the plant. For instance, a common toxic solute like chromium affects cabbages by a “decrease in leaf water potential, associated with increase in diffusive resistance and lowering of transpiration rate.” [Pandey: 2003] Also, when the pathogens and pests are interfering on the surface of the leaf, there is a “measure of water loss from a leaf with closed stomata.” [Dawson: 2018] We hypothesized if saturated leaves of Brassica oleracea are dispensed in water, then the rate of photosynthesis will decrease because it will block the porous membrane needed for gas exchange involved in photosystem II. 



Materials and Method:
This procedure was done by obtaining three separate cabbage leaves for the saturated condition, which were leaves placed in beaker of deionized water for ten minutes, and unsaturated conditions. Then, with two constantly chilled mortar and pestles, each were separately grinded into a paste; 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer was initially grinded with solid leaves, then additional 15 Ml of cold grinding buffer was used in order to make paste less thick. Each of the solutions were strained in order to separate the chloroplasts from large debris. The strained volumes were placed in two preceding chilled centrifuge tubes, A and B pellet, in order to analyze the supernatants of each microtubule and to determine the concentration of chloroplasts present. Centrifuge tube A was spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degree celsius and centrifuge tube B was spun at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degree celsius. 200 microliters of each of the samples of saturated and unsaturated solutions were transferred to microtubules in order to analyze the presence of chloroplasts using a hemocytometer. Once the presence was confirmed, the blank, negative, saturated, and unsaturated solutions were prepared. The blank solution contained water and 100mM phosphate; the unsaturated solutions contained 100 microliters of unsaturated chloroplast solution, water, 130mM DCIP, and 100mM phosphate; the saturated solutions contained 100 microliters of saturated chloroplast solution, water, 130mM DCIP, and 100mM phosphate; the negative controll with no chloroplasts contained water, 130mM DCIP, and 100mM phosphate. The solutions were placed under a lamp of light intensity 11302 lux. Once the tubes were prepared, 2 Ml of each solution was transferred to cuvettes and read at absorbance 600 nm for three separate times: 0 minutes, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes. The percent change in absorbance levels were recorded for each time and each of the deviations was used to determine the statistical significance with a two-sample t_test. 


Results:
The hemocytometer was observed using 200 microliters of separate A and B-pellet solutions, and it was noted that the B-pellet solution contained more chloroplasts in order to create the solutions needed for the spectrophotometer and light lamp. As solutions were under the light lamp, it was observed that the original appearance of dark blue color gradually became clearer the longer it remained under the lamp. 
The statistical test used for this experiment was a two-sample t_test because the means of two groups of data were compared. The controll group was the unsaturated chloroplast solution and the experimental group was the saturated chloroplast solution. The data proved not to be statistically significent at time 10 minutes (t-value: 0.34, d.f.: 4, p_value: 0.75) and time 20 minutes (t-value: 1.26, d.f.: 4, p_value: 0.28.) The negative controll group data was taken from an experiment done with spinach leaves as for it was not prepared; however, the solution would have been prepared in the same manner stated in the method, so its data is used for comparison. The averages of both the saturated and unsaturated solutions in percent change of absorbance were much greater at time 20 minutes compared to time 10 minutes (Figure 1.) The saturated chloroplast solution had a greater change in percent absorbance than the unsaturated solution (Figure 1.) It was important to note that at time 20 minutes there was a tube with a percent change of absorbance at -60.64% which was a much greater change than any of the others absorbances recorded. 


Discussion:
Based on the experimental results, the null hypothesis was supported because the experimental group of the saturated solution proved to increase the rate of photosynthesis in photosystem II. The p_value was shown to be above 0.05, so that means the data was not significent and that the alternative hypothesis was rejected. The cabbage leaves were saturated for 10 minutes by being dispensed in water, but when they were grinded up this ruined the potential of damage to the leaf surface by pathogens and blockage of gas exchange. Stomata had no function anymore for gas exchange, so this could not slow the rate of photosynthesis within photosystem II. In terms of how toxic chemicals damage the rate of photosynthesis, this is altered by the absorption of excess water, not through a surface-level impact. Effects of water absorption with toxic solutes are “more in roots than in leaves, and to the development of toxicity symptoms.” [Pandey: 2003] This data is important because it shows that water saturated plants may have an affected photosystem II depending on how the water is absorbed or interacts with the plant. 
Normally, when the outside environment of the plant is water saturated, “plants directly controll water dynamics, weathering, and the chemistry of weathering solutions.” [Lucas: 2001] So if the water was absorbed through the roots, water saturation would have no effect because plants can maintain an osmotic balance. However, if the cabbage leaves were water deficit, cabbage leaves have the ability of “turgor recovery in the absence of water uptake” if the “rate of water loss is slow enough” and “the leaves are no longer growing actively.” [Levitt: 1986] Due to this, this may have lead the cabbage leaves to return to optimal conditions of water intake for photosystem II during the procedure and allow it to have a greater change in absorbance compared to the unsaturated leaves. The cabbage leaves were not planted and did not grow anymore, so turgid recovery in the absence of water uptake may have been from the cell walls or from the vessel lumens by cavitation. [Levitt: 1986]
Understanding how excess water interacts with plants is important for agricultural purposes in order to maintain and protect the health of crops. By researching how water can affect its growth and reproduction, farmers can regulate soil levels, predict cropping season, and protect the structure of plants from pests and pathogens with herbicides. In order to test the hypothesis stated in this procedure, a way to prove the alternative hypothesis would be by keeping the cabbage leaves whole and put in water saturated solutions where they would be grinded up after exposure to light at varying times. This way, pathogens and interrupted gas exchange can possibly alter the rate of photosynthesis within the light-dependent reactions.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The average percent absorbances of solutions at times 10 and 20 minutes. The average percent change in absorbance of the unsaturated solution at time 10 minutes was -2.19 +/- 3.81 and at time 20 minutes was -4.63 +/- 5.23. The average percent change in absorbance of the saturated solution at time 10 minutes was -3.44 +/- 5.21 and at time 20 minutes was -26.47 +/-29.67. The average percent change in absorbance of the negative controll at time 10 minutes was -9.09 +/- 4.97 and at time 20 minutes was -6.07 +/- 4.62. The unsaturated chloroplast solution acted as the controll group and the saturated chloroplast solution acted as the experimental group. The solution with no chloroplasts acted as the negative controll.
