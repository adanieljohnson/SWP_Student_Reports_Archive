Title: Is absorbance linked to Correlation between herbicide effectiveness and absorbance levels in spinach leaves 

Abstract:
This experiment looks at photosynthesis and the effects that herbicides have on chloroplasts production. Photosynthesis occurs in three different stages but this experiment looks at photosystem II. The herbicide that is used is called Atrazine which is a light-dependent herbicide that inhibits electron flow in PSII. This is tested by using three different tests which includes three tubes that contain herbicide in placed in a dark space, three tubes that contain herbicide placed in white light, and three tubes that do not contain herbicide that is place under white light. Absorbances were recorded for each tube at minutes 0, 10, 20, and 30. The percent absorbances were calculated and averaged. From running this experiment we can see that the results were not significant and the error was high. The biggest percent change in absorbance came from the samples with no herbicide in the light and the absorbance values were highest in the samples in the light with herbicide. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use energy from sunlight and turn it into chemical energy. It is the most important biological process on earth because it provides gas exchange on earth and without plants, there would be no oxygen. Photosynthesis occurs in three different stages. The first two stages are called the light-dependent reactions. There is also a light-independent reaction however, the herbicide that we are using for this lab will only focus on light-dependent reactions. Light-dependent reactions use light energy to make ATP and NADPH. Herbicides that are light-dependent inhibit electron flow in PSII and capture electrons in PSI. This causes the plant to basically starve itself because the inhibition of light reactions in photosynthesis which causes the inhibition of sugar production in the Calvin Cycle through the depletion of ATP and NADPH [Hess, 2000]. For this lab, we wanted to see how exposure to light influences the effectiveness of a light dependent herbicide called Atrazine. Atrazine is used to control broadleaf and grass weeds in certain crops [Hess: 2000]. We want to test this by placing three assay replicates with and without the herbicide under white light and with the herbicide in darkness. Our control variable is the herbicide in the darkness because we do not expect a change and is the controlled sample since this is a light dependent herbicide and therefore nothing to excite the electrons. We hypothesize under the light, there should be more chloroplasts so the absorbance will stay at a high level in the no herbicide sample and the absorbance will decrease if the chloroplasts are not affected by the herbicide. 

Materials and Methods:
The materials needed for this experiment include: 24 mL of distilled water, 6mL of DCIP, 2mL of Atrazine herbicide, 2-3 spinach leaves, 28mL of grinding buffer, a mortar and pestle, and a spectrophotometer. The mortar and pestle is used first to grind up the spinach leaves as well as the addition of 10mL grinding buffer to be centrifuged for the first time for 3 minutes. The samples are to be centrifuged two times total with the second time being centrifuged for 10 minutes. The purpose of centrifuging twice is to obtain a resuspended B-pellet because the Hill assay works best when there is not a lot of debris and a lot of chloroplasts. As explained in the introduction, there were three replicate tubes with and without the herbicide under the white light, and then three replicate tubes with the herbicide in the dark. Table 1 shows how much of each is to be added to the tubes. By doing this, we are comparing chloroplasts in the light with and without herbicide to chloroplasts in the dark with the herbicide since the herbicide. If the absorbance levels of the treated replicates in the dark remain the same, then we know the herbicide works better in the light. We used a 2 sample t-test for analyzing the data. Lastly, the absorbances were read using the spectrophotometer set to 600nm. The absorbances were read at minutes 0, 10, 20, and 30. The absorbance values were calculated using the formula: % Change=  ((Absorbance at time 0-Absorbance at time〖(_^')N〗^'))/(Absorbance at time 0 )  x 100%. 

Results:
From the 2 sample t-test, we found that our data was not significant. The p-values were above .05 but our hypothesis was not completely rejected. Table 2 and Figure 2 shows the averages of the absorbances at 0, 10 , 20, and 30 minutes. It is shown that the absorbance values are highest in the samples that had herbicide in the light which matches the hypothesis. It also shows that the no herbicide in the light was the lowest absorbance which also is congruent with the hypothesis. However, these values did not change much throughout the experiment. At 0 minutes, the herbicide in the light was highest and never really deviated from this 0 minute absorbance. In Figure 1, the percent changes in absorbance is graphed and this is where it can be shown why there was no significant data. The error bars are very large and there is not much change in the data throughout the time interval from 0 to 30 minutes which is why our data is not significant. 

Discussion:
For this lab, we wanted to know whether or not exposure to light will influence the effectiveness of Atrazine. We hypothesized that under the white light with no herbicide, there should be more chloroplasts, so the absorbance will be higher and the absorbance should drop if the chloroplasts aren't affected by the herbicide. In the samples in the dark with the herbicide, the absorbance should go down. Based on the results, it can be seen that with the tubes that contained no herbicide and were placed under the white light had the highest absorbance levels throughout. The samples with the herbicide in the light had lower values throughout which makes sense because the Atrazine is a light-dependent herbicide. This means that the herbicide did work to stop photosynthesis which means that there were less chloroplasts. The dark samples with herbicide were used to confirm if the herbicide was light-dependent since there was nothing to excite the electrons. The percent change in absorbance was showing if photosynthesis is actually happening relative to starting point (0 minutes). No herbicide in the light showed the biggest percent change and rightfully so because it is the only sample that is conducting photosynthesis since the others had the herbicide in it. From Figure 2 it is shown that the samples with the herbicide in the light had the highest absorbance values from the start and no herbicide in the light had the lowest. Our results did turn out to be not significant and the errors were quite large. There may be a few reasons why this happened. One source of error could have been from the Atrazine herbicide itself. Atrazine is pretty thick and is somewhat of a milky substance which could have affected the absorbance reading from the spectrophotometer. With the absorbance values being so high in the herbicide sample in the light, this means that the light is being blocked by the sample. Absorbance values should usually stay between 0.1 and 1.0. Also, other studies have shown that the “triazines are soil-applied or early post emergent herbicides in crops and noncropland sites. These herbicides are absorbed by both shoots and roots but are translocated only in the xylem [University of California, 2019].” This means that they are applied at an early stage in plant development and that they are absorbed by the shoots and roots only. In future studies, it would be more accurate and may lead to significant data if we used the same experiment steps but instead of spinach leaves, used real plants and left them for a longer period of time. It has also been studied that “waterhemp can evolve resistance to this herbicide. In target-site resistance, a gene mutation changes the protein that the herbicide is designed to attack. With an ill-fitting protein binding site, the herbicide becomes ineffective [ScienceDaily, 2017].” It would also be interesting in future studies to use a waterhemp plant to see if there is a resistance to the herbicide and how this affects the absorbance values.
