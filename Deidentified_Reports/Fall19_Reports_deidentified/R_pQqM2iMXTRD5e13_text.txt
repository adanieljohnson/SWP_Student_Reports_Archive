Title: Hormone Regulation in the Manduca Sexta: Addition of the Precor Juvenile Hormone and How it Stunts the Molting Process

Abstract:
none

Introduction:
The average amount of time that it takes the larvae of a Manduca Sexta to reach the pupa stage is estimated to be 18-23 days. There are certain types of hormones that conduct and inhibit the molting process of the Manduca Sexta, these are called Juvenile Hormones (JH).  Juvenile Hormones regulate types of molt during its development. Experiments can be carried out to observe the specific effects of this hormone on the Manduca Sexta. During an experiment that compares larvae treated with JH to a controll group, the independent variable would be the amount of Juvenile Hormone added to the food of a treatment group, whereas time and weight of the growing larvae would be the dependent variable. By using a scale, one should be able to weigh the larvae to decipher whether or not the Juvenile Hormone is inhibiting growth, as they are expected. This experiment will provide data to show that, with the varying addition of Juvenile Hormone (JH), the larvae should take a longer amount of time to reach the pupa stage than the controll group.

Materials and Method:
There were two different groups used in this experiment, the controll group and the treatment group. Each of the two groups consisted of 4 Manduca Sexta larvae that were each contained in their own space. Each of the larvae initially received 10g of food along with 5 drops of their perspective treatment: 5 drops of water for controll and 5 drops of Precor JH for treatment group. The containers were cleaned out and we weighed the larvae daily. The food only had to be changed whenever deemed necessary (when it becomes dry), so roughly every other day. During the first week, the treatment group received 5 drops of JH, while the second week it received an additional 5 drops, 10 in all. The weights of the treatment larvae were compared to the controll larvae to show that with the addition of JH, the larvae would not grow and molt as much. After obtaining the data we used a paired, one-tailed T-test to find the p_value of the data and compare the two test groups.

Results:
After repeatedly weighing both groups of Caterpillars for 15 days, we were able to collect enough data to observe and make inferences about the validity of our hypothesis. We took the weights of each caterpillar in each group and found the mean weight for every day of the experiment (one mean per day for the treatment group and one for the controll group). Figure 1 shows each of the daily average weights and how they compare to each other. The mean for the controll groups tended to be higher for the first nine days, while the last six days tended to be lower in comparison. The standard deviations for the experiment tended to follow the same trend as the mean in reference to the controll group and treatment group. The average for the ending weight for the controll group was 6.8127g while the ending average for the treatment group was 9.5427g, which was significently greater than we had expected.  After obtaining this data, we used a paired one-tailed T-test to find the p_value, which was 0.3724. Due to this number being larger than .05, it was proven to be an insignificent value.



Discussion:
When learning about juvenile hormones and the effects of it in the Manduca Sexta, we found that it regulates the type of molting that takes place throughout the caterpillar’s life span. After learning this information, my groupmates and I made the hypothesis that with additional amounts of Juvenile Hormone (JH), the larvae would take a longer amount of time to reach the pupa stage than the controll group. After comparing our two testing groups, one controll and one treated with the juvenile hormone Precor, we found that they grew at a similar rate. This was unexpected because we had hypothesized that the test group would be much smaller than the controll group. Then, from comparing the mean weights of each of the test groups and placing them in a paired one-tailed T-test (shown in Figure 1), we were able to determine that the p value for this experiment was 0.3724. This value was overall insignificent and makes it easy to infer that the likelihood of the results was due to chance. There are many factors that could have caused this unexpected outcome, such as inaccuracy in the addition of Precor or unequal amounts of food given to the larvae, but the likely cause is simply an incorrect hypothesis. Juvenile hormone is often used by the bodily processes in an insect to cue transformation within it and initiate maturation [Riddiford, 2008], but this is not what we had expected when first creating our hypothesis. We had assumed that the addition of JH would slow and inhibit molting and maturation processes but in reality, it induces them, meaning that the data from our experiment is accurate but it doesn’t match with our specific hypothesis. Now that we have acquired more knowledge about the use of JH, the results make clear sense and bring our experiment to a logical end.
