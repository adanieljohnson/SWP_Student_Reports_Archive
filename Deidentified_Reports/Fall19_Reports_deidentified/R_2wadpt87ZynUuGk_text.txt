Title: The effects of varying salinity concentrations on Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus

Abstract:
Plant growth can be restrained or enhanced based on several factors. In this experiment, the rate of plant growth will be observed and dependent on salinity concentrations in the water. One group was the controll, while the second group was watered with 200Ml of regular water, and 200Ml of 1M NaCl solution, and the third group was watered with 400Ml of 1M NaCl solution. We took before and after measurements of the roots and shoots to determine growth rate. The ANOVA test determined all groups insignificent. There is not only statistical evidence, but also physical evidence for the rejection of the alternate hypothesis. The growth of the plants was not affected by which group they were in, or in other words the concentration of salinity they received. Next time this experiment is performed, it could be beneficial to use a different species. This research is important for further discoveries, especially within the agricultural industry.

Introduction:
The growth and survival of many plant species is determined by a number of factors, including biotic and abiotic. Plant growth can be restrained or enhanced based on the amount of sunlight, quality of soil, humidity in the air,  and of course water in-take. In this experiment, the rate of plant growth will be observed and dependent on salinity concentrations in the water. This specific factor plays a role in the rate of photosynthesis, as the increase in salinity causes the equilibrium to shift. The water in the plant cells will favor a hypertonic solution, causing there to be less available water to run the mechanisms required for photosynthesis. This would result in a lower output from chloroplast and a lower overall photosynthetic output. Other research has shown that under high NaCl concentrations, there was a reduction in photosynthetic output. [Goussi: 2018] This is important to note, especially for agricultural or economic purposes. It is imperative to know which plants survive and produce the best in certain conditions, or else that could affect the overall profit of farmers and the economy. For example, it would not be very logical to plant a cactus in a very wet environment, or a plant that is not resistant to salt by the ocean. With this in mind, It is predicted that the plant with higher amounts of salinity will have the least amount of growth. The shoot to root ratio will be applied to a statistical test to measure significance, so it is expected that the ratio of the plants with higher salinity concentrations to be smaller.

Materials and Method:
Three groups of the same plant species were prepared, in this case radishes. One group was the controll, that was being watered with 400Ml of regular water. The second group was watered with 200Ml of regular water, and 200Ml of 1M NaCl solution. The third group was watered with 400Ml of 1M NaCl solution. Multiple seeds were plants in each space of each group. The plants were monitored and watered daily for 2 weeks. After this 2-week period, the plants were removed from the soil along with their roots. Extra care was taken to avoid breaking the roots. The plants were washed, and the entire length was measured. Then, the roots were cut from the shoots, and each was measured individually. A root to shoot ratio was calculated and entered into an ANOVA test to evaluate significance. 

Results:
The controll group had an average root:shoot ratio of 2.46 ± 0.65, the 50% NaCl group had a root:shoot ratio of 2.44 ± 0.43, while the final 100% NaCl group had root:shoot ratio of 1.46 ± 0.75. The ratios were analyzed using an ANOVA statistical test. The results gave a p_value of 0.225 with 2 degrees of freedom. Overall, the root:shoot ratios were smaller for the 100% NaCl group, as seen in table 1. In general, the lengths for the 100% NaCl were smaller than the other two groups. Control and 50% NaCl had more growth on average. 

Discussion:
According to the data, the alternative hypothesis was not supported. The ANOVA test determined that the difference between the data was insignificent. There is not only statistical evidence, but also physical evidence for the rejection of the alternate hypothesis. The growth of the plants was not affected by which group they were in, or in other words the concentration of salinity they received. The data failed to support the hypothesis, and this could be due to not a high enough salt concentration due to the species of plant that was used, or not running the experiment for long enough. Researchers from the department of biotechnology from the Jamia Millia Islamia institution in New Delhi also performed a salinity experiment with spinach plants, and those results suggested that certain plants, like spinach, have different mechanisms to respond to salinity and other combined stress with unique sets of proteins. [Bagheri: 2015] In further experiments, it could be beneficial to use a different plant that has not been found to respond to salinity stress in a positive manner. It could also help to raise the salinity levels to a higher degree. This could impact the data that is observed, and cause less plant growth, however more research would need to be conducted. This research is important for further discoveries, especially within the agricultural industry. If a plant cannot withstand salinity stress, but is planted somewhere close to an ocean, or another area of high salt concentration, the plant will not produce good yield. This could not only impact the success of the farmer, but also the agricultural economy. Further research should be done in order to determine the effects of salinity on various plants, with various concentrations in order to ensure the highest yield for local and mass-produced crops.
