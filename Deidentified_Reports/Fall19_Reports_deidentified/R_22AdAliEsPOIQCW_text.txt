Title: Colored stimuli does not affect aggression of Betta splendens

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior relies on quality research resulting from periods of patient observation with consideration of behaviors from the viewpoint of the specific, nonhuman organism.  The aim of this experiment was to understand how color effects the level of aggressiveness for the male Betta fish (Betta splendens). In order to test the effect of color, a male Betta fish was shown a video of a red, blue, or black Betta fish acting aggressively and the responses of the fish were monitored. It was hypothesized that the fish would act more aggressively by striking the glass of the tank towards the videos of the red and blue Betta fish compared to the black, no-color video. The results of this experiment do not follow expected results because the male Betta fish did not strike the glass while watching the videos. The biological results of this experiment further the understanding of external factors like color on Betta fish behavior.

Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, is reliant on observation. Quality research results from a researcher’s knowledge of his or her animals, often due to long periods of patient observation, as well as a knowledge of behavioral and evolutionary literature [Johnson: 2016].
	It is essential that observed animal behavior is not considered in isolation and from the perspective of the observed species. Many animals perform behaviors specific to their species, such as domesticated dogs that raise their hackles in response to outside threats [Christensen: 2007].  
	Male Betta fish (Betta splendens) are aquarium fish that are indigenous to Thailand [Johnson: 2016]. Wild males are an inconspicuous, dull brown or green color when at rest but change color to an intense blue or red color when excited by the appearance of another male.  Betta fish are a good choice of species to use when investigating animal behavior due to the intraspecific behaviors the males present towards one another. Males can present different broadside, displaying the side of the body, or facing, head-on display, movements varying in level of aggressiveness or other aggressive behaviors such as darting, biting, or nipping at the opponent [Johnson: 2016].
	Performing this experiment widens the knowledge of animal behavior by testing how color factors into the reaction of a male Betta fish. Previous studies observing Betta fish have showed that external factors like amount of long-term light exposure alters their tendency to become aggressive towards males opponents [Lynn: 2007]. It was hypothesized that a male Betta fish presented with red or blue fish videos will act more aggressively compared to when shown a black and white video because male Betta fish in the wild change to a bright and vibrant color in an aggressive response to another male. 


Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, one red male Betta fish was obtained and put in a tank filled with room temperature water. 
Two different videos of aggressive red and blue Betta fish were found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtJWPtY1iCI and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtQ8JRGc_Fw, respectively. The video of the blue male was set to black and white so that the fish appeared black and functioned as a control for color. Each video was shown to the fish by placing an iPhone displaying the video directly next to the glass of the tank.  
The videos were presented to the fish for two minutes with five minutes of rest in between trials.  Three trials were completed for all videos. 
During trials, time until first strike at the glass next to the phone was monitored and the total number of strikes at the glass were counted.
A two-sample t-test was intended to be used to compare the results from the different colored fish to the results from the black and white video to determine significant difference in time until first strike and total number of strikes.


Results:
 	While the fish did swim close to the wall of the tank to which the phone was in contact, it did not strike the glass nor display any aggressive behaviors for all three trials of any of the three videos. Therefore, there is no quantitative data to report nor compare.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment do not follow the expected pattern that male Betta fish act more aggressively towards vibrantly colored Betta fish. The fish did not strike the glass of the tank nor display other kinds of aggressive behavior like broadside or facing movements in response to any of the videos presented. 
	The outcome of this experiment can be supported by a study conducted on sheep shown videos of other sheep displaying agonistic behavior, like headbutting [Vogeli: 2015]. Measures of brain activity showed that the sheep displayed high attentiveness and cortical deactivation when watching agonistics, and their behavioral response was often to become agitated but not aggressive. It is important to note that during experimentation there was one instance in which the fish did spread out its opercula, an aggressive behavior, in response to an original showing of the blue Betta fish video, but this did not occur again throughout any other trials.
	Logistical complications could have resulted from the lack of clarity of the video presented through a glass wall and tank full of water. These factors could have altered the fish’s ability to clearly identify the video as an aggressive male. Additionally, introduction of new light stimuli from the phone screen could have startled the fish which would have hindered its ability to respond aggressively.
	Modifications to this experiment could lead to more insightful results. For instance, actually creating three-dimensional models of red, blue, and black male Betta fish to put in the tank might elicit a strong aggressive response from a live fish.  Also, completing more trials with greater numbers of males would yield reliable results.
	This is a useful experiment to perform because it helps ethologists understand how external factors like color can effect animal behavior.  Also, the optimal conditions for raising Betta fish are still largely unknown [Monvises: 2009]. Results from experiments such as this one shows fish breeders the possible response of their fish with respect to vibrantly colored stimuli.
