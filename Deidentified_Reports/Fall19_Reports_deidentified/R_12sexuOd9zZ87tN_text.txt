Title: The effect of light intensity on the photosystem II activity of Spinach oleicea

Abstract:
	Photosynthesis is the process of absorbing environmental light and water in efforts to produce a sugar energy source and carbon dioxide. It involves the action of photosystem II, which takes light and uses it to excite electrons needed to produce necessary to carry out the reaction. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of all plants, but in this study the chloroplast’s of Spinacia oleracea was isolated. This was done through the use of a grinding buffer, mortar and pestle, and centrifuge. The isolated chloroplasts were subjected to different environments and spectophotometer was used to determine the way in which these affected the photosynthetic rate. As indicated by the data, the intensity of light that the chloroplasts are exposed increases the activity of this protein complex does as well. The increase in the activity of photosystem II increases the overall photosynthetic rate of that chloroplast. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the “formation of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and a source of hydrogen (such as water) in the chlorophyll-containing cells (as of green plants) exposed to light” [Merriam Webster Dictionary]. This process relies on the function of multiple different protein complexes, one of which is Photosystem II. Sunlight is essential to the function of photosynthesis as Photosystem II captures energy from it and uses it to extract electrons from water molecules. This produces oxygen as well as electrons needed to synthesize the ATP that fuels the production of sugar a, water, and carbon dioxide [Goodsell: 2004]. A 2013 study that altered the light exposed to Arabidopsis thaliana observed the constancy of photosystem II over the allotted time for chloroplasts exposed to no light, and an increase in the density of C2S2M2 super complexes which were an indication of the increase in activity of the photosystem II protein complexes of plants exposed to “higher-light” [Kouril R, Wientjes E, Buktema J, Croce R, Boekema EJ: 2013]. Taking this data into consideration it is likely that increasing the intensity of the light that Spinacia oleracea – spinach – is exposed to will have the same effect. 

Materials and Method:
A spinach leaf and grinding buffer slurry was prepared with a prechilled mortar and pestle and prepped to be centrifuged. The pellet that remained after the slurry was centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC was resuspended using a grinding buffer and chilled. This sample contained the chloroplasts that carried out the photosynthetic reaction. The solutions outlined in Table 1 were mixed, and 100 μl of the isolated enriched chloroplasts were added to the blank tube, and to Tubes #4-12. Tubes #1-3 did not contain chloroplasts, as they were the controll that the data was compared to. The spectrophotometer was blanked at 600nm and a time 0 absorbances for all samples was recorded. Samples #0, #1-3 were then placed in regular light, #4-6 in dark 0% light, #7-9 in 50% light, and #10-12 in 100% light under a lamp. After 10 minutes in these environments the absorbance of each solution was recorded. The absorbances were recorded again as a 20-minute absorbance as well as a 30-minute absorbance in efforts to see how the different environments effected the amount of light each sample absorbed. The percent change of the absorbances were calculated over time, and a paired T test was preformed to analyze the statistical significance of the data collected. 

Results:
A mean percent change of 1.61 percent was seen in the solution that lacked chloroplasts entirely, while the mean percent change of the solution that was exposed to 0 percent light was 2.39% +/- 0.6. Both of these had much lower percent changes than those of the chloroplasts exposed to 50 percent and 100 percent light, which had mean percent change values of 13.6% +/- 4.66 and 0.51% +/- 3.65percent respectively. This data is visually represented in Figure 1. The comparison of the percent changes of chloroplasts exposed to 0 percent light and 100 percent light were statistically significent, with a paired t test p value of .00586399, as was the comparison of the percent changes of chloroplasts exposed to 0 percent light and 50 percent light, with a paired test p value of 0.030508006.

Discussion:
As the light intensity of the Spinacia oleracea’s environment increased photosystem II activity also increased. This paralleled the 2013 Arabidopsis thaliana study data and supported our hypothesis [Kouril R, Wientjes E, Buktema J, Croce R, Boekema EJ: 2013]. The activity of photosystem II was indicated by the increase decrease or absence of change in absorbance that was measured by the spectrophotometer. Photosystem II excites electrons using the energy from its environment and uses this energy to carry out photosynthesis. Thus, a direct correlation between light intensity and photosynthetic rate is not surprising. With the increase in ozone depleting gases such as ChloroFluoroCarbons (CFCs), water vapor, and carbon tetra fluoride the sunlight reaching the surface of the earth has become increasing intense [Bolaji BO, Huan Z: 2013]. According to this study, one could predict an increase in the photosynthetic rates of the plants on earth surface exposed to this light, however more data would need to be collected in order for this to be conclusive.
