Title: Effects of red light on the growth of Vigna radiata (mung bean plants)

Abstract:
Living things are always adapting to the environments in which they live through a process of resource allocation to what is important for that organism at that particular point in time. In this experiment, we wanted to observe the effects of red-light on the growth of Vigna radiata (mung bean plants). We hypothesized that there will be higher shoot lengths in the plants grown under red-light compared to plants grown under normal sunlight. We also anticipated a lower root to shoot length ratio as a result of the higher shoot length. We found that our results supported our hypothesis that the shoot length of the plants grown in red-light, but it rejected the hypothesis that the root to shoot length ratio will be lower in the experimental. We did have a small sample size, so we hope that further research is done with a much larger sample size to understand correctly what the effects of red-light are on plants.

Introduction:
All living organisms are constantly being influenced by the environment in which they live. Whether it is biotic (living) or abiotic (non-living) factors, they still have some impact on living organisms. Some resources that are needed for survival aren’t always in abundance to living organisms. Resource limitation affects species present in a given community. Limited resources can be sunlight, water, nutrients and anything that hinders the healthy growth of plants in their natural habitat. To acclimatize, the species go through a process of resource allocation to help adapt to the new conditions they are presented with [Johnson: 2016]. Species are forced to distribute and use their limited resources in a way that they can still survive. This distribution in the plants can be geared towards either the shoot of the plant or the root of the plant. The shoot of the plant is primarily responsible for photosynthesis and the storage of food while the root of the plant is usually responsible water and mineral intake as well as a firm standing in the soil. In this experiment, we will observe the phenotypic plasticity, that is, the physical changes that are observed in mung bean plants (Vigna radiata) as a result of resource allocation when the only source of light is red-light. The Vigna radiata species of the mung bean plants are predominantly found across Asia and grow very fast which makes it optimal for this experiment because we have a short time span. We hypothesize that the treatment group (the group presented with red light) will have a lower root to shoot length ratio but a higher shoot length relative to that of the control group (the group with regular sunlight). This is because when there is less sunlight, resources are allocated to the shoot in an effort to get as much sunlight as possible and to outgrow other competitors [Hernandez: 2006]. We predict a lower root to shoot length ratio because with the root of the plant being unaffected by the red light, the denominator (the length of the shoot) will be greater for the experimental and that will produce a lower root to shoot ratio.

Materials and Methods:
We took six clean nursery pots and by a process of random selection, we placed 4 mung bean seeds in each pot by placing the seeds about an inch into the soil. Three of the pots were the experimental group and the remaining three were the control group. We placed the experimental group under a red tent-like setup that shined red light unto the plants when sunlight shined on the tent while the control was placed under direct sunlight. We watered each nursery pot with 200ml of water daily for a 14-day period. After the end of the 14-day period, we harvested 8 mung bean plants each from experimental and control groups. We washed and dried the plants to make sure we were weighing the plants free of debris. We weighed the 8 plants as a whole and recorded the weights. We then separated the shoots from the roots at the root/shoot junction. We weighed the shoots and roots independently of each plant and calculated the root mass, the root to shoot weight ratio and the mean value of both the experimental and control group. We then measured the lengths of the roots and shoots and calculated the root to shoot length ratio and the mean of the experimental and control groups. We then run one-tailed two-sample t-tests to compare the root to shoot length ratios and shoot lengths between the experimental and control groups.

Results:
The mean shoot length for the control was 11.23 ± 4.17cm while the mean shoot length for the experimental was 14.31±2.53 cm as shown in figure 1. The mean of the root to shoot length ratio for the control was 0.806 ± 0.486 while the mean shoot length for the experimental was 0.780±0.221 as figure 2 visually shows. The average R:S length ratio was nearly equal when we compared the control group to the experimental group as observed in figure 2. The average shoot length of the experimental was higher than that of the average shoot length of the control as seen in figure 2. The control group’s mean root length was 8.09±5.02 cm whereas the plants under the red light had a mean length of 10.9±3.1 cm. The average R:S weight ratio was higher for the treatment group compared to the control group. The p-value for the R:S length ratio was 0.444 and the p-value for shoot length was 0.0476. The degrees of freedom were 14 for both statistical tests. Our cut-off for the p-value to be significant was 0.05.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the root to shoot length ratio will be lower in the experimental compared to the control was rejected because we got a statistically insignificant result. We anticipated getting a lower root to shoot length ratio because we predicted a higher shoot length which is the denominator of the calculation so the larger the denominator, the lower the total value. We observe this result because the average length was higher in the experimental relative to the control. As a result, the root to shoot ratio between the control and the experimental was nearly identical. A good reason for the difference in root length is that the control’s soil lost water through evaporation because it was under direct sunlight, whereas the experimental had a tent over the plants so the soil was able to retain water which was in turn absorbed by the roots making them bigger and longer. Our hypothesis that the shoot length of the experimental will be higher than that of the control was supported because we got a statistically significant result which wasn’t due to chance. We got this result because, with limited sunlight, the plant tried to grow taller to reach sunlight and to outgrow its competitors. This is because the plants allocated more resources such as the auxin hormone to ensure that the plant was able to get more sunlight than the surrounding plants in its environment. Auxin is a plant hormone produced in the stem tip that promotes cell elongation. Auxin moves to the darker side of the plant, causing the cells there to grow larger than corresponding cells on the lighter side of the plant and effectively move the plant towards the direction of the light. The situation that the plant was in gave the plants the maximum shoot and root lengths [Govil: 1985]. In Govil’s research experiment, Vigna radiata plants were exposed to laser in the ultra-violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum and found that the plants had the maximum root and shoot length with exposure to the UV light. The results from this experiment correlate with our findings during this experiment. We have to note that our sample size was very small and that our data isn’t sufficient to make a universal prediction as to how mung bean plants will behave when grown under a red-light filter. We can carry out further experiments to see if our results still stand. Data from these experiments can be used to ascertain we can revolutionize how we grow plants for specific outcomes. We can essentially see how we can use the concept of resource allocation for our own benefit. Living things will learn how to adapt to certain environments to have the best outcome.
