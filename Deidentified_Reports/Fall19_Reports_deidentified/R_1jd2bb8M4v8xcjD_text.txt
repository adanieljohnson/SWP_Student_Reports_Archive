Title: The Effect of Increasing Juvenile Hormone Levels on the Growth of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
NA

Introduction:
Tobacco Hornworms (Manduca sexta) undergo lepidopteran growth and metamorphosis in four distinct stages of development. The growth and development of these insects is controllled by neuron-based signaling which triggers the secretion of hormones. Three hormones in particular are secreted and required for the growth and development of Manduca sexta. The first hormone required for this purpose is the Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH), which regulates the release of ecdysterone by the prothoracic glands. The next hormone ecdysterone (20E), which regulates the timing of molting in the development period. Finally the hormone focused on in this experiment, the juvenile hormone (JH), which regulate the type of molting that occurs during development [Johnson: 2016]. It was already known that the juvenile hormone is important in adult female Manduca sexta egg production, but the effect is very different in the vermiform larvae. In a study conducted by Nijout and Riddiford the effect of juvenile hormone on egg production in adult female tobacco hornworms was observed. This study provoked interest in studying the Manduca sexta specifically due to the overwhelming effect it has on adults compared to other species, and the experiments “confirmed that adult Manduca sexta females require JH for complete egg maturation” [MaryNijhout: 1974]. With the knowledge that increasing JH levels in adult female Manduca sexta having such a drastic effect, this experiment had the goal of comparing these effects with increasing JH levels in Manduca sexta larvae. When the larvae reach a large enough size JH levels drop very low, and the larvae move to the pupa stage. With this in mind, the question arose of whether increasing amounts of JH in these larvae would stop the pupa stage from occurring and inhibit the caterpillar’s ability to transform into their adult form. This could then be observed in experiment by mixing in additional amounts of JH into the diets of some caterpillars, while a separate group would be under the same conditions except they would not be receiving additional JH into their diet. It was then assumed that if immature Manduca sextas are treated with excess juvenile hormone, then the transition into the adult moth will be inhibited and the caterpillars will only increase in their mass further until their death.

Materials and Method:
The experiment began with eight caterpillars isolated from each other in plastic cells with holes for breathing. Lids were placed over the top when their masses weren’t being recorded and food was not being prepared. Each caterpillar received 10 grams of fresh food each day. Four of the caterpillars received 7 drops of [1: 1250] IGR JH mixed into their food each day, while the other 4 caterpillars received 7 drops of water mixed into their food each day. The caterpillars lived under relatively stable conditions at 26 degrees celsius. All 8 caterpillars developmental progress was measured daily through mass (g) and qualitative observations (appearance and movement) over the course of 15 days. The individual cells were also cleaned each day to prevent the build up of waste and old food. The one-tailed T-test was used in order to find and compare the average change in mass of both groups with a p_value of 0.307.

Results:
By the end of the 2 week period the 4 experimental caterpillars displayed a lack of optimal mobility and a pale complexion. The controll group on the other hand displayed a darker green complexion and relatively normal behavior. The controll group had a slightly higher average in mass change of 6.70g +/- 5.13g than the experimental group with an average of 5.80g +/- 4.57 (Figure 1). The mean of the groups displayed no statistical difference between the groups (t_stat = 0.51, d.f. = 28, P = 0.307). 

Discussion:
Our results as well as our statistical analysis supported our hypothesis in saying that the caterpillars receiving additional amounts of JH would be unable to pupate, and would instead continue to gain weight until their death. Our visual observations also supported our hypothesis. The controll group displayed visual signs of nearing pupation such as dark green color whereas the experimental group did not. The only known difference between the two groups was the presence of JH in the diet of the experimental group, so therefore additional amounts of JH in the diet of Manduca sexta did have an impact on development, and more specifically their ability to pupate. The large standard deviation in the controll group may provide some speculation and reason to repeat the experiment for an additional number of replicates. This could possibly provide data more accurate with our hypothesis and other experiments that have been done on Manduca sexta with JH. In a similar study done by Nijhout and Williams where they experimented with the effect of JH on pupation it was found that the presence of additional JH was able to prolong the final instar, and therefore “there is comprehensive body of evidence that a declining titre of JH is a prerequisite for pupation” [FrederikNijout: 1974]. Future experiments could also be done to examine what effect differing amounts of IGR JH have on Manduca sexta. For instance, mixing only 3 drops, or as many as 10, of JH in with the treatment group’s food in order to find how much effect JH truly has on development.
