Title: Effect of IGR on the development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Various larvae can have negative impacts on commercial farming due to their diet of crops being grown. Manduca Sexta, AKA the tobacco hornworm, is a local pest whose larvae feeds off of crops in these fields. Insecticides are used to kill off these pests, but insecticides are also known to have negative impacts on humans. Therefore, an insecticide that can only affect these larvae are ideal for agriculture. Development has led to the use of insect growth hormone (IGR) to manipulate the hormone regulatory system of these pests to negatively impact their growth cycle. This experiment followed the larvae of Manduca Sexta over the span of 15 days with larvae treated with IGR and those without. Our experiment showed no significance that IGR negatively affected Manduca Sexta larvae. However, further experiments should still be done due to some open variables in the experiment and observations made that shows some impact on larvae.  

Introduction:
Many farmers can have their crop yield damaged developing larvae and insects. One way the negative impact of insects can be minimized is with insecticides. However, insecticides also have a negative impact on humans, making them less ideal to be used on crops for human consumption. Therefore, an insecticide that would only affect developing larvae and has no effect on humans would be the most ideal form of pest controll. Recent research has developed these insecticides that only affect larvae by altering hormones found in larvae but not humans [Staal 1982]. The larvae’s unique hormones, not found in humans, are involved in development of cuticles and growth of the larvae. The abundance and concentrations of these hormones are very specific in the larvae’s life cycle. The growth cycle of our subjects, Manduca Sexta, is regulated by both ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Manduca Sexta is used due to their ease of accessibility, high prevalence in the area, and well understood physiology. Both hormones work together to signal when the caterpillar of Manduca Sexta should transition into its next instar and signal when to pupate into an adult moth [Tunaz: 2004]. It is then possible an alteration in the amount of hormones in the larvae can affect development and growth. Insect growth regulator (IGR) has been observed to adversely affect insect development and survival by disrupting both 20E and JH, inhibiting the insect’s ability to develop properly [Curtis: 1984]. IGR could also have a similar effect on Manduca Sexta development by disrupting both 20E and JH preventing the larvae’s ability to molt properly. These specific concentrations change during an organism’s life cycle and disrupting these hormones could affect Manduca Sexta survival rate since its ability to transition to its next instar and pupate is inhibited. We hypothesized that treatment of Manduca Sexta with IGR will decrease standard weight growth. 

Materials and Method:
Four Manduca Sexta caterpillars were selected for the controll group along with four experimental caterpillars. Each caterpillar received ten grams of water daily however the controll group had their food mixed with eight drops of di water, while the experimental group had their food mixed with 8 drops of insect growth regulator (IGR). The caterpillars were then fed daily and given water or IGR mixed with the fresh food respectively. The caterpillars were also weighed every five days for fifteen days along with observations on their growth were noted. A one-tailed two sample t_test was then used to determine statistical significance. 

Results:
The final mean weight for the controll group was 11.3 (+/- 5.33) grams while the experimental group had a mean weight of 12.4 (+/- 2.22) grams. A one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to analyze the results which gave a p_value of 0.381 indicating our results were not statistically significent. Observations during the experiment showed some gray texture on caterpillar 3 in the experimental group on day 5 of analysis. The experimental group also had a paler blue coloring compared to the darker blue of the controll group. There was also more variation in weights of the caterpillars as the days progressed as shown by Fig. 1. A more lethargic attitude was seen with the experimental larvae occasionally compared to our controll group. Future studies should increase sample size of the controll and experimental groups to reduce standard deviations seen. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the Manduca Sexta caterpillars will be affected by IGR was not supported by the experiment. It appears from the data that Manduca Sexta was unaffected by treatment of IGR. The data showed a p_value above .05 demonstrating that IGR does not have an impact on the caterpillar’s weight or development. Our data shows that the results from the experiment were within reasonable chance of occurring and not likely due to random chance. This is surprising considering prior evidence which showed that IGR formula prevents the ability of Manduca Sexta to molt [Tunaz: 2004]. A possible explanation for the difference in results could be due to the small sample size used (n=4) in each group. The genetic variation between each caterpillar for a variable such as weight is a factor to consider especially with a smaller sample size. However, a much larger impact would be expected on the growth of the experimental group since the hormonal signals for growth are most likely less variable than the genetic variation for size and weight. There is also the possibility that the dosage of IGR may not be sufficient enough to cause a noticeable effect on the larvae. One variable not considered when planning the experiment was the total amount of IGR metabolized by the larvae. It is a possibility that the excess amount of IGR could simply be facilitated out of the larvae as waste, showing no change. However, because there were a few observations of abnormalities seen in the larvae it is more likely that IGR had some degree of effectiveness. Since the amount of IGR was not a variable in this experiment it may be useful to conduct further experiments measuring level of IGR the larvae take in. The method by which the IGR was put into the larvae’s food also allows for more error in the experiment since there was no steps taken to ensure the distribution of IGR in the food was equal.
	It could also be possible that these larvae where in ideal conditions for them to find food, compared to wild types that may be in a crop field. The lethargic attitude noted by the experimental group could mean that the interrupted development of these larvae could result in abnormalities in function and movement to seek out food. In this aspect IGR might have the intended effect of lower survival rates in Manduca Sexta larvae, but it may not be in the intended method proposed by the experiment.  During the experiment some grey material was observed on one of the caterpillars treated with IGR, which was most likely disrupted cuticle formation since IGR has been shown to disrupt this key development pattern [Staal: 1982]. From the results it appears that the dosage of IGR given to the larvae over the selected amount of time does have some effect on the larvae. 
	From the experiment it seems that more tests should be conducted with Manduca Sexta to observe the specific effects of IGR on the larvae development. Based on weight, there is no statistical significance seen that IGR is an effective insecticide on Manduca Sexta. However, observationally there seems to be some negative impact on the larvae when treated with IGR. For further experiments the amount of IGR the larvae consume, along with method of direct application should be considered to improve upon the results of the experiment and reduce variability. Conclusively a more significent impact may be seen with further development of experiments. These experiments are still useful to commercial farmers since they can provide an alternative to insecticides which have a negative impact on the surrounding environment and human consumption.
