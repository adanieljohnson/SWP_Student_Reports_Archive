Title: The Effect of the Absence of Color Stimuli to Aggressive response level in Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Animals’ aggressive behavior is shaped by evolution and selection, associated with intraspecific competition. Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are well known for their elaborate and stereotyped aggressive displays between males. One of the aggression stimuli for male betta fish is color, as they change color when exerting aggressive behavior. In this study, whether a betta fish recognize aggression behavior by color stimuli is tested. The hypothesis that a male betta fish’s aggressive behavior will decrease in duration when the red color stimuli is absent is supported. The color change in both fish is less obvious than in clear water for the other fish, so that less aggressive behavior would arouse in response, leading to shorter duration of aggressive behavior. Further experiments can be done with confounding variable, the visibility of water. 

Introduction:
	Animals’ aggressive behavior is shaped by evolution and selection, associated with intraspecific competition. Since resource is limited, individuals that come in direct contact with another can engage in interference competition, especially between males [Birch: 1957]. Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are well known for their elaborate and stereotyped aggressive displays between males, including broadside movements and facing movements [Simpson: 1968]. Broadside movements consist of pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing, while the facing movements consist facing an opponent with pectoral fin erect, spreading opercula, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes which creates a red mane. Exertion of aggressive behavior is common between males since they compete for territory, as wells as the access to mate, a phenomenon of intrasexual selection [Brownwell:2014]. Female betta fish is shown to ‘eavesdrop’ on male fights to select the winner to mate with [Doutrelant :2000]. One of the resulted aggression stimuli for male betta fish is color, as they change color when exerting aggressive behavior. Blue betta fish respond with strongest level of aggressiveness when encountering a red betta fish model [Thompson: 1965]. In this study, whether a betta fish recognize aggression behavior by color stimuli is tested. We hypothesized that a male betta fish’s aggressive behavior will decrease in duration when the red color stimuli is absent.

Materials and Method:
Two male blue betta fish is set in a small aquarium divided into two compartments, with each in one compartment and visually isolated. For the trail group, fish 2’s compartment is dyed red with food dye; for the controll trail, both fish are in clear water. There trails are performed for each group, and trails and separated by 5 minutes breaks. In each trial, the visual block is removed for 5 minutes, appearance of aggressive movements, broadside and facing, in both fish are observed. Frequency and duration of aggressive behavior are recorded for each fish. A one tailed paired t_test are performed for both fish before the dye and after.

Results:
The tail beating and tail flashing total duration in minutes of both fish in each trail are shown in table.1. Fish 2 has longer duration in each trails in both controll and test than fish 1. Compared to before compartment 2 dyed with red dye, both fish decreased in total duration of tail flashing and tail beating.
Paired t test performed for fish 1 before the dye and after is significent(p=0.025, d.f =2, n=3); paired t test performed for fish 2 before dye and after is also significent(p=0.0022,d.f=2,n=3).


Discussion:
The hypothesis that a male betta fish’s aggressive behavior will decrease in duration when the red color stimuli is absent is supported. The duration of aggressive behavior, shown in tail beating and tail flashing, decreased for both fish after the compartment of fish 2 is dyed red. It makes sense since after the dye, the color change in both fish is less obvious than in clear water for the other fish, so that less aggressive behavior would arouse in response, leading to shorter duration of aggressive behavior. Betta fish respond to the color stimuli, while the red color is blended in the color of water, they do not recognize the other betta fish as aggressive as in the clear water, leading to a decrease in aggressiveness. However, there are confounding variables that after the dye, the visibility of water also decreases. Apart from color, the texture of the fish a betta fish encounters also plays a role in their aggressive response level, decreasing aggressive behavior strength when the scale pattern is less seen[Bando: 1991]. In red dyed water, the environment becomes much darker, therefore not only color, but texture for instance, are also harder to recognize. Further experiment could be done with different dye colors, or simply less visible water to test if it is the disappearance of color stimuli or other stimuli.
