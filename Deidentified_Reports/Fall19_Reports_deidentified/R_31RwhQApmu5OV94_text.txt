Title: How juvenile hormone increase the growth of tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta) in two weeks.

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta) are native to North Carolina with a short lifespan. The larval stages of Manduca sexta are insatiable feeders. The larvae consume the leaves of solanaceous plants, defoliating the plants. Since, tobacco hornworms are considered a common garden pest, the tobacco hornworm can cause significent economic damage to tobacco crops and occasionally tomato and potato crops [Booth, Cambron, Fisher, & Greenlee, 2015]. One approach to insect pest controll is the use of substances that adversely affect insect growth and development. Insect juvenile hormone controlls insect larval development by preventing premature metamorphosis and also contributes to a variety of other essential physiological functions, including reproduction, pheromone production, and cast differentiation [Shin et al: 2018]. Insect juvenile hormone occur in the corpus allata section of the brain. Scientist can speed up the molting process to get the caterpillars into their adult stage where they will no longer be a pest, and so an approach for the insect controll is in progress. Tobacco hornworms have eight different transformations in their life cycle. Passage from one life stage to the next requires molting, in which an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer, and molting allows the insect to change in size and or morphology [Johnson AD: 2016]. The total time it takes for the caterpillars to get from the 1st instar larva stage to the adult moth phase is between 37-46 days. Ecdysterone (20E) is a type of juvenile hormone that regulates timing of molting during insect development, and additional functions in adult insects. Precor is a juvenile hormone analogue and works similarly to ecdysterone. We will use precor to test whether the caterpillars grow through four larvae stages, then the commitment pulse, then the fifth larvae, then pupae, and finally an adult moth. Precor includes chitin synthesis inhibitors which disrupt cuticle formation, or substances that either block or overactive process regulated by JHs, ecdysteroids, and other insect hormones. During the final 5th larval instar the juvenile hormone declines to undetectable levels due to the cessation of secretion from the corpus allata coupled with the appearance of a juvenile hormone specific esterase in both the hemolymph and the tissues that degrades existing juvenile hormone. This loss of juvenile hormone allows prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) release that stimulates a small amount of ecdysone release. Ecdysone in the absence of juvenile hormone causes the cessation of feeding and the onset of wandering to find a pupation site [Abdou M.A: 2019]. These caterpillars are good to use in this experiment because there is an abundance of caterpillars and their lifecycle is within a 45-day window which is great for measuring many replications of the experiment. 
Hypothesis
If we give the caterpillars the juvenile hormone (precor), then they will grow more than the caterpillars without the hormone.


Materials and Method:
The materials for the experiment will contain 8 caterpillars, water, precor, and two plastic containers. There were eight total caterpillars. Four of the caterpillars belonged to the treatment group, and the other four were a part of the controll group. The caterpillars stayed inside plastic containers separated from each other and stayed inside of an incubator with a constant temperature of 26.5 degrees Celsius. Three drops of precor was added to the treatments group’s food and three drops of water was used on the controll group’s food. The caterpillars were measured in length using centimeters. The food was replaced each day if the food was not moist. 10 grams of food were measured out, containing each concentration of precor or water and was placed in the appropriate containers for the caterpillars to eat. Mean and standard deviation of each controll and experimental group was recorded for each day. A two sample, one-tailed statistical test was used to analyze our data and it tested using a 95% confidence interval.

Results:
The average of all the controll caterpillars’ values was 4.85cm+/-3.05 with a total of 48 measurements taken which is shown in figure 1. The one-tailed p_value was 5.809 for all of the controll and treatment values. The average of all the treatment caterpillars were 5.72cm+/-2.60 with a total of 60 measurements which was shown in figure 1. On day 6 controll 1 died and on day 12 controll 2 died. The general trend of the data shows that the controll caterpillars were growing at a constant rate and so were the treatment caterpillars. You can see this in figure 2 because the graph has a positive correlation.

Discussion:
The results did not support that if the caterpillars were given the juvenile hormone (precor), then they will grow more than the caterpillars without the hormone. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis was rejected because the one tailed p_value was statistically insignificent. The precor juvenile hormone was supposed to exponentially increase the growth of the caterpillars [Abdou M.A: 2019], but it did not show any adverse effects compared to the controll. It is possible that 3 drops of precor was not a high enough concentration to jumpstart the development of the caterpillars. Some errors that may have occurred were the death of caterpillar controll 1, on day 6 and the death of caterpillar controll 2, on day 12. The causes of their death may have been the air quality in the containers because some of the holes were bigger than others. Another possible cause for their deaths could have been the moisture of their food because if their food was moist, the caterpillars would die from dehydration. We observed that controll 2, 3, and 4 were increasing in size from the start, yet controll 1 began shrinking from day 1. This gradual decrease in length may have led to its death by the sixth day. Although controll 2 began the experiment by growing as the others did, we recorded that after a week of observation, its length also began to decrease and died by the twelfth day. After their deaths, the data recorded had to be excluded from the averages which decreased the sample size from 60 to 48. On the other hand, the treatments still had a sample size of 60, so the comparison of the two averages were not consistent. A possible error in the experiment design could have been that three different scientists had to stretch out each caterpillar every day and sometimes the caterpillars would not stretch all the way, or the scientist would not stretch them to their maximum potential. The experiment should be replicated a few more times because caterpillars had died and sometimes the caterpillars did not stretch out all the way. In the future when conducting a study like this a better way to measure the data of the experiment could be to use mass rather than weight because it will be more accurate. Another similar study that looked to find whether juvenile hormones are also effective in prohibiting growth development in insect pests concluded that different juvenile hormones can regulate the type of molt during development [Staal, G. 1976].
