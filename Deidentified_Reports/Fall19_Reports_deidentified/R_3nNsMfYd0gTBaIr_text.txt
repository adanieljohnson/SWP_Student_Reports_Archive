Title: Effects of the Juvenile Hormone on Lepidopteran Growth and Metamorphosis of Tobacco Hornworms (Manduca Sexta)

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
This experiment focuses on the biology of hormone systems and how hormones communicate with the rest of the body.  The Manduca Sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is a caterpillar that has played a significent role in the development of scientific research regarding insects and pests in their larvae form.  The pest naturally molts into a moth in roughly 39-48 days [Davidowitz: 2006].  The Manduca sexta are sufficiently well understood and act as a model for insect development [Davidowitz: 2006].  The developmental stages of these insects are controllled mainly by Juvenile Hormone (JH), Ecdysterone (E20), and Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH) [Davidowitz: 2006].  Working with JH, E20 regulates the timing of the insects molting while the JH controlls the type of molt during development and multiple functions in adult insects [Davidowitz: 2006].  The ratio in which these hormones work together is crucial to the overall development of Manduca sexta [Davidowitz: 2006].  Other experiments have linked JH to causing the caterpillars onset of metamorphosis to be delayed or prevented by neck-ligated fourth-instar tobacco hornworm larvae and by fifth instars neck-ligated before the end of feeding [Nijhout: 1980].  This experiment specifically focuses on the effects of JH on the growth and metamorphosis of Manduca sexta.  This is relevant because pesticide controll is a significent part of maintaining farm vegetation and controllling insect interactions.  By knowing how to regulate hormones in insects such as Manduca sexta, it will be helpful to know the amount and type of hormones that cause a specific response.  A better understanding of how JH affects the insect development can help in the agricultural industry.   It was hypothesized that if JH is increased during the early phases of the Manduca sexta’s life cycle, then insect development, specifically mass, will be negatively affected.  

Materials and Method:
This experiment was conducted with a controll group of four caterpillars and an experimental group of four caterpillars.  With food, time, and temperature being held constant, the dependent variable tested was the weight of the caterpillars, while the independent variable was the JH being given to the caterpillars.  The caterpillars were separated into four different compartments in the experimental and controll containers, which were labeled clearly to avoid confusion.  Students poked holes into the container to allow for a steady supply of oxygen.  The controll group was fed 10 grams of food with six drops of water for each caterpillar, while the experimental group was fed 10 grams of food with six drops of the JH enhancer, called Precor.  Before the food was given to the caterpillars, it was rolled into a small damp ball in order to fulfill the caterpillars consumption preference.  Students recorded the weight of the caterpillars everyday for 15 days and cleaned out the containers and compartments.  The food was also replaced when it had been eaten or had dried out.  The caterpillars were incubated on a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle schedule.  Data was analyzed using a two-sample t_test as the masses of the caterpillars from day one were subtracted from the masses of the caterpillars on day fourteen (p_value of .05 or less would suggest significent data while a p_value greater than .05 would suggest that the results were most likely due to chance).  This was performed in order to determine whether the weight of the controll group was meaningfully different from that of the experimental group. 

Results:
The data collected revealed that the experimental group’s masses were higher than the controll groups masses.  A trend of weight gain was observed, and the average weight gain in the controll group was 12.320 grams, while the average weight gain in the experimental group was 14.189 grams (Figure 1).  The experimental group had a standard deviation of ± 0.97 s.d., which was smaller than the ±4.26 s.d. value for the controll group (Figure 1).  The two-tailed T-test revealed a p_value of .499 (Figure 1).  The qualitative data collected showed that the controll group caterpillars maintained a healthier appearance than the experimental group, as they were swollen, active, and green (prior to pupation), while the experimental group were pale green and sluggish.  It is important to note that only three living experimental caterpillars were accounted for when averaging out the weights because one of caterpillars died on day five.  By only taking into consideration the three experimental caterpillars, students avoided skewing the weight measurements and data.  

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the caterpillars exposed to increased levels of JH during the early phases of their life cycle will experience negative developmental effects was not supported, therefore the null hypothesis was accepted.  The experimental group’s masses were higher than the controll group’s masses (Figure 1).  The large p_value of .499 suggests that the data was not significent and was most likely due to chance.  Based on the results of the experiment, it can be deduced that increased levels of JH hinder the organisms ability to pupate but do not prevent the organism from continuing to grow while the organism is in its larval stage.  In the future, performing a new experiment that does not rely solely on mass for the hypothesis would be useful to test because findings from other studies showed that altering the normal hormonal mechanism of the caterpillars is indeed responsible for the developmental standstill of Lepidoptera which diapause as mature larvae [Akai: 1989].  Endocrine controll was noted to have been involved in the decline in the titer JH and the cause of insect metamorphosis in past experiments [Nijhout: 1975].  There was an assumption issue that negative mass is equivalent to insect development, so in the future it would be important to focus on a different form of measurement to quantify insect development.  Figuring out how to best manipulate and maintain the Manduca sexta species through hormonal changes would be useful in the enhancement of crop yields in the farming industries that these caterpillars damage and is a practical application for this study.
