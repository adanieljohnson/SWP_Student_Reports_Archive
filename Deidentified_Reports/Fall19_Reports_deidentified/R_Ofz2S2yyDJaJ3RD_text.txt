Title: An increase in Juvenile Hormone levels of Manduca sexta increase the growth of larvae

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, like other insects, controlls growth, development, behaviors and other physiological processes with its endocrine system. The endocrine organs in the Manduca sends hormonal inputs to the brain that can have activation and organizational effects on the organism. Activation effects are reversible, for example a hormone signal causing a change in function. Meanwhile organizational effects are not, such as a hormone changing how the insect’s body is arranged. Two of the main hormones found in hornworms, the common name for Manduca sexta, are Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH).  Both work together to controll the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of Manduca. More specifically, 20E regulates the timing of the molting in insect development while JH regulates the type of molt. Both are necessary for the survival and development of Manduca (Johnson: 2016). 
This leads to questioning what would happen to the life cycle and development of the hornworm if the hormone levels were altered. Knowing how the worm reacts to altered hormone levels would increase our understanding of what would help this insect thrive or die prematurely. It would give us information about how it is that these hormones interact with each other. It could answer the questions: does significent levels of JH alter the effects of 20E? Does it stop development? It’s been observed by scientists that a low level of JH is needed for pupation (Nijhout: 1974). Others have found that in premetamorphic molts of Manduca, the level of JH is very low (Fain: 506). From these previous findings it seems that by increasing JH levels, we would impede molting. However, it is also a growth hormone so it could also intensify the growth of Manduca larvae. Therefore, we hypothesize that by increasing the levels of JH in the larvae, they will grow faster, and larger, than larvae with normal JH levels.


Materials and Method:
This experiment was conducted using eight Manduca sexta larvae, four of which were used for the experimental group and the remaining four were used for the controll group. The variables would be the weight of the larvae and the Precor. It’s important to note that Precor is a hormone that mimics the effects of JH and the concentration used was 1 in 250. The larvae were separated by groups and were kept isolated in plastic containers where they were fed and kept for later weighing. The key step in the experiment was feeding the Manduca. The controll group was fed ten grams of a food substance with five drops of distilled water mixed in for hydration purposes. The experiment group was also fed ten grams of food, but with five drops of Precor mixed in. This was done daily for two weeks as well as weighing the Manduca to track their growth. The statistical test used was a two-tailed two-sample t_test, comparing the controll and experimental group.

Results:
The general trend seen in Figure 1 is that the experiment group did grow larger and more quickly than the larvae in the controll group. However, there was also a fluctuation in the weight. Neither group of larvae consistently gained weight. They all slowly gained weight in the first 3 days and kept gaining weight until they reached a peak. The peak for the controll group was the 11th day while it was the 12th for the experimental group. The difference in weight between the controll and experiment group was the most pronounced at the end of the two weeks. The biggest difference between both groups being about 7 grams (the exact value being 6.8 grams). The SD for the controll group was +/-5.7 and +/-9.0 for the experimental group. The p_value was 0.046 which is less than 0.05, making the mean of our controll and experiment group statistically significent.

Discussion:
The results support our hypothesis, increasing the level of JH in the Manduca larvae resulted in them gaining more weight than those with normal levels of JH. The overall trend in both groups seems to be very similar, with a slow and then drastic increase in weight. The experiment group started gaining weight faster than the controll group starting the at the fourth day. The concentration levels of JH and 20E work together to regulate things such as growth, molting, and metamorphosis (Johnson: 11), so it makes sense that the increase of JH resulted in an increase in the growth of the larvae. Our results also replicate those found in other studies, that the increase in JH does not result in the pupation of the larvae. It may have actually inhibited it, based on the findings that during the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm, the presence of JH inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and therefore the corpora allata ceases to secrete JH in order to begin pupating (Nijhout: 493).  
It would now be interesting to study the effects an increase in 20E would have on the larvae to compare against the effects the increased JH levels had. Maybe it would make it clearer to see the main effect these hormones have on the Manduca. However, this study could also be modified by changing the point in the Manduca’s life cycle at which this experiment is ran. This could result in the JH affecting the regulation of another aspect of the Manduca such as the molting or metamorphosis. The same could be done with 20E. Both hormones work together to move a Manduca through its life cycle so more research is needed to understand exactly what each hormone is controllling at difference stages of the life cycle.
	Through this experiment we have been able to discover that an increase in the JH levels of Manduca larvae result in larvae that are heavier than average. It can be concluded that altering the JH levels of larvae will not be helpful in the pest controll of these insects. If anything, it would be the opposite of pest controll because it would result in larvae that do not pupate faster but grow much larger, although whether they consume more food than normal larvae cannot be concluded.  However, these results may differ if we changed the amount of Precor given to Manduca. An increased or smaller dosage may have effects different to the ones we collected. However, it is clear that the life cycle of the insect is dependent on a careful balance of JH and 20E for its growth. It seems insect endocrine systems are complex, and many different variables come together to go through a life cycle. The study of insect endocrine systems can be thus used as an example for insight into more complex organisms’ endocrine systems.
