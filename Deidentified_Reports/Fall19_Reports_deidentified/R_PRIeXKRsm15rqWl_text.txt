Title: The Impact of Phosphorus of Resource Allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum (Buckwheat)

Abstract:
Resource allocation is a process used by all plant species to adapt to changing resource availability in different environments. Fagopyrum esculentum, or buckwheat, is one such plant. Calculating the root to shoot ratio can assist in determining resource allocation in buckwheat plants. Phosphorus is a key nutrient in buckwheat growth, and varying amounts can alter resource allocation. We hypothesized that buckwheat plants exposed to greater levels of phosphorus would have a higher root to shoot ratio than those exposed to no added phosphorus. Eight plants were watered every day for 14 days with bone meal and eight plants were watered every day for 14 days with just water, and then each plant was harvested and the root to shoot ratio was calculated. Our results show no statistical significance in the difference between the average root to shoot length ratio in the two groups. We concluded this was due to oversaturation of phosphorus, hindering overall plant growth. While this experiment was not helpful in demonstrating resource allocation, it shows how excess nutrients can influence plant growth and cause environmental problems.

Introduction:
Resources that plants use to grow such as the amount of sunlight, temperature, competition with other biotic factors, and the availability of water and nutrients can vary depending on the environment. One of the ways plants adapt to this variability is a phenomenon called resource allocation, which allows for increased growth and development in the areas of the plant that have a greater need for resources [Ruan: 2013]. Resource allocation is a useful tool when determining how a plant responds to its individual environment is comparison with a plant of the same species in a different environment. A good measurement for how plants use resource allocation is determining the root to shoot ratio. The root of a plant typically extracts water and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur from the soil, while a shoot is comprised of the leaves and stem of a plant. Leaves are used for photosynthesis and carbon dioxide intake, while the stem maintains the structure of the plant. The root to shoot ratio can be used for either length or weight of the plant and helps determine which part of the plant had more substantial growth. It is calculated by taking the root calculation and dividing it by the shoot calculation. Typically, the smaller the value, the more resource allocation has favored the shoot, and vice versa. Buckwheat, or Fagopyrum esculentum, is an example of an organism that uses resource allocation, and it is an ideal organism for measuring this process because of its short growth time and its visible distinction between the root and the shoot. As mentioned previously, phosphorus is one of the key nutrients absorbed by the roots and is crucial for the process of cell division, membrane formation, and maintaining homeostasis, making it a vital nutrient for growing plants [Shen: 2011]. When more phosphorus is available in an environment, more resources are allocated to growing the roots to acquire more phosphorus from the soil, because it slowly diffuses and is often limited in the environment, so more roots and root hairs would allow for greater diffusion of phosphorus into the plant [Shen: 2011]. When there is less phosphorus (or other nutrients) in the soil, more resources are allocated to growing the stems and leaves so that photosynthesis can occur at a higher rate [Lopez-Bucio: 2003]. Phosphorus is available in bone meal, or P2O5, a fertilizer specifically made for soil lacking in phosphorus. For this experiment, we hypothesized that buckwheat plants watered with bone meal would have a higher root to shoot length ratio than plants watered with just H2O, which implies that a greater presence of phosphorus causes the process of resource allocation to favor growth of roots as opposed to shoots. 



Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we planted eight pots containing buckwheat plants labeled “High Phosphorus” and eight pots containing buckwheat plants labeled “No Phosphorus”. Each pot consisted of ten pre-soaked buckwheat seeds buried shallowly in vermiculite. Every pot was placed in a greenhouse with the same temperatures and humidity levels. The high phosphorus group was watered once every 24 hours with 100ml of a mixture of water and 20% 2x bone meal. The no phosphorus group was watered every 24 hours with 100ml of distilled water. After 14 days, two samples from each pot were collected. The length of both the root and the shoot were measured for every sample and the root to shoot ratio was calculated. A paired t-test with an alpha value of 0.05 was used to compare the root:shoot ratio for the high phosphorus group and the no phosphorus group.

Results:
Our results show that the average root:shoot ratio between the high phosphorus group and the no phosphorus group had no statistical difference with a two-tailed p-value of 0.76 and 30 degrees of freedom (Figure 2). There was also no statistical significance between the average root length with a two-tailed p-value of 0.08 and 30 degrees of freedom (Figure 1). However, there was statistical significance between the average shoot length of the two groups with a two-tailed p-value of 0.002 and 30 degrees of freedom. Upon observation, the group of high phosphorus plants had fewer sprouts than the no phosphorus group and were much duller in color, while the no phosphorus plants were a vibrant green color. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis. Although the root:shoot length ratio for the no phosphorus plants was slightly higher, there was not a significant difference between the two groups. However, the results of the difference between the average root length and the average shoot length show there was an increase of general growth in the plants not given excess phosphorus. This is most likely due to the oversaturation of phosphorus in the experimental group. The specific brand of bone meal that was used recommends use twice a year, whereas our experiment used the recommended amount daily. Excess phosphorus in the soil causes plants to be unable to absorb micronutrients such as zinc and iron, which are also essential to plant growth [Provin: 2014]. This causes poor plant health and decreased plant growth. This explanation is also most likely the cause between the appearances of the two groups in both color and the number of sprouts in each plant. Although there was a difference in color, the most recognizable sign of excess phosphorus is stunted plant growth, which was observed during the experiment [Shen: 2011]. While this experiment was not a good depiction of true resource allocation, it shows how varying levels of nutrients can impact the growth of a plant, especially in excess. If this experiment were to be altered, the amount of phosphorus would need to be drastically lowered to prevent the risk of oversaturation and provide a more reliable experiment to study resource allocation. It would also be beneficial to take more samples from each pot so that the data can be enriched and more reliable. The results of this experiment show how damaging excess nutrients in the soil can be to growing plants, which has caused significant problems in the past. Excess phosphorus can cause alterations in soil pH, cause pollution in groundwater systems and rivers, and influence algal growth [US Department of Commerce: 2019]. This environmental damage, called nutrient pollution, shows how imperative it is to be conscious of nutrient content in the soil, especially when using additive fertilizers. Resource allocation, while influenced by the environment, becomes almost entirely inhibited when nutrients in the soil are in excess.
