Title: The effect of juvenile hormone on the growth of the immature Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Many hormones influence the development of many species from the immature stage to the adult stage of life. Juvenile hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) are two of these hormones. 20E, produced in the prothoracic glands, regulates the type of development. JH, produced in the corpus allatum, regulates the timing of molting. Manduca sexta is a moth that lives throughout North America. In its larval stage, Manduca sexta feeds on foliage and other crops, affecting North America’s agriculture. Thus, studying the growth of Manduca sexta can possibly help prevent negative agricultural consequences. Since they are considered pests when they are larvae, it could be beneficial for Manduca sexta to become adults as quickly as possible. They are good model organisms because they are easy to obtain and are numerous in population. Researchers studied juvenile hormone and juvenile hormone esterase, which helps clear away juvenile hormone in fifth instar larvae. [Browder: 2001]. Usually, juvenile hormone esterase reaches a peak right before Manduca sexta starts to look for a place to pupate, suggesting to researchers that it might play a role in the timing of pupation [Browder: 2001]. The researchers found that juvenile hormone esterase did not affect the timing of pupation [Browder: 2001]. We wa

Introduction:
Many hormones influence the development of many species from the immature stage to the adult stage of life. Juvenile hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) are two of these hormones. 20E, produced in the prothoracic glands, regulates the type of development. JH, produced in the corpus allatum, regulates the timing of molting. Manduca sexta is a moth that lives throughout North America. In its larval stage, Manduca sexta feeds on foliage and other crops, affecting North America’s agriculture. Thus, studying the growth of Manduca sexta can possibly help prevent negative agricultural consequences. Since they are considered pests when they are larvae, it could be beneficial for Manduca sexta to become adults as quickly as possible. They are good model organisms because they are easy to obtain and are numerous in population. Researchers studied juvenile hormone and juvenile hormone esterase, which helps clear away juvenile hormone in fifth instar larvae. [Browder: 2001]. Usually, juvenile hormone esterase reaches a peak right before Manduca sexta starts to look for a place to pupate, suggesting to researchers that it might play a role in the timing of pupation [Browder: 2001]. The researchers found that juvenile hormone esterase did not affect the timing of pupation [Browder: 2001]. We wanted to determine if juvenile hormone would affect the growth of the caterpillar. If we treat the Manduca sexta with ten drops of Juvenile Hormones in their food, we predict there will be a negative effect on the timing of their transition to the pupal stage and they will lose weight. 

Materials and Methods:
The control group had four Manduca sexta caterpillars and the experimental group had four Manduca sexta. We fed each caterpillar ten grams of food: the control group’s food had ten drops of deionized water while the experimental group’s food had ten drops of JH. The caterpillars’ food was replaced appropriately. We weighed them once a day, for fifteen days, and they stayed in the incubator. We used a two sample T-test to determine significance of our results.  

Results:
The caterpillars were quite small at the start of the experiment. All caterpillars except for experimental caterpillar #4 seemed to grow rapidly. As the experiment continued, the caterpillars became more responsive to touch, often curling up their bodies when we picked them up. The caterpillars in both the control group and the experimental group gained weight each day. As shown in Figure 1, the control group’s average mass was 14.10 grams (sd=0.66), and the experimental group’s average mass was 13.16 grams (sd=1.52). The one-tailed p-value was 0.15 (α = 0.05)

Discussion:
Our group hypothesized that the experimental group caterpillars would weigh significantly less than the control group caterpillars. Although the average weight of the experimental group was 0.96 grams less than that of the control group, the p-value was 0.15; therefore, the difference in weight was not significant. The data did not support our alternative hypothesis. Instead, the data supports our null hypothesis, indicating that the control group’s larger average weight was coincidental. A biological explanation for the results we observed could be that the amount of JH given to the experimental group was not enough to change the signaling of the normal development process. Juvenile hormone is the hormone that keeps the caterpillars in the larval stages. According to other studies, JH has actually promoted weight gain in other insects. Researchers compared the effect of juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta and Drosophila [Mirth: 2013]. To do so, they used the established role of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta: to manage body size and the timing of metamorphosis [Mirth: 2013]. The researchers note that if more juvenile hormone is present, the larvae have more time to grow; thus, they could grow to be bigger than those whose juvenile hormone supply has been naturally cut off by their bodies [Mirth: 2013]. This phenomena might be best studied by researchers who have more time with their caterpillars and can see the immature insects into the adult stages. Upon replication, the researcher should take care to choose caterpillars with similar initial weights to more eliminate any discrepencies in the rate at which different caterpillars can grow. Choosing similarly-sized caterpillars would also help standardize the methodology, as the average of the experimental group’s weight was brought down by experimental caterpillar #4. As larvae, Manduca sexta are pests that can disrupt agricultural patterns, so it would be beneficial for Manduca sexta to molt into moths as soon as possible. The increased presence of juvenile hormone does not necessarily prevent the molt from occurring; as suggested by Mirth, it may even allow the immature caterpillars to grow larger before they molt. Previous studies such as Mirth’s demonstrate that hormones play an important role in insect development. Growth hormones are not just insect-specific; many species have some kind of endocrine system that regulates development.
