Title: Effect of Phosphorus and Nitrogen on the Root and Shoot Growth of Mung Bean

Abstract:
In the agriculture industry and every day gardening, the use of added nutrient solution is widely used to efficiently and effectively grow produce. Specifically, since nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur are necessary nutrients, certain environments lack such nutrients, so solutions that include concentrations of these nutrients help the plants grow. Each nutrient is used in different ways by the plant such as one nutrient helps with length growth meanwhile another nutrient may be used to give the plant its color. Excessive nutrients or nutrient leaching can be a problem in agriculture and can even cause excessive growth, especially with algae blooms. There are specific concentrations that help produce grow ideally without damaging the plant or causing excessive growth; moreover, certain concentrations of nutrients can be used together can damage the plant, stunt the plants growth, or give maximum efficiency. 

Introduction:
Plant growth is affected by abiotic and biotic factors including community plant interactions. When there is resource limitation, plants have evolved to use a technique called resources allocation and trade-offs. Resources allocation describes the process in which the species limit resources to structures on the organism that do not gather enough sunlight or energy that help the organism survive, meaning it will limit resources to the structures of the plant that help survival. This is also leads to trade-off when a plant redistributes resources from one structure to another structure to reduce wasted energy. Plants allocation patterns vary based on the environment, limiting nutrients, and structures such as leaves, roots, and stems. The roots gather nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, and water from the soil. The stems allocate the water, nutrients, glucose, and energy throughout the plants for new growth and storage. The leaves father solar energy and carbon dioxide from the air for photosynthesis. Thus, we hypothesize that if we treat separate groups of mung bean plants with nitrogen, phosphorus, nitrogen and phosphorus, or nothing, then the root length will be the greatest in the nitrogen treated group. Specifically phosphorus is used for synthesis of ATP which in turn is used for the uptake for nitrogen, and nitrogen is used for amino acid synthesis [Malik: 2003]. Thus Nitrogen and Phosphorus can be used in combination or alone, depending on the plant, to increase yield and quality of the produce. For example, phosphorus is important in the formation of carbohydrates, diseases resistance, maturation of crop, and root development [Arya: 1988].

Materials and Method:
48 mung beans were soaked in water for 24 hours. We used 8 pots total with 2 for each group, and labeled one as controll, one as Phosphorus-treated, one as Phosphorus & Nitrogen-treated, and one Nitrogen-treated. For every pot, we filled it soil, completely soaked them in water, and let the excess water drain. We made three holes spread apart in each pot and placed 2 seeds in each hole then covered with dirt. For the controll group, we only treated the seeds with plain water every day. For the Phosphorus-treated group, treat with water and 50 Ml of phosphorus solution of 20% P2O5. For the Nitrogen-treated group, treated the plant with water and 50 Ml of nitrogen solution of 32% nitrate. For the Phosphorus & Nitrogen-treated group, we treated it with water and 25 Ml of the same nitrogen solution and 25 Ml of the same phosphorus solution. We repeated this process every day around the same hour of each day. If the pots are too saturated with water on a given day, we reduced the amount of water given that day. After 2 weeks of growth, we harvested the plants without tearing the roots off the stem, washed the dirt off the roots, dried them with a paper towel, and measured in centimeters the length of the roots, shoots, and calculate the root-to-shoot ratio. We made sure to measure every root up to the change in color on the stem to keep consistency. Finally after gathering the data, we used the ANOVA test to measure the significance of the data. 


Results:
According to FIgures 1 and 2, the results showed the controll group with the greatest growth for root length ( avg=11.5 cm) and shoot length ( avg=8.75 cm), and it had the smallest root to shoot ratio (avg=1.31). The combination treated group of nitrogen and phosphorus had resulted in having the least growth of root length (avg=8.5 cm) and shoot length (avg=2.5 cm) with the greatest difference in root to shoot length ratio (avg=3.4). The nitrogen-treated group and the phosphorus-treated group both had about the same statistics, but the phosphorus-treated group had slightly more length across the board. According to the ANOVA test, for root length had no significent correlation between the 4 groups (p value = 0.565). For shoot length, there is one significent correlation between the combination-treated group and the controll group, but the other comparisons had no significance (p value = 0.041).

Discussion:
We were looking at the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus on the plant growth and how the plant will allocate those resources. However, according to the ANOVA test proving there is no significance between our data, we cannot prove our hypothesis. For the most part we cannot conclude that our data for the root length can be explained, but our shoot length has significent, so it can be a reference in our explanation. 
The composition of mungbean seeds are 24.0% protein, 1-3% fat, and 50.4% carbohydrates, and phosphorus accounts for 367mg per 100 grams of seed, meaning that nitrogen is needed more in concentration than phosphorus [Phoehlman 1991]. However, nitrogen and phosphorus can be used together to increase yield and improve the quality of the produce; increasing phosphorus uptake increased the nitrogen uptake and protein content of mung beans [Dewanfan, 1992]. Nitrogen and Phosphorus are essential for protein synthesis of proteins and cellular function. 
Ours results proved to be insignificent through the anova testing. This means there could have been room for error. For example, there could have been other nutrients leached, too much water, too much sunlight, pests could intervene, too humid; they could have been human errors, abiotic, or biotic errors. For the first week, most of our plants did not grow, except for 3 seed from the controll which is not enough for data, so we had to replant 3 seeds in each pot at the beginning of the second week. Thus, we do not know what could be the cause of the error.
