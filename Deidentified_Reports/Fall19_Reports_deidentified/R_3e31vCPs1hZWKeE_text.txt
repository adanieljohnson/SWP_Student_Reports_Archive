Title: Effect of Water Color on Betta splendens Agonistic Behaviors

Abstract:
	Animals exhibit interspecific behaviors, or behaviors that are only practiced within their own species. The Betta splendens species exhibit interspecific behaviors relating to aggression, otherwise called agonistic behaviors. These include color changing, tail flashing and beating, red mane exhibition, and biting. These agonistic behaviors are ranked in order from least aggressive to most aggressive. These behaviors are recognized between male Betta splendens. In this experiment, two blue male Betta splendens were observed at rest, visually isolated from each other. Then, the opaque barrier was lifted so they could each see each other. Their behaviors were recorded for three minutes, and this process was repeated three times with five minutes of rest between each observation. Then, one side of the tank was dyed with red food dye. The same observations were done with the red food coloring in the tank, thus changing each Betta’s perception of the other. The biological alternate hypothesis was that when the tank was dyed red, both Betta splendens would demonstrate fewer aggressive behaviors towards each other due to visual impairment. This hypothesis was supported by our results, which leads us to believe that color is a main standard for Betta fish recognizing agonistic behaviors.

Introduction:
	Ethologists aim to understand the physical purpose of behavior and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. Betta splendens, originating in southeast Asia and indigenous to small, muddy ponds, show aggressive, or agonistic, behaviors between males [Johnson: 2019]. These behaviors are easily observable and Betta splendens are easily obtainable, which makes observations and quantification in behavioral studies efficient [Forsatkar: 2016]. include body color saturation, erection of the operculae with extension of the branchiostegal membranes (otherwise called red mane), and tail flashing and tail beating, and biting [Figler: 1975]. Behaviors have increasing aggressiveness, with tail flashing being least aggressive and red mane and biting being the most aggressive [Johnson: 2019]. Betta fish will also orient themselves in either a broadside display or front facing display, with broadside being least aggressive and facing display being more aggressive [Halperin: 1997].  When male Betta fish recognize some or all of these behaviors in other male Bettas, they will either match them, surpass them, or become habituated [Figler: 1975]. Since color changing is an agonistic behavior observed in males, the Betta splendens will recognize when the other fish turns a darker color, thus leading them to be more aggressive than the first fish [Lucas: 1968]. It is also found that Betta splendens are also more agonistic towards each other when vision is unobstructed and when they can clearly see the other Betta fish [Bronstein: 1983]. Obscured waters, such as water discoloration, will change the Betta’s perception of other male Betta fish and their exhibited behaviors such as color change, which then changes the reaction of the first Betta fish [Figler: 1975]. Therefore, the biological alternate hypothesis is if the color of the water were altered so that the coloring of the Betta fish was also altered, this would result in less agonistic behaviors, specifically tail beating, tail flickering, and red mane exhibition.

Materials and Methods:
	For this experiment, we obtained two male, blue Betta splendens from the Biology 113 laboratory. They were placed in one tank with an opaque divider and a transparent divider separating them. They were both given five minutes of rest, then the opaque divider was lifted. The two fish were observed for three minutes, three times, with five minutes of rest between each observation period (the opaque divider was replaced to ensure rest). Then, we obtained red food coloring from the Biology 113 laboratory and put seven drops on one side of the divider and let the dye diffuse throughout that side. The Betta splendens with the red dye was labeled “Fish 2”, and the Betta splendens without the dye was labeled “Fish 1”. We then lifted the opaque divider again, and observed the fish for three minutes, three times, with five minutes of rest between each observation period (the opaque divider was replaced to ensure rest). We recorded when the Red Mane was displayed, when tail beating and tail flashing happened, when the dorsal fin was erect, broadside and facing displays, and how long each of these behaviors lasted for each fish. A one-tailed T-test was performed to analyze the statistical significance of the duration of tail beating and tail flashing for both fish. Another one-tailed T-test was performed to analyze the significance of the red mane display for both fish. The average duration of tail beating, tail flashing, and red mane exposure is represented in a bar graph for each fish. 

Results:
Both Betta fish exhibited significant agonistic behaviors towards each other before the water had been colored. Fish 1 practiced tail beating and tail flashing for half of the observation time (1.34 minutes) before habituation occurred, and fish 2 practiced tail flashing and beating for the majority of the observation time (2.37 minutes) before habitation occurred. Upon habituation, both fish returned to normal swimming behaviors (slow movements, relaxed fins, moving from top to bottom slowly). A similar phenomenon happened with red mane exhibition – fish 1 had a red mane for 0.42 minutes, and fish 2 had a red mane for 0.49 minutes. After coloration, the fish without the red dye (fish 1) exhibited no agonistic behaviors towards fish 2. He never had a red mane, and never practiced tail beating or flashing. However, fish 2 did exhibit agonistic behaviors towards fish 1. He had less tail flashing and beating (average = 0.40 minutes), but his red mane lasted the same amount of time (average = 0.48 minutes). The standard deviation of fish 1 tail beating and flashing was 0.95, p=0.01. The standard deviation of fish 2 tail beating and flashing was 1.40, p=&lt;0.000.  The standard deviation of fish 1 red mane exhibition was 0.30, p=&lt;0.00. The standard deviation of fish 2 red mane exhibition was 0.29, p=0.48. 

Discussion:
	Our hypothesis, that if water is dyed it would alter the perception of one male Betta splendens to another therefore resulting in less agonistic behaviors between both Betta splendens, was supported by our results. We saw that fish 1 and fish 2 exhibited tail beating, tail flashing, and red mane during the control observational period, which is typical for Betta fish when visually stimulated by another Betta fish [Bronstein: 1983]. Since tail beating and tail flashing is a less aggressive behavior than the red mane, it makes sense that the red mane appeared less in the observation period [Johnson: 2019]. When the water of fish 2 was colored with the red food dye, fish 1 had no agonistic behaviors towards fish 1, while fish 1 exhibited significantly less agonistic behaviors towards fish 2. This leads us to believe that the red dye resulted in altered perception of the fish 2 from the perspective of fish 1, which made fish 1 not threatened by fish 2. When Betta fish perceive other Betta fish as a threat, they will change colors to a darker, more dense color than that of their relaxed state [Lucas: 1968]. Betta fish have been seen to attack those of their own kind, meaning species but also coloration. We had two blue male Betta splendens, so both fish originally recognized the other as one of their own [Gelacio: 2019]. Upon coloring the water, fish 1 no longer recognized fish 2 as one of his own because he saw him as a red Betta instead of blue, like him. Fish 2 recognized fish 1 more but practiced significantly less aggressive behaviors than during the control observational periods. Since each of the three observational periods for the control and experimental groups had similar durations of tail beating, flashing, and red mane, we know neither fish habituated to the other over the six total observational periods. Our hypothesis being supported proves that Betta splendens use color as a main parameter in determining agonistic behaviors and whether other male Betta splendens are displaying aggression. This observation speaks to the basis of behavioral changes in interspecific competition seen in many species, which helps ethologists understand the physical purpose of interspecific behaviors and how they have been preserved by natural selection.
