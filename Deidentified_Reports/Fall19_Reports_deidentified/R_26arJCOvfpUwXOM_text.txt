Title: Agonistic responses of male betta fish (Betta splendins) in response to living and non-living stimuli based on visual cues

Abstract:
This experiment sought to assess the agnostic reactions of male betta fish (Betta splendins) to a variety of stimuli including another male betta fish, a betta-shaped decoy, and a circular cutout. We measured the time in seconds after the start of each trial until the first agnostic behavior (such as broadside or facing movements) was displayed. It was hypothesized that the fish would react aggressively only to the live fish because it would look for behavioral cues that indicate the presence of another male betta, indicating the need for male-male competition for mates. The data showed that the male bettas reacted agnostically to both the live fish and the betta-shaped decoy but not the circular cutout. These results show the importance of visual cues in eliciting aggressive or competitive behaviors in male betta fish and potential use of decoys in future ethology experiments. 

Introduction:
Ethology, or the study of animal behavior, seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors by using observational skills. It focuses on the genetic, physiological, and learned actions of organisms and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. One such observed behavior is intraspecific agonism, or aggression in the presence of members of an animal’s own species [Johnson: 2019]. The fish species Betta splendins is an appropriate species to analyze intraspecific agnostic behavior because they use clearly-defined and colorful displays in the presence of other betta fish. Their behaviors include broadside movements, such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing, and facing movements, including erecting pectoral fins, spreading its gill covers (opercula) and protruding the branchiostegal membranes located underneath the opercula, displaying a red “mane” [Johnson: 2019]. Our study sought to investigate whether male bettas use body shape as a cue for these agnostic behaviors or whether they only display threatening behaviors in response to another fish’s behavior. Past studies have shown that there is a connection between agnostic behavior and body shape. For example, one study presented male bettas with a series of decoys, including robotic fish and cylindrical dummies, finding that male bettas showed more aggressive behavior to robotic fish than cylindrical dummies. This indicates that bettas respond to shape and movement, not the mere presence of another object [Romano: 2017]. In order to further test the cues for agnostic behavior in male bettas, we presented subjects with a live fish, a fish-shaped decoy, and a foam circle. Our hypothesis was that the fish would react aggressively only to the live fish because it would look for behavioral cues that indicate the presence of another male betta, indicating the need for male-male competition for mates. 

Materials and Method:
4 male Betta splendins were used as subjects. Each subject was exposed to another live male betta in the same tank separated by a transparent partition. We recorded the time (in seconds) when we noticed the first sign of agnostic behavior, stopping at 300 seconds if no agnostic behavior was displayed. We then gave the subjects a 5 minute rest period. Next the subjects were exposed to a blue circular foam cut-out. We placed this in the tank with the subject male, again separated by the transparent partition, and recorded time until agnostic behavior. We then gave a 5 minute rest period. Finally, we placed a Betta-shaped decoy in the tank with the subject, separated by the transparent partition, and recorded time until agnostic behavior. We used an ANOVA test with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test to analyze the data. 

Results:
The results show that the bettas had the quickest response of agnostic behavior toward the live betta male, followed by the betta decoy, and did not respond to the circle cutout (Figure 1). The bettas did not show agnostic behavior toward the circle cutout, resulting in a mean of 300s (the default) and a standard deviation of +/- 0. In one test, the beta did show an aggressive behavior toward the circle cutout after 26s, but we identified this data point as an outlier and retested, resulting in the data point of 300s. The bettas showed agnostic behavior toward the betta-shaped decoy after a mean time of 75s with a standard deviation of +/- 85.8. The bettas showed agnostic behavior toward the live betta after a mean time of 43s with a standard deviation of +/- 53.89. A one-way ANOVA was significent at p= 0.000293. A Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test determined that the Circle and Decoy tests as well as the Circle and Betta tests produced significent results, while the Decoy and Betta tests were not significent. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that betta fish would only display agnostic behavior in the presence of a live betta was not supported because the subjects did display agnostic behavior in the presence of the betta-shaped decoy, although they responded more slowly. They did not respond to the circular foam cut-out, indicating that body shape is a key factor in eliciting an aggressive response rather than movement. This could be because male betta fish are evolutionarily wired to identify visual cues such as shape and general appearance of other males of the same species in order to compete for mates. This is in line with other studies, which have found that bettas display agnostic behavior in response to dummies. For example, one study presented both a betta-shaped dummy and a live male betta to subject betta males, watching for opercular flaring, an agnostic behavior. They found that the males behaved with opercular flaring to both the dummy and a live betta [Dziewecynski: 2010]. Our results could be retested in the future by increasing the number of subjects and testing more variables, such as color and other shapes of the decoy. Using more test subjects would make it easier to identify outliers (such as the one we removed from our data) and reduce their impact. Furthermore, these analyses could further specify the type of decoy that elicits a reaction. This type of information is useful in the field of ethology because it shows that decoys, when constructed properly, can make effective stimuli in social experiments and can be used to gain more information about animal behavior while also allowing for more controll of the experiment [Dziewecynski: 2010].
