Title: The Inhibition of Ecdysterone by E20 inhibitor in the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta also known as the tobacco horned worm is a native species to Winston-Salem. The worm is a pest and studies are being conducted in order to try and deal with the pest problem. Rather than using harmful chemicals and pesticides to kill off the worms IGR’s are used. IGR’s (insect growth regulators) change the development of the worm in order to stop the reproduction and function of the worm. The tobacco horned worm does not develop reproduction organs until it is a full blow adult, so the IGR’s keep the worm from reaching adulthood at the proper time. The IGR that is used in this lab is E20 inhibitor. The E20 is stopping the production of the Ecdysterone in the worm. Ecdysterone is a hormone present during the times of molting in the worm. Hormones allow communication throughout cells from one point in the body to another target area. By applying E20 inhibitor to block the communication of Ecdysterone to the rest of the body the worm will be prevented from molting and remain in its first development stage. 
The purpose of this lab is to see the effect of inhibiting Ecdysterone in the hornworm to stop development and the reproduction of the worm. The result expected is feeding E20 inhibitors to the Manduca Sexta insects will slow the timing of the molting process during development, resulting in decreased mass gain, and prevent it from pupating at the proper time. 


Materials and Method:
The lab began by collecting the Manduca Sexta from the larva stage or first instar stage and placing eight worms in separate containers. Each worm was given a name and number. Holes were punched in the side of each section of the containers. The worms were separated into two groups. Four worms were chosen to be the controll group and the other four were the experimental group. In this Lab the experimental group was given the 7 drops of E20 inhibitor in their food while the controll group was given 7 drops of water in their food. The worms were then monitored for three weeks being weighed and inspected every day, and the food was changed when dried up. When the food was replaced due to dryness or consumption the controll group received new food with 7 drops of water again and the experimental group received food with 7 drops of E20 inhibitor. When the experiment was completed the worms were weighed a final time and pictures were taken to record and observe and the worms were disposed of in a freezer. 

Results:
The data collected agreed with the hypothesis showing the result of inhibiting the molting of the young worm into other instar phases. Th E20 inhibitor blocked the production of Ecdysterone hormone from reaching the target cells in the worm prohibiting molting. The controll group grew at a normal pace increasing in mass and going through the normal molting phases. The amount of food consumed increased as the controll worms grew at a steady pace while the experimental worms remained small and consumed very little amount of food. The Experimental group after some days of being fed the E20 inhibitor began to lose mass and some died. The data collected showed a P Value of 0.000247 which rejects the Null hypothesis. The averages for controll group is 0.85 and the average for experimental is 0.08125. 

Discussion:
The Lab provided a great look into the life of the Manduca Sexta and how hormones effect the life and development of animals. The lab was easy to follow, and the data was easy to collect allowing for solid results to support the hypothesis. The Manduca Sexta is a very interesting animal and watching it grow through the instar phases showed the importance of healthy secretion of hormones throughout the body. The Lab also allowed an InSite on how the Manduca Sexta can be eliminated as a pest to tobacco plants by releasing non harmful chemicals, like the E20 inhibitor, into the fields to eliminate the pest ethically through the use of IGR’s.
The Lab could have been improved by keeping the amount of inhibitor given the experimental group below 5 drops. The worms in this lab died quickly due to an over ingestion of the hormone. Lowering the amount of E20 inhibitor would allow the worms to molt once or twice to be at a stage for predators to consume and therefore not breaking the cycle of the tobacco fields. The statistical significance of this lab is showing that the null hypothesis was rejected due to a P Value of 0.000247
