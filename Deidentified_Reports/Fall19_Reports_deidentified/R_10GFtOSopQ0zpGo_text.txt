Title: Manduca Sexta Juvenile growth hormone experiment  

Abstract:
None

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta also is known as the tobacco hornworm in the Sphingidae family was studied in the experiment. The hornworm goes through states all the way up to the adult stage which is when the subject goes through a metamorphosis and becomes a moth. The stage in which the subjects were during the lab was the hornworm stage otherwise known as the larva state. The insect starts in eggs then goes through 1st instar larva up to 5th instar larva, then the Hornworm enters its pupa stage to finally end the cycle as an adult moth. The hornworm is found throughout the United States and is considered a pest at their larval stage, but not at their final stage as a moth, which is controlled by multiple hormones [Jones:1981]. The Manduca Sexta itself is bright green in color and it is referred to as a hornworm, this is derived from the horn structure located at the end of its body. Juvenile hormone, otherwise known as JH, is produced in the Corpus allata and this is what regulates the type of molting during the insect’s life cycle. During the cycle up until the 5th instar larva, the Juvenile hormone levels are high. Once the 5th stage begins the juvenile hormone drops and Ecdysterone (20E) rises to start triggering the next stage of development [Jones:1981]. In this study that was conducted over a 15 day period of time the group studyed and assessed the effect of the JH activator on the deveopment of the Manduca Sexta. The hypothesis was that if the Manduca Sexta is given a synthetic juvenile hormone activator, then the Manduca Sexta will not develop as fast as the Manduca sexta wi

Materials and Methods:
In the experiment, there were two separate sets of 4 Manduca sextas each in their own individual slot in the plastic containers. Before placing each hornworm into the containers all the subjects were weighed individually. After the mass was taken, each slot was labeled and each slot was punctured with 2 holes on the sides to allow oxygen flow. The first set of hornworms, which were the control group were given the same amount of food (10g) and 10 drops of water were added to the food. The second group was in a separate container and was given the same amount of food with 10 drops of water and 10 drops of the juvenile hormone (JH). The experiment continued for 15 days and everyday each individual worm was weighed and recorded. If the food was dry, more water was added to the control and more of the juvenile hormone (JH) was added to the opposite test group. The statistical test that was used was the two-tailed T-test, this test was used to show whether or not the data happened by chance.

Results:
After the 15 days that the lab took place, the data shown in (Figure 1) shows the change in mass over time by showing the mean of the data for each of the 8 tobacco hornworms for the controlled and treatment groups. Over the given 15-day period the controlled and the treatment groups had similar patterns of growth in their mass. The treatment group grew to have a greater overall mass comparative to the control group with no Juvenile growth Hormone [Lawrence:1961].The group decided to test the two individual groups using the “Two-sample t-test”. In the data, there was a significant difference in the mean of the mass of the two groups. The data given had the degrees of freedom at df=6, the t-value at t-value= 6.874716, and finally, the two-tailed p-value which was P=.000467. The data of the group was rejected because P=.000467 was below 0.5 which rejects the null hypothesis.

Discussion:
The hypothesis of the group was “If the Manduca Sexta is given a synthetic juvenile hormone activator, then the Manduca Sexta will not develop as fast as the Manduca sexta with no activator” was rejected by the experiment. This was important because the Manduca sextas mass affects the molting process because the subject must reach a certain stage before it can start the metamorphosis process [Yuichiro:2013]. The treatment group that was given the juvenile growth activator grew to have larger masses than the controlled group in the experiment with no JH. The results from the mean values of both the controlled and the activator groups shown by the two-tailed p-value rejected the hypothesis. The group could have made mistakes during the experimental process which could have affected the results. If the food was too dry and more water and or activator wasn’t added, then that could have caused the mass of the Manduca sextas to change. If more time was allowed for the experiment there could have been different results, if the experiment went till the subjects reached the pupa stage that could have altered the data and possibly accepted the groups hypothesis. Another possible error could have been the amount of oxygen flow for the worms, 2 holes were punctured that could have been in the wrong fashion. This error may have been the cause of the early death of control subject number 4. An experiment in the future that could be beneficial would be one that focuses on the molting of the Hornworm which was focused on by Yuichiro. He looked into depth on how the metamorphis of the Manduca sexta happens, and they must be a certain mass before they can continue to the next phase. [Yuichiro:2013]. This experiment is important because juvenile hormone (JH) is in many other insects such as the Deaths head moth which is in the same “Hawkmoths” family as the Manduca sexta and it affects them in different ways such as molting and the production of eggs [Noriega:2014]. If more research is done like this with the juvenile hormone more discoveries could be made from it in insects and other species and how it affects them in the metamorphosis phase.
