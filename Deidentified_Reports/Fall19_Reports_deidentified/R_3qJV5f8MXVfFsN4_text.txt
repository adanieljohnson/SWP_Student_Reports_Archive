Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta’s development

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The Maduca sexta commonly called the tobacco hornworm is a subset of species that includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers. Their life cycle is around 48 days, but it can be longer or shorter depending on their diet and the temperature of their environment. During their life cycle the Manduca sexta go through various stages including the egg/embryo stage, larvae, pupa, and adult. The passage from one stage of life to the next is completely dependent on the molting of their skin, where they shed their old skin and create a new one. Juvenile hormone (JH) and 20E are two of the hormones that play a key role in the development of the tobacco horn worm. JH regulates the type of molt that occurs in the earlier stages of the Manduca Sexta’s developement, while the 20E regulates the timing of the molt and other functions in the adults. While Juvenile Hormone is the primary developmental hormone in the beginning of the insect’s life, it tapers off during the pupal eclosion allowing the 20E levels to rise simultaneously. This is because the Manduca sexta is in its late larval stage, approaching early adulthood, and 20E is critical at this point. JH and 20E work together to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis for Manduca sexta. The absence of JH after the Manduca sexta reaches a critical rate is critical for normal metamorphosis processes to occur [Browder: 2001]. We hypothesize that when treated with Juvenile Hormone, the Manduca sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the control group.


Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment eight Manduca sexta were randomly split into two groups of four: the control and the experimental. Then each of the groups were put into two separate four celled containers with holes poked throughout to provide the hornworms with airflow. Each cell for the control container had ten grams of food with five drops of water mixed in, and each cell for treatment group had ten grams of food with five drops of the Precor 1:1250 Juvenile Hormone mixed in. When the food was dried out or finished for both the control and experimental groups, it was promptly replaced with a regimen of the same formula. Both groups of Manduca sexta were stored in a regulated incubator and checked on daily to be weighed and fed. Once the data was done being collected statistical tests for the standard deviation and p-value (one-sample t-test) were performed.


Results:
This experiment looked specifically at the change in mass observed in the Manduca sexta for both the control and experimental groups over a 14 day period. Table 1 shows each hornworm’s individual change in mass over the two week period. On average in the control group from the 12th day onward the hornworms mass decreased almost four grams. It is evident when looking at figure 1 that the treatment group ended up growing to much larger masses towards the end of the two weeks. In addition, figure 1 shows that the control group was growing at a quicker rate up until the 12th day of the experiment. Table 2 shows the average change in mass between the two groups and again points to the fact that the treatment group grew more in addition to also having a larger standard deviation. The outcome of our statistical test to calculate standard deviation for the control group was found to be 1.18 and for the treatment group it was 2.17. Our one-tailed test p-value ended up being 0.17. 



Discussion:
The experiment yielded no results that proved our hypothesis to be valid, our hypothesis being that with the addition of the Juvenile Hormone the Manduca Sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the control group. After looking at the results from our data it can be concluded that the Manduca Sexta’s growth rate was in no way hindered by the extra hormone addition. When comparing the average size of the control Manduca sextas to that of the treatment it is evident that the treatment group grew to much larger sizes than that of the control. I fed the Manduca sexta towards the end of the 14 days period and I noticed that the food for the treatment group was eaten at a much more rapid rate as compared to that of the control group.When looking at the timeline of the growth of the two groups there was a point when the average measurements of the control group were higher than that of the treatment group, but from the 12th day until the last day of the experiment the average weight of the treatment group was larger than that of the control. The decrease in the control groups mass from the 12th day onward could be due to starvation or a molting transitioning. None of the hornworms managed to reach pupation, which is evident through their green coloration. It should be noted that the green coloration in the treatment group was lighter than that of the control. In the treatment group the inability to reach 
the pupation stage could be a potential reaction to the addition of the Juvenile Hormone, which has properties that could inhibit genes that would normally promote the transition. In the control group the findings are unambiguous as to why the pupation stage would not be reached. 
By looking at the results of the one sample T-test it is evident that the variation shows no statistical significance between the two groups. Overall the results found did not correlate to our null hypothesis, however, perhaps with the addition of more time our results would more closely  favor our hypothesis. When looking at an experiment that also added extra Juvenile Hormone to the Manduca sexta it is clear that in the feeding fifth instar larvae the weight increases and rises to a peak up until the natural secretion of the hormone ceases [Browder: 2001].
