Title: Excess magnesium decreases health and growth of Vigna radiata

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to understand the effects of varying magnesium levels on the health and growth of Vigna radiata, commonly known as the mung bean. In order to test magnesium effects on mung beans, seeds were watered with either magnesium enriched water or water not enriched with magnesium for two weeks.  After the treatment period was over, the plants were massed and number of wilted leaves were calculated. It was hypothesized that the plants watered with magnesium enriched water would grow to have a larger mass with fewer wilted leaves when compared to those that were not. The results of the experiment do not follow expected results because the magnesium treated plants had lower masses as well as higher percentages of wilted leaves.  This can be explained by the fact that elevated magnesium in soil actually causes calcium deficiency in plants (Yermiyahu, 1994). 
Results of a two-tailed t_test show that average masses between treatment and controll groups were statistically significently different with a p_value of 0.0007, but the average percent of wilted leaves between groups were not significent with a p_value of 0.06. The biological results of this experiment further understanding of elevated minerals in crop soil on plant growth and condition.

Introduction:
All organisms must adapt to biotic and abiotic factors from their environment in order to survive. Additionally, limitation in nature of essential resources like sunlight, nitrogen, and water effects what plant species are likely to grow in a particular community. As a result, most species have evolved to allocate resources in a certain pattern.
 Resource allocation can be altered depending on variations in the surroundings, like different abiotic conditions or presence of same or differing species.  Relative allocation of biomass in the leaves, shoots, and roots is indicative of ability to acquire resources from the environment. Plants exhibit phenotypic plasticity, so their growth pattern can noticeably change over time. Measuring components of plants in altered environments are thus indicative of how external factors put pressure on plants to adapt their structures, as is shown in European tree species exposed to increased environmental temperatures (Kramer, 1995).
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants store sun energy which is then available for essential processes that contribute to overall health like cellular respiration. Elevated rates of photosynthesis have also been shown to enhance overall plant growth due to increased carbon availability for plants (Kirschbaum, 2011).  An important component in the photosynthesis process is magnesium, which is located in chlorophyll molecules.  Without this mineral, chlorophyll cannot capture sun energy, so magnesium is key to photosynthesis success. 
Performing this experiment widens the knowledge of consequences of human mediated mineral deposits on plant health and growth and offers insight into elevated magnesium levels on the quality of horticultural and agricultural products.  Previous studies evaluating other plants, like tomatoes, have demonstrated that magnesium deficiency causes wilted leaves and decreased blossom growth (Hao, 2004).  It was expected that if mung bean seeds were watered with magnesium-enriched water then they would grow to have consistently healthy leaves as well as greater overall growth because of the increased energy availability from photosynthesis.


Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, 60 water-soaked mung bean seeds were obtained. Ten seeds were planted into soil in six individual plastic planters.  Upon original planting, the seeds were watered until excess water drained out of the bottom of their containers.  
The planters were placed in a greenhouse where they remained for two weeks to grow.  At 4 PM every day, the plants were watered with 150 Ml of water.  Three planters received regular water while the three other planters received water enriched with magnesium sulfate.  
After two weeks, the wilted leaves on each plant were counted.  Then, three plants from each planter were removed from soil and their mass was measured on a balance.  
A two-tailed t_test was used to analyze if the mean number of wilted leaves and overall plant masses were statistically significently different between the groups exposed to differing amounts of magnesium.


Results:
The results from this experiment show that the average mass of the controll plants was larger than the plants of the magnesium enriched plants (Figure 1). The average mass of three chosen plants in each planter for the controll plants never dropped below 2.00 g while the average mass of three plants for the magnesium enriched plants remained below 0.47 g (Table 1). Once a two-tailed t_test was run, it was determined that the t_statistic was 9.43 with degrees of freedom of 4 and p_value of 0.0007 for the average masses (Table 2).
Additionally, it was shown that the magnesium enriched plants had a greater average percent of wilted leaves per plant than the controll plants (Figure 2). The average percent of wilted leaves on all the controll plants within each planter never got above 67% while the average percent of wilted leaves for magnesium plants was above 67% for each planter (Table 1). Once a two-tailed t_test was run, it was determined that the t_statistic was 2.60 with degrees of freedom of 4 and p_value of 0.06 for the average percentages (Table 3).
Magnesium treated plants had noticeably darker leaves with smaller stems than controll plants (Figure 3). 


Discussion:
The results from this experiment do not follow the expected pattern of bigger and healthier mung bean plants watered with magnesium enriched water.  The results show that on average the controll plants were bigger in mass than the magnesium enriched plants with a p_value of 0.0007 which indicates that these results were not obtained by chance and that the controll plants were larger than the treatment plants.  The average percent of leaves wilted for the controll plants was lower than the magnesium enriched plants with a p_value of 0.06, indicating that these results may be due to chance, so we cannot support the hypothesis.
The biological results that donâ€™t correlate with expected growth patterns can be explained by the fact that elevated levels of magnesium result in decreased uptake of calcium by plants. It has been demonstrated in other experiments that there is quantitative competition between magnesium and calcium on sorption sites of plasma membrane vesicles of melon roots. (Yermiyahu, 1994) Calcium is an essential salt for the plant to maintain the rigidity of cell walls and contributes to structural integrity of roots and shoots. Deficiency in calcium can result in the blackening and curling of leaves, ultimately leading to cessation of growth, as well as development of unhealthy root cells and slow growing shoots. (Jones, 1967)
The results from this experiment align with expectations for calcium-deficient plants. The plants are noticeably different in size and condition. Magnesium treated plants are smaller with darker, almost black, leaves and shoots (Figure 3). The overall mass of magnesium treated plants on average was measured to be significently below that of the controll plants (Figure 1). This indicates that there was a slower rate of development of the leaves, the stem, the roots, or all three which led to an accountable mass discrepancy. A p_value less than 0.05 was defined as being significent. The t_test evaluated the data as being statistically significently different with a p_value of 0.0007, so mass results are not due to chance (Table 2).
Also, the magnesium treated leaves seem to be smaller, less healthy, and more wilted than the controll leaves upon visual inspection (Figure 3).  The average number of wilted leaves per planter for the magnesium treated plants was higher compared to the wilted leaves of the controll planters  (Figure 2).  This indicates that the structural integrity of the leaves was reduced, which is consistent with calcium-deficient plants. The t_test evaluated the data as not being statistically significently different with a p_value of 0.06, so it was not proven that the number wilted leaves results were not due to chance (Table 3). 
Modifications to this experiment could lead to more insightful results.  For instance, testing the same hypothesis but including ten sets of ten replicates all watered with the same volume of gradually increasing concentrations of magnesium enriched water.  With this method, a close approximation of magnesium concentrations that could actually be beneficial to the plant might be identified. It could also be interesting to switch the conditions and water plants with calcium enriched water and see if signs of magnesium deficiency arise or water plants with other ions, like potassium, and note for signs of calcium-deficiency.
	This is a useful experiment to perform because it can help farmers understand the effects of excess magnesium on crop health, and it serves as a model for effects of human-caused contamination of plant soil. Mineral composition of crop soil is an important issue that requires further studying in order to compensate for the transient conditions of growing environments (Colombo, 2014).  Experiments such as this one contribute to a better understanding of the harm of uncontrollled mineral and salt levels in plant soil.
