Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone analouge, precor, on the growth of the Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, known more colloquially as the tobacco hornworm, is a common pest in a variety of plants such as tobacco, tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, and other various weeds. Manduca sexta in the larval stages are ravenous and widely considered pests as they feed on unripe fruit and leaves. This leaves large wounds in plants that exposes them to a variety of harmful plant pathogens which has been shown to have detrimental effects on the economic success of tobacco crops, and occasionally tomato and plant crops. On the other hand, the adult stage of the Manduca sexta are not pests and some are even considered beneficial pollinators [Byron:2017]. 
	There are eight different developmental stages that make up the life cycle of the tobacco hornworm [Johnson:2018]. These stages start at the egg and ultimately end at the moth, commonly called the Carolina sphynx moth or the tobacco hawkmoth [Byron:2017]. After the tobacco hornworm develops from an egg, it undergoes five different instar larvae stages. After the fifth, it sustains the process of pupation for between 19 and 23 days [Johnson:2018].
	The cycle of hormones that occurs during the developmental process of the Manduca is essential to its growth. Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) are two of the three hormones involved in the development if the Manduca sexta. Ecdysterone is produced in the prothoracic glands and is responsible for the timing of the molting of the Manduca sexta. JH is produced in the Corpus Allata and is responsible for the type of molt that that occurs. Both JH and Ecdysterone work together, in different proportions and concentrations, to controll the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta [Johnson:2018]. JH levels remain very high during the first four larval instar periods of the Manduca sexta, and the levels of JH start to drop at the end of the fourth instar. After this, a small rise of 20E occurs and causes the commitment pulse, which triggers pupation [Johnson 2018].  
	With this information in mind, it is possible that by increasing the amount of JH present, there is a chance that the Manduca sexta would reach the fifth instar faster. This could possibly cause it to pupate at an increased rate and become a moth, making it less of a pest. For this experiment, our group hypothesized that by adding the JH analog, Precor, the Manduca sexta would increase in weight and ultimately grow faster than those who were not given the extra Juvenile hormone.



Materials and Method:
The first step in our experiment was to set up the Manduca Sexta habitat. The group obtained two containers, each with four segments. This gave room for four controll and four experimental caterpillars. Next, we placed holes inside of each slot of the container to ensure proper airflow to the Manduca Sexta. Then, we labeled each container as either controll or experimental and numbered each slot one through four.
Secondly, we set up food for the Manduca Sexta. This was especially important because it is how the treatment is was administered. The controll group received five drops of water mixed with ten grams of food. The experimental group received five drops of Precor mixed with Ten grams of food. These were mixed up and rolled it into a ball. Then, we placed the mixture in the respective slot. 
Next, one Manduca Sexta was placed in each container, which were then put in an incubator for fourteen days. We observed them every day for two weeks. Each day we came in we cleaned out the container, replenished the food, and weighed each hornworm. It was important to remake the food every day in order to avoid dehydration. 
After two weeks of collecting data, we compared the recorded weights of the Manduca sexta and ran a two-sample t_test to determine statistical significance in the weights of the controll and experimental groups. 


Results:
Both the controll and experimental groups increases at a relatively constant rate. The only difference was that the experimental group were noticeably larger than the controll group. There is a slight decline in the masses of each group that can be seen after day twelve until the end of the experiment. From a behavioral standpoint, the experimental group seemed much more lethargic and enlarged than their counterparts in the controll group. They also seemed to be slightly lighter in color than those in the controll group. 
The average of the masses taken over two weeks for the experimental group was 9.009 with a standard deviation of 6.070. The average mass of the controll group was slightly smaller at 8.725 with a standard deviation of 3.980. Overall, the difference of the means of the experimental group treated with Precor and the controll group showed to be statistically significent (t_stat = 1.74, d.f. = 28, P= 0.046). 


Discussion:
Overall, our results that we collected supported our hypothesis that the Manduca sexta treated with the JH analogue, Precor, would ultimately grow to be larger than those without the treatment (Fig. 1). 
	Increasing the levels of juvenile hormone present led to an increased size of the Manduca sexta because JH works alongside 20E to promote growth and development of the hornworm through its larvae stages. Similar results were found in a study conducted in the early 1980’s by Doctor Dorothy Rountree and Dr. Wallen Bollenbacher. In their study, they concluded that JH alters the response that larval tissue has to ecdysterones and affects the release of prothoracicotropic hormone, or PTTH. PTTH plays a role in regulating that production and release of ecdysterones; therefore, by decreasing the release of this hormone there will be a decreased release of ecydysterones as well. Overall, they found that Manduca sexta treated with artificially elevated JH levels had an accelerated rate of pupal development [Rountree, 1985]. 
These finding support our conclusion that excess levels of JH causes an increased mass in the Manduca sexta. 
The next step in this experiment would be to determine what concentrations of insect hormones would lead to the Manduca sexta reaching its pupation phase faster. This would be advantageous given that we know that the larval stage of the hornworm are pests that cause lots of damage economically and ecologically to a variety of plants [Byron 2017]. From our experiment, we understand that increasing the levels of JH would lead to an increase in mass of the Manduca sexta, but ultimately this leaves room for further investigation. It is ultimately the drop in JH and slight increase in 20E that lead to the commitment pulse and the start of pupation [Johnson 2018]. It may be advantageous in the future to investigate how various concentrations of these hormones can help us get to that stage faster. 
Overall, the results found from this experiment conducted lead us to a greater understanding of the development and life cycle of the Manduca sexta. Many experiments have been done of this organism, but there is still room to understand more about their hormone cycles. This small-scale experiment involving the increase in levels of JH still leaves many questions from which one could derive numerous other experiments to help us broaden our understanding of the hormone cycle of the Manduca sexta.
