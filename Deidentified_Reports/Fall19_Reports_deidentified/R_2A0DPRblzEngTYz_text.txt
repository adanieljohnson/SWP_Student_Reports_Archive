Title: Studying the Effect of Phosphorus and Nitrogen Solutions on Mung Bean (Vigna radiata) Root and Shoot Growth

Abstract:
An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of phosphorus and nitrogen on the growth of mung bean plants (Vigna radiata).  Phosphorus and nitrogen are both known elements to stimulate plant growth as they are essential in several biotic processes that influence plant growth.  Nitrogen and phosphorus solutions were added to mung beans planted in soil combined with water daily.  It was determined that the controll group (no added phosphorus or nitrogen) of mung bean plants grew the most, while the group with a mixture of phosphorus and nitrogen solutions grew the least with a root length and shoot length.  The hypothesis that the mixture group would grow the most was not supported by the data.  

Introduction:
Plants need certain elements in order to survive, function and grow.  Phosphorus and nitrogen are common elements which both affect plant growth [Sadava: 2014].  Primarily, phosphorus and nitrogen are both essential in the formation of DNA which contains the genetic info to code proteins which make up the structure of a plant [Sadava: 2014].  To use nitrogen, plants have to undergo a process that includes nitrogen fixation (taking atmospheric N2 to NH3 and NH4+), nitrification (turning those molecules into nitrate), nitrate reduction (reducing nitrate to ammonium), and then using the ammonium to form amino acids which are the building blocks of the plants structure [Sadava: 2014].  Nitrogen is also essential for plant growth because it helps make up the chlorophyll which is the mechanism that plants use to conduct photosynthesis [Novoa: 1981].  Nitrogen also plays a role in protein, nucleic acids, and helps in cell division and cell elongation [Firoz: 2009].  To use phosphorus, plants uptake it through their roots [Sadava: 2014].  Phosphorus is also a necessary nutrient for growth because it is involved in photosynthesis and respiration [Novoa: 1981].  Phosphorus also increases root growth, and a deficiency can lead to poor root development [Firoz: 2009].  The effect of the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen could be helpful for people interested in growing plants, such as gardeners and farmers.  These two elements can be limiting nutrients on plant growth, depending on their abundance [Sadava: 2014].  The addition of them in excess can allow the plant to use more of the elements, negating the limiting factor [Sadava: 2014].  The effect of adding phosphorus to a plant, the effect of adding nitrogen to a plant, and the effect of adding equal amounts of both phosphorus and nitrogen were being investigated.  The addition of the combination of phosphorus and nitrogen to the soil of the mung bean plants was predicted to increase the length of the root and the shoot the most because phosphorus and nitrogen both play important roles in processes that affect plant growth and a lack of them can be limiting, so a surplus of the combination of the two will have the greatest effect.  

Materials and Method:
48 mung bean seeds were distributed among 8 pots (6 seeds per pot) and planted in shallow holes in vermiculite soil. 50 Ml of phosphorus solution (20% P2O5) was added to pots 1 and 2 each.  50 Ml of nitrogen solution (32% NO3-) was added to pots 3 and 4 each.  A mixture of 25 Ml of the phosphorus solution and 25 Ml of the nitrogen solution was added to pot 5 and 6 each.  Pots 1 through 8 were watered until the soil was soaked.  The plants were placed in a greenhouse with adequate sunlight.  The nitrogen and phosphorus solutions were added to the pots followed by the watering process every day for two weeks.  At the end of the two-week period, the plants were uprooted carefully, and the root and shoot lengths were measured, differentiating the root from the shoot at the location of color change on the base of the stem that led into the root.  Anova tests and Tukey-Kramer tests were conducted on the data sets for the root and the shoot lengths. 

Results:
The mean root length for the controll was 11.5 cm +/-4.18 cm SD, 9.4 cm +/- 1.65 cm SD for phosphorus, 8.9 cm +/- 1.88 for nitrogen, and 8.5 cm +/- 4.18 cm SD for the mixture (see figure 1).  The mean shoot length of mung bean plants for the controll was 8.8 cm +/- 1.65 cm SD, 6.5 cm +/- 1.47 for phosphorus, 5.9 cm +/- 3.66 cm SD for nitrogen, and 2.5 cm +/-2.17 cm SD for the mixture solution (see figure 2).  The P-value of the mean shoot length was 0.041.  The P-value for the mean root length was 0.565. 

Discussion:
The alternative hypothesis predicted that the addition of phosphorus and nitrogen simultaneously would increase both root and shoot lengths the most out of all the groups.  The alternate hypothesis was not supported because the mixture of phosphorus and nitrogen solutions resulted in the least amount of growth in both the root and the shoot length, at a mean of 8.5 cm +/- 4.09 cm SD and 2.5 cm +/- 2.17 cm SD respectively, while the controll group grew the most with a mean root length of 11.5 cm +/- 4.18 cm SD and longest mean shoot length of 8.8 cm +/- 1.65 cm SD (refer to figure 1 and figure 2).  The phosphorus-group grew the second best with a mean root length of 9.4 cm +/- 1.65 cm SD and mean shoot length of 6.5 cm +/- 1.47 cm SD, while the nitrogen-only group had a mean root length of 8.9 cm +/- 1.88 cm SD and a mean shoot length of 5.9 cm  +/- 3.66 cm SD.  The standard deviations of the average root length for the mixture group and for the controll group were particularly high, suggesting a potential unaddressed error (refer to figure 1).  While phosphorus and nitrogen are biologically necessary for several functions pertaining to plant growth, such as DNA formation and amino acid building, the results from the present experiment do not suggest otherwise because the data is largely statistically insignificent [Sadava: 2014].
According to the Anova test, the shoot length data is significent, rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no significent difference between the means of the shoot length.  However, the Tukey-Kramer test reported each pair of means as not significent for every pair of means for average shoot length besides the combination group and the controll.  Additionally, according to the Anova test, the root length data is insignificent.  The Tukey-Kramer test reported each pair of means as not significent for average root length.  The statistical insignificance could be attributed to potential errors that may have occurred.  A way that the procedure could be improved to minimize error is to increase the number of seeds planted, for example amending it from 48 to 100 seeds, resulting in more trials and a higher likelihood of more significent trends.  
According to a study on plant growth in a vegetable field, N fertilizer reduced plant growth in vegetables [Wang: 2004].  This result is consistent with how the addition of a nitrogen solution resulted in lower root and shoot lengths compared to the controll group in the present study. The study also stated that the effects of P fertilizer were species and sampling-time dependent [Wang: 2004].  This finding could explain why the phosphorus solution did not aid the growth of the mung bean plants, potentially suggesting that mung bean plants could be a non-responder species to additional phosphorus, or that they were measured at a time where the sample was not responding to the phosphorus.  A future experiment could be conducted to test if mung bean plants are time-sensitive responders to the addition of phosphorus. 
Another study was conducted in China to investigate the possibility of overfertilization of phosphorus on plants in greenhouses, and it was concluded that too much phosphorus was hindering growth [Yan: 2013].  In the present experiment, too much phosphorus may have been added for it to have a positive effect on growth.  A future experiment could be conducted on the mung bean plants to test the effect of different amounts of a phosphorus-only solution on root and shoot growth.   
The experiment has little real-world application due to the time scale of it.  Mung beans would typically be grown and harvested in a garden or a farm and would take a much longer time to allow the plants to fully grow and the beans to sprout.  The effect of nitrogen and phosphorus on the grown of the roots and shoots could be time-sensitive, as some vegetables were found to be in the Wang study [Wang: 2004].  If the experiment were to be conducted again, the time could be increased from two weeks to a much longer time period, perhaps two months, or until the beans were fully grown for harvesting.  Only then will the knowledge of the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus on the growth of the plant be applicable to real events.
