Title: The Effect of Different Photon Energies on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a fundamental process for a plant cell and allows the plant to convert CO2 and water into energy stored in the form of glucose using sunlight, with a byproduct of oxygen.  Because a major portion of photosynthesis is dependent on photon energy, light has a large effect on the photosynthetic activity of the plant.  The effects of light color on the specific model Spinacia oleracea have not been fully investigated, but we hypothesize that the photosynthetic rate in Spinacia oleracea would be highest under white light (regular light), lower under blue light (~470 nm), and lowest under red light (~639 nm) if treated under those light conditions.  A DCIP Decolorization Assay was used to determine the rate of photosystem II in Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts in red, blue, and white light.  In our experiment, our samples incubating under red light were the only ones that exhibited photosynthetic activity.  Our other two groups showed the same level of photosynthesis as our negative controll.  We concluded that the different photon energies of the different light wavelengths effected the efficiency of photosynthesis.  Lastly, we determined that the photosynthetic repair mechanism plays an integral role in determining the rate of photosynthesis.     


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a fundamental process for a plant cell and allows the plant to convert CO2 and water into energy stored in the form of glucose using sunlight, with a byproduct of oxygen [Johnson: 2016].  Photosynthesis is the source of most of the oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere, and is the reason that the earth has an oxygen atmosphere today [Plait: 2014].  
Photosynthesis can be divided into two different types of reactions: light independent reactions and light dependent reactions.  The light dependent reactions are the first step of photosynthesis, and begin with the splitting of water by Photosystem II (PSII) into O2, H+ protons, and free electrons which continue down the reaction chain [Johnson: 2016].  The light dependent reactions continue with the delivery of electrons through electron carriers to Photosystem I (PSI), where newly harvested photons are used to re-excite the electrons to eventually form NADPH [Berg: 2002].  Lastly, the light dependent reactions end with the production of ATP by ATP synthase through the mechanism of rotational catalysis, which is powered by the proton gradient generated by the activity of Photosystem I and II [Nakanishi-Matsui: 2016].  This ATP and NADPH then travel to the light independent reactions: the Calvin-Benson Cycle.  Through this cycle, the energy from ATP and NADPH is used to fix CO2 into carbohydrates, which can be used for the plant’s metabolism [Johnson: 2016].
Because a major portion of photosynthesis is dependent on photon energy, light has a large effect on the photosynthetic activity of the plant.  The molecules that absorb light energy in plants are called pigments, the most well-known being chlorophyll [Johnson: 2016].  Pigments harness light energy by absorbing photons into their conjugated π-systems, exciting the π electron from its lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to its highest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) [Johnson: 2016]. The pigment eventually delivers this excitation energy to the reaction center of PSII, providing the energy to split water [Ruban: 2014].  Plants also have different types of pigments which absorb different wavelengths of light.  Some plants have chlorophylls and carotenoids, which can absorb ~450nm light, and others have phycoerythrin and phycocyanin, which can absorb up to 600nm [Ruban: 2014].  Pigments also have wavelengths where they do not absorb any light at all [Johnson: 2016].  Photons in each wavelength of visible light (400-700nm) have a different energy, with 400nm wavelengths having the highest energy, and therefore their photons deliver different amounts of energy to the PSII reaction center.
Because photosynthesis requires energy from light, it is hypothesized that with an increase in provided light energy, the rate of photosynthesis would also increase.  This hypothesis was tested by Sowbiya Muneer, et al, in 2014.  Their results concluded that photosynthetic activity in lettuce leaves (Lactuca sativa L.) was higher at blue light (470 nm) than at red light (639 nm) [Muneer: 2014].  They attributed this result to the dependence of PSII and PSI protein maintenance on blue light wavelengths [Muneer: 2014].  Biyun Yang also tested this hypothesis in 2016 and found that photosynthetic activity in purple cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) was highest with white light, lower in blue and lowest in red monochromatic light [Yang: 2016].  He found that photosynthesis was higher with blue monochromatic light versus other monochromatic lights, but did not offer an explanation as to why different colors of light produced different rates of photosynthesis [Yang: 2016].
The effects of light on the specific model Spinacia oleracea have not been fully investigated.  Because Spinacia oleracea is a higher vascular plant like Lactuca sativa L. and Brassica oleracea L., the structure of the photosynthetic system should be similar between them [Classification Lactuca sativa L: 2019, Classification Brassica oleracea L: 2019, Classification Spinacia oleracea L: 2019].  Based on other systems, the photosynthetic rate in Spinacia oleracea would be highest under white light (regular light), lower under blue light (~470 nm), and lowest under red light (~639 nm) if treated under those light conditions.  This is due to the fact that white light has a wide range of wavelengths, therefore providing the plant with very high energy light, exciting the electrons in pigments from the LUMO to the HOMO, therefore pushing PSII activity and increasing the rate of photosynthesis.  Blue light has a higher energy then red, but a lower energy than the highest energy white light [NASA: 2013].  Due to these same factors, the rate of photosynthesis under red light will be the lowest, and under blue light the rate will be in between that of white and red light. 

Materials and Method:
To isolate chloroplasts, fresh Spinacia oleracea was purchased and the major veins removed.  Leaves were homogenized with a mortar and pestle in 10 Ml griding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to lyse cells.  Another 10 Ml was added before straining liquid through 2 layers of cheesecloth to remove large cell debris.  The filtrate was centrifuged in 4ºC for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm to remove smaller cell debris.  The supernatant was decanted into a new tube and centrifuged in 4ºC for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm to pellet the chloroplasts.  The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 20Ml of grinding buffer to resuspend chloroplasts in solution.
The DCIP decolorization assay was used to quantify the activity of PSII.  A blank for this assay was prepared by combining 8Ml dH2O and 2Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5).  Twelve samples were then prepared, each containing 6Ml dH2O, 2Ml 130 mM DCIP, 2Ml of reaction buffer.  Three colored lamps with either a white, red, or blue lightbulb were set up on a table with pieces of paper around them to block natural light from reaching the samples.  Three samples were placed under each lamp color.  100uL of our chloroplast solution was then added those twelve samples at the start of our timed DCIP assay.  The last three samples which did not contain any chloroplasts were placed under white light and served as a negative controll.  The blank was also placed under white light.  
At the start of our assay (time zero), we measured the absorbance of each sample at 600nm using a spectrophotometer.  The samples were then incubated under their respective colored light sources for 10 minutes and absorbances were measured again at 600nm, re-blanking with the prepared blank.  This process was repeated twice more to record absorbance at 600nm after 20 and 30 minutes incubation. 
The percent change for the absorbance values for each of the twelve samples was calculated using the following equation: % change = |(Absorbance @ time zero – Absorbance @ time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero|  x 100%, with N being 10, 20, or 30 minutes.  The three percent changes for each experimental group at each timepoint were averaged, and a two-sample t_test with an alpha value of 0.05 was conducted to determine the significance of the differences between the average percent changes at 30 minutes of each of the four experimental groups: no chloroplasts, white light, red light, and blue light. 


Results:
After 30 minutes, the samples under red light had the largest percentage decrease of absorbance when compared to time zero absorbance (Figure 1).  The samples under blue light had the second-largest percentage decrease of absorbance when compared to time zero absorbance, and the samples under white light had the third-largest percentage decrease of absorbance when compared to time zero absorbance (Figure 1).  Lastly, our controll, the samples with no chloroplasts under white light, had the smallest percentage decrease of absorbance when compared to time zero (Figure 1).  At time 30 minutes, all differences in percent change of experimental groups were not significent except for the difference in percent change between the no chloroplast controll group and the red light group (p=0.000011), and the white light group and the red light group (p=0.025) (Figure 1).  


Discussion:
Our experiment tested the effect of different colors of light on the rate of photosynthesis on the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea.  Our collected data for this DCIP decolorization assay do not support our hypothesis.  The DCIP assay measures the decrease in solution absorbance, which is caused by the reduction 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) in the PSII pathway.  The faster the solution absorbance decreases, the higher the activity of PSII.  In this assay, PSII activity is directly proportional to overall photosynthetic activity.  When converting our data from percent change of absorbance to photosynthetic activity, our data show that there was no significent difference in photosynthetic activity between our negative controll and our samples under white light or blue light after incubation for 30 minutes (Figure 1).  Our red light group was the only group that had a significent increase in the photosynthetic activity when compared to that of our negative controll and our while light group (Figure 1).  
Overall, our samples incubating under red light were the only ones that exhibited photosynthetic activity.  Our other two groups showed the same level of photosynthesis as our negative controll.            
These results can be interpreted as red light has the largest positive effect on the rate of photosynthesis, whereas white and blue light have no effect.  This does not support our hypothesis, which stated that while light would have the highest rate of photosynthesis, blue light would have a lower rate, and red light would have the lowest rate of photosynthesis due to the energy of the photons entering the system.  To start off, this is not a result of differing light intensities based on the different lamps we used because light intensity does not significently affect photosynthetic rate, only the distribution of chlorophyll in Spinacia oleracea [Cui: 1991].  
It has been shown that PSII most efficiently absorbs wavelengths around 680 nm [Piovene: 2015].  This is due to a special set of pigments present to harvest energy for PSII which absorb ~680nm photons [Johnson: 2016].  This wavelength of light is relatively low energy for the visible spectrum, and therefore the PSII system is not receiving a large amount of energy with each photon.  When a photon comes together with the pigment chlorophyll, the pigment has two main excited states that it can occupy, the S1 and S2 excited states, with S0 being the default ground state [Johnson: 2016].  The energy of a red photon promotes the electron directly to the S1 excited state, while the energy of a blue photon promotes the electron to the S2 state, which is unstable and quickly degrades to the S1 state [Johnson: 2016].  The S1 state is the state at which the electrons that participate in charge separation, the chemical process that allows PSII to split water, are in [Johnson: 2016].  
These facts serve as an explanation as to why treatment with red light resulted in a higher photosynthetic rate than treatment with blue or white light. Red light photons immediately promote the electron to the S1 state, whereas higher energy while and blue light promote the electrons to the S2 state, which takes about 10^−12s [Johnson: 2016].  In a system with millions of molecules moving through it at any given time, this time could make a large difference in the photosynthetic rate of plants.  The blue and white light treated plants would “fall behind” due to the time it took for the electrons to degrade from the S2 to the S1 state.  
This addresses the question of why red light treatment resulted in a higher rate of photosynthesis after 30 minutes, but not why the rate of photosynthesis in the blue and white light treated did not differ from the negative controll.  This is our most surprising result.  The chloroplasts under white light, the light that actively photosynthesizing plants are exposed to every day, showed no photosynthetic activity [Stanford: 2019].  This is due to the fact that the chloroplasts are not in the same environment as they usually are when conducting photosynthesis.  Specifically, our results most likely differ with those of previous studies because we tested the chloroplasts alone, while those previous studies tested the entire leaf system [Yang: 2016, Muneer: 2014].          
PSII subunits are synthesized and assembled in the chloroplast [Uniacke: 2007].  It has been hypothesized that the maintenance of these subunits is dependent on blue light [Muneer: 2014].  Our hypothesis is that, without blue light, the plant in the short term proceeds as normal in its photosynthetic activities.  In the presence of blue light, as the photosynthetic system attempts to maintain the PSII units, the complexes to assemble and repair the PSII subunits are not functioning correctly, as some necessary proteins are not present, as before they were being imported from the cytoplasm, but now the chloroplasts are suspended in only a buffer solution [Meurer: 1998, Lu: 2016].  This inhibits the function of photosynthesis because the system has recognized that it cannot be maintained, with blue light as its signal.
These two factors, the lack of red light which delays the electron’s arrival to the S1 state and the presence of blue light, which, in the absence of the proper PSII repair machinery, will pause photosynthesis, contribute to the blue light group’s absent rate of photosynthesis.  Lastly, the white light provided in the experiment most likely had a higher concentration of blue light, which resulted in the same photosynthetic rate issues as the blue light group had.
Overall, our experiment presented us with some interesting and confusing results, but nevertheless, these results fit into and contribute to the greater body of scientific plant knowledge.  These data also could have an impact on agriculture and feeding humanity.  Although most human agriculture is grown in bulk outside, increasing nutrition and quality of plants for human consumption is often done in greenhouses.  There, the color of light can be changed to fit the need of the project, whether that be inhibiting or stimulating photosynthesis.  Although our results are not completely applicable to this example because we did not look at the photosynthetic rate of the entire leaf, our results could still contribute to the greater goal of improving agriculture.
