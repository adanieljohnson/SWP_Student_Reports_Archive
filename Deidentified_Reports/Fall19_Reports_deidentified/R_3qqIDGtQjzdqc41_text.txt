Title: Effect of Humidity on Raphanus sativus Resource Allocation

Abstract:
Plants have the ability to allocate resources in different ways to maximize on limited resources. They can also alter their resource allocation based on environmental factors. We wanted to test the effect of high humidity on Raphanus sativus plant’s resource allocation. We hypothesized that R. sativus in high humidity would have a lower root to shoot ratio because they do not need to invest as much energy in their roots to absorb the water they need. This allows them to allocate more resources to their shoots compared to the controll group. However, our findings did not support our hypothesis. We did find that the weight of the shoots, length of the shoots and the overall weight of plants was significently lower in the high humidity group compared to the controll. This may be because the humid conditions were too intense for proper plant growth and disrupted development. As the environment continues to change it remains increasingly valuable to understand how different environmental conditions like humidity effect crops and plant growth. 

Introduction:
We live in a world of limited resources. This has caused organisms to develop ways to maximize the limited resources available to them. Plants can absorb resources from the sun and air, through their shoots, and resources from the soil through their roots. They then have to distribute these resources in ways that allow them to get the greatest benefit, this is called resource allocation. Plants also have the ability to alter their resource allocation based on environmental factors, also known as phenotypic plasticity. In this experiment we observed how Raphanus sativuses plants (commonly known as radishes), exposed to different environmental conditions allocated resources to their shoots and roots. R. sativus is an edible root vegetable that is very popular in kitchens and gardens around the world. R. sativus are very easy to grow which makes them a good study organism.  In one previous study testing the effect of humidity on R. sativuses, humidity seemed to have little impact on R. sativus growth when CO2 concentrations we’re also altered [Wong: 1993]. However, there is little literature on the effect of humidity alone on R. sativus growth. Discovering the effect of varying humidity on plants is important because in polluted atmospheres, high humidity may contribute to further crop damage [Grange: 1986]. As pollutants continue to pour into our atmosphere understanding this link may be increasingly important for crop growth and understanding plant resource allocation. In the past studies have shown that some greenhouse plants experienced increased shoot length when relative humidity was raised [Mortensen: 1986]. In our experiment R. sativus plants were kept in either high humidity or normal conditions. We hypothesized that plants in high humidity would have a lower root to stem ratio because they do not need to invest as much energy in their roots to absorb the water they need. This allows them to allocate more resources to their shoots compared to the controll group. 

Materials and Method:
Six pots with twelve R. sativus seeds each were assembled and separated equally into the controll or experimental group. The experimental group was the high humidity treatment and the controll group was kept in normal humidity conditions. The three high humidity plants were put into two glass containers that were each filled with 1 inch of water and then sealed and placed in the greenhouse. Both plant groups were watered daily for two weeks. Originally 5 plants were supposed to be looked at from each group after the two-week growth period. However, there were only 4 viable plants for the high humidity group so 4 plants were used for the experimental group and 6 were looked at for the controll group. Each plant’s total mass was recorded. Then its root was separated from the shoots by cutting each plant apart at the root-shoot junction. The shoot weight was measured and recorded. The root mass was calculated by taking the total mass minus shoot mass. The shoot and root lengths were measured to the nearest millimeter, and the mean and standard deviation was calculated for each group. The root to shoot weight and length ratio was calculated for both groups. The independent variable was amount of humidity and the dependent variables were the measurements of total weight, root length, root weight, shoot length, shoot weight and the root to shoot ratios for length and weight. Next, 7 one-tailed two sample t tests were run to compare the two groups average weight, weight and length of their roots, weight and length of their shoots, and their root to shoot weight and length ratio. 

Results:
As shown in Table 1 the root to shoot weight ratio was lower in the high humidity group (0.074 +/- 0.04) than the controll (0.16 +/- 0.10) but not by a significent amount (p_value 0.062). Table 1 also shows that the root to shoot length ratio was lower in the high humidity group (0.97+/- 0.084) than the controll (1.16 +/- 0.43) but these results were also not significent (p_value 0.202). Table 1 also shows that the overall weight of the roots was lower for the high humidity group (0.02+/-0.012) than the controll (0.15 +/- 0.14) but this finding was not significent (p_value 0.056). As also depicted in Table 1, the high humidity group (96+/- 35.8) had a lower overall root length than the controll (161+/- 65.3) but there was no significent difference (p_value 0.55). The high humidity plants (0.31 +/- 0.13) had a significently lower (p_value 0.006) overall weight than the controll plants (1.04 +/- 0.43) as shown in Figure 1. The length of the shoots was also significently lower (p_value 0.04) in the high humidity group (95+/- 33.5) compared to the controll (142 +/- 33) as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 displays the weight of the shoots which were significently lower (p_value 0.004) in the high humidity group (0.29 +/- 1.20) compared to the controll (0.88 +/- 0.30) as well. Our conditions for statistical significance were p_value less than 0.05. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that plants in high humidity would have a lower root to shoot ratio was not supported by the findings. Although the high humidity plants did have a lower root to shoot ratio for weight and length this finding was not significent. However, we did find that the average weight of the plants in the high humidity group was significently lower than the controll. This may indicate that humidity has a greater effect on overall plant growth rather than the root to shoot ratio. The humidity group plants may have been failing to grow generally and could not properly allocate their resources. One previous study demonstrated that too humid conditions can encourage disease and cause disorders of growth and development [Grange: 1986]. We also found that the length and weight of plant shoots was significently lower in the high humidity versus the controll group. However, previous studies have found that shoot length is increased when relative humidity is increased [Mortensen: 1986]. This may support the claim that the humid conditions we created were too intense for the experimental plants to grow properly. It may also be that R. sativuses resource allocation is not as greatly affected by humidity as other plants [Wong: 1993]. All plants react differently to environmental conditions and some may be better at allocating resources than others. Our sample size was also small and even more limited by the lack of growth we saw in the experiment group and our failure to obtain enough viable plants. Future studies should look to replicate this study with a greater study sample. It could also be replicated with a different study organism to assess the difference among plant species. Testing multiple humidity levels would also be helpful for better understanding the relationship between humidity and resource allocation. As the environment continues to change it remains increasingly valuable to understand how different environmental conditions effect crops and plant growth.
