Title: Comparative analysis of length (cm) of Manduca sexta treated with the growth hormone Precor vs. untreated

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera. It lives for around 30 to 50 days and goes through four major stages of development throughout its life. These stages are the embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult stage [Johnson:2016]. In general, the larval stage of Manduca sexta is considered an agricultural pest, as it feeds on important crops such as tobacco and tomato. However, the adult stage is not considered a pest as it does not feed on these crops [Staal: 1975]. Therefore, if there was a way to manipulate the insect’s endocrine system, which controlls growth and development, then the larval stage can be disrupted or inhibited. This would greatly benefit farmers as they would be able to harvest greater amounts of tobacco and tomato crops. The three main hormones of the insect endocrine system that deal with growth and development are Prothoracicotropic Hormone, Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Prothoracicotropic Hormone regulates the release of Ecdysterone by the prothoracic glands. These glands regulate the timing of the molt during Manduca’s development. Juvenile hormone is produced in the corpus allata and it regulates the type of molt that occurs [Johnson:2016]. 
Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) are chemical compounds that can disrupt these hormones, mainly through an insect’s growth and development. IGRs interfere with JH and E20, leading to disruptions specifically in growth, molting, egg hatching, and fertilization. For example, one subset of IGRs, Juvenile Hormone agonists, interfere with the molting process of insects. When this IGR is introduced, it prevents the larval stages from reaching adulthood. When the insect cannot reach adulthood, then there will be no reproduction [Pfeiffer]. IGRs are therefore considered useful compounds that can effectively disrupt insect growth and development without introducing extremely harmful pesticides and chemicals to soil and crops [Staal: 1975]. 
In this experiment, when the IGR Precor 1: 1250 is introduced to Manduca sexta, we hypothesize that it will speed up the development of Manduca sexta. Moreover, the use of Precor will make the affected Manduca longer in length that the unaffected Manduca. 
The null hypothesis of this experiment is that Precor will have no effect on Manduca sexta growth.


Materials and Method:
Method:
The experiment consisted of two groups. One controll group consisted of four Manduca and the treatment group consisted of another four Manduca. Each Manduca was placed in its own box within a container. Airholes were created in each container so as to allow the Manduca to breathe. The controll group was given three drops of water each day in their food. The treatment group received three drops of Precor 1: 1250 in their food. 10g of food was provided and replenished each day along with either three drops of the controll or treatment. Each day, the Manduca were measured in cm using a ruler. The Manduca were stretched out and their length was recorded.  After they were measured, the Manduca were placed within their container and placed within a refrigerator that maintained a constant temperature of 22.5 degrees Celsius. This procedure occurred for a total of fifteen days. Data from the experiment was collected and graphed. In order to compare the data between the controll and treatment at the end of the experiment, a two sample one-tailed t_test was used.


Results:
Since, the lengths of the Manduca were taken each day, the data for the individuals in the controll group and the treatment group was averaged so that the daily mean of both the treatment and controll groups could be compared. 
Looking at figure 1, both the controll and treatment Manduca experienced significent growth over the span of fifteen days. The controll group, represented with blue, trailed the treatment group slightly until around day thirteen where it overtook the treatment group in terms of mean length of Manduca. On day 6, one of the controlls died. As well, on day 12, another controll died. These were the only Manduca that died. A two-sample one tailed t_test was performed for the data collected. The null hypothesis of the test stated that the mean length of the treatment group would be equal to the mean length of the controll group (H_0: X ̅_T= X ̅_C ) and the alternative hypothesis stated that the treatment group would have a greater mean length than the controll group H_a: X ̅_T&gt; X ̅_C. For the statistical test the t-value = .31, the degrees of freedom = 28, and the one-tailed p_value = .38. 

Discussion:
Discussion:
The results from the experiment suggest that there is no difference between the lengths in Manduca when one is treated with Precor while the other is given just water. The data from the graph also demonstrates this point as toward the end of the experiment, the controll group mean average for length was actually greater than the treatment group. This was backed up by the two-sample one-tailed t_test that was used. The p_value of the test was p = .38. This value is greater than p=.05. This means that the mean of the controll group was not statistically different than the mean of the treatment group. Thus, the null hypothesis of the t_test would not be rejected. Therefore, the original hypothesis is incorrect. The introduction of Precor did not speed up the development of the Manduca. One confounding variable that could influence the results of this data is that the length of the Manduca was difficult to measure. The Manduca did not like to be stretched out and tried to shrink so as to protect themselves. This made the accuracy of our length measurements extremely difficult, as within the raw data, on occasion the length of a Manduca would be recorded, and the next day the length of that Manduca would actually be less than the previous day. Overall, however, while we did not fully understand the effects of Precor on the development of Manduca before the experiment (leading to an incorrect hypothesis), the results do not demonstrate any abnormalities associated with the use of Precor. Precor contains Methoprene and falls under the class of IGRs called Juvenile Agonists [Pfeiffer] [Pedchem]. In Manduca sexta, Juvenile Hormone is a mechanism that prevents PTTH from being released. Only when Juvenile hormone levels drop is PTTH released and the larvae can produce its final molt to an adult. The use of Juvenile hormone agonist then during this stage where PTTH is supposed to release creates another bigger 6th larval instar stage of Manduca. [Kiguchi: 1978]. Therefore, to see if Precor was actually effective, it would be better to conduct a similar experiment in which the transition from larval instar to adult was observed. For this type of experiment to occur, we would need to compare a controll group and treatment group that received Precor. We would then compare the time it took each group to reach adulthood, observing the effects of IGRs on the insect’s growth and development. 
Many of the compounds that constitute IGRs are found in classes of terpenoids, benzamides, carbamates, triazines, and benzoylureas. Unlike other insecticides, the ability of IGRs to attack specific species and stage-specificities make them better at insect controll. Furthermore, IGRs are relatively safe for invertebrates, fish, birds, and other wildlife. Humans and domesticated animals are also considered safe from effects of IGRs. However, insects continue to be devastating pests for many crops, greatly influencing agriculture throughout the world. Yet, as technology increases, so does our ability to synthesize more effective IGRs, mitigating the effects of many insects, including Manduca Sexta [Tunaz:2003]. 
In conclusion, while Precor is a proven effective IGR, our experimental setup was not able to demonstrate these effects. The use of Precor in the experiment did not accelerate nor slow down the growth of Manduca sexta. This is constant with the scientific body of knowledge of Precor, as it is used as way to prevent a larval instar from becoming an adult.
