Title: Changes in resource allocation of mung bean (Vigna radiata) in response to spacious and crowded seed planting

Abstract:
This experiment sought to assess the impact of seed distribution and planting area on resource allocation of mung beans (Vigna radiata), measured by a ratio of the length and weight of roots to shoots. One group of seeds was planted in a crowded environment while the other group of seeds was planted in a more spacious environment. It was predicted that the root-shoot ratio would be higher for plants grown in a more spacious environment. The data showed that the root-shoot ratio for both weight and length of the plants was significently higher for the experimental group (more planting area per seed). These results show the importance of ample growing space for development of roots and uptake of nutrients. 

Introduction:
Plants must interact with biotic and abiotic factors in their ecological community. These interactions revolve around obtaining essential resources like sunlight, nitrogen, and water. In order to obtain, distribute, and use these resources, plants must perform resource allocation. The plant allocates energy to its leaves, the primary photosynthetic organ, the stems, the principal supporting structure, and the roots, the primary absorptive organ in order to compete for resources and obtain essential nutrients. Because resources are limited, they must develop a particular reproductive strategy and give up the option of using others, known as an evolutionary trade-off [Johnson: 2019]. This resource allocation is dependent on the plant’s environment. Our study analyzed the resource allocation of mung bean (Vigna radiata) plants. Mung bean is an important pulse crop grown from tropical to subtropical areas around the world [Birahnu: 2018]. Its prevalence in agriculture as well as its fast growth makes it an appropriate plant to analyze. This study sought to test how resource allocation changes when seeds are planted in a crowded environment versus a spacious environment, measured by a ratio of the length and weight of roots to shoots. Past studies have shown that the seed population and method of sowing is significent in contributing to mung bean yield, indicating a change in resource allocation. The highest grain yield was achieved at a spacing of 40 x 10 cm, while the lowest grain yield was produced by a 20 x 5 cm spacing. The narrowest spacing also produced the shortest plants, indicating an effect on growth [Birahnu: 2018].  The root-shoot ratio will be higher for plants grown in a more spacious, less crowded environment because there will be less competition for sunlight and therefore less allocation needed for shoots. 

Materials and Method:
Mung bean seeds were divided into a controll or experimental group and planted in one of two independent environments. The controll group contained 36 mung bean seeds divided evenly among 3 beds of vermiculite, resulting in 12 seeds evenly spaced in each bed. The experimental group contained 36 mung bean seeds divided evenly among 6 beds of vermiculite, resulting in 6 seeds evenly spaced in each bed. The plants were kept in a greenhouse and watered every day for two weeks. After two weeks of growth, 10 mung beans were selected from each group. The samples were measured for root length (cm), shoot length (cm), root weight (g), and shoot weight (g). Using these values, the mean and standard deviation for each category as well as the root-shoot ratio for length and weight were calculated. A one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to compare the data from the experimental and controll group. 

Results:
The ratio of the length of the roots to the length of the shoots of the experimental group was higher than the controll group (Figure 1). The mean length root-shoot ratio for the controll group was 0.70 with a standard deviation of +/- 0.17, while the mean length root-shoot ratio for the experimental group was 1.43 with a standard deviation of +/-0.54. The ratio of the weight of the roots to the weight of the shoots of the experimental group was also higher than the controll group (Figure 2). The mean weight root-shoot ratio for the controll group was 0.53 with a standard deviation of +/- 0.17 while the mean weight root-shoot ratio for the experimental group was 1.18 with a standard deviation of +/- 0.80. This data is statistically different, indicating that the treatment had some effect. A two sample t_test for the weight root-shoot ratio revealed a one-tailed p_value of 0.01045. A two-sample t_test for the length root-shoot ratio revealed a one-tailed p_value of 0.00032. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the root-shoot ratios for length and weight will be higher for plants grown in a more spacious environment was supported. The mung beans grown in the more spacious environment was able to allocate more energy to the roots because there was less competition for sunlight, whereas the mung beans grown in a more crowded environment had to allocate more energy to the shoots to compensate for higher competition for sunlight. Furthermore, the added space in the soil bed allowed the mung beans' roots in the experimental group to grow longer. This is consistent with a previous study which found that mung bean shoots were longer when grown with more narrow spacing [Birhanu 2018]. The results are also consistent with a study on Manado Kuning plants (Zea mays L.), a local maize, which found that an increase in planting distance resulted in more root growth [Lihiang: 2017]. These results could be retested in the future by increasing the number of replicates and adding a third or fourth group with different environments ranging from very spacious to very crowded, varying the number of seeds placed in each bed. This would further analyze the extent to which seed population and growing area affect resource allocation. Knowing more about how plants react to crowded growing environments is important as urban farming gains prevalence in large cities despite the lack of space for growing [Deelstra: 2000].  Understanding the detriments to yield of crowded plants could lead farmers to change their sowing method to a model with more area per seed.
