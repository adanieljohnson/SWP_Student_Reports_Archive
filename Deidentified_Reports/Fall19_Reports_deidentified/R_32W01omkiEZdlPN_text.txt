Title: Effect of Different Spatial Territories on Betta Splenden’s Agnostic Behaviors 

Abstract:
For our experiment, we studied aggressive behaviors of male Siamese Fighting fish (Betta Splendens), recording the amount of aggressive behaviors displayed when two males share the same space. The field of Animal behavior, in general, seeks to understand the relationship between physiological purposes and social interactions within organisms. Animal behavior can be initiated for several reasons, some being reproduction, territory, or resources like food. We hypothesized that the fish would display more aggressive behaviors when placed in the smallest tank size and would become less aggressive as the tank size increases. Our experiment required four male beta fish and three different tank sizes. We recorded our data (the amount of aggressive behaviors displayed by one fish, named Shy Smurf) in the form of tally marks and notes for the five trials within each tank. Every time we changed the tank size, a new opponent was used. For our statistical test we used ANOVA, which showed that our p value was .14, thus our data was not significant. Therefore, our alternative hypothesis was rejected, while our null was supported. Data could be skewed due to the use of a new fish each tank change and possibly the lack of sufficient rest time in-between the trials. If one were to do further test

Introduction:
Betta Splendens, also known as Siamese Fighting fish, are freshwater fish native to parts of Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. One may recognize these fish as Beta fish, the ones you can find in almost every pet store in little plastic cups in America. The field of Animal behavior, in general, seeks to understand the relationship between physiological purposes and social interactions within organisms. Animal behavior can be initiated by several internal stimuli, some being tied to reproduction, territory, or resources like food. The behaviors we focused on in our experiment were aggressive behaviors, known as agonistic behaviors. Agnostic behaviors typically occur when there is a “competition” for a mate, territory, or food resources. The aggressive behaviors could include broadside movements or the more aggressive display, facing movements. The broadside movements could include tail flashing/beating, parallel swimming, or pelvic fin flicking. Facing movements are flashier and could include erect pectoral fins, gill covers spread out, and the most aggressive form of facing, the “red mane”, which is the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane. A study showed that beta fish display these agnostic behaviors, in relation to nest building, towards other males to basically communicate that the location they build their nest in is theirs [Brontein:1981]. This behavior could also be useful with the protection of their youth or mate that would live in said nest. So, our experiment set out to see at what spatial distance could two male bettas coincide without displaying aggressive behaviors. We hypothesized that the fish would display greater agnostic intraspecific behaviors when placed in a small tank and would become less aggressive as the tank size increases because with more space, territories could be created at two ends of the tanks.  

Materials and Methods:
Our experiment required four male beta fish and three different tank sizes. The three tank sizes were small, medium, and large. One of our four fish, named shy Smurf was used throughout all three tanks sizes while the other three fish were divided into the three tank sizes. For each tank size we would perform five trials of the experiment. First, we tested the presents of agnostic behaviors in the small tank. We placed both shy guy and the first fish into two opaquely separated sides of the tank, allowing them to adjust to the new environment. Then we removed the divider allowing the two fish to react to each other for 1 minute followed by a 1-minute rest period. As experiment was undergoing, we recorded our observations of aggressive behaviors, tallying up the times broadside or facing movements were displayed, while also ensuring the safety of the fish, breaking the interactions up early if need be. Then we repeated the same steps for 4 more trials in the small sized tank before moving on to the next size. When we moved to the next size (medium) we added in a new fish (fish 2), keeping Shy Smurf and followed the same steps as before for the large tank as well (except we switched out fish 2 for fish 3). As our experiment went on, we extended our rest period to 5 minutes due to extreme stress shown within shy Smurf during the trials in the large tank. We choose to ANOVA (with the alpha being 0.05 or less for statistical significance) as our statistical testing, because tank size counts as categorical data. In term of our statistical testing, the independent variable in our experiment was the tank size, while the dependent variable was the number of agnostic behaviors displayed. We then preformed a Turkey-Kramer test from the ANOVA to determine the significance between our categorical groups. 

Results:
The results of our ANOVA test showed that our p value was 0.14, thus our data was not significant. The amount of agnostic behaviors, as well as our observations differed between each of the three tank sizes. Before the trials even started shy Smurf stayed toward the bottom of the tank, seeming to be a docile fish. However, when placed in the small tank with another male, he demonstrated agnostic behaviors in every trial. For the first three trials it took shy Smurf around 45 seconds to demonstrate a facing movement, while in trial 4 and 5 he demonstrated facing aggression sooner than 45 seconds, closer to 30 seconds. The medium tank yielded fewer agnostic behaviors than the first, however the first trial had the most aggressive behaviors of the whole experiment at 11. Meanwhile, trials 2-5 decreased significantly, with one trial even exhibiting zero agnostic behaviors. The large tank trials yielded the smallest number of signs of aggression with two trials coming up with zero. (refer to figure 1) He would slowly approach his opponent and show faint broadside movements like tail flicking, and the quickly swim away to avoid contact. The average number of aggressive behaviors shown during the trials were 
3.5±-0.71 for Small, 6.5±6.36 for Medium, and -1±1.41for the Large tank size. The medium tank is an outlier, due to the 11 behaviors in first trial being so much higher than the other 4 trials, tilting our data, making it have a high average and standard deviation. The large tank gave a value below zero, even though negative amounts of behavior can’t be shown. Thus, our Turkey-Kramer test showed no significance between the two groups. The variance between the groups was 21.18% and 78.82% within the groups. 


Discussion:
Due to the fact that our data was not significant, our alternate hypothesis, that the amount of intraspecific agonistic behaviors would decrease as tank size increases, was rejected and the null was accepted. There were many areas of our research that could have possibly skewed our data, making it insignificant. One could say the big issue could have been that every time we switched tanks we added in a new fish, while keeping shy Smurf through all of the trials. This could have skewed our data because as shy Smurf was going through the trial, he was getting tired, and we would just place a new energetic fish to the experiment. We saw the physical color change within shy Smurf, so the interactions weren’t on a leveled playing filed. Also, an opportunity we missed by exchanging out the fish was to see if the fish would habituate to each other and just keep to one side, because they both would be tired from the testing. We could and probably should have allotted more time in-between the trials because the fish began to cower away from the displays of fish 2, shy Smurf started to show signs of stress and was just beginning to avoid fish 2 at any cost. So, by the time we got to the Large tank, shy Smurf began to become pale in color with his caudal fin closed in the medium tank, and just succumbed to submission sooner due to not the right amount of break time. The setting of the experiment (empty transparent tanks) could also not be the right conditions to test the natural agonistic behaviors because in the wild there would be some debris or plants to claim and form a nest rather than a big open space. And when males get fixated on their specific nest, usually in a corner, they become aggressive with territory defense. [Bronstein: 1980] Therefore when resources, such as mates, territories, and food are at risk of being taken, betta splendens have adapted to display agonistic behaviors to intraspecific-ally communicate with each other. If one were to do further testing, they could use only two fish for the whole experiment and see how the results change. One could also change up the setting of the tanks and maybe add some natural elements rather than just an empty space with nothing to really claim. It’s important to understand relationships and behaviors within species to be able to appreciate and know what they require for survival so we can further protect future generations and/or keep our fish alive in our personal tanks.
