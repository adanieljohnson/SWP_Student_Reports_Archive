Title: Impact of excess phosphorous on resource allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
Plants respond to the availability of resources in the environment by altering their resource allocation pattern and favoring growth of specific structures to attain these resources. In mediums deficient in nutrients, plants have been found to favor growth of longer roots. Thus, plants might be expected to have shorter roots when grown in nutrient-rich medium. It was hypothesized that Fagopyrum esculentum exposed to excess phosphorous (from bone meal solution) would have a smaller root:shoot ratio than the control group. Methods included watering buckwheat plants daily with either 100 mL water (control) or an equal amount of 20% P2O5 bone meal solution. The hypothesis was not supported, as statistical significance was not reached in the data, with a p-value of 0.378. It was concluded that the concentration of phosphorus given to the plants likely exceeded their threshold, or may have caused an iron-deficiency. In future studies, buckwheat should be given varying concentrations of phosphorous to determine the concentration of phosphorus at which shoot growth is optimized.


Introduction:
Given that biotic and abiotic resources necessary for plant survival are present in the environment in limited quantities, plants must adjust by developing structures that allow them to optimally extract these resources. In certain conditions, a plant may preferentially allocate carbon to the leaves, stem, or roots, and therefore have some of these structures more developed than others. The roots allow the plant to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, whereas the stem and leaves are associated with the acquisition of light and photosynthesis. One abiotic factor known to influence resource allocation in plants is the availability of minerals in soil (Johnson: 2019). Considered a macronutrient, phosphorus forms part of essential molecules such as nucleic acids and phospholipids; moreover, inorganic phosphorus acts in metabolic pathways (Schachtman: 1998). As such, it has been found that plants grown in a phosphorous-deficient medium allocate carbon resources to the roots in an effort to acquire this vital nutrient, resulting in the growth of a more extensive root system (Hermans: 2006).  Fagopyrum esculentum will be used as the model organism for the experiment, as its seeds germinate quickly, and it is a common crop plant. In addition to its use as feed for livestock, buckwheat’s seeds are a good source of protein and carbohydrates for humans, and may act as antioxidants (Holasova: 2002). Therefore, the study of its resource allocation pattern has practical applications in the agricultural field. It is hypothesized that buckwheat plants exposed to excess phosphorous will have a smaller root:shoot ratio by length.



Materials and Methods:
Two trays, one for the control and one for the experimental group, were prepared for this experiment, with each tray containing 8 plots. In each plot, one small scoop of Miracle Gro was mixed with vermiculite before placing buckwheat seeds on top. The contents of each plot were then saturated with water. Every day for a two-week period, plants were either given 100 mL water (control) or 100 mL of 20% P2O5 bone meal solution (experimental). During this time, plants were stored in a greenhouse with ample exposure to sunlight.
	After two weeks had elapsed, two plants were harvested from each plot The roots were separated by washing off any remaining vermiculite with water. The plants were dried before cutting each apart where the roots met the shoots. The shoot length and maximum root length were recorded and used to calculate the root:shoot length ratio. The average root:shoot length ratio averages for the control and experimental groups were compared using a one-tailed paired t-test.


Results:
The average ratio of root:shoot length for the control was 0.51 (SD: 0.18), whereas the average root:shoot length ratio for the bone meal group was 0.49 (SD: 0.14). The root:shoot ratio was not significantly different in the bone meal group from the control (t-stat = 0.31, df = 30 , P = 0.378). 


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that buckwheat grown in a medium with high amounts of phosphorous would have a smaller root:shoot length ratio. The original hypothesis has not been supported, and statistical significance was not reached. This data suggests that buckwheat plants do not preferentially allocate carbon resources to the stem or leaves when an abundance of phosphorous is readily available in the medium. Conversely, the data suggests that buckwheat plants with only a small/normal amount of phosphorus in the medium (as in the control) do not distribute a significantly greater portion of their resources to the root system as compared to the bone meal group. While this result may seem to defy logic, there are possible mechanisms explaining how this phenomenon occurred. One explanation is that it was too costly for the buckwheat to grow longer roots in the control, and this cost exceeded the reward that would be gained from increased phosphorous uptake (Johnson: 2019). Additionally, the excess of phosphate present in the medium could have led to an iron deficiency and a shortage of chlorophyll. Under conditions in which plants are exposed to an excess of phosphorous, plants have demonstrated a related lack of iron, which is used in the synthesis of chlorophyll. A shortage of chlorophyll in iron-deficient plants therefore stunts overall plant growth (De Kock: 1965).
	One limitation of the present experiment may have been that the buckwheat plants were given too much water. Buckwheat typically performs best in arid climates; thus it may have been more appropriate to water the plants less frequently. The utilization of phosphorous by plants differs in soils with high moisture compared to drier soils (Ryan: 1982). Therefore, when grown in a medium with its optimal moisture conditions, buckwheat might have a different resource allocation pattern to cope with an excess of phosphorus.
	In future experiments, the procedure might be repeated with multiple experimental groups, with each administered bone meal solution of varying concentrations. Researchers might consider decreasing the amount of water given to the plants. Such an experiment would allow researchers to identify the threshold for potassium uptake in buckwheat. This knowledge would be valuable in that the phosphate concentration that maximizes shoot growth could be determined; the plants at the optimum phosphate concentration would be the most productive and yield the most seeds. Since phosphate fertilizers are costly, identifying the maximum phosphate concentration that is effective for increasing buckwheat productivity would be of benefit to farmers, especially in developing countries.

Figure 1. Effect of Phosphorous on Average Root:Shoot Length Ratio. The control buckwheat plants (orange bar) were given 100 mL water daily for 14 days. The experimental group (blue bar) was given 100 mL of 20% P2O5 solution daily for 14 days. Root and shoot lengths were measured in millimeters, and the root:shoot ratio was calculated by dividing the root length by that of the shoot. Each bar is the mean root:shoot length ratio of 16 buckwheat plants. Error bars represent ±1 standard deviation of the sample.
