Title: The Effects of Low Levels of Salinity on Photosystem II Activity in Spinacia Oleracea Chloroplasts 

Abstract:
This experiment focuses on the effects of low salt concentrations on photosystem II activity in the chloroplasts of the Spinacia oleracea. Salt stress is an important component to plant photosynthesis due to salt being in many environments. At low levels of salt, there is an increase in the activity of photosystem II activity, however at high concentrations it is dramatically decreased to almost no activity. In this experiment, after a process of chloroplast extraction, 0.1 M sodium chloride was added to an experimental group of test tubes containing water, chloroplasts, DCIP, and buffer solution. After 20 minutes of the reaction occurring in bright light, the absorbances were recorded and the percent change in absorbance was compared to that of the controll group. The results of the two-sample independent two-tailed statistical test produced a p value of is 0.00106. This means that the results were significent and the hypothesis that the low salt concentration will cause a greater decrease in absorbance, meaning greater photosystem II activity, of the Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts was supported. This information provides insight into cost effective ways for farmers or plant owners to increase the rate of photosystem II in their crops.

Introduction:
Plants rely on photosynthesis for the production of energy in order to continue functioning appropriately. Photosynthesis is defined as the process by which plants use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water and give off oxygen as a byproduct. The process consists of 3 distinct steps. Each of these processes are running inside of the chloroplast, a major organelle only found in plant cells [Johnson: 2019]. Photosystem II is a process in which the energy created by the absorption of light photons causes electrons to move out of the chlorophyll, thus oxidizing the chlorophyll. This chlorophyll is then reduced by the addition of water which produces oxygen as a byproduct. Due to the difficulty of measuring oxygen production, the Hill reaction will be monitored in this experiment in order to determine photosystem II activity. This reaction causes photosystem II to pass the electrons to an alternative electron acceptor, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), thus causing a reduction in color of the DCIP decreasing the absorbance [Johnson: 2019]. Absorbance is an easy variable to measure and is therefore the marker for determining photosystem II activity. As the absorbance goes down, there is more photosystem II activity occurring. This experiment will focus on the effects of low salt concentrations on photosystem II activity in the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea, commonly known as spinach. This is an appropriate model organism because it is cost efficient and chloroplast rich. Sodium chloride is an accessible salt that was used in this experiment as the independent variable in order to measure the effects of minor salt stress on the activity of spinach chloroplasts photosystem II, therefore the dependent variable. In low concentrations of sodium chloride, precisely 50 to 400 mM NaCl, the salt stimulated uncoupled electron transport, thus indicating an increase in photosystem II activity [Baker: 1978]. According to the study, high concentrations decreased activity, however lower concentrations increased it. At high concentrations, salt serves to inhibit the electron transport in the system [Lu: 2002]. Therefore, this experiment will measure the effects at a 0.1 M concentration, considered a low concentration of NaCl. The significance of this data is it has implications for plants living in a slightly salty environment. Thus, we hypothesized that the low salt concentration will cause a greater decrease in absorbance, meaning greater photosystem II activity, of the Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts. 

Materials and Method:
Four medium sized deveined Spinacia oleracea leaves were collected and ground up in a cold mortar and pestle after being combined with cold grinding buffer. The resulting paste was filtered through a layer of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 200 times the gravity (1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 4 minutes at 4oC. The resulting substance was transferred to a new tube (tube B) leaving any remaining debris at the bottom of the original tube (tube A). This was again centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4oC. The remaining pellet was left behind when the liquid was transferred to a new tube (tube C). This pellet was then suspended by the addition of grinding buffer and used for further experimentation due to the high concentration of chloroplasts and low concentration of debris tested on the hemocytometer. The samples were prepared with various concentrations and volumes of water, chloroplasts, DCIP (130 mM), buffer solution, and salinity (0.1 M). There were 4 groups of experimentation created excluding the blank: no chloroplasts no salt, no chloroplasts with salt, and 3 tubes of each chloroplasts without salt and chloroplasts with salt. An initial reading of absorbance for each sample was taken on the blanked spectrophotometer set at 600nm immediately after the addition of DCIP. After 20 minutes of the samples sitting in 20214.6 lumens per square meter of light, the absorbances were then measured again. The resulting data was used to calculate percent change in absorbance from the equation below and a two-sample independent two tailed t test was performed. A lower absorbance after 20 min, thus a greater percent change in absorbance, means that there was a higher activity of photosystem II.

% change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’)/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100% 

Results:
The results showed that the experimental group with 0.1 M NaCl had a significently greater percent change in absorbance as compared to the controll group without salt. The average percent change in absorbance after 20 min for the controll group without salt was 17.24 +/- 4.06%. Whereas the average difference in absorbance of the experimental chloroplasts in salt stress was 62.17 +/- 8.24%. Each of these values are demonstrated in figure 1.Visually, the experimental group with salt was also much lighter than that of the group without salt. Therefore, we saw a decrease in absorbance for experimental groups which in turn means an increase in PSII activity. With an alpha value of 0.05, the two-sample independent two tailed p_value is 0.00106 with degrees of freedom of 4, and a t-value of 8.474. Based on the p_value of the experiment, the results are statistically significent. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the low salt concentration will cause a greater decrease in absorbance, meaning greater photosystem II activity, of the Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts was supported. We observed a significent difference at the 0.05 level, suggesting that the low level of sodium chloride did cause an increase in photosystem II activity. These results are supported by previous studies about the effects of low levels of salt stress on photosystem II. According to this study,  absorption rate increased significently with a low salt concentration up to 300 mM of NaCl [Lu: 2003]. This suggests that PSII activity was increased due to the lower levels of salt concentration. The results of this experiment were also supported by a second study that found at 50 to 400mM NaCl as well as KCl, the uncoupled electron transport was increased [Baker: 1978]. Had the concentration been high however, a significent difference in the opposite direction, meaning decreased PSII activity, would have been observed. A place of further study could be the examination of the effect of lightly greater salt concentrations in order to determine the optimal level of salinity that produces the greatest PSII activity. This information has significance because it examines the optimal environments for plants to live in. Knowing this provides pertinent information for farmers with the ideal salinity levels to water their plants with to maximize photosystem II activity, thus increasing plant growth.
