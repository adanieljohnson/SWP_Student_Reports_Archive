Title: The effect of IG regulator on the development of Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm)

Abstract:
NA

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidopetra. Tobacco hornworm is one of the many common names for Manduca sexta. Tobacco hornworms undergo a holometabolous life cycle which includes four major life cycles: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult (Johnson: 2019). The larvae and adult forms of tobacco hornworms are very dissimilar. Major body reorganizations occur during pupal metamorphosis. Tobacco hornworms pass from one life stage to the next by molting, which is when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer, or cuticle, and the old cuticle is shed. During their progression through a holometabolous life cycle, tobacco hornworms’ brains receive inputs from their bodies. These inputs are often hormones that are released to initiate a specific response. The two primary hormones that control tobacco hornworms’ development from an egg into an adult are ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) (Johnson: 2019). 20E is responsible for regulating the timing of molting, and JH regulates the type of molting. JH levels remain elevated in tobacco hornworms through the 4th instar but drop very low during the 5th instar (Johnson: 2019). An instar is a phase between two periods of molting. This decrease in JH allows for the release of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) that stimulates a small amount of 20E to be released. When 20E is released in the absence of JH, it causes tobacco hornworms to stop feeding and to find a pupation site. Additionally, the larva cannot undergo another larval molt but rather only a pupal molt (Riddiford: 2012). Past experiments have demonstrated that exposure to 20E and JH prolonged the larval state (Riddiford: 1978). This experiment focuses on the effect JH has on the development of tobacco hornworms, therefore determining the viability of using JH as a pesticide. Tobacco hornworms are considered pests when they are in their pre-adulthood stages. The addition of JH may decrease the size of tobacco hornworms in their earlier life stages, which could minimize the damage they have on plants. If tobacco hornworms are fed ten grams of food containing eight drops of IG Regulator (a type of JH), then the they will weigh less than tobacco hornworms that are fed ten grams of food containing eight drops of water. 

Materials and Methods:
This experiment used a control group and an experimental group. Each group contained four tobacco hornworms in the 3rd instar larva. The tobacco hornworms were all weighed and placed in their own compartments in a plastic container. The control group and experimental groups were placed in separate plastic containers, and the tobacco hornworms were labeled one through eight. Each tobacco hornworm was given ten grams of food. The food was clumped into a ball and placed into the corner of the individual compartments. Eight drops of IG Regulator were added to the experimental group’s food, and the food given to the control group received eight drops of water. The tobacco hornworms were weighted daily for a total of two weeks, and daily observations were made about their physical appearances. Additionally, the food was checked daily and was replaced if it was dry. If the food was replaced, another ten grams of food was given with either eight drops of IG Regulator or eight drops of water depending on which group the tobacco hornworm was in. Feces were removed from the containers daily. After the data was collected, a one-tail p-value was calculated. A p-value above 0.05 indicates that the data is not significant, and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. 

Results:
The average daily weights of the control group and the experimental group remained similar throughout the first eleven days as seen in Figure 1. Starting around the eleventh day, the average daily weights of the experimental group began to surpass the average daily weights of the control group. This pattern continued until the end of the experiment on the fourteenth day. The one-tailed p-value for the experiment was 0.39. The average daily weights of the experimental group and the control group were 3.78 grams and 3.42 grams respectively. The standard deviations of of the experimental group and the control group were 3.95 and 3.04 respectively. As seen in Figure 2, the tobacco hornworms in the experimental group were much paler in color compared to those in the control group. Furthermore, the experimental group had spiracles that were much less defined and vibrant compared to those on the tobacco hornworms in the control group. Additionally, the experimental group had white tail spines while those in the control group had reddish pink tail spines. Lastly, black dotted lines were present along the abdomen of the tobacco hornworms in the control group and not those in the experimental group. In Figure 3, it can be seen that one of the tobacco hornworms in the control group (number seven) formed a dark brown cuticle on the fourteenth day, indicating that it was at the start of its metamorphosis. 

Discussion:
A one-tailed p-value of 0.34 indicates that the data collected in the experiment is statistically insignificant, and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the addition of JH had any effect on the tobacco hornworm’s weights. Furthermore, JH is not a viable pesticide because the one-tailed p-value rejects our alternate hypothesis which stated that the tobacco hornworms in the experimental group would weigh less than those in the control group. However, the tobacco hornworms in the experimental group appeared to be considerably different in their physical appearances. The addition of JH may have caused the tobacco hornworms in the experimental group to be much paler in color, to have less visible spiralces, to have a white tail spine instead of a reddish pink one, and to not have black dotted lines running down their abdomens. In future experiments, it may be worthwhile to raise the tobacco hornworms in a more natural setting because environmental factors such as temperature, nutritional conditions, photoperiod, and humidity can affect the number of larval instars that insects endure (Daimon: 2012). An experiment in which the tobacco hornworms are raised in a regulated but natural environment will produce results that are much more practical.
