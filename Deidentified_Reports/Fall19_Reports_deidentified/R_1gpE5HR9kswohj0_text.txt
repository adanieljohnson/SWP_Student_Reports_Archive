Title: Juvenile hormones effect on the development of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Research on how hormones influence the growth of insects has garnered attention from the agricultural industry in the past few decades [Dhadialla: 1998]. The research has been focused on two hormones in particular, ecdysterene (20E), and the juvenile hormone (JH) due to their signaling acting as a controll of insect growth, behaviors, and development. This is important when considering insecticides are being used to target specific insects [Noriega, 2014]. New insecticides can controll hormone levels, thus affecting the insect’s developmental stages and causing less of an ecotoxicological impact on other species [Noriega, 2014]. JH acts as an inhibitor of metamorphosis whereas 20E instigates the start of metamorphosis. The balance of these hormones and weight of their affect can be witnessed when examining the Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm. The hornworm follows a holometabolous life cycle consisting of four stages: the egg, larvae, pupa, and adult [Johnson: 2019]. Molting is the process, driven by hormone concentration, that moves the tobacco hornworm through these phases. JH controlls the type of molting while 20E manages the time it occurs [Johnson: 2019]. What is known as the “commitment pulse” acts as a final transition from larvae to pupa. The phase is recognized by a spike in 20E and a lower amount of JH present. After pulpating, the JH concentration remains low while 20E gradually increases until a fully developed adult is formed. This raises the question of whether higher JH concentrations can hinder the growth of a hornworm or other insects. Knowing how an increased amount of this hormone will affect an insect’s species can provide helpful information for the agriculture industry and the development of growth inhibiting insecticides. In this experiment, the affect JH has on hornworm growth will be examined. It is hypothesized that if IGR Methoprene (a substance analogous to JH) is added to the Manduca sextas food source, then the worm will remain in lower developmental stages and weigh less for a longer period of time than what is expected over a fifteen-day time period.

Materials and Method:
To begin this lab, we acquired eight hornworms in their larvae stage. Two containers were gathered with four sections in each, and each section was punctured with two holes. The containers were labelled, one as a controll group and the other as an experimental group. The hornworms were then weighed and added to the containers, one to each section. The weighed measurement was recorded within a spreadsheet where raw data and observations were written for the entirety of this experiment. A food source for the hornworms was considered next. Each worm was to have ten grams of food. For the experimental group, forty grams of food was weighed then divided into ten grams for each hornworm. Five drops of IGR Methoprene were added to each food source by the use of a pipette. Each of the ten grams was mixed with five drops of Methoprene and transferred into the experimental group’s sections. The food has a tendency to dry out, so it was compacted together (to retain moisture) in each section before moving on to the controll group. The controll group followed, requiring forty total grams of food to divide between the four worms. A new container was used to mix the food and split it amongst the worms in ten grams. To each of the worms’ ten grams, five drops of water was added by pipette. This was done to simulate the same moisture level for the controll as the experimental group experienced. The containers were set in a temperature sensitive refrigerator and data was collected each day for the following fourteen days. This data included the weight of each worm as well as comparative observational data between the controll and experimental groups. Observational data was taken every five days and the observations noted coloration and any new developments on the worms. Once all of the data was collected for a total of fifteen days, statistical tests were used to compare the controll and experimental worms. These tests include finding the average weight, the standard deviation, and a one-tailed, two sample T test. 

Results:
Data in this lab was collected by observations and numerically by weighing the worms. After the fifteen days, the average controll group mass was 7.48 grams while the experimental was 8.09 grams. This was recognized throughout the experiment as the weights of the experimental group were slightly, but consistently larger than those of the controll group. To compare these average values, a one-tailed, two sample T-test was completed. The result, 0.25511, shows only a small dispersion between the means. The standard deviation was also calculated to determine variation within each data set. The experimental group is seen to have a higher standard deviation (SD: 5.29) than the controll (SD: 4.78), meaning the worm’s weights deviated further apart in this group. Although the statistical data does not show much of a difference between the controll and experimental groups (as seen in Figure 1), observational data showed the slower development in the experimental group than the controll. Observations were taken every five days. This allowed time for development and notable observations to be made. Day one showed all worms to be in their larvae phase. On day five, the experimental group appeared to have a white color. The controll group began to take on a bluer coloration. By day ten, this difference intensified. The experimental group had a light blue color while the controll worms took on a more vibrant color of blue/green. By day fifteen, small horns were noticed on the controll group worms and the color became brighter within the five days. The experimental group remained a pale blue/green. 

Discussion:
The juvenile hormone within insects is necessary for the initial development on insects, specifically the Manduca Sexta. After this intitial development, JH is made available until the last instar phase. During this phase, the concentration of JH drops, leading to metamorphosis and the worms’ transition into adulthood. The inhibition of this final development to occur can be prompted by a surplus of JH remaining in the insect [Slama: 1971]. The hindrance of JH on development in the Manduca sexta was tested within this experiment. By supplying a source of IGR Methoprene to the experimental group, the development was compared to a controll group with no hormonal additives. It was hypothesized that a lack of development would be witnessed in the experimental group and this was to be based on observational data and each worm’s weight. The results show very little difference between weight of worms in the controll versus worms in the experimental. This could be due to both worms being given to equal amounts of food. The addition of JH does not affect the worms’ weight, but rather its development. Both worms consuming the same amount of food allowed them to grow at similar rates. However, the stunt in development of experimental worms can be noticed through observations. The observations show a slower development of the experimental worms, as they remained a pale color for the duration of the experiment. The controll groups transition into a vibrant color and its growth of horns helps draw the conclusion that the consumption of excess JH prevented the experimental group from reaching this developmental stage. The discovery of JH being a safe deterrent of insect growth sparked its usage as an insecticide. Agriculture has begun incorporating JH analogs (JHAs) into their insecticides. This reduces toxicity, showing only a slight behavioral effect on some insects and susceptibility in others during metamorphosis. JHAs however do not affect fish, birds, and mammals [Slama: 1971]. The future of JHAs being used within insecticides is now focused on specificity within the insecticide. Having the JHAs reach only a particular target insect is important for narrowing the number of insects it affects.
