Title: The Effect of Salt Water on Raphanus sativus Leaf Surface Area

Abstract:
Radishes are commonly consumed by humans; with an increasing industrial landscape, it is common for plants to be exposed to less fresh water and more salt water. As radish plants continue to have less access to freshwater, examining how their leaf surface area compares in salt water can help us to estimate how their growth will change over time. In this experiment, radish plants were exposed to 6 M NaCl water and regular water and then their average leaf surface areas were compared. There was no statistical significance between the plants watered with salt water compared to the plants watered with regular water with a p-value of 0.22. The experimental hypothesis was not supported. There was a large outlier within our control group, which may have accounted for insignificant results that were received. Future experiments could examine these conditions with a larger sample size so an outlier will not have such of a drastic effect on the final results of the experiment. These results can help to understand how an increasing industrial environment may impact leaf surface area of radish plants

Introduction:
In the environment, plants need water in order to grow and undergo photosynthesis. Additionally, plants use water for nutrient transport. Plants will allocate their resources to different systems in order to compensate for their inability to receive adequate nutrients [Johnson: 2016].  Radishes are consumed by humans as a source of different vitamins and nutrients. As the industrial climate of the United States continues to grow, it is more common for plants to have water that is more damaging to their growth such as salt water. Different edible plants such as pepper hybrids the have shown a significant plant height decrease when watered with NaCl infused water compared to plants watered with regular water [Chartzoulakis: 2000]. Additionally, rice plants were shown to decrease in leaf surface area as their salt concentrations increased [Amirjani: 2010]. High salinity can result in growth limiting factors such as smaller leaves because the plants will not have the proper access to water for nutrient flow or growth support. If the radish plants are watered with NaCl infused water, then they will have smaller leaf surface area than those plants watered with regular water because the salt watered plants will have had inadequate access to nutrients. Through osmosis, salt will draw  water from leaves to their roots in order to minimize the concentration gradient, leaving those plants exposed with salt water with a smaller leaf surface area.

Materials and Methods:
6 small buckets were obtained. 15 radish plant seeds were planted in each of the 6 small buckets, labeled as 6 different sets. These seeds were then each buried within Vermiculite soil. Out of the 6 sets, 3 were labeled as control and 3 were labeled as treatment. Then each these sets were placed in a greenhouse consistent temperatures at 75° Fahrenheit and all sets had the same access to sunlight. The 3 sets of treatment group were watered with 100 milliliters of 6 M NaCl solution daily, including the initial day that they were placed in the greenhouse, for 2 weeks at approximately the same time. Then the 3 sets of control groups with 100 milliliters of tap were watered daily, including the initial day that they were placed in the greenhouse, for 2 weeks at approximately the same time. After the 2 week period, the 3 largest leaves from each set were cut off from the plants and measured because of the inconsistency within the number of leaves from each set as well as the varying degrees of large and small leaves. These leaves were measured using a technique that placed each leaf on an equal grid of 1 cm2 blocks. After counting the blocks that each leaf was in, the blocks were then added together in order to determine an individual leaf’s surface area. After measuring and recording their surface areas, the average surface area of each set was calculated. Then the 3 control sets and the 3 treatment sets were averaged separately in order to have two final groups, average surface area of control and average surface area of treatment. These averages were compared with a one-tailed two-sample t-test.


Results:
The average leaf surface area of the control group was 3.31 cm2 and the average leaf surface area of the treatment group was 4.14 cm2 (Table 1). There was no significant difference between the leaf surface area of the control group and the treatment group (t=1.44, df=4, p=0.223). According to the two-sample t-test that was run, these results were not statistically significant. The p-value obtained was 0.223, indicating that there was a 22.3% chance that our results were due to chance.

Discussion:
Prior to conducting this experiment, it was hypothesized that plants exposed to salt water would have a smaller leaf surface area than those that were not watered with salt water. The results from this experiment do not support the hypothesis made earlier. The radish plants watered with NaCl had an overall larger surface area than the control plants watered with regular water (Figure 1). Radishes are a type of plant that has a large importance within the current global agricultural system. Since water systems are being tainted from an increasing industrial environment, these radish plants have less access to freshwater through an irrigation system [Chartzoulakis:2000]. Industrial environments do not adequately filter water through aquifers because of the high hydraulic gradient due to the usage of oil-brines near cities or high industry communities [Pettyjohn:1971]. From our experiment, radishes in salt water did better than fresh water radishes, which contradicts some of the previous literature. Even though these results differ from other studies, the data is still valid and reliable. Since there was a relatively small measurement of leaves, their averages may not have been an accurate representation of how the salt water impacts leaf surface area as a whole. The largest 3 leaves were cut and averaged because there were varying amounts of large and small leaves within each set. The sets varied significantly in the number of leaves, which is why the largest 3 were taken and measured. If all of the leaves were taken and measured from each set some of the sets would have been skewed because there would only be a small sample of them. The largest 3 were taken in order to expel the potential confounding error of an outlier. In retrospect, it might have impacted the accuracy of the results. This issue can be resolved in the future by including the surface area of every single leaf in every single set of each plant.   Another potential error from this experiment includes the inadequate leaves of a set from the control group. One set of plants in the control group was significantly smaller than the other sets in the control and treatment groups. When this one set of plants was observed, its leaves were drooping and yellow. After careful examination of this set of plants at the conclusion of the two weeks, it appears that they were moved slightly from their original spot so the one set with the outlier data was not exposed to the same amount of sunlight as the other sets. However, they were not omitted from the results. This outlier set was likely responsible for the difference between the groups as well as the large standard deviation that can be seen in the control group and not in the treatment group. Future studies can examine these same experiment conditions with a larger sample size in order to expel the potential outlier that may impact data. Additionally, future studies could examine these conditions with other plant species in order to examine whether or not salt water impacts leaf surface area of other plants species. This experiment helps to further understand the influence of salt water, as a substitute for freshwater, on radish plants, which will continue to be important in an increasing industrial environment.
