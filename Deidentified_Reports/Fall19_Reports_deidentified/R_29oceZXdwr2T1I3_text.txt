Title: The Negative Effect of Liquid Hand Soap on Hill Reactions in Spinach Leaves

Abstract:
In photosynthesis, oxidation/reduction reactions are promoted in Photosystem 2 by light. These oxidation/reduction reactions can pass electrons to alternative electron acceptors, such as DCIP. When DCIP is reduced, it changes color, which in turn changes the absorbance at 600nm. Detergents have a great impact on inhibiting this reduction reaction. In this experiment, we measured the effect of liquid hand soap containing detergents on the Hill reactions in spinach leaves (spinacia oleracea). We enriched chloroplast and added soap with a reaction buffer to one sample, and no soap with reaction buffer to another, and measured absorbance after 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Our main objective of this lab was to observe the effect liquid hand soap had on photosynthesis. We hypothesize that liquid hand soap will negatively affect the rate of oxidation/reduction reactions in Hill reactions. It was observed that there was a larger percent change in absorbance in the spinach leaf with soap, because DCIP was not reduced and did not change color. Therefore, the detergent in the liquid soap prevented the DCIP from being reduced, interfering with activity in PS2. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we measured the effects of liquid hand soap on DCIP reduction, which indirectly estimates the oxidation/reduction reactions in Photosystem 2.  The question tested was, how does hand soap, which contains detergents, effect the rate of the oxidation/reduction reactions in Photosystem 2. In photosynthesis, energy from absorbed photon of light causes electrons to get excited and leave chlorophyll and move to plastoquinone, and then chlorophyll is reduced again by the hydrolysis of water. It is believed that PS-2 will pass electrons to alternative electron acceptors, which is called Hill reactions. We use DCIP, an alternative electron acceptor, to measure this activity because oxidized DCIP is a dark blue compound that absorbs light at 600nm, and reducing this compound makes it colorless. This allows experimenters to measure DCIP reduction by measuring a decrease in light absorbance at 600nm. [Bio 114 lab Sakai site: 2019]. Therefore, the oxidation reduction reactions in PS2 can be measured by DCIP. We chose to test spinach because spinach is a plant that undergoes this process. In another experiment, a different detergent “effectively ruptures intact chloroplasts, and at low concentrations disrupts the sequential electron flow required for the Hill reaction.” [Vernon: 1965].  Therefore, we hypothesized that addition of liquid hand soap will negatively affect the rate of oxidation/reduction reactions compared to oxidation/reduction reactions without hand soap in spinach leaves, because detergents disrupt electron flow. By negatively affecting the rate of oxidation/reduction reactions, this would have an effect on photosynthesis. 

Materials and Methods:
The first step in this experiment is to enrich chloroplast by differential centrifugation. We first took our mortar and pestle, a medium-size beaker, and 3, 50mL centrifuge tubes and placed them all on crushed ice. While that was cooling, we took our four spinach leaves and removed the large central veins from the leaf and rinsed the remaining leaves and then blotted off excess water. We added the spinach leaves to the mortar and pestle and added 10mL of cold grinding buffer to grind the spinach until it was a thick paste. We then added another 10mL of grinding buffer to the spinach slurry and strained the slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. After, we transferred 200μl of the filtered liquid into a microtube labeled Sample of A and stored it on ice. Next we transferred the remaining green liquid into a chilled 50mL centrifuge tube marked A and span it in the centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4 degree Celsius. We then poured the supernatant out of the tube, and into the second tubed marked B, and left the pellet debris at the bottom of tube A. We removed 200μl of the liquid from 50mL tube marked B, and placed it in a microtube labeled Sample of B. Lastly, we centrifuged the 50mL tube at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degree Celsius, poured the supernatant out into a tube marked C, and added 20mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and stirred. We removed 200μl of this pellet and used the Sample of B pellet for part 2 of this experiment. 
After obtaining our sample of B pellet, we took and labeled 7 large test tubes, and turned on the spectrophotometer to read at 600nm. We prepared one blank with 8mL of water and 2mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), 3 tubes with 6mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 1mL of soap, and 3 tubes with 6mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and no soap. We then added 100μl of the chloroplast suspension from part 1 to all the tubes and transferred the mixtures to the spectrophotometer cuvettes under a lamp. We immediately blanked the spectrophotometer and took a 0-minute absorbance. We then placed the cuvettes back under the light and continues to take absorbances every 10 minutes until 30 minutes had passed. We then recorded our results and created a two-sample t-test.

	In this experiment, it was observed that there was a much larger percent change in the chloroplast without soap than the chloroplast with soap. At 0-minute, the absorbance of both chloroplast with soap and chloroplast without soap was around the same, with an average at .319nm with soap, an absorbance of .339 without soap. However, as figure 1 shows, the average percent change of no soap was much larger than the average percent change with soap after 30 minutes, with an average of 87.2883119% with soap, and 7.15672818% without soap. By observation, the samples of chloroplast with soap became colorless, while the sample of chloroplast without soap remained blue. Our p value after conducting a two-sample t test between the absorbance between 0 minutes and 30 minutes was 2.34e-6, which is below .05. 


Discussion:
In this lab, it can be concluded that the large increase in absorbance with the chloroplast with soap is due to the detergent in the soap affecting the electron flow in the Hill reaction. Therefore, our hypothesis is supported by our results. Before any time has passed, both samples had a similar absorbance, of .319nm and .339nm, however as time passed, there was a much larger percent increase in absorbance in the no soap sample than in the soap sample. This is because the soap disrupted the Hill Reaction, therefore the DCIP did not change color. If there is a high activity of DCIP reduction, then the PS2 is active which allows photosynthesis to happen. Oxidized DCIP is dark blue, and when DCIP is reduced, it turns colorless. Therefore, if there is electron activity in PS2 we should expect to see a large decrease in absorbance, meaning a high percent change in absorbance from 0 minutes to 30 minutes. If oxidized DCIP is not reduced, this means PS2 is not active and photosynthesis is disrupted. Therefore, we should not expect a high change in absorbance since DCIP remains oxidized, remaining dark blue. This explains why we saw a small percent change in the chloroplast with soap and a high percent change in chloroplast without soap. 
	Interactions with detergent “could either remove some essential component of the electron transfer sequence or by the mere process of adding to the chloroplast could cover up sites at which the various electron transfer agents interact,” [Vernon: 1965]. Therefore, the addition of hand soap, which contains detergents, is expected to decrease the electron activity, which is what we observed. In another experiment, “the plant treated with water content detergents showed high inhibitory effect on chlorophyll content in sunflower leaves,” [Jovanic: 2010]. This experiment believed on top of removing essential components of electron transfer, detergents, “caused decline in bonding Chl b and Chl a,” [Jovanic: 2010]. Therefore, detergents are expected to have drastic negative effects on the electron activity in photosynthesis. 
	All in all, the data turned out to be statistically significant, leaving us with a p value lower than .05. Therefore, we can conclude with evidence that the addition of soap lowered activity of the Hill reaction. This can be observed by the small percent change in absorbance due to DCIP not changing color. For further research, I would like to test the impact of liquid hand soap on another plant or leaf, in order to see if the detergent effects other plants.
