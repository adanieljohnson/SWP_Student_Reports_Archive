Title: Effect of Nitrogen Availability on the Root Length of Radishes

Abstract:
This experiment was designed to determine the effect of different nitrogen availabilities on the root length of radish plants. It was hypothesized that the radishes exposed to greater levels of nitrogen would display smaller root lengths that those without. The data collected demonstrated that the radish samples given supplementary nitrogen did in fact have statistically significant shorter root lengths than the control samples. The results of the experiment imply how varying nitrogen levels affect the resource allocation of radishes in the form of root length, altering the size of the plant’s absorptive agent based on the need to collect essential elements for growth. The analyses of phenotypic plasticity on root length have greater implications in protecting soil health and the greater ecosystem. 

Introduction:
Plants have the capability to allocate their resources differently for the optimal fitness to adjust to the varying conditions in their environment. This is called phenotypic plasticity, the property than enables a plant to adjust their allocation strategy to best adapt to the biotic and abiotic factors in their environment [Phillip: 2006]. Unlike animals, plants cannot migrate to areas with greater resource availability so they must adapt their root system architecture based on the soil conditions its concentration of key elements in order to keep themselves alive [Shahzad:2017]. Nitrogen is the most fundamental element in plant growth and development, and therefore can cause plants to modulate their root growth and architecture to improve their resource uptake capabilities [Kiba: 2016]. Raphanus raphanistrum sativus, commonly known as radishes, is the model organism that we chose to test our hypothesis on, due to its quick growth rate and accessibility. In this experiment, we study the root length of the radishes as the main absorptive agent of the plant so as to determine how the plant changes its phenotype with fluctuating availability of nitrogen [Narcy: 2013]. The hypothesis of the experiment is that the radishes exposed to lower levels of nitrogen will have longer roots attributed to their greater need to collect the vital nutrient for growth.


Materials and Methods:
Radish seeds were first soaked and then 60 were extracted for the use of the experiment. Six planters filled with soil and a supplement of Miraclegro were given 10 seeds each. For the two weeks following, each sample was administered 200 milliliters of water, and the three selected for supplemental nitrogen were given an additional 20 milliliters of nitrate solution every day. The samples were kept in identical conditions including temperature and exposure to light, and were fed daily at the same time. From the planters, three samples were collected from each, with the exception of those who failed to produce that quantity. For the planters that did not produce three viable samples, the maximum number was extracted and 0mm lengths were assigned to the missing plants. Each plant was then measured for their respective root length. The data was then subsequently compared with a two-tailed two-sample t-test to calculate if there was a statistically significant difference between the samples collected from the nitrogen supplied group and the control group. 


Results:
The experimental group given the nitrate solution demonstrated shorter root lengths than the control group. As seen in Figure 1, the nitrogen exposed group had an average root length of 58.44 mm, while the control group presented an average root length of 99.22 mm. The two tailed two-sample t-test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the root lengths of the two groups (tstat=2.735, df=8, p=0.026). The experimental group did log two zeros for the root lengths of the missing samples, but even without those values, the mean of the experimental group is 75.14 mm and the difference remains significant (tstat=2.751, df=14, p=0.0156).


Discussion:
The results of this experiment supported our hypothesis that stated that an increased supply of nitrogen would lead to smaller root lengths in the radish plants. Previous studies demonstrated similar consequences from the supplementation of nitrogen on the resource allocation of radishes [Leghari: 2016].  The reasoning for this finding can be attributed to the higher root length and branching density for plants that are in environments with less available nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, so that there is a greater surface area for the absorptive roots to collect essential elements for growth. [Postma: 2014]. Our findings were also complemented by other studies that show that the direct removal of nitrogen from the soil will prompt greater growth for root length [Coleman: 1989]. The findings of our experiment are significant due to the effects of root length and branching patterns on soil health which is essential in protecting ecosystems [Paez-Garcia: 2015]. Evidence in support of our hypothesis can guide those cultivating plants in soil plots to be mindful on how element availability can affect the greater ecosystem. Although our data supported the hypothesis, even without the zeros automatically entered to account for a failure to produce enough viable samples, the experiment would be improved if it was conducted a second time in which there are an ample selection of samples to be measured. This alternative experiment should use a larger number of radish seeds to ensure that at least 9 samples in both the experimental and control groups can be harvested. This experiment alone provides evidence that supports our hypothesis that greater nitrogen availability will induce phenotypic plasticity to make the plant’s roots shorter. Studying resource availability and its effect on phenotypic plasticity remains important given its broader implications on the maintaining of ecosystems via soil health.
