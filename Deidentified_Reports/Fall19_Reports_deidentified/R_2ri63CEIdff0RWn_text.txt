Title: Effect of IGR on the development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Many farmers can have their crop yield damaged by multiple factors but one of these is insects. One way the negative impact of insects can be minimized is through the use of insecticides, but insecticides can be harmful to human populations and thus compromising the integrity of the crop. One way to impact harmful insects and not humans is through the use of insect growth regulator (IGR). IGR has been shown to disrupt the molting ability of Manduca Sexta larvae and therefore preventing the further development of the larvae to pupate [Tunaz: 2004]. In this experiment we used Manduca Sexta caterpillars treated with IGR to determine the effect on the caterpillars development. The expectation is that the caterpillars treated with IGR will have slower growth and develop slower than the caterpillars who were not treated with IGR. Our data did not show a difference between the development of caterpillars treated with IGR and those not treated with the IGR. This suggests that IGR may not be the best inhibitor to prevent insects from damaging crop yields.


Introduction:
	Hormones serve as an important regulator and signaler in the body for an organism's growth. The abundance of hormones and certain concentrations of hormones in relation to one another can signal the body to proceed with important growth phases (such as puberty). The growth cycle of our subjects Manduca Sexta is regulated by both ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Both of these hormones work together to signal when the caterpillar of Manduca Sexta when to transition into its next instar and signal when to pupate into an adult moth [Tunaz: 2004]. These specific concentrations change during an organism’s life cycle and disrupting these hormones could affect Manduca Sexta survival rate since its ability to transition to its next instar and pupate is inhibited. Insect growth regulator (IGR) has been observed to adversely affect insect development and survival by disrupting both 20E and JH, inhibiting the insect’s ability to develop properly. IGR could also have a similar effect on Manduca Sexta development by disrupting both 20E and JH preventing the larvae’s ability to molt properly. Physically since the caterpillars will be unable to regulate their growth, the weight of the caterpillars will be a key indicator to IGR’s affect on Manduca Sexta. 

Materials and Method:
Four Manduca Sexta caterpillars were selected for the controll group along with four experimental caterpillars. Each caterpillar received ten grams of water daily however the controll group had their food mixed with eight drops of di water, while the experimental group had their food mixed with 8 drops of insect growth regulator (IGR). The caterpillars were then fed daily and given water or IGR mixed with the fresh food respectively. The caterpillars were also weighed every five days for fifteen days along with observations on their growth were noted. 


Results:
The final mean weight for the controll group 11.3 grams with a standard deviation of  while the experimental group had a mean weight of 12.4 grams with a standard deviation of . A one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to analyze the results which gave a p_value of 0.381 indicating our results were not statistically significent. Observations during the experiment showed some gray texture on caterpillar 3 in the experimental group on day 5 of analysis. The experimental group also had a more pale blue coloring compared to the darker blue of the controll group. There was also more variation in weights of the caterpillars as the days progressed as shown by Fig. 1.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the Manduca Sexta caterpillars will be affected by IGR was not supported by the experiment. The data showed a p_value above .05 demonstrating that IGR does not have an impact on the caterpillar’s weight or development. This is surprising considering prior evidence which showed that IGR formula prevents the ability of M. Sexta to molt [Tunaz: 2004]. A possible explanation for the difference in results could be due to the small sample size used (n=4) in each group. The genetic variation between each caterpillar for a variable such as weight is a factor to consider especially with a smaller sample size. However, a much larger impact would be expected on the growth of the experimental group since the hormonal signals for growth are most likely less variable than the genetic variation for size and weight. Since the experiment tested the fundamental regulation of M. Sexta, it is possible that more effective IGRs must be developed to prevent the use of insecticides on crops.
