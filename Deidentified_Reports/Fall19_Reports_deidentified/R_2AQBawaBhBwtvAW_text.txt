Title: The Effect of Nitrogen on Resource Allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum.

Abstract:
This experiment tests the effect of nitrogen on the growth of the anatomical features of Fagopyrum esculentum, or buckwheat, in relation to each other, using the root-to-shoot length and weight ratios, as an indicator of resource allocation. The experiment was performed over 14 days on 5 treatment plants, to which water and 200Ml of nitrate solution was added daily, and on 5 controll plants, to which only water was added daily. A two-sample t test was performed, using the one-tailed p_value to reveal that the difference between both the average root-to-shoot weight and length ratios were not statistically significent between the controll and treatment groups. While the data could not reject the null hypothesis, the results of this experiment suggest new directions for further experimentation that include testing other elements of the environment compounded with changes in nitrogen levels.

Introduction:
Plants allocate energy and resources to developing certain anatomical features based on their environment [Chapin: 1987]. In environments that are limited in a certain resource, plants will allocate more nutrients and energy to developing the anatomical feature responsible for collecting that limited environmental resource. It follows, then, that plants allocate less energy to the anatomical component responsible for collecting a certain resource in environments where that resource is abundant. 
This experiment will test this assumption on Fagopyrum esculentum, or as it more commonly known, Buckwheat. As a high protein food source, Buckwheat is an important crop in the scope of global food production [Sure: 1955]. Knowing how to manipulate the development of different anatomical features, then, could make a contribution to the international challenge of feeding the world. One way to measure the effect of an environmental resource on resource allocation within an organism is to comparatively assess the development of roots and shoots when the environment is changed. In this experiment, the dependent variables of root-to-shoot weight ratio and root-to-shoot length ratio were measured to assess the effect of the independent variable, the addition of nitrogen into the soil of the treatment buckwheat plants. It was hypothesized that the root-to-shoot weight ratio and root-to-shoot length ratio would both be lesser in the treatment plants, to which nitrogen was added, than in the controll plants, to which no additional nitrogen was added. This prediction was made based on the idea that in nitrogen rich environments, F esculentum would allocate less resources to the anatomical feature responsible for the uptake of nitrogen, the roots. 


Materials and Method:
5 Fagopyrum esculentum seeds were planted into each of 10 pots, about 2 inches under the soil. The pots were randoMly divided into a controll group and a treatment group, each with 5 pots. All pots were watered daily, and 200Ml of N2 solution was added to each treatment pot daily. On the 14th day, all of the plants of the controll group were removed from the pots and five were randoMly selected for measurement. The mass and length of the root and shoot for each of the 5 replicates were measured and recorded. Then, the root-to-shoot length ratio and the root-to-shoot weight ratio was performed for each replicate. The same procedure was repeated for the treatment group. At the end of data collection, a two-sample t test was performed on the root-to-shoot weight ratios of the controll and treatment groups and another was performed on the root-to-shoot length ratio of the controll and treatment groups.

Results:
The mean root-to-shoot weight ratio was 0.46 in the controll group with a standard deviation of 0.32, and 0.25 in the experimental group with a standard deviation of 0.16. The mean root-to-shoot length ratio, however, was 1.28 in the controll group with a standard deviation of 0.56, and 1.48 in the experimental group with a standard deviation of 0.57 (Figure 1). The two-sample t_test revealed that the mean root-to-shoot weight ratio of the controll group was not statistically significently different from that of the experimental group (t_stat=1.287282, d.f.=8, one-tailed p_value=0.116994). Nor was the mean root-to-shoot length ratio of the controll group statistically significently different from that of the experimental group (t_stat=0.999549, d.f.=8, one-tailed p-Value=0.173399).

Discussion:
It can be noted that the mean root-to shoot weight ratio was higher in the controll group than in the treatment group, while the mean root-to-shoot length ratio was higher in the treatment group than in the controll.  Also, of note is that ratio was less than 1 in both groups for weight and greater than 1 in both groups for length. This result means that though on average the shoots weighed more than the roots, the roots were on average longer than the shoots for both groups. Due to the statistical insignificance of the difference between the means of the controll and treatment groups for both the root-to-shoot weight and length ratios (Figure 1), however, the null hypothesis could not be rejected. Thus, the results for this experiment provided no support for the alternate hypothesis that the root-to-shoot weight and length ratios would be larger in Fagopyrum esculentum grown in Nitrogen supplemented soil than in the supplemented soil. While one interpretation of the data lends itself to the conclusion that F escuententum do not allocate resources differently when exposed to an abundance of nitrogen, several findings from the literature might suggest otherwise. 
	The reasoning behind the prediction that the root-to-shoot ratios—in terms of both weight and length—would be lesser in plants grown in more nitrogen environments rested upon the observation that plants allocate their resources to anatomical features based on what is appropriate to the environment. It was assumed that in a nitrogen-rich environment, plants would allocate less resources to roots, since without nitrogen constraint, less energy and resources would be required to obtain the readily available nutrient. This prediction is challenged not only by the results of this study, but also that of an experiment performed on winter wheat, in which nitrogen promoted root growth in drought [Barraclough: 1989]. Not only does this finding of more resources allocated to roots challenge the hypothesis of this study, but it also highlights the role of nitrogen both as a factor that potentially affects allocation, but also the means by which allocation can occur. That is, nitrogen is one of the nutrients or inputs that the plant uses to construct the anatomical features, which it mediates between. In the presence of other environmental constraints. It is possible, then, that some confounding variables in the environment in which the plants were grown could have negated the effect of supplemental nitrogen, or otherwise resulted in data from the treatment group that was statistically indistinguishable from the controll when its effects were compounded with the addition of nitrogen. 
	Another important finding of the literature is that, somewhat intuitively, different amounts of nitrogen can have different effects, and that high levels can lead to inhibition of growth by preventing the absorption of other nutrients, as was observed in several vegetables in an experiment [Wang:2004]. This result is relevant to the root-to-shoot growth observed in this experiment, because it implies that it is possible that the level of nitrogen used in this experiment could have prohibited normal growth. It also provides a reasonable basis on which to critique the procedure used in this experiment, particularly during the step of pouring the nitrate solution in the pots of the treatment group each day. It is possible that the technique used resulted in nitrogen heterogeneity within each pot, causing plants in different parts of the same pot to be in essentially different nitrogen environments, perhaps causing large variation in resource allocation within the treatment group. The procedure could be improved by using a spray bottle to spray the nitrogen solution uniforMly throughout the soil and growing each seed in a different pot to avoid a nutrient heterogeneous environment and prevent root entanglement and intraspecific competition between plants that share pots. Performing the experiment using several treatment groups exposed to varying levels of nitrate might also elucidate what kind of effect the nitrogen is having on resource allocation.
	While the results of the experiment did not provide evidence of a change in resource allocation in buckwheat plants that would allow for their manipulation in order to yield organisms with relatively more edible material, it implies that there are perhaps more variables at stake. The lack of statistically significent data suggests the investigation of several other avenues, including the effect of nitrogen level on allocation.
