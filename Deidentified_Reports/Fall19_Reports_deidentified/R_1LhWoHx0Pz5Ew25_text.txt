Title: Root propagation in nitrogen-enriched radish plants

Abstract:
The needs of plants are very specific, similar to those of humans. Amongst them is the requirement for micronutrients such as nitrogen. Nitrogen is largely responsible for plant growth and root propagation, the focus of the present study. We aim to investigate how the lengths of the roots of Radish plants differ between controll and nitrogen-enriched environments. In the nitrogen-enriched environment we found that plants had shorter root lengths than those in the controll group, showing that with a nutrient-rich environment plants do not need to propagate roots as far to absorb the same levels of essential nitrogen as do plants in a normally-potted controll group. 

Introduction:
Plants are complex organisms that need a combination of many nutrients to survive. Some generally known nutrients include water, sunlight, and CO2, however, there are also many lesser-known micronutrients that are just as important to plant health. One of these macronutrients, typically found abundantly in soil, is nitrogen. Nitrogen is essential to plant growth and proliferation mainly for its role in amino acid, carbohydrate, and DNA synthesis. DNA, like in all living organisms, is the genetic code from which everything the plant makes is based. Without nitrogen taken up through roots, plants would not have enough to properly make DNA. In addition, amino acids use large amounts of nitrogen in their protein structures, as do carbohydrates. Amino acids and carbohydrates are the main building blocks of the plant and a deficiency of nitrogen can cause structural instability, among other abnormalities. 	
	In order to absorb and use nitrogen, it needs to “fixed” by symbiotic bacteria in the soil. Once fixed into useful forms (nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+)), the plant roots can absorb and store it for use in various cellular processes. It has been shown that in a nitrogen-enriched environments plant growth is increased compared to either a controll or nitrogen-depleted environment [Mackie-Dawson: 1995]. While it is clear that whole-plant growth increases with increased nitrogen levels, the propagation of roots in different levels of nitrogen richness is not completely clear. Plants must balance between growing roots to be able to absorb more nutrients in a sub-optimal environment and conserving the energy it takes to grow longer roots when there are plenty of nutrients around. So, in our present study, we are using the Radish (R. sativus) as a model organism to study specifically how the root of the plant propagates in response to a nitrogen-enriched environment. Our hypothesis is that if plants are grown in a nitrogen-rich environment, compared to a normally potted controll, then the plants with higher levels of nitrogen in the soil will have shorter roots as there is not a need to propagate roots further in nutrient-rich soil. 


Materials and Method:
A total of six Radish plots were planted for this experiment. Three were designated as the treatment group (nitrogen-enriched) and the other three were designated as controlls. Each plot was filled with vermiculite and approximately fifteen radish seeds were planted evenly throughout each plot. The plants were then watered, and a small amount of fertilizer was added to assist with the initial sprouting period. All six plots were placed together in a tray and the tray was brought to a greenhouse in the building. Starting the day after planting, Day 1, the plants were all watered and treated once daily for two weeks. Each of the three controll plants was watered with approx. 200Ml of water while each of the three treatment plots received both 200Ml of water and approximately 20Ml of a pre-made nitrate solution. After two weeks all the sprouted plants were carefully removed from their soil. Each plant root was measured from the junction between the roots and the stalks to the end of the longest root. This “root length” was the main data point used for analysis. Once data was recorded, a two-sample t_test was run to asses statistically significent differences between the groups. 

Results:
The average root length across the entire controll group, who only received daily watering, was 
99.22mm with a standard deviation of 19.9mm. The average across the treatment group was 58.44mm with a standard deviation of 35.02mm. When run through a two-sample t_test the data was shown to be statistically significent at a 95% confidence level with a p_value of 0.0079. Due to the nature of the experiment we were only able to collect data from the plants that sprouted. The maximum number of plants we collected to be measured from each individual plot was three. However, some plots contained more than three sprouts and some none at all. Based on the raw data it appeared that for most of the individual measurements made the controll group had longer roots. 


Discussion:
Overall the experiment yielded results that supported our hypothesis that plants enriched with nitrogen would have shorter roots compared to a controll group given no excess nitrogen. We found that the average root length in the treatment group was statistically shorter than the roots found in the controll group. This aligns with the idea that plants propagate their roots to absorb nutrients over a larger area. These nutrients include micronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the two main ingredients in fertilizer. In this experiment we were able to show that, controllling for all other variables, nitrogen affected root length. This also aligns with other findings in published literature on the subject. Researchers found that in two different potato cultivars, increasing levels of nitrogen in the soil accounted for greater shoot than root growth [Sattelmacher: 2008]. Similar results were found in wheat cultivars [Karrou: 2008]. While we didn’t study root to shoot ratios in the present study it would be an interesting direction for further investigation.   
	Given the small sample size of the study, there are some limitations to be addressed. First, our statistical tests included some zero values for root length in certain individual plots. This was due to some of the nitrogen plots not sprouting any plants at all. If you run the two-sample t_test again, without those zeros, you will find that the difference between the controll and treatment groups is not significent. This non-sprouting in some treatment plots could have been due to many things. Likely, it was due to a toxic amount of nitrogen in the soil. This leads into the other possibility for the general experiments results being that the root length is longer in the controll group not because of the need to find nitrogen over a larger area but because there could have been a toxically high amount of nitrogen added to the treatment groups, stunting their growth. Overall, our data is preliminary and further study is warranted to address sample size concerns as well as factors beyond root length, such as root to shoot ratio, to fully understand the effects of soil nitrogen on plants. In addition, future studies of larger sample sizes could address adding varying levels of nitrogen instead of a single volume. This is an important consideration that agriculture specialists and farmers need to account for when determining the best growing conditions for crops and how to maximize yield.
