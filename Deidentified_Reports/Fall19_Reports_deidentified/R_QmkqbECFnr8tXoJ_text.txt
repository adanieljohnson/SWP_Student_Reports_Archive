Title: The Relationship Between Conspecific Pigment and Water Pigment Modifiies Aggressive Response in male Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Betta Splendins, an aquatic species native to Thailand, compete with one another for attention of females through displays of aggression. Bettas display bright red or blue scales to assert dominance over male conspecifics. It is not yet known how the visual signal's contrast with aquatic environment modifies aggression in Bettas. This study examined the affects of colored food dye (red and blue pigment) on the perception of visual cues in male Bettas. The time spend in aggressive response was measured for two types of characteristic displays. The presence of color dye equal to counterpart color, and therefore reduced visibility, led to a diminished response for the 'red mane' display.  No difference was found for broadside movement. This study suggest that the ability to perceive visual color cues may influence the onset of specific aggressive behaviors.



Introduction:
Betta Splendins, a species of fish native to Thailand, evolved in aquatic environments with high opacity, like murky ponds. When threatened, male Bettas perform energy-intensive displays of aggression. This occurs most frequently among members of their own species and appears to benefit mating success [Miley and Burak: 1977].  Aggressive display ranges in intensity from mild behaviors, such as pelvic flickering and other broadside movements, to bold responses, like the “red mane” display. This characteristic behavior occurs when Bettas erect a ‘red mane’ by extending their brightly colored branchiostegal membranes [Johnson: 2017]. 

 Colorful visual cues, as well as characteristic movements, modify aggressive behavior in Bettas [Thompson and Sturm: 1956]. Aggressive display can be evoked even from a mirror image, implying a strong role of the visual system [Clayton and Hinder: 1968]. At the surface of the water, this behavior does not occur [Johnson: 2017]. 

Wild Bettas, green or brown in color, transform to a vivid red or blue when provoked by a conspecific male [Johnson: 2018]. In their natural environment, blending in visually appears to benefit survival, most likely through predator-evasion. In the face of an intraspecific threat, this does not hold true. The pressure of sexual selection appears to favor male Bettas displaying bold colors that contrast their environment [Doutrelant: 2001].

The ability to perceive visual color of another male Betta may influence the onset of aggressive behavior. It is not yet known if the quality of the visual signal, as distinct from the aquatic environmental, is important for the aggressive behavior. To examine the relationship between visual-color stimuli and the water conditions, we will observe aggressive response in artificially-dyed water tanks in two male Bettas with different pigments.

 If male Betta splendins are exposed to treatment in red-colored water and blue-colored, we expect that they will show higher rates of intraspecific aggressive behavior (as measured by broadside movements and red mane display) when the color of their conspecific male contrasts the water pigment. Aggressive response is likely be lower when the visibility of their counterpart is reduced. 



Materials and Method:
Male Betta splendins of an artificially-bred species were maintained in isolated compartments in tanks prior to the start of the experiment. One Betta with red pigment and one Betta with blue pigment were used in this study. The two Betta fish were placed in adjacent compartments, separated by a white slate, in a fish tank with clear water. 

The visual barrier was removed and baseline aggressive response was recorded during a three-minute trial. A slate of transparent glass divided the fish during experimental trials to avoid physical conflict. Aggressive response was measured as the time spent in broadside movement and red mane display for each fish. The time in each display was recorded by four separate observers, each tracking response in one subject.  After each trial, there was a minimum of 5 minutes’ rest. 

Baseline aggressive response for each fish was determined by taking the average of two trials in clear water. We used standard food dye to create a blue-colored tank and a red-colored tank.  Five drops of colored food dye were used to dilute the tanks. The red and blue Bettas were tested counter-opposed visually for six trials: three trials in red water and three trials in blue water. 

For each fish, the time in broadside movement and red mane display was subtracted from baseline time to controll for individual differences in behavior. The outcomes were dividde into two categories according to the similarity of environment and conspecific Betta color: 
Condition A) Water pigment aligns with subject pigment + contrasts counterpart pigment (i.e. red Betta in red water, or blue Betta in blue water) and 
Condition B) Water pigment contrasts subject pigment; aligns with counterpart pigment. 
 
A paired T-test was used to compare the mean time spent in broadside movement for Bettas under Condition A (conspecific color is distinct) or Condition B (conspecific blends in). This was repeated for the red-mane display. 


Results:
Two subjects were tested and six samples were taken under two different ecological contexts. The difference between broadside movement in the two environmental conditions was analyzed using a paired T-test. No difference was detected (p=0.14) (Table 1). The average time in broadside was 69 seconds when the counterpart was visually distinct from the water pigment and 37 seconds when the counterpart was indiscriminate from the water pigment (Table 1). 
The average red mane time was higher when the counterpart color contrasted the water pigment (119 s) compared to the average time when counterpart color aligned with water pigment (15 s) (p =0.005). This difference was statistically significent (Table 2). 
Each trial period was 240 seconds.


Discussion:
The red mane response was significently lower when opponent was not visually discriminate from the environment. This supports our hypothesis. It suggests that the red mane display may emerge as a response to threatening visual cues, characterized by pigment. However, no difference was found between the mean time in broadside movements under each condition. The time in broadside was slightly higher when conspecifics were distinct from their aquatic environment, as we hypothesized, but the outcome was not statistically significent. The relationship between counterpart pigment and water pigment significently affects the duration of red mane display but not broadside movement. However, more samples are needed to form a conclusion. 

This study was limited by the lack of adequate habituation time and the organization of trials. Five minutes was allowed between the three-minute trial periods. Furthermore, in some cases on subject received longer rest (10-15 minutes). These differences in rest time were not recorded and may have confounded aggressive response. The recommended rest period to avoid habituation is 15 minutes. [Clayton and Hinde: 1968]. 

From this study, it appears that the color pigment and water may modify the time in red mane display in Bettas by altering perception of visual cues. The aggressive response in Bettas appears to have evolves as a form of sexual selection. Previous studies show that the color pigmentation affects aggression and mating success [Magnhagen: 1991]. Pigmentation serves as a signal of mate quality in a variety fish and birds. Evans et al. found that pigment intensity can reflect mate health status, diet, and social status. The dispersion of light through water may be involved in threat signal perception as well. 

Studying the relationship between behavioral variation and environmental conditions provide insights valuable for conservation management and policy. This work may enable better predictions on the effects of changing aquatic ecosystems and species displacement.
