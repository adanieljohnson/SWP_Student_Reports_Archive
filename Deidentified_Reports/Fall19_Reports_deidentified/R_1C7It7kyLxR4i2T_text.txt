Title: The Effect of Temperature on Plant Resource Allocation in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Plant interactions, both intra- and inter-specific, largely center around obtaining essential resources such as sunlight, water, and nitrogen. Environmental limitations of these resources lead species to make trade-offs with regard to resource allocation, which can be measured via root:shoot ratio. It was hypothesized that an elevated temperature would cause less resource allocation to the shoot of the plants, resulting in lower biomass and length, procuring a higher root:shoot ratio. The weight and length of Vigna radiate, or mung bean plants, grown over two weeks were determined for a control and experimental group, and the root:shoot ratio calculated for each. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the root:shoot ratio for either weight or length between the control and experimental groups. Previous studies have explored mung bean’s ability to withstand high temperatures, and further explored the synergistic effects of drought in conjunction with elevated temperatures. Implications of this experiment and future studies will be increasingly important with the elevated temperature associated with global climate change and its impact on food resources. 

Introduction:
In all ecological communities, plants and animals interact with the biotic and abiotic factors in their environment. Both intra- and inter-specific plant interactions focus largely around obtaining essential resources such as sunlight, water, and nitrogen. Limits of these resources affect what species are present in a community. Selective pressures lead species to make certain trade-offs when it comes to resource allocation. A species may put more energy into growing a certain structure, and thus reduce energy allocation and mass elsewhere [Johnson: 2019]. The resource allocation of species is determined genetically but is not totally fixed; there is room for variation in response to disparities in environments. Resource allocation can be measured in several ways. One common method is the root:shoot ratio, where the biomass or length of the roots is divided by that of the shoot. In environments where it behooves a plant to have longer roots, perhaps in a drier condition where they are necessary to obtain limited water or nutrients, the root: shoot ratio would be larger, as the length/biomass of the roots would presumably be larger if more energy is appropriated to grow them to access sparse resources. If the environment was such that the plant would benefit from having larger leaves/stems, such as in a shady environment where more energy is needed to be allocated to grow the surface areas of leaves to obtain sufficient sun, the root:shoot ratio would be smaller. This is because the length/biomass of the shoots would presumably be larger with more energy allocated to them. [Johnson:2019]
The effects of various environmental conditions on energy allocation can be observed in Vigna radiata, or mung bean. Mung bean is used as an ingredient in various dishes across Asia and the Middle East. In the latter, the plant is a staple along with rice for many individuals, and thus plays an important role as a food resource for many people. This experiment specifically focused on the root:shoot ratio of mung bean plants, the dependent variable, in normal greenhouse temperatures compared to that of plants in elevated temperature conditions, the independent variable (temperature). High temperature is a significant abiotic stressor that becomes the limiting factor for normal plant growth and productivity [Hayat: 2010]. Higher temperatures can result in lower leaf size and weight due to general impairment of photosynthetic activity via stomata. Stomata function in photosynthesis by controlling the intake of carbon dioxide and release of oxygen through the expansion and contraction of guard cells. The size or frequency, and accompanying leaf size or quantity, may be decreased in an attempt to prevent water loss in higher temperature conditions. As a result, it was hypothesized that an elevated temperature would cause less resource allocation to the shoot of the plants, resulting in a higher root:shoot ratio; there would be lower shoot biomass in order to prevent water loss from stomata due to the increased temperature. 

Materials and Methods:
Approximately six mung bean plants were planted in each of three bins of soil in air-temperature conditions of approximately 29°C as the control group. Six mung bean plants were planted in each of three bins of soil on a heated pad which elevated air-temperature conditions of approximately 38°C. Both groups of plants were kept in a greenhouse and watered via watering-can daily for fourteen days. The plants were carefully harvested and washed/dried at the end of this period. While all eighteen plants in the control group survived and had their data measured, eight plants of the experimental group died, leaving ten with the ability to provide data. The individual plants were weighed and their data recorded. The mung bean plants were cut at the root-shoot junction, and the shoots were weighed. The root mass was found by subtracting the shoot mass from the total mass. The lengths of the roots and shoots were measured for each plant. The root:shoot ratios for both weight and length were found by dividing the root value by the shoot value. The mean value and standard deviation were determined for all components measured. A one-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine if the results were statistically significant.

Results:
The data shows that the average of the experimental group root:shoot weight ratio was not significantly higher than that of the control group (p = 0.26) (Figure 1). The data also shows that the average of the experimental group of root:shoot length ratio was not significantly higher than that of the control group (p = 0.20) (Figure 2). The control group saw more plants (n=18) than the experimental group (n=10) germinate, but this did not significantly impact the range of standard deviations. There were no discernible general trends in the data.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment indicate that the hypothesis should be rejected. When grown under elevated temperature conditions, the biomass of the shoots was not affected enough to significantly increase the root:shoot ratio in neither weight nor length when compared to the control. The mung bean were thus not allocating significantly more energy to the shoot structures than the roots. Upon review of other studies, it was determined that mung bean plants can survive regimens of high temperature and constant root temperatures up to 42°C with no effect. Temperature records of Pakistani soil, where mung bean grow, shows that the top 10 cm of the soil is frequently exposed to temperatures above 38°C and up to 48°C [Hafeez: 1991]. The growing conditions of the elevated temperature plant were in this range. The plants’ habituation to warm temperatures may explain why no significant change in energy allocation was measured. Further literature also explores the synergistic effect of increased temperature and drought on plant growth; the combined effect is stronger than the effects of each alone [Lipiec: 2013]. An additional logical experiment could thus be to explore the impacts of drought combined with higher temperatures, perhaps those expected to be seen in the future with global climate change, on mung bean or other plant species. This experiment and aforementioned future studies are particularly important because mung bean are a staple crop of a large population in the Middle East and Asia. Increasing global temperatures will have an impact on available food resources for these individuals, and agricultural trade-offs may have to be made, just as plants have to make trade-offs for their own resources.
