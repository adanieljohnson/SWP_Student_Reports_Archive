Title: The Influence of Herbicide on the Photosynthetic Activity of Spinach and Weeds

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted in order to measure the influence of herbicide on the photosynthetic activity of spinach and weed plants. This activity was recorded using DCIP, a redox dye that changes color as it takes in electrons. The hypothesis was that an herbicide is more effective in inhibiting photosystem II activities of weeds than those of spinach. Photosystem II is the second photosystem in the photosynthetic light reactions. It’s a membrane protein complex that uses light energy to produce ATP and NADPH. In order to separate the chloroplasts from the other plant components in both spinach and weeds, centrifugation was used after grinding the leaves. The chloroplasts of both plants were separated into two categories; with and without herbicide. When comparing the chloroplast samples containing herbicide in both plants, the statistical test was insignificant (p-value=0.10649). Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected which had multiple justifications due to the fact that it was a humanly driven experiment. The most probable error was that some of the test tubes were mixed up throughout the measuring of absorbances over the 30-minute period. 

Introduction:
Most organisms depend on photosynthesis to fix carbon in a usable form, whether it’s dependently or independently. During photosynthesis, organisms capture and store energy from the sun, which is subsequently released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm, and respiration, which occurs in mitochondria of both plants and animals. Together, photosynthesis, glycolysis, and cellular respiration are three of the most important metabolic processes carried out by living things. Photosynthesis and respiration involve multiple oxidation-reduction reactions, in which electrons are transferred through an electron transport chain from one molecular complex to another. These complexes use energy from the moving electrons to pump protons in the form of H+ ions across a lipid bilayer and generate a proton gradient. The proton gradient is then used to drive a large molecular complex which synthesizes ATP. Both systems transfer high energy electrons onto carrier molecules such as NAD+/NADH or NADP+/NADPH, that allow the electrons to be used for other chemical reactions. (Johnson:2013) In this experiment, 
2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) is used as the electron acceptor for the Hill reaction, in which DCIP decolorization and its take-up of electrons help determine whether the herbicide inhibits the redox reactions in photosystem II. More specifically, the color loss is used to measure DCIP reduction to DCIPH2, which represents the redox reactions in photosystem II. Environmental changes that affect photosynthesis rates are going to influence primary productivity, which is the amount of energy converted into usable forms of photosynthetic organisms in an ecosystem, and ultimately the ecosystems that depend on it. In this experiment, the effect of herbicide on the photosynthetic processes of weeds are compared to those of spinach. The two primary sites of herbicide action in photosynthetic electron transport are the inhibition of photosystem II (PS II) electron transport and diversion of electron flow through photosystem I (PS I). PS II electron transport inhibitors bind to the D1 protein of the PS II reaction center, thus blocking electron transfer to plastoquinone. Inhibition of PS II electron transport prevents the conversion of absorbed light energy into electrochemical energy. (Fuerst: 1991) The hypothesis of this experiment is that an herbicide is more effective in inhibiting photosystem II activities of weeds than those of spinach, when applied to both spinach and weeds. Photosystem II is the second photosystem in the photosynthetic light reactions. It is a membrane protein complex that uses light energy to produce the high energy carriers ATP and NADPH.

Materials and Methods:
In order to separate the chloroplasts from the other plant components in both spinach and weeds, centrifugation was used after grinding the plant leaves. The chloroplasts were than concentrated and enriched with water and DCIP in 12 tubes, 6 for spinach and 6 for the weeds. DCIP is a redox dye used to record the amount of product of the reaction. Lastly, herbicide was added in 6 of those tubes, 3 for spinach and 3 for the weeds. This means there were three tubes containing chloroplasts and 3 tubes containing chloroplasts and herbicide for each plant. Consequently, each kind had three trials when the absorbance was measured at 600nm with a spectrophotometer. The fluids’ absorbances were measured every ten minutes for 30 minutes, while being fully exposed to light. A two-sample t-test was used as the statistical test when comparing the effect of the herbicide on the absorbances of spinach leaves and weeds. 

Results:
When comparing the chloroplast samples containing herbicide in both plants, the statistical test reported a p-value of 0.10649, a t-value of 1.897831 and degrees of freedom of 6. The absorbances of the spinach leaves were lower with the herbicide than without the herbicide with a p-value of 0.000334. The absorbance decreased over time in the spinach leaves with herbicide and stayed the same in the samples without herbicide. When comparing both spinach samples, the p-value of the experiment was 0.000334. The t-value counted 7.309865, and the degrees of freedom had a value of 6. In the weed plant, the absorbances decreased in both samples with and without herbicide over time. The two-sample t-test for the weed samples had a p-value of the 0.007342, a t-value of 3.973013, and degrees of freedom of 6.

Discussion:
When analyzing the results, the herbicide didn’t fully inhibit the photosynthesis in the plants because the absorbances decreased in both the spinach and the weed leaves. A decreasing absorbance indicates moving electrons by a decolorization of DCIP. For the spinach samples, the absorbances of the chloroplasts without herbicide were significantly higher than the ones with herbicide (p-value=0.000334). Following this data, it would mean that the samples with herbicide perform a better photosynthesis than the ones without herbicide, which doesn’t line up with the reality. The same observations were made in the weed leaves, where the absorbances of the chloroplasts without herbicide were significantly higher than the ones with herbicide (p-value=0.007342). Additionally, the weed chloroplasts without herbicide decreased in absorbance over time, which should not be the case. After being exposed to light for thirty minutes, photosynthesis should be occurring at the same level as the initial state. When running a two-sample t-test between the samples of both plants with the herbicide, the results are insignificant (p-value=0.10649), which means the hypothesis is rejected. Multiple justifications can be made for these inconsistent results. Overall, the errors were mainly due to the fact that it was a humanly driven experiment. Consequently, it’s possible that some of the test tubes were mixed up throughout the measuring of absorbances over the 30-minute period. When comparing both plants, the influence of herbicide was more significant on the absorbance of the spinach leaves than those of the weed leaves. Even if this seems counterintuitive, herbicide resistance is a contemporary problem, in which an alteration of the site of action of the herbicide at the cellular level generates the herbicide resistance in weeds. Additionally, herbicide tolerance, i.e. to low herbicide doses, is usually the result either of differences in herbicide: uptake and translocation at the plant level or of differences in plant metabolism and herbicide detoxification. (Warwick:1991) The herbicide tolerance shows another potential error that could have occurred, that is the too little amount of herbicide added into the sample. The increasing and widespread occurrence of herbicide-resistant weeds has reached the level where more extensive basic research is needed to develop effective management strategies. A clear need exists for studies on herbicides and herbicide resistance, including research on the mech¬anisms and physiological effects of resistance. (Warwick:1991) Overall, since this experiment had some flaws. additional research will have to be made to be performed to conclude whether or not and to what degree spinach and weeds are resistant to herbicide.
