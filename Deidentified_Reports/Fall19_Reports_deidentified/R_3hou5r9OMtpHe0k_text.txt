Title: Effects of the Addition of Juvenile Hormone on the Life Cycle of  Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
none

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is considered a pest to many crops. In their juvenile form, these worms can severely damage tomatoes and tomato-like crops. The development of Manduca sexta is controlled by a variety of hormones. These hormones send various signals throughout the body. They can vary greatly in their function, with some triggering responses to environmental stimuli, and others provoking structural bodily changes. Specific hormones instrumental to the development of the tobacco hornworm are Ecdysterone(20E) and Juvenile hormone(JH)[Johnson:2019]. 20E helps to regulate the timing of molts while an insect is developing. On the other hand, JH regulates the type of molt the hornworm experiences. Both of these hormones in specific concentrations work together to control the growth of the manduca sexta. An important example of this collaboration occurs during the 5th larval instar. During this time, levels of JH drop, marking the first time levels of 20E are higher than the levels of JH[Johnson:2019]. This event is known as the commitment pulse, and signals to the caterpillar that it is ready to pupate. Altering the concentrations of one of these two important hormones could potentially affect this stage of development of the organism. We are interested specifically in the response that altering the concentration of JH has on the tobacco hornworm. We hypothesize that if treated with the Juvenile hormone, the manduca sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the control group. Since a lowering in concentration of JH is necessary for the hornworm to experience the commitment pulse, altering its concentration has the ability to cause a change in its life cycle.

Materials and Methods:
Eight tobacco hornworms were placed in individual plastic plastic containers. Two holes were poked in the side of each individual compartment to provide the hornworms with oxygen. Ten grams of food were weighed and placed in each individual compartment. Four of the hornworms were part of the treatment group. This group received five drops of JH mixed in with their food. The control group also contained four hornworms. This group received five drops of water mixed in with their food. The hornworms were weighed initially and placed in their containers. The growth of each individual hornworm was documented by weighing and recording of their individual masses every day. The food in each of the compartments was replaced once it began to dry out. The food was completely replaced, with the treatment group again receiving five drops of JH and the control group receiving five drops of water. To determine the reproducibility of our experiment we used a two-sample t-test comparing the daily change in weight between the two groups.

Results:
All hornworms in both the treatment and control groups survived the experiment. Slight variations were detected in the growth of the treatment and the control groups. The hornworms in the treatment group grew on average 1.0569g per day. The hornworms in the control group grew on average 0.57734g per day. The average daily growth rates for both groups were similar until day 12, when the control group began to lose weight. The average daily growth rates of both groups per day are depicted in figure one. The one-tailed p value of this data is 0.17, meaning the difference in their daily growth was not statistically significant.

Discussion:
Overall, while the addition of JH had some effect on the manduca sexta , it was found to be statistically insignificant. While there may not have been a statistical significance in the daily average growth of each group, there were many trends that suggested the more rapid development of the control group. Although the average daily growth favors the treatment group, this was likely due to the control group losing weight, skewing its daily growth average. Overall, the control group began its weight loss around day 12. This weight loss trend can potentially be explained by the life cycle of the hornworm. Once the hornworm reaches the commitment pulse, its growth begins to stop as it now enters the wandering stage preparing to pupate[Grunert:2015]. Our hornworms experienced a similar weight loss, potentially indicating that they had reached the wandering stage. This stage is an essential part in the development of the hornworms, indicating they are ready to move forward in their life cycle. If our control hornworms were losing weight in order to pupate, it would indicate a trend of greater rapidity in their development in contrast to the treatment group that did not lose weight. This means that the development of the treatment group was potentially slowed by the addition of the JH, however further testing would be required to fully prove our hypothesis. To fully determine whether this explanation is accurate, it would be necessary in a future experiment to lengthen the duration of observation. If the experiment were to be continued over the course of another week or two, it would provide clearer results on whether the control group had reached the commitment pulse or not. If the control group began to pupate within a few days, it would support the explanation of reaching the wandering phase. If not, it would support the statistical insignificance of our hypothesis. Overall, the results of this experiment can help to exemplify the role that JH plays in the life cycle of manduca sexta. Studying the effects of particular hormones on insect populations has many potential benefits. Certain hormones have the potential to be used as pesticides, by keeping certain organisms in one stage of their life cycle. Further research in usage of hormones as pesticides can help prevent loss of crop leading to financial and ecological problems in the future.
