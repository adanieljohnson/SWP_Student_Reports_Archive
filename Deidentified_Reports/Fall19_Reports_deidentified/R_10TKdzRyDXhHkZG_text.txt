Title: Juvenile hormone in manduca sexta 

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Introduction: In this experiment, students are studying insect hormones. The insect used in this lab was the hornworm (manduca sexta). From the lab manual and class discussion, we know there are three main hormones in insects that control their growth and other physiological processes. The two hormones that were focused on in this lab are Ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). 20E regulates the timing of molting during the development of the insect. JH regulates the type of molt the insect will go into during development. The hornworm was chosen for this experiment because it is found in abundance in nature and due to it being considered a model organism. It is easy to study in a laboratory setting because the hormones in the manduca sexta are relatively easy to understand. These insects are also easy to maintain within the lab. [Kingsolver: 2007].The Manduca sexta is  also considered to be a pest and is popular to study as a result.. The hornworm is considered a pest because it will harvest on crops such as tobacco, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant and other vegetation in this family. Hornworms will eat the leaves of these plants. They will also digest fruit that is yet to ripen, giving a rise in opportunity for the fruit to be diseased. [Byron and Gillett-Kaufman: 2017].Pests have also been studied to determine the best way to control outbreaks in crops. The insect growth regulators we experimented with affect the growth and development of the insects. 

Hypothesis: The expectation for this experiment is that the juvenile growth hormone will alter the growth of worms by accelerating their development. We predict that the worms given six drops of the growth hormone in their food will have a significantly different weight than the control group with no growth hormone used. 


Materials and Methods:
Methods: For this experiment we separated eight hornworms into two separate containers. In the containers, each worm had their own section. Small holes were placed on the side of the container to help air flow. The initial weight of each worm was taken, then they were placed in their respective containers. After this approximately ten grams of food was weighed out and given to each worm. The control group received six drops of water added to  their food. The treatment group received six drops of juvenile growth hormone added to their food. Each container and section was labeled. Every day the worms were checked on. We weighed the worms, recorded their mass, cleaned their containers and gave them new food if needed. Each container was kept in an incubator in the lab. 


Results:
In the experiment done with the juvenile growth hormone, there was no obvious increase in the amount of weight gained each day when comparing the control group to the treatment group as seen in table 1.Both groups had one caterpillar die in the experiment. Caterpillar number three died in the treatment group and caterpillar number four died in the control group. This is demonstrated in table one by the decrease in weight each day. For the most part, the caterpillars in both groups were around the same weight, varying from 8.9 grams on the last day to 6.6 grams. Both groups of caterpillars had signs of motion and continued eating food up until the last day. The caterpillars also kept their green/blue coloring, with the exception of the two that died. The results of the two-sample T-tests for the weights of the caterpillars were 1.17 for the t-value, 0.12 for the p-value and 0.24 for the two-tailed p-value. 


Discussion:
Our group hypothesized that for this experiment the juvenile growth hormone would alter the growth of worms by accelerating their development. We also predicted that the worms given six drops of the growth hormone in their food would have a significantly different weight than the control group with no growth hormone used. The results of the experiment rejected our hypothesis. In fact, there was very little difference in weight between the control group and the treatment group. The juvenile hormone had no to little effect on the growth and development of the caterpillars. Our test for weight resulted in a p-value of 0.12, meaning that there is little correlation between the juvenile hormone fed to the treatment group being responsible for the weight that was gained. After researching the juvenile hormone, the results of the lab began to make sense. When the juvenile hormone is released into an insects body in the lab, it covers up the effects of insulin that is released naturally [Hatem:2015]. Since insulin is responsible for the body using carbohydrates and glucose from food intake, it would make sense that there was very little difference between the weights of the control and treatment group. Future studies with this experiment could be with insulin in insect bodies. It would be interesting to conduct an experiment and see if there could potentially be a type of insulin strong enough that the juvenile hormone does not mask its effects.

This means that there is not a significant difference in the weight of the control group compared to the treatment group. *************************************************************************
