Title: The Effect of Temperature on Number of Aggressive Behavior Displays in Betta splendens

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior, ethology, seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors and how they have been shaped evolutionarily, largely through patient observation. The species Betta splendens, a robust fish originating from southeast Asia, is a prime candidate for ethological studies due to its flamboyant displays of aggressive behavior when provoked. In this experiment, it was hypothesized that a male Betta exposed to higher water temperature would display a higher number of aggressive displays compared to that of a Betta under ambient or lower water temperature conditions. A male Betta in lower water temperature was hypothesized to have a lower number of aggressive displays compared to that of the warmer or ambient water condition Bettas. Two male Bettas were isolated and then presented to each in ambient water conditions, followed by subsequent comparisons of an ambient water Betta to Bettas kept in warmer water and colder water. A total of nine trials were performed. The results indicate temperature has a significant impact on the number of aggressive displays in male Betta in colder water, but not warmer water. Further studies may examine animal behavior changes due to higher temperatures and lower pH in water due to the effects of climate change.  

Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, combines observational skills with insights and theories from ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology. The field seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, and how these behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. Patient observation is required to collect data, recognize patterns, develop questions, and formulate experiments about behaviors. One species that demonstrates such observable behaviors and has been the focus of many studies is the Betta splendens, commonly referred to as “Betta.” Betta are common aquarium fish which originated in southeast Asia. They are a fairly robust, ectothermic species that can survive sluggish and muddy waters. A wild male at rest will typically have dull colors, but these may change to intense blues or reds when aggravated by the presence of another male. These displays of aggressive intraspecific behavior can be categorized by various broadside movements and facing displays, within which occur specific behaviors indicating differing levels of aggression [Johnson: 2019]. In this experiment, we tested how temperature affects these displays of aggression between Betta males. Bettas were optimal subjects for this experiment because their naturally ostentatious displays are easy to identify. The Bettas in this experiment were particularly adept, because they have been bred to be grandiose in both morphology and behavior. It was hypothesized that a male Betta exposed to higher water temperature conditions would display a higher number of aggressive displays compared to that of a Betta under ambient or lower water temperature conditions. A male Betta in lower water temperature was hypothesized to have a lower number of aggressive displays compared to that of the warmer or ambient water condition Bettas. Bettas exposed to higher temperatures have been found to be more active overall and to display a general increase in “boldness” with elevated temperature due to increases in metabolic rate, respiration, and locomotion performance [Forsatkar: 2016]. The opposite of these effects would thus be expected in Betta kept in colder water. Decrease in temperature reduces metabolic activity and subsequent overall activity in ectothermic fish. [Johnston: 1987]. A decrease in total activity would presumably be coupled with decreased aggressive displays.

Materials and Methods:
Two male Betta were isolated by a partition in a tank with water under ambient temperature conditions, 19°C, as the control group. The partition was removed between the Betta, and the number of aggressive displays by one of the males was counted for 4 minutes. The partition was replaced, and the Bettas allowed 4 minutes of rest. This process was repeated for 3 trials total. A different, experimental group male Betta was allowed to acclimate to water under increased temperature conditions, heated to 21°C via a warming pad under a tank, while one of the ambient water fish was removed. The Betta in warmer water was then placed in the tank with ambient water and allowed to acclimate for 2 minutes, separated from the other male by a partition. The partition was then removed and the number of aggressive displays by the Betta from warmer water was noted for 4 minutes. The partition was replaced and the Bettas were allowed 4 minutes of rest. This was repeated for 3 trials total. A different, experimental group male Betta was allowed to acclimate to water under decreased temperature conditions, chilled using ice cubes to 16°C, while the Betta initially from warmer water was removed. The Betta from colder water was placed in the tank with ambient water temperature conditions and allowed to acclimate for 2 minutes, separated from the other male by a partition. The partition was then removed and the number of aggressive displays by the male from colder water was noted for 4 minutes. The partition was replaced and the Bettas allowed 4 minutes of rest. This process was repeated for 3 trials total. An ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test was used to determine if the results were statistically significant, additionally comparing significance between ambient and warmer, ambient and colder, and warmer and colder display numbers.

Results:
The data shows that temperature has a significant impact on the number of aggressive behavior displays in male Betta (p = 0.0013). The difference in the average number of aggressive displays of the control group under ambient water conditions (8.67 +/- 2.89; n=3) and experimental colder water group (0 +/- 0; =3) was significant (p &lt; 0.05). The difference in number of aggressive displays between the colder water group and the experimental warmer water group (13.3 +/- 2.89; n=3) was also significant (p &lt; 0.05). The difference in average number of aggressive displays between the ambient water and warmer water groups, however, was not significant (p &gt; 0.05) (Figure 1). The number of aggressive displays within groups was fairly consistent (variance = 11.23%), while the number of aggressive displays among groups was fairly different (variance = 88.77%). 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment indicate that the hypothesis should be partially supported. The warmer water Betta did not show a significantly higher number of aggressive displays than the ambient water Betta, but did perform a significantly higher number of displays compared to the colder water Betta. This result is likely due to the range of temperatures Betta prefer to inhabit and in which they are able to survive. While the displays of Betta have been found to be affected by changes in water temperature of as little as 2°C, the range of temperatures used in this experiment may not have allowed for significant differences. In the wild, Betta prefer water that is between 25°C and 31.5°C. In laboratory conditions they are often kept in water conditions of 21-30°C [Forsatkar: 2016]. In one study on the effect of temperature and Betta aggressiveness, temperatures of 28°C led to consistently more responses than when a temperature of 22°C was employed [Hess: 1952]. The temperature we used, 21°C, for the experimental warmer group may thus not have been warm enough to induce the increased metabolic rate and subsequent increase in aggression demonstrated by other studies.  
The colder water Betta, however, did display a significantly lower number of aggressive displays than the ambient and warmer water groups as hypothesized. Studies conducted on other ectotherms have demonstrated that lower temperatures decrease locomotor performance, which produces lowered aggressiveness as a result. When exposed to lower temperatures over longer periods of time, ectotherms have even been shown to alter thermal sensitivity of skeletal muscle mechanics, with varying effects on behavior, in order to allow for best fitness in their environment [James: 2013]. Other studies have also shown ectothermic fish acclimated to colder water temperatures demonstrate reduced maximum performance when compared to fish in warmer water conditions. [Pörtner: 2002]. 
Additional experiments could be performed to test the effects of increased water temperatures, perhaps at temperatures expected as a result of global warming, on levels of aggression and other behavior displays in aquatic ectotherms. One logical experiment in particular could be to test the potential for synergistic effects on aggression between increasing temperatures and decreasing pH in water as a result of climate change and ocean acidification. It is expected that community structure will be strongly influenced by global warming in the future, as animal physiology, ecology and evolution are all affected by temperature [Nguyen: 2011]. By using practices employed by ethologists, such as observation, we can better understand how organisms and their communities will respond to the changing conditions of the future.
