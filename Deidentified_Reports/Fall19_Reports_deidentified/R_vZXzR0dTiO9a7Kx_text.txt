Title: Habituation Rates of Betta splendens at Different Distances and In Front of a Mirror

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied the effects of distance on habituation rates in Betta splendens, or the Siamese fighting fish. We tested three different conditions on two male B. splendens individuals. We analyzed the habituation rates of two males, in a fish tank, that were separated by a glass barrier and two glass barriers of a greater distance. We also tested the habituation rate of a male with a mirror in front of him. We hypothesized that B. splendens would habituate the fastest when a mirror was present and that the habituation rate of the B. splendens individuals would decrease with distance. We established the B. splendens separated by a single glass barrier as the control group. We expected habituation to occur more quickly with greater distances because the strength of an agonistic behavior may be more difficult for the B. splendens to perceive. Our data yielded insignificant results, as the two-tailed p-value between the control and the two experimental groups were high.


Introduction:
Betta splendens, or the Siamese fighting fish, was the species studied in this experiment. Some notable characteristics of this species is its colorful body ranging from dark blue to bright red. In addition, they have wide caudal fins that move in feather-like motions. The most significant characteristic of B. splendens is its aggressiveness toward other members of its species. This agonistic behavior is composed of broadside movements such as tail flashing and facing movements such as red mane display [Johnson: 2016]. In this experiment, we studied the habituation rates of B. splendens under three different conditions. The first of which was two males separated by a single transparent barrier. The second condition was a male placed in front of a mirror and the third was two males separated by a far distance with two glass barriers. Habituation rate is the reduction of a species’ response to a certain stimulus over time. This species is useful in this experiment because its agonistic behaviors are very apparent to an outsider studying this animal. We hypothesized that the B. splendens in front of the mirror would have the fastest habituation rate, and the rate of habituation among the separated males would become faster as distance increased. We hypothesize that habituation will occur more quickly when the B. splendens are farther away because they may find it more difficult to perceive agonistic displays because of the long distance. In addition, B. Splendens are highly territorial fish and may habituate more quickly because neither male can get closer to each other. In a prior experiment, Michael H. Figler examined the habituation rate of a male B. splendens in front of a mirror for over 24 hours [Figler: 1972]. He found that habituation occurred quickly, but the fish never fully ceased its agonistic behaviors [Figler: 1972]. The B. splendens habituated for a period of time and eventually, again, initiated agonistic behavior in a repeated cycle [Figler: 1972]. Therefore, we expected the B. splendens to habituate quickly and begin agonistic behavior shortly after a period of habituation. This experiment is important to our understanding of B. splendens territorial behavior. In addition, B. splendens are common pets. In order to prevent the fish from being constantly stressed, fish owners should know how far B. splendens should be separated from each other. 


Materials and Methods:
In this lab, we chose two male Betta splendens and put them in a fish tank. Prior to placing these fish in the tank, we inserted two opaque and two glass barriers in the tank, creating three separate sections. After constructing this design, we put one male in the middle section and a male in a neighboring section. We removed the opaque barrier, allowing the fish to see each other. We began to record observations of agonistic behavior once the barrier was removed. We looked for agonistic behaviors such as opercula expansion and caudal fin flipping. We timed the amount of time it took for both fish to stop displaying these intraspecific behaviors for thirty seconds. We considered this to be an indication that habituation has occurred. We recorded this value in seconds. We put the opaque barrier back in the tank and allowed the fish to rest for five minutes. We then repeated this portion of the experiment two more times. During the second part of the experiment, we placed a mirror in front of one of the B. splendens. We then recorded our observations of agonistic behavior and the amount of time it took for the fish to habituate. We allowed the fish to rest for five minutes. We repeated the mirror step two more times, with a five-minute break between each step. We then used a fish net to place one of the males in the farthest section from the other male. They were separated at a distance of about 10 inches. We removed the opaque barriers and recorded our observations and habituation rate of both fish. We performed this step three times and included a five-minute rest period between each trial. We used two different two-tailed, two-sample t-tests to compare the habituation rates of the control and experimental groups.


Results:
The two-tailed p-value between the two groups in Figure 1. was 0.13. The two-tailed p-value between the two groups in Figure 2. was 0.62. The average habituation rate for the control group was 170 s. This value was greater than that of the experimental group represented in Figure 1. (50.3 s). It was also smaller than that of the experimental group in Figure 2. (204 s). In all of the different groups, B. splendens displayed red manes, an example of highly aggressive agonistic behavior. As can be seen in Figure 1., the habituation rates of the experimental group were fairly consistent. The standard deviation was smaller than that of the control group. Similarly, the experimental group in Figure 2. had a smaller standard deviation than the control group. There was one trial during the control portion of the experiment where the habituation rate of both B. splendens was much lower than that of the other trials within this step.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported. The two two-tailed p-values were both greater than 0.05 indicating that there was no significant difference between the sets of data. As a result, we cannot conclude whether or not habituation occurs more quickly over greater distances. In addition, we cannot say with confidence that a male Betta splendens in front of a mirror will habituate quicker than it would in the presence of another male. While the average habituation rate was the lowest for this group, the habituation rate is not significantly different from the control. There were no significant sources of error in this experiment. The only sources of error that may have been present was an incorrect judgement of agonistic behavior. We may have perceived some behavior to be agonistic when it may not have been. As a result, we would have recorded a longer habituation rate than the actual habituation rate. In a prior experiment, male B. splendens were physically separated in fish tank and a relationship between aggressiveness and distance was observed [Bronstein: 1981]. In this experiment, Paul M. Bronstein found that aggressiveness and agonistic behavior decreased with distance. As a result, we would have expected habituation to occur more quickly among the fish that were farther apart. We would expect that a decreased presence of aggression would lead the fish to discontinue their agonistic responses quicker.  In a separate experiment, Bronstein performed an experiment nearly identical to ours. He placed a male B. splendens in front of a mirror and physically separated two males at a number of different distances [Bronstein: 1983]. He found that B. splendens displayed more aggressive behavior at a variety of distances than the B. splendens placed with a mirror [Bronstein: 1983]. We saw a similar outcome, as the individual in front of the mirror had the fastest average habituation rate. However, the average was not significantly different from those of the other groups. Understanding animal behavior is essential to our understanding of the evolutionary path of a species. A possible follow up experiment could be examining fitness of male B. splendens in relation to their aggressiveness. We can examine their aggressiveness towards other males at varying distances and their corresponding fitness. In addition, B. splendens is a popular pet. As we saw in lab, B. splendens sometimes die from stress due to increased exposure to other B. splendens. If people want to have more than one of these fish, they should know how far apart to keep these fish so that they do not become overstressed. Habituation of agonistic behavior is an indicator of a decrease in stress in these fish. While we were unable to draw a difference between B. splendens at different distances, we could perform this experiment again with farther distances.
