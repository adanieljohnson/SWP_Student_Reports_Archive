Title: Habituation Rates of Betta splendins at Different Distances and In Front of a Mirror

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied the effects of distance on habituation rates in Betta splendins, or the Siamese fighting fish. We tested three different conditions on two male B. splendins individuals. We analyzed the habituation rates of two males, in a fish tank, that were separated by a glass barrier and two glass barriers of a greater distance. We also tested the habituation rate of a male with a mirror in front of him. We hypothesized that B. splendins would habituate the fastest when a mirror was present and that the habituation rate of the B. splendins individuals would decrease with distance. We established the B. splendins separated by a single glass barrier as the controll group. We expected habituation to occur more quickly with greater distances because the strength of an agnostic behavior may be more difficult for the B. splendins to perceive. Our data yielded insignificent results, as the two-tailed p_value between the controll and the two experimental groups were high.


Introduction:
Betta splendins, or the Siamese fighting fish, was the species studied in this experiment. Some notable characteristics of this species is its colorful body ranging from dark blue to bright red. In addition, they have wide caudal fins that move in feather-like motions. The most significent characteristic of B. splendins is its aggressiveness toward other members of its species. This agnostic behavior is composed of broadside movements such as tail flashing and facing movements such as red mane display [Johnson: 2016]. In this experiment, we studied the habituation rates of B. splendins under three different conditions. The first of which was two males separated by a single transparent barrier. The second condition was a male placed in front of a mirror and the third was two males separated by a far distance with two glass barriers. Habituation rate is the reduction of a species’ response to a certain stimulus over time. This species is useful in this experiment because its agnostic behaviors are very apparent to an outsider studying this animal. We hypothesized that the B. splendins in front of the mirror would have the fastest habituation rate, and the rate of habituation among the separated males would become faster as distance increased. We hypothesize that habituation will occur more quickly when the B. splendins are farther away because they may find it more difficult to perceive agnostic displays because of the long distance. In addition, B. Splendins are highly territorial fish and may habituate more quickly because neither male can get closer to each other. In a prior experiment, Michael H. Figler examined the habituation rate of a male B. splendins in front of a mirror for over 24 hours [Figler: 1972]. He found that habituation occurred quickly, but the fish never fully ceased its agnostic behaviors [Figler: 1972]. The B. splendins habituated for a period of time and eventually, again, initiated agnostic behavior in a repeated cycle [Figler: 1972]. Therefore, we expected the B. splendins to habituate quickly and begin agnostic behavior shortly after a period of habituation. This experiment is important to our understanding of B. splendins territorial behavior. In addition, B. splendins are common pets. In order to prevent the fish from being constantly stressed, fish owners should know how far B. splendins should be separated from each other. 


Materials and Method:
In this lab, we chose two male Betta splendins and put them in a fish tank. Prior to placing these fish in the tank, we inserted two opaque and two glass barriers in the tank, creating three separate sections. After constructing this design, we put one male in the middle section and a male in a neighboring section. We removed the opaque barrier, allowing the fish to see each other. We began to record observations of agnostic behavior once the barrier was removed. We looked for agnostic behaviors such as opercula expansion and caudal fin flipping. We timed the amount of time it took for both fish to stop displaying these intraspecific behaviors for thirty seconds. We considered this to be an indication that habituation has occurred. We recorded this value in seconds. We put the opaque barrier back in the tank and allowed the fish to rest for five minutes. We then repeated this portion of the experiment two more times. During the second part of the experiment, we placed a mirror in front of one of the B. splendins. We then recorded our observations of agnostic behavior and the amount of time it took for the fish to habituate. We allowed the fish to rest for five minutes. We repeated the mirror step two more times, with a five-minute break between each step. We then used a fish net to place one of the males in the farthest section from the other male. They were separated at a distance of about 10 inches. We removed the opaque barriers and recorded our observations and habituation rate of both fish. We performed this step three times and included a five-minute rest period between each trial. We used two different two-tailed, two-sample t_tests to compare the habituation rates of the controll and experimental groups.


Results:
The two-tailed p_value between the two groups in Figure 1. was 0.13. The two-tailed p_value between the two groups in Figure 2. was 0.62. The average habituation rate for the controll group was 170 s. This value was greater than that of the experimental group represented in Figure 1. (50.3 s). It was also smaller than that of the experimental group in Figure 2. (204 s). In all of the different groups, B. splendins displayed red manes, an example of highly aggressive agnostic behavior. As can be seen in Figure 1., the habituation rates of the experimental group were fairly consistent. The standard deviation was smaller than that of the controll group. Similarly, the experimental group in Figure 2. had a smaller standard deviation than the controll group. There was one trial during the controll portion of the experiment where the habituation rate of both B. splendins was much lower than that of the other trials within this step.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported. The two two-tailed p_values were both greater than 0.05 indicating that there was no significent difference between the sets of data. As a result, we cannot conclude whether or not habituation occurs more quickly over greater distances. In addition, we cannot say with confidence that a male Betta splendins in front of a mirror will habituate quicker than it would in the presence of another male. While the average habituation rate was the lowest for this group, the habituation rate is not significently different from the controll. There were no significent sources of error in this experiment. The only sources of error that may have been present was an incorrect judgement of agnostic behavior. We may have perceived some behavior to be agnostic when it may not have been. As a result, we would have recorded a longer habituation rate than the actual habituation rate. In a prior experiment, male B. splendins were physically separated in fish tank and a relationship between aggressiveness and distance was observed [Bronstein: 1981]. In this experiment, Paul M. Bronstein found that aggressiveness and agnostic behavior decreased with distance. As a result, we would have expected habituation to occur more quickly among the fish that were farther apart. We would expect that a decreased presence of aggression would lead the fish to discontinue their agnostic responses quicker.  In a separate experiment, Bronstein performed an experiment nearly identical to ours. He placed a male B. splendins in front of a mirror and physically separated two males at a number of different distances [Bronstein: 1983]. He found that B. splendins displayed more aggressive behavior at a variety of distances than the B. splendins placed with a mirror [Bronstein: 1983]. We saw a similar outcome, as the individual in front of the mirror had the fastest average habituation rate. However, the average was not significently different from those of the other groups. Understanding animal behavior is essential to our understanding of the evolutionary path of a species. A possible follow up experiment could be examining fitness of male B. splendins in relation to their aggressiveness. We can examine their aggressiveness towards other males at varying distances and their corresponding fitness. In addition, B. splendins is a popular pet. As we saw in lab, B. splendins sometimes die from stress due to increased exposure to other B. splendins. If people want to have more than one of these fish, they should know how far apart to keep these fish so that they do not become overstressed. Habituation of agnostic behavior is an indicator of a decrease in stress in these fish. While we were unable to draw a difference between B. splendins at different distances, we could perform this experiment again with farther distances.
