Title: Effects of Salinity on Buckwheat Plant Growth

Abstract:
The effects of salinity on plant growth highlight a source of environmental stress affecting growth.  Salinity describes the concentrated, dissolved salt in a solution.  In this study, the effect of saline solution, or sodium chloride (NaCl), on buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plant growth was investigated over a two-week period through analysis of root-to-shoot ratios in recently grown plants for both the root-to-shoot mass and length ratios to understand differences in resource allocation.  A significent difference was found in the root-to-shoot mass and length ratios between the controll and experimental groups, ultimately leading to rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  Salinity exposure affected the root-to-shoot length and mass ratios, as salinity adversely affects plant growth.  

Introduction:
Resource allocation allows plants to develop different strategies within different environmental settings in order to tolerate abiotic and biotic stress. Saline obstructs a plants ability to acquire nutrients, thus disrupting growth [Grattan: 1992].  Salinity is a global threat to plant growth and crop productivity, as salinity is an abiotic environmental factor that adversely affects plant growth and development. More than 800 million hectares, or nearly 2 million acres of land are affected by the environmental effects of salt globally.  The major contributors to salinity’s adverse effects on plant growth include the osmotic effect, toxic effect, and nutritional stress  [HAN: 2005]. When exposed to the environmental stress of salinity, plants first undergo growth reduction as a result of an osmotic effect, which produces limited genotypic difference.  Following the osmotic phase, plants exposed to salinity will slowly demonstrate to be salt tolerant or salt sensitive, as plants are genotypically different, and will have varying capabilities in preventing the accumulation of salt toxicity.  The extent to which the osmotic effect, toxic effect, and nutritional stress effect a particular plant’s growth are dependent upon the species, genotype, age, ionic stress, and other composition factors of the organism [Läuchli: 2007].  In looking at buckwheat plants, observation and analysis of growth, specifically length and mass of the roots and shoots of plants, can demonstrate how resource allocation in buckwheat plants specifically responds to changes in environmental factors.  Understanding this buckwheat species tolerance and adaptation to salinity, specifically sodium chloride (NaCl) solution, is critical in order to demonstrate the mechanisms of buckwheat’s salinity tolerance [Jeppson: 2006].   

In this lab, the response of buckwheat plants when exposed to salinity was measured in regards to plant growth.  The mass and lengths of the roots and shoots are the measurements utilized to understand the effects of salinity and compare resource allocation under varying environmental conditions.  Using the mean and standard deviation of the collected data develops further understanding of the variation.  T-tests also further demonstrate the statistical significance of the data. It is hypothesized that if plants are watered with saline solution, then on average these plants will have shorter roots and shoots as well as a smaller root-to-shoot ratio. 

Materials and Method:
Four buckwheat seeds were planted in twelve trays containing soil.  Six trays were planted as controll, and six trays were planted as experimental.  All twelve trays received 50 milliliters of Miracle-Gro fertilizer.  Each evening around 5 pm the controll trays were soaked with water while the experimental trays were soaked with saline solution.  The process was repeated each evening for two weeks in a greenhouse.  Following the two weeks, the plants were removed from the pots using care to separate the roots from the soil.  Using a container filled with water, the roots were then gently cleaned in order to remove any residual soil.  The largest shoot sample from each pot of both the controll and experimental groups was selected, measured and weighed individually.  The roots of the twelve plant samples were separated from their shoots by cutting each plant at the root to shoot junction.  Data was collected on the root length, shoot length, root mass, and shoot mass for each sample. Root to shoot length and weight ratios were then calculated for each of the twelve bins as well as the mean values and standard deviations for all data including the root and shoot lengths, masses, and root-to-shoot ratios.  From the data collected, a two-sample t_test was then run to analyze both the root-to-shoot mass ratios and root-to-shoot length ratios.  

Results:
The average root-to-shoot mass ratio of the experimental group, plants soaked with saline, was 0.36  0.28, whereas for the controll group soaked with water the average ratio was 0.40  0.09.  The average root-to-shoot length ratio for the experimental group was 0.72  0.20, whereas for the controll group the average ratio was 1.23  0.26.  Figure 1 illustrates the average root-to-shoot ratios for mass and length within the experimental and controll groups.  Both the mass and length root-to-shoot ratios were statistically significate.  For the root-to-shoot length ratios, the p_value was 0.38405 (t=0.303917, p_value=0.38405, d.f.=9, N=6).  For the root-to-shoot mass ratios, the p_value was 0.0049 (t=3.700132, p_value=0.0049, d.f.=9, N=6).  Figure 2 represents the average root and shoot lengths for the experimental and controll groups.  The average root length for the experimental group was 8.92  3.04, and for the controll group, 22.38  5.48.  The average shoot length for the experimental group was 12.17  1.36, and for the controll group, 18.3  3.97.  Figure 3 represents the average root and shoot masses for the experimental and controll groups.  The average root mass for the experimental group was 0.13  0.10, and for the controll group 0.426  0.24.  The average shoot mass for the experimental group was 0.42  0.26, and for the controll group 1.05  0.42. 



Discussion:
As a result of finding statistically significent results, our null hypothesis was rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, as there was a difference in root-to-shoot ratios between plants soaked with saline solution, and plants soaked with water in the case of root-to-shoot length ratio.  A previous study concluded that while plant growth is severely affected by salinity, buckwheat is a transgenic plant that demonstrates heightened abilities to attempt to overcome the exposure to high soil salinity [Chen: 2008].  In the first week of monitoring the experimental and controll plants, it was apparent that there was little visible difference between the saline soaked plants and the controll group.  An additional study found similar results, where there was no seed dormancy, meaning seeds can germinate in a range of environmental conditions.  However, with increasing quantities of saline water over time, plant growth decreases, which relates to the idea of the osmotic effect [Mustapha: 2013].  In the second week of monitoring, visible differences began to develop.  In removing the max shoot and corresponding root from each experimental and controll pot, visible differences were apparent, particularly in the root and shoot lengths.  The average root and shoot lengths respectively for the controll group were 22.38 cm and 18.3 cm, whereas plants exposed to saline were 8.92 cm and 12.17 cm.  This difference manifested itself further in the root-to-shoot length ratio, where a ratio of 1.23 described the controll group, and a smaller ratio of 0.72 described the experimental group.  In regards to mass, the difference in root-to-shoot ratio between controll and experimental was smaller, with values of 0.4 grams and 0.36 grams respectively.  However, in analyzing the averages of root and shoot masses, there was an evident difference between the controll and experimental groups.  Similarly, there was greater variation among both length and mass within the controll group than seen in the experimental group. This can likely be explained by the deterioration in growth in week two that halted further development, and thus, failed to allow for variation in growth to continue.  One pot in the controll group failed to germinate, which can likely be explained by a failing to spread out the buckwheat seeds across the pot.  In regards to the two-sample t_tests conducted for root-to-shoot mass and length ratios, only the root-to-shoot ratio for length was statistically significent (p_value=0.768).  A p_value of this degree demonstrates that the relationship between salinity and plant growth did not happen by chance, thus supporting the idea that salinity has an adverse effect on plant development. The p_value for root-to-shoot mass ratio of 0.0049 is not statistically significent.  While there is a difference in the average masses of roots and shoots within the controll and experimental groups, root-to-shoot mass ratio does not highlight this difference well; however, if the experiment were to continue over time, there could be a greater difference in average root-to-shoot mass ratios.         
In further laboratory experiments it would be interesting to look at how temperature affects plant growth and seed germination in buckwheat plants when exposed to salinity [Mustapha: 2013].  It would also be interesting to compare responses to salinity among different species, particularly because other studies have found buckwheat to be advantageous in attempting to overcome salinity exposure [Chen: 2008].  This lab demonstrated that buckwheat plants had a significent response to salinity that discouraged plant growth.  While the root-to-shoot ratios provided smaller ratios for the controll group than the experimental, it would be helpful to collect other data, or utilize a longer growth period to understand how the ratios progress over time.  Overall, understanding the effect of salinity on plant growth is critical on a larger scale in understanding the global environmental threats affecting plant growth and development globally.
