Title: Effects of Ecdysone(20E) on the Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
x

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta, or tobacco hornworm, is a species with larvae that are considered a pest due to damage that can potentially be done to crops. The Manduca Sexta is commonly found in North America, as well as Central and South America. The larvae feed on plant matter, hence their classification as a pest. In nature, the larvae can reach a mass of up to twelve grams. Larvae develop in several instars, ending with the fifth instar. Following the fifth instar, the larvae enter the ground in order to pupate[Kanost 2016].
Ecdysone is a hormone that is secreted by the prothoracic glands. 20E, or 20- hydroxyecdysone, is a hormone derived from ecdysone that works with Juvenile hormone to regulate development in insects. 20E regulates the timing of the molting of the larvae[Gilbert 2009]. 20E controlls the development of a new exoskeleton by triggering ecdysis, or the shedding of the exoskeleton. If 20E levels fall below a certain threshold, other endocrine structures may activate. This happens naturally at the end of apolysis, which allows the exoskeleton to harden. 20E can be utilized as an insect growth regulator, or IGR, which can be used as pesticides. 20E has not had the same commercial success as Juvenile Hormones used as pesticides as 20E is more difficult to synthesize commercially[Omkar 2016]. 
The null hypothesis is that the controll and treatment groups will fare the same growth rates in mass over the course of eight days. The alternate hypothesis is 20E will incite faster growth in the mass of Manduca sexta. 



Materials and Method:
First, we will procure eight manduca sexta larvae. We will then divide them into two groups of 4. Group 1 is the controll group, and group 2 will be treated with 20E. Both groups will be separated into plastic containers will four individual spaces for each larva, separated by walls. Two holes for air will be poked into each sub container. Each larva will receive 10 grams of food prepared from beans, which will be replenished frequently. The controll group will receive eight drops of water mixed in with their food. The treatment group will receive three drops of Azaguard 20E as well as eight drops of water. The water and Azaguard will be replenished with the food.
	The caterpillars will be weighed daily for eight days to track their change in mass. A paired T-test will be conducted on the averages of each group for each day to determine the existence of a correlation between 20E treatment and the growth in mass of the pupae.


Results:
Observations: 
The larvae in the treatment group started out larger, as they were selected at a later date than the controll group. This was due to the quick deaths of the original treatment group.
The larvae in the controll group grew quickly and were noticeably larger each day. They appeared healthy as each one was green in color and none of them had brown discolorations at any point. They ate noticeable amounts of food, which had to be replenished nearly every day. They also defecated enough to cover most of the surface area of the bottom of the container, starting on day 4. The controll group larvae all appeared physically similar, aside from slight differences in mass. 
The treatment group had more variation in physical appearance. When they were first selected, they were all a vibrant light green color. By day 6, one of them had taken on a grayish hue and had begun to move less, although it did move slightly when handled. On day 7, an additional larva had taken on a grayish hue and appeared deceased. The first larva to lose their color remained gray and inactive. The other two larvae were still green, but did not move very much.  On day eight, the initial gray larva appeared to be deceased as it showed no signs of movement even when handled. The second gray larva had turned a dark brown and also failed to move. The green larvae were still alive, but were slow moving.

Discussion:
The data did not support the alternate or null hypothesis. The masses of the Manduca Sexta larvae studied indicate that E20 does not incite faster growth in Manduca Sexta, nor are the masses of the treatment group and the controll group the same. The controll group reached much larger masses on average after eight days, despite starting at smaller masses than the treatment group. This suggests that excess E20 prevents growth in Manduca Sexta larvae.
The hampered growth may be explained by the idea that the natural drop in E20 levels was unable to occur due to the intake of Azagaurd. E20 levels generally fall, allowing the exoskeleton to harden during each instar phase[Omkar 2016]. Without this natural change in levels, it is possible that the development of the larvae ended after the first instar as the exoskeleton of the second instar was unable to properly form. This would explain why there was not a notable change in mass in the treatment group, as they were unable to grow to the next instar. Thus, the mass would be unable to increase as molting would likely not occur again, but the treatment group did not die immediately as they were able to survive as the initial instar.
The next logical step would be to increase the scale of the experiment. Only four subjects were used in each group during this experiment, which is a small sample size. A larger sample size would further support the reproducibility of this experiment. The length of the experiment could also be increased.
