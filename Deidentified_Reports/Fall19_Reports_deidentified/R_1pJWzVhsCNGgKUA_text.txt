Title: The effects of alkaline water on resource allocation in Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the process in which plants dedicate energy to development. The plant’s growth and internal processes can be affected based on where resources are allocated, and that’s influenced by factors such as water availability and sunlight. Resource allocation can be physically seen in a plant’s roots and shoots. In this study, we hypothesized that radish plants, Raphanus sativus, would have weaker roots when exposed to alkaline water. With 36 controll and 36 treatment plants, we saturated them with water everyday for 2 weeks. The treatment group received 50Ml of 9.5 pH water as the treatment variable. We then measured the plants total weight, root length and weight, shoot length and weight. We used those numbers to find the root: shoot ratio, which can be used to compare where a plant dedicates its resources. A one tailed, two-sample t_test was used. Of the sample, the p_value for weight was 0.07, and the p_value for length was 0.04. Both values were of significance, meaning that we can accept the alternate hypothesis. There was a correlation between plant growth and alkaline water exposure. When observed, the treatment plants had roots that were brittle and weak. Future studies would be needed to further confirm this hypothesis, and to also see if other factors in 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is the ability for a plant to dedicated energy to its development. This energy, formed from photosynthesis and metabolism, can be used to specifically target internal processes to help manage growth. Allocation can affect an individual plant’s properties, such as its structure, or an entire community’s species distribution [James: 2005]2. For smaller, herbaceous plants, such as Raphanus sativus (the radish), structural growth is important for nutrient transfer. The roots intake water and nutrients from the soil, and the shoot helps reach sunlight. However, what were to happen if the water pH was changed? How would the plant change its growth? How can we trace this growth change back to resource allocation? For Chinese cabbage plants, when using a weak alkaline solution in soil, heavy metal concentrations, specifically cadmium, were increased. The increase rate of heavy metal consumption caused the plants to have a slower growth phase [Ai: 2016]1. In radish plants, we hypothesize that the roots will be weaker due to an alkaline solution used in soil, causing the plant to dedicate more resources to shoot growth.

Materials and Method:
In all, there were 72 radish plants that were used for the study. 36 were dedicated for controll, and 36 were dedication for treatment. The seeds were planted in groups of 12, across 3 planter boxes for both controll and treatment. The plants were planted in Vermiculite and held in a greenhouse for two weeks. For the two weeks, each group was watered each day until saturated. The treatment group received 50Ml of alkaline water, at a pH of 9.5, as their independent variable. The dependent variable we were measuring is the root development. To determine root development, each plant’s total weight, root weight, shoot weight, root length, and shoot length were measured. A root to shoot ratio was used for both the weight and the length to determine the plant’s resource allocation. Numbers close to (.85 or greater) or above 1 mean stronger roots, and numbers less than 1 mean stronger shoots. A one tailed, two-sample T test was used to statistically measure the data, with an alpha of 0.05 for data significance. Since we are studying root development, we will take the p values for both length and weight root: shoot ratios.

Results:
Not all of the plants survived, with 26 for the controll group and 29 for the treatment being used in this sample. At a 0.05 alpha value, results were significent for both length and weight. For length, the p_value was 0.04, and for weight, the p_value was 0.007. General trends seen was a smaller, more concise standard deviation for the controll groups, versus a large deviation for the treatment group.

In Figure 1, the averages and standard deviations are compared between the controll and treatment groups. For the R:S weight, the controll group had an average ratio of 0.71 and the treatment had an average ratio of 0.31. For the R:S length, the controll group had an average ratio of 1.77, and the treatment had an average ratio of 1.50. 

Discussion:
Since the p values were of significance, we are allowed to accept the alternate hypothesis, that plant roots are weaker when exposed to alkaline water. There is a correlation between root development and exposure to alkaline water, but it cannot be confirmed that it’s causation. Observations when handling the plants showed that physically, the roots in the treatment group were brittle. When separating the roots from the soil and from other plants, it was easy to tear. This could account for some loss of root mass. Plant growth is affected by resource allocation, which determines which processes or structures of the plants have the most focus during development. Things like water, sunlight, and nutrient access affect resource allocation. In a previous study, it was suggested that a plant’s development could be limited by nutrient availability in the soil [James: 2005]2. Future studies could do a soil toxicology sample on nutrient levels after using alkaline water, to see if there’s a correlation between the pH and chemical composition.
