Title: Examining the Common Herbicide Roundup’s Effect on Various Plants’ Photosynthetic Activity

Abstract:
Herbicides are an important mechanism used to controll plant growth and protect crops from competition from invading organisms.  Herbicides effectively kill plants.  This experiment measures the effectiveness of the herbicide Roundup in inhibiting plant prosperity by determining its effect on photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleracea and garden weeds.  The hypothesis of the experiment is that Roundup will be more effective in inhibiting photosynthesis in garden weeds because herbicide is typically intended to kill weeds.  Data was collected by studying absorbance values for both plant sample in the presence of light and herbicide, as well as simply in the presence of light.  These values were averaged and compared.  The statistical test used to analyze the comparative effect of Roundup on S. oleracea and garden weeds did not show significent differences on Roundup’s ability to inhibit photosynthesis differently in varying plant specimens.  The p_value was 0.431.  The effects of Roundup on the S. oleracea leaves were slightly higher than the effect on garden weeds, suggesting that with longer time trials significent results may be obtainable.  This research is important due to its ability to better equip gardeners and farmers on how to protect their plants and crops.

Introduction:
In this experiment, the effects of the common herbicide, Roundup, on photosynthetic activity in two types of plants, S. oleracea and an unknown garden weed sample, will be compared.  Photosynthesis is an inherently important process for the generation of energy and involves three separate stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions [Johnson: 2019].  The light dependent reactions can be further divided into Photosystem II and Photosystem I, which use the movement of electrons to create a proton gradient that permits the synthesis of ATP, the energy currency of cells [Mehta: 2017].  The processes of the light-dependent reactions take place across the thylakoid membrane, important sacs found in the energy generating plant organelle known as chloroplasts.  The only requirements for photosynthesis are carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water.  These simple requirements mean that plants are easily able to grow and develop without significent effort.  The ease with which plants grow necessitates method of controllling plant growth.  This problem has been solved by the creation of herbicides such as Roundup.  Roundup functions by inhibiting a key enzyme that plants and bacteria use to make amino acids; thus, inhibiting plant growth [Panda: 2017].  Without the ability to grow and produce macromolecules, the plant effectively dies and can no longer facilitate the production of energy through photosynthesis.  The purpose of this experiment is to determine how Roundup can affect the events of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, specifically, in two different plants: S. oleracea and an unknown garden weed sample.  The hypothesis for this lab is that if herbicide is applied to both S. oleracea and weeds, then the herbicide will be more effective in inhibiting the weed plants’ photosystem I activity compared to the effects of Roundup on S. oleracea.  The rationale behind this hypothesis is that most herbicides are intended to kill weeds, and spectroscopy can be used to measure the electron transport activity occurring at the light dependent stages of photosynthesis.  A decrease in the absorbance of chloroplast samples means that processes of photosynthesis are taking place in the chloroplasts.  The assumption is that the herbicide, in inhibiting weed photosynthetic activity, would cause absorbance to change much less than the absorbance change observed in S. oleracea.  The independent variable is the type of plant and presence or absence of herbicide.  The dependent variable is the amount of photosynthesis that occurs, or the extent of inhibition of the electron transport chain in the process of photosynthesis.

Materials and Method:
In order to test the hypothesis of how the herbicide Roundup affects different types of plants’ ability to undergo photosynthesis, the following steps were completed.  2 different mortar and pestles, 2 medium sized beakers, and 4 50 Ml centrifuge tubes were placed in crushed ice to cool.  S. oleracea leaves and garden weed leaves were detached from their veins, rinsed and dried before being separated into two different mortars.  10 Ml of cold grinding buffer were added to each mortar and the sample was mixed with a pestle until significently fluid.  2 centrifugations were run for each sample, and the pellet contents of the second centrifugation were used throughout the duration of the lab as the chloroplasts in the samples.  Samples were prepared including 1 blank sample containing water and reaction buffer, 3 samples containing water, 130 M DCIP, reaction buffer, and 3 samples containing water, 130 M DCIP, reaction buffer, and herbicide.  These samples were prepared for both S. oleracea and garden weed leaves, totaling 14 test tubes.  Next, absorbance values at time 0 were gathered for each sample using a spectrophotometer.  All samples with the exception of the blank were then placed under the light and their absorbance values were measured every 10 minutes for a 30-minute period.  The data for the results in S. oleracea and the garden weeds was separately averaged and compared based on the percentage change undergone by both samples and a two-sample t_test was used to compare the results regarding the differences in Roundup's ability to eliminate photosynthetic processes in S. oleracea and garden weed leaves.  

Results:
When comparing the effects of Roundup on garden weeds, the garden weeds that were not exposed to the herbicide produced a larger amount of overall percent change throughout the experiment (Fig. 1).  The p_value for the two sample T-test comparing the effects of Roundup on garden weeds was 0.051.  The S. oleracea that was exposed to Roundup produced a greater percent change in absorbance throughout the experiment than the S. oleracea not exposed to roundup (Fig. 2).  The p_value for the two sample T-test comparing the effects of Roundup on S. oleracea was 0.099.  When comparing the effects of roundup between S. oleracea and garden weeds absorbance changes, the S. oleracea and roundup produced slightly more overall change in absorbance compared with the garden weeds and roundup (Fig. 3).  The overall percent change in absorbance for the tests conducted using S. oleracea was 22.73% decrease in absorbance, while the overall percentage change in absorbance for the tests conducted using garden weeds was 22.06% (Fig. 1).  The P-value for two sample T-test was determined as 0.431.  

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the herbicide Roundup would cause S. oleracea to produce more percent change in absorbance, therefore translating to a higher level of photosynthetic activity occurring, did not prove to be statistically supported.  Although observationally there was a greater percentage change in absorbance over the 30-minute interval in S. oleracea compared to the garden weed plants, the one-tailed p_value given by the two-sample t_test was not statistically significent.  Furthermore, the difference in percentage change in absorbance for both S. oleracea and garden weed plants was not large.  Past experiments have determined that photosynthesis was effectively inhibited at the level of Photosystem II in the light-dependent reactions by the herbicide diuron in microalgae [Magnusson: 2008].  Despite this evidence supporting the hypothesis, the experiment fails to support that Roundup has varying effects on different plant types, or that it contributes substantially to the inhibition of photosynthesis due to the insignificent p_value obtained experimentally.  Although the results correlated with the hypothesis to a small extent at the observational level, there is no evidence that this wasn’t due to mere chance.  It is important to note that the findings that Roundup effects Garden weeds had a nearly significent p_value, so there is strong evidence for this information.  Due to the inconclusive results obtained in this experiment through data and observation, it cannot be feasibly supported that Roundup has varying effects on different types of plants.  The data obtained in this experiment suggests that future tests might focus on using herbicides with a higher level of toxicity than Roundup, running trials for longer than 30 minutes, and explore working with a larger variety of plants.  These alterations could potentially provide important household knowledge regarding the most beneficial herbicides gardeners can purchase to suit the specificity of their plants being grown and potential unwanted invading organisms.
