Title: Effects of juvenile hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
	The Manduca Sexta is an organism that persists throughout most climates in the United States. The moth has a relatively quick molting period and life cycle, which makes it a very common and useful model organism for an array of studies. Commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, the M. sexta goes through various pupal, or instar, stages in which its levels of Juvenile Hormone (JH) are relatively high before it molts. It is known that M. sexta invariably goes through five instar phases, and this consistent number of instars determines the species– the fifth instar is always the last [Nijhout: 1975]. JH is known mostly for restricting ecdysone levels, in order to prevent the organism from molting [Safranek: 1980]. When M. sexta is ready to begin the molting process, JH levels reduce drastically and another hormone (20E) spikes which allows for the molting process to begin and for adult structures to develop on the organism [Johnson: 2016]. Treating the pupae with higher than normal JH levels, through food, is hypothesized to result in a failure of the organism to begin the molting process and cause a significently larger mass than those not treated. Rather than beginning the molting process, the treatment group is expected to enter a sixth instar phase and become larger-than-normal pupae [Johnson: 2016].  


Materials and Method:
	Pupae of M. sexta, all in similar instar phases, were obtained and divided into a controll and a treatment group, with eight total organisms and four organisms in each treatment group. After separating the groups, the pupae were individually placed into four-welled containers. 10 grams of food for each organism was measured and placed into the respective wells. Those organisms in the treatment group received 10 drops of the JH hormone mixed into their food, while those untreated received an equal amount of distilled water mixed into their food. The organisms were maintained in an incubator with appropriate temperature. Each pupae was weighed every day for two weeks. After two weeks, the mass differences between the groups was observed. Additionally, photos were taken every day to observe any obvious differences in appearance. A two-sample, one-sided t_test was used to compare the final difference in masses of the groups. 


Results:
	The results of this experiment did not show a significent difference in the final masses of the experimental and controll groups  (t=0.51956, d.f.=6, p=0.310986) with an alpha level of 0.05. Figure 1 shows the average mass of both groups after two weeks, and exemplifies the lack of significent difference between the treatment and controll groups. The trend of Figure 1 shows a similarity of final masses between the controll (blue bar) and treatment (purple bar) groups. 



Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis. At the end of two weeks, there was no significent difference in the masses of the treated and controll groups. No conclusion about  the addition of Juvenile Hormone to the organisms’ food having an effect on the growth and completion of instar phases of the organism can be made from this experiment. In addition to no observable difference in the size, there was a difference in coloration of the controll and treatment groups; the treatment group became much more pale that the controll group, which remained a brighter blue. More research and time is necessary to see the full effects of the Juvenile Hormone on the instar phases of M. sexta. Since the maximum amount of JH was given to the organisms, this could have had potentially negative effects on the organisms’ ability to even complete daily functions and sustain life. An additional study reports that JH may first delay development before it begins to accelerate development in the organism [Safranek: 1980].  Another study reports that if M. sexta are starved (or perhaps in this case have too much JH added to their food), during the third and fourth instar phases, the pupae will enter the fifth instar phase at a submaximal mass [Nijhout: 1975]. Additionally, the starting instar phases of the organisms were similar but not exactly the same, which could have resulted in each individual organism preparing to molt at different times during the experiment; in an attempt to remedy this, more time could be spent treating and observing the groups, to ensure that every organism reaches the final instar phase. More research is necessary to determine the effects of JH on molting in M. sexta.
