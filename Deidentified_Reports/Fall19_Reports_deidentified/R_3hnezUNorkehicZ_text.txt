Title: The Development of Manduca Sexta when Juvenile Hormone is Increased.

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta’s development is controlled mainly by two hormones, the Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone (E20). Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt that the larva will have, and E20 regulates the timing of the molt. The experiment focused on the effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Manduca Sexta during its development. The hypothesis was that the introduction of Juvenille Hormone (JH) would slow the growth during development, and not allow for the caterpillar to reach its adult stage. The Manduca Sexta is a pest as a larva so determining what hormones stunt its growth would be valuable in creating pesticides. There was a control group of caterpillars that was given water and food, and an experimental group that was given food and precor (Juvenile Hormone). The caterpillars were continually weighed to determine growth. It was determined that Juvenile Hormone had no effect on the growth of the Manduca Sexta, and there was an inability to determine whether JH would stop metamorphosis to the adult stage because the duration of the experiment was not long enough. It takes the Manduca Sexta around 20 days to develop into a moth and the experiment only ran for 2 weeks.

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is an insect that relies mainly on two hormones to control molting (Ecdysterone E20 and Juvenile Hormone JH)[Johnson: 2019].The Manduca Sexta is very useful in analyzing development because of its large size [Kanost: 2016]. The insect is a caterpillar in its larva state and a moth in its adult state. When the Manduca Sexta is a larva they are pests, and when they are adults they are not pests. Many insecticides utilize hormones, therefore it would be beneficial to know the effects of different hormones. A pesticide that hinders the Manduca Sexta from reaching its adult stage would not be beneficial because they would remain a pest. The hormone E20 regulates the timing of the molt as well as other adult functions. The hormone JH, produced in the corpus allatum, regulates the type of molt, in other words, JH maintains the Manduca Sexta’s larva state until it has developed enough to become an adult. Juvenile Hormone is the focus of the experiment. Juvenile Hormone is kept relatively constant in the Manduca Sexta throughout its life as a larva. When there is a decline in Juvenile Hormone the caterpillar is triggered to begin metamorphosis and begins to take on adult traits [Johnson: 2019]. The hypothesis is that if one adds precor (methoprene, a juvenile hormone) to the Manduca Sexta’s food source the Manduca Sexta will grow slower, and will not be able to grow to the adult stage.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment had two groups of caterpillars with four caterpillars in each group. The experiment began with the measuring of the initial mass of each caterpillar, and the assignment of container and number of each caterpillar. Each caterpillar in the control group was given 10 grams of food mixed with water. Two control caterpillars received four drops of water in their food, and two caterpillars received eight drops of water in their food. Each caterpillar in the variable group was given precor mixed with 10 grams of food. Two caterpillars in the experimental group were given four drops of precor in their food, and the other two caterpillars were given eight drops of precor in their food. The experiment ran over the course of 2 weeks, and the food supply was replenished whenever necessary (usually every time the caterpillars were massed). The caterpillars were stored in individual containers in a temperature regulated fridge, and the caterpillars were continually fed and weighed. For the analysis of the results a two sample T-test was utilized. The growth of the caterpillar would be the dependent variable, the amount of precor in the food would be the independent variable, and the group of caterpillars given only food and water would be the control. 

Results:
During the experiment the Manduca Sexta from both the control group and the experimental group grew at relatively the same rate. If you look at figure one and two on day five and six the caterpillars that were given precor appeared to be growing slower, but on day seven they began to grow faster than the control group. There was no significant difference in average growth. The average growth for the caterpillars that received four drops of water with their food was 4.7 grams and the average growth of the caterpillar that received four drops of precor was 4.6 grams. The average growth of the caterpillars that received eight drops of water with their food was 5.7 grams, and the average growth of the caterpillars that received eight drops of precor was 5.1 grams. In both conditions the average growth was not significantly different. The Manduca Sexta that received precor did appear to move in a more sluggish manner than the control group, and the experimental group had a slightly lighter green color. The mean of the control group was not significantly different than the mean of the experimental group meaning the null hypothesis was rejected (Group that received 4 drops of assigned liquid: t-value: 0.280345, df: 16, Two Tailed p-value: 0.782) (Groups that received 8 drops of assigned liquid: t-value: 0.016412, df: 16, Two Tailed p-value: 0.98). Standard Deviation: 4 drop control- 5.72, 4 drop variable- 6.186, 8 drop control- 6.0694, 8 drop variable- 6.03.

Discussion:
	In conclusion, the experiment did not support the hypothesis which was that if one adds Juvenile Hormone to the Manduca Sexta’s food then they will not grow as fast and they will not reach the adult phase of their life. There was an inability to determine whether the Manduca Sexta would reach the adult part of its life because the experiment was ended before the caterpillars could reach their final instar. The control group didn’t even reach their adult stage. Also, the growth of the experimental group was not significantly different than the growth of the control group, which is evident in figure 1, 2, and their insignificant p-values. This means that there was no effect on the caterpillars growth due to adding precor to their diet. This could be due to the fact that the Juvenile hormone is kept constant until the larva is ready to molt to their adult form, when JH levels drop that is when the larva is signaled to begin metamorphosis [Nijhout: 1975]. There is no correlation between growth and increased Juvenile Hormone [Johnson: 2019]. Juvenile Hormones determine the type of molt and whether or not to trigger metamorphosis. When given Juvenile hormone it merely delays or stops metamorphosis [Safranek: 1980]. This fact would support part of the hypothesis, that the Manduca Sexta would not reach the adult phase when given Juvenile hormone, but there is no way to tell from the results. The next step one would take in this experiment would be to run the experiment again, but this time allow for enough time to pass for the caterpillars to reach their final instar where they would molt. One would also want to find a hormone that could possibly cause the growth of the Manduca Sexta to slow, possibly E20 because this controls the timing of the molt not the type of molt. Overall, the hypothesis was rejected, and the mean of the control group was not significantly different than the mean of our experimental group meaning the null hypothesis was rejected.
