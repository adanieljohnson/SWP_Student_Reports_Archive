Title:  The Effects of Salinity on Photosystem II Activity in Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts

Abstract:
    In this experiment, we analyzed photosystem II activity in Spinacia oleracea (spinach) chloroplasts in solutions of varying salinities. We hypothesized that photosystem II activity would be inhibited most in high salinity samples due to photosystem II’s role in cleaving water. We predicted that salt-concentrated (hypertonic) solutions would have fewer water molecules available for photosystem II to split and generate electrons from, resulting in reduced photosynthetic activity. Using centrifugation to obtain an enriched spinach chloroplast sample, we then measured overall absorbance of the chloroplasts in solutions of no salinity, moderate salinity, and high salinity with a spectrophotometer. 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), a redox dye, was added to all samples to measure absorbance. Lower absorbance correlated to higher photosynthesis rates, whereas higher absorbance correlated to lower photosynthesis rates. Our findings were statistically significant (f-ratio=14.06, df=2, p-value=0.03), confirming our hypothesis. The moderate salinity sample (0.3M NaCl) displayed both lower absorbance and less color, indicating electron gain and higher photosynthetic activity. The high salinity sample (0.8M NaCl) had higher absorbance and remained blue, suggesting reduced photosynthet

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar molecules for energy and/or storage. Chloroplasts, containing the chlorophyll needed to capture sunlight, are the driving force of photosynthesis [Alberts: 2014]. This process has multiple steps; in fact, the combined actions of both photosystem I and photosystem II must occur for successful photosynthesis. There are three main stages to photosynthesis [Photosynthesis: 2019]. The first two stages are known as the light-dependent reactions. Light-dependent reactions utilize absorbed photons to produce NADPH, responsible for powering reduction reactions in plants. These reactions also form the proton gradient crucial for ATP synthesis. The light-independent reactions utilize the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions to reduce carbon dioxide to make glucose. In this experiment, we specifically analyzed light-dependent reactions, which rely on the efforts of both Photosystems I and II. Both photosystems are found in the thylakoid membrane and assist in absorbing and transferring light energy. Although both photosystems are crucial, photosystem II was our focal point in this lab. Photosystem II cleaves water, releasing oxygen as a byproduct, and excites chlorophyll to make ATP. Because photosystem II replenishes lost electrons by cleaving water, it is responsible for transferring electrons to photosystem I to fully complete photosynthesis. Without this movement of electrons, photosynthesis would not be possible  [Alberts: 2014]. 
We examined photosystem II reduction activity of chloroplasts in varying salinities. Using Spinacia oleracea (spinach) chloroplasts as the method of study, we sought to determine whether manipulating environment by increasing salinity levels would inhibit or completely stop photosynthetic activity. According to previous research, salt stress led to changes in PSII efficiency in Spirulina platensis (spirulina) cells, reducing overall oxygen activity and electron transport [Lu: 2002]. Based on this research, we hypothesized that increasing the salinity of the solutions added to the chloroplasts would decrease photosystem II activity, and thus increase absorbance, due to our knowledge that the splitting of water occurs at photosystem II. In hypertonic solutions (salt solution in this case), water diffuses out of the plant cell, limiting the amount of water molecules available for photosystem II. Thus, because there would be less water available to photosystem II to split and generate electrons from, fewer electrons would be transferred to the transport chain, and the protons needed to help establish the proton gradient would be limited, impairing the photosynthetic process [Hypertonic and Hypotonic Environments: 2019].


Materials and Methods:
We began this lab by determining the reagents necessary to complete this experiment (Table 1). After planning, we packed a chilled mortar with a handful of de-veined Spinacia oleracea leaves. Adding 10 mL of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), we ground the spinach to paste. We then incorporated 10 additional mL of grinding buffer, and subsequently strained the spinach slurry with cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. We then transferred 200 microliters of this mixture into a microtubule and chilled it. We put the leftover mixture into a cold 50 mL centrifuge tube and then used the centrifuge to spin it at 200xG for approximately 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius (“Sample A”). Following this first centrifugation, we poured the supernatant into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube, leaving the pellet of debris at the bottom untouched (“Sample B”). We extracted 200 microliters from the supernatant in the new 50 mL tube and put it in a microtubule of ice. Following this step, we centrifuged the “Sample B” 50 mL tube containing the chloroplast suspension at 1,000xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After this centrifugation, we poured the supernatant out of the 50 mL centrifuge tube and added 20 mL of grinding buffer to the pellet at the bottom. This last sample (“Sample B pellet”) was the chloroplast sample selected for analyzing photosystem II activity due to its higher chloroplast density and lower amount of debris (as instructed by our TA). We then prepared 3 replicates of the following reaction mixes (Table 2), adding 100 microliters of the enriched chloroplasts from “Sample B pellet” to each test tube. The test tubes were placed under a light source with an intensity of approximately 1781.81 lux. We also added 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) and reaction buffer to each tube (only excluding DCIP from the blank test tube). Because we intended to subject our sample to varying saline solutions (control, moderate, and high), we diluted the 2M NaCL stock solution to prepare 25 mL of 0.3M NaCl solution (3.75 mL of 2M NaCl and 21.25 mL of distilled water) and 25 mL of 0.8M NaCl solution (10 mL of 2M NaCl and 15 mL of distilled water), adding these salt solutions to their designated test tubes. We then measured the absorbance of all the samples at 600 nm (time zero), and did this two more times at ten minute intervals (10 minutes, 20 minutes). Using the formula “[(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%”, we then calculated the “% Change” in absorbance at 10 and 20 minutes. We used an ANOVA test to determine the significance of our results.


Results:
Our results show the relation between varying salinity levels and time (in minutes) on chloroplast absorbance (in nanometers). Absorbances were measured for 20 total minutes in 10 minute intervals. The graph displays the percent change in absorbance over the 20 minute time period. The percent change in absorbance shows the overall rate of photosynthetic activity. Thus, the greater the percent change in absorbance, the greater the change in photosynthetic activity. According to our graph, change in absorbance varied most from the chloroplasts in 0.3M NaCl solution between 10 and 20 minutes (Figure 1). Conversely, there was little fluctuation in the percent change in absorbance of both water and the 0.8M NaCl solution. The data obtained was used in an ANOVA test with two degrees of freedom, which resulted in an f-ratio of 14.06 and p-value of 0.03. A Tukey-Kramer test further confirmed that the difference between the control and experimental groups was significant. 

Discussion:
The alternative hypothesis was supported due to our statistically significant results. The  null hypothesis was rejected. Increased photosystem II activity correlated with decreased absorbance. As predicted, the 0.3M NaCl chloroplasts showed the lowest absorbance and thus the highest photosystem II activity. The 0.8M NaCl showed the highest absorbance and the lowest photosystem II activity. We measured absorbance through the addition of DCIP, which is commonly used as a redox dye. When reduced, or when electrons are gained, DCIPH2 is colorless [Henriques: 2004]. When oxidized, or when electrons are lost, DCIP is blue [Johnson: 2018]. Because photosystem II splits water molecules and releases oxygen, we believed DCIP would be colorless in the 0.3M NaCl solution because photosystem II activity would be less affected and thus the reduction reaction would be able to occur. The colorless nature of the solution would result in lower absorbance readings. As we expected, the 0.3M NaCl samples contained less color, indicating electron gain and higher photosynthetic activity. The 0.8M NaCl samples remained more blue, hinting at lower overall activity. As shown, increasing salt deters photosystem II activity. 
Our hypothesis did not clearly state the level of salinity that would impair photosynthetic activity, but our results do suggest that chloroplasts can operate under low to moderate salinity levels/ In fact, the results from our control sample of water exhibited almost identical absorbances to the 0.8M NaCl solution, suggesting that salt may not inhibit photosynthetic activity as much as we thought. This may be explained by the findings of previous studies. Research has found that spinach is a moderately salt-tolerant species. In past studies, spinach did not react as much to NaCl salt than other salt formations, and spinach growth was not impaired in 100 mM NaCl environments over a seventeen day time frame [Shannon: 1999]. Thus, we cannot operate under the assumption that saline environments would be always be highly detrimental to photosystem II activity. This journal also claimed that spinach has a high potassium requirement for overall growth (especially in high salinity environments). As underlined in this journal, it may be possible that potassium levels alter the sensitivity of spinach to salt solutions [Shannon: 1999]. Because we did not consider nor control for potassium levels within this experiment, we cannot claim that amount of potassium present altered photosystem II activity and/or photosynthetic rates, but potassium levels could be something to consider in further experiments for more conclusive results.
    Although we obtained statistically significant results, the likelihood of error is still probable. Possible errors include mixing up test tubes when adding the reagents, pipette errors, and not selecting the actual optimal chloroplast sample for performing this experiment. In the future, it would be interesting to examine chloroplast activity in even higher salinity samples to find the “cut-off” point for photosystem II activity in saline solutions. This could potentially illuminate the optimal environment for spinach growth, thereby increasing spinach production. In fact, experiments like these are essential for the success of the agricultural system. A variety of factors such as pH, salinity, temperature, and amount of light can seriously alter plant growth and livelihood, and without awareness of these potential risk factors, crop yield could be seriously diminished. To avoid produce shortage, agriculturists must be aware of the effects of these aspects to photosynthetic activity.
