Title: An Analysis of the Effects of Different Potting Environments on the Root to Shoot Ratios of  Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
The effects of different potting environments on Raphanus sativus growth was examined in order to investigate resource partitioning between roots and shoots. Fifteen radish seeds were planted in three different environments: soil, clay, and pebbles, and were placed in a greenhouse and watered each day for two weeks. It was hypothesized that the radishes growing in the soil would have the smallest root to shoot ratio because of their large access to resources in the roots and the resulting aim to grow up more through the shoots. The soil instead had the largest average root to shoot ratios for both weight and length with the values being .24 and 1.57, respectively. Clay had the smallest averages for both root to shoot ratios with values of .037 for weight and .36 for length. The ANOVA test run between the groups determined that there was a statistical difference between the groups.


Introduction:
In nature, plants of all species must determine how to allocate their resources depending on the environment in which they exist. Measuring a plant’s root to shoot ratio, or how many resources are being put into the leafy part of the plant above ground versus the roots growing below the ground, can give insight into what type of environment a plant is growing in and how the plant has grown and developed in order to adapt to certain resources that may be limited [Johnson: 2019]. Calculating a plant’s root to shoot ratio is also important in analytically assessing resource competition [Reynolds: 1993]. Raphanus sativus, a root vegetable known as a radishes are the perfect species to examine in order to gain more understanding about resource allocation in plants because they grow quickly and are responsive to their environment. Radishes do not need much care to grow and develop, but they are sensitive to water stress. Both a lack of water as well as an overabundance of water will produce a lower yield of plants [Wan: 2005]. The type of soil that the radishes are planted in can also affect how the grow and where they decide to invest more resources, the roots or shoots [Wan: 2005]. In this experiment, radish seeds were planted in three different environments: soil, clay, and pebbles to assess what conditions allow the plant to grow the most, or have the highest root to shoot ratio after a two week period. We hypothesize that the plants growing in the soil will have the lowest root to shoot ratio because they will have access to plenty of nutrients in the soil and will therefore allocate most of their resources to their shoots instead. On the other hand, the pebbles followed by the clay will have the highest root to shoot ratios because they will not have as much access to rich nutrients and will therefore have to allocate a lot of resources into the roots in order to reach any nutrients that are available. 


Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, fifteen pots were collected and filled with a variety of three different materials: soil, clay, and pebbles. There were five pots for each of the potting materials, and three Raphinus sativus, or radish seeds were planted in each pot. The pots were soaked with water and allowed to drain before being placed in the greenhouse. For two weeks, the plants were kept in the greenhouse and watered once a day. At the end of the two weeks, five radishes from each of the three experimental groups were harvested. The plants were gently washed to remove any material from the roots and pat dry. Each of the plants were weighed and the length was measured and this data was recorded. Finally, the plants were cut at the root-shoot junction and each root and shoot was weighed and measured and the data was recorded. The root-shoot ratios were calculated and this data was analyzed by taking the means and standard deviations for each experimental group. Finally, a one-way ANOVA was used to compare the means of the three groups and determine whether or not they were statistically different. 


Results:
The soil group had the greatest root to shoot ratios for both weight and length, 0.23(±0.19) and 1.56(±0.31), respectively (Table 1). The radishes grown in clay had the lowest root to shoot ratio for weight, 0.035(±0.023), and also for length, 0.34(±0.07). Finally, the plants grown in pebbles had a root to shoot ratio for weight of 0.67(±0.14) and of 1.0(±0.77) for length (see Table 1). These results show that the radish plants grown in soil grew the most above ground through the leaves and below ground through the roots. Meanwhile, the radishes grown in clay had the lowest overall growth (see Figure 1 and 2). A one-way ANOVA test was used to determine whether the three experimental groups were different from each other. There was a significent difference (P=0.011) in the mean root to shoot ratio for weight between the three groups (see Figure 1). Further tests indicated that the soil group had a significently greater root to shoot ratio than the other groups and no significent difference was indicated between any of the other sections. There was also a significent difference (P=0.0031) in the mean root to shoot ratio for length between the groups (see Figure 2). Once again, the soil group had a significently greater mean root to shoot ratio for length than the other groups, and no significent difference was indicated between the other sections.

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that the radishes growing in the soil would have the smallest root to shoot ratio because they had plenty of access to nutrients in the soil and therefore might have allocated more resources to growing up through the shoots than growing out the roots. However, the results indicate that the group of radishes that grew in the soil environment had the largest average root to shoot ratio for both weight and length. The radishes that grew in pebbles had the middle root to shoot ratios and the group that grew in the clay had the lowest average root to shoot ratios for both weight and height. The data does not support the hypothesis. Because all of the radishes had access to adequate sunlight the entire time they were in the greenhouse, none of the groups had any reason to allocate all or none of the resources to the shoots. But the potting materials did have varying amounts of nutrients, densities, and capacities to hold moisture which are all factors that affected the results of this experiment. The radishes that grew in the soil had access to plenty of nutrients, so the roots may have grown large and far in order to reach and use all of those resources. Meanwhile the plants that were in the clay pots maybe did not have any resources to waste on growing the roots because they did not have access to many nutrients in the first place. An error that occurred in this experiment was an inconsistency in watering the plants. Although all of the plants were meant to be watered every day for two weeks, there were a couple days throughout that span of time when the plants were not watered as they should have been. Without enough water to keep the soil moist, the plants may not have been able to grow as efficiently as possible which could have impacted the results [Wan: 2005]. The high density of the clay may have also had a negative impact on the plants’ abilities to grow out through the roots [Unger: 1994]. Being aware of these environmental impacts on plants is very important for planting crops and having a successful harvest. If the soil is too dense and compacted because it has been a dry season or in this case, when the plants were not watered frequently enough, it would helpful to use proper tilling method to turn over the soil so the roots are better able to push down through it [Unger: 1994]. This could have been especially effective in the clay pots which were extremely dense and compacted by the end of the two weeks. If this experiment were to be redone, planting more radish seeds in each individual pot in the beginning of the experiment may prove useful in getting more accurate results. Only three seeds were planted in each pot and while there were enough individual plants to collect data, the experiment would be more reliable if a larger group of individual plants were tested.
