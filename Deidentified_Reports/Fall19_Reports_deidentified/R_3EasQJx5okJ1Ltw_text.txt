Title: Hormone Regulation Experiment: Inserting Additional Juvenile Hormone Drops into the Manduca Sexta To See Effects on Growth and Development

Abstract:
abstract

Introduction:
This experiment involves the Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm.  This was a good insect to use for this experiment because their life cycles average 39-48 days which can be studied accurately, and they don’t grow to be too big for a lab setting.  They are mainly located in the US, Central America, and the Caribbean.  Tobacco hornworms experience a holometabolous life cycle which means they have four major life stages that include: an egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult [Johnson: 1016].  In the larvae stage, the tobacco hornworm has white striped markings that slant on the body, not to be confused with the tomato hornworm that creates a V- shape.  The larvae and adult to not look similar in holometabolous life cycle.  Female tobacco hornworms lay legs on Solanaceae family plants which ranges from pepper to tobacco [Goodman: 2001].    Tobacco hornworms begin as eggs and go through five instar larva phases before they enter the pupa phase, later into an adult.  Before the fifth larval instar, JH levels were high but drop very low and 20E goes through two small rises.  That second rise in 20E and drop in JH is called the commitment pulse which indicates the hornworms are large enough and has enough stored nutrients to enter the pupa stage and path to become an adult moth.  Two significent hormones that work in the tobacco hornworm is ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH).  Both of these hormones are necessary in the insect, or it will die. [Johnson: 2016].  This raised questions in our group about what would happen if we altered the level of one of the hormones.  Deciding to focus on the JH hormone, we wondered what would happen if we increased the level of JH in the tobacco hornworms.   In our experiment, we hypothesize that if treated with the Juvenile Hormone, the Manduca Sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the controll group of Manduca Sexta that receive no additional JH. 

The larvae phase is what is important to focus on because in society, this is the stage of the Manduca Sexta that attaches to a host plant.  It is important to study these pests because they cause defoliation in the crops they attach to.  These crops could be highly significent to the economy in the world today.  If the crops die, they cant be sold, which is throwing off many jobs and leaving consumers with fewer crops to choose from.  This would also mean the crops that don’t come out infected would have to be raised to a higher price.  


Materials and Method:
We conducted this experiment in a span of two weeks.  We read up on the tobacco hornworm to gain insight on the insect we were studying.  To set up the lab, we prepared a proper place for the eight tobacco hornworms to live by properly ventilating containers.  For this lab we had four hornworms in the treatment group and four in the controll.  All hornworms are fed 10 grams of food.  The food of the treatment group was soaked in 5 droplets of the JH hormone.  The controll group’s food was dropped with water in order to make the food wet enough to have them consume it.  The hornworms were divided between controll and treatment and stored in a refrigerator.  The independent variables in this experiment include the Juvenile Hormone treatment, dosage, and time.  The dependent variable is the growth (in this case weight) of the tobacco hornworms.  Every day for 14 days, we monitored and weighed the Manduca sexta.  Weight was recorded in a spreadsheet to keep track of results.  A key to remember in conducting this experiment was checking the food.  If it is dry it must be fully taken out and replaced because adding drops onto already concentrated food takes away from what we initially are measuring.  We stayed at a consistent measure of five drops of the JH supplement.  A statistical T- test was used.  Specifically, a one-tailed T test.  Another element to remember is that the caterpillars can be fragile.  When removing them for cleaning or feeding purposes, it is important to handle them with care so they don’t return to their habitat in an agitated state.  This could cause them to eat less and would take away from the experiment as we want every hornworm on an equal playing field.

Results:
For a majority of the experiment, the controll group of hornworms and the treatment group varied in their growth.  The controll group was significently growing more successfully than the tobacco hornworms consuming the JH supplement.  This showed not only in numbers, but physical appearance as well.  After the first week, the controll group showed vibrant colors and extreme mobility, while the treatment group showed the opposite. The controll group was a bright, vibrant blue and their movement was vast.  In the last 3 days of the experiment, the controll group dropped heavily in weight, losing 1-2 g a day approximately.  At the end of the experiment, the treatment hornworms weighed more than the controll hornworms.  The latter group, the treatment hornworms, had obvious discoloration and lacked energy and movement when observed.  The average growth of the controll group calculated at 4.992298333.  The average growth of the treatment group calculated to 5.285276667.  This data can be reviewed in Table 1.  Running the t_test (t_stat=0.160448, d.f.=28, P=0.43684) demonstrates that the data is statistically insignificent.  


Discussion:
The hypothesis has been rejected considering we predicted the controll group would weigh more than that of the treatment, when it turns out to be the opposite.  This could be attributed to multiple causes.  One, right before pupation, a hornworm stops eating and gets restless.  This comes with the process of preparing to undergo major changes. [Ward Science: 2008].  The larvae shrink up and are often mistaken to be dying, but this is pre-pupa preparation.  This could explain the loss of weight in the final 3 days for the controll group which would then in fact mean that the controll group is ahead of the treatment group in the growing process.  It also makes sense that the treatment hornworms blew up in size because this is the biggest they will get considering the JH supplement holds them back.

The results came out to be statistically insignificent meaning they are close together in results and would be likely to happen.  Science backs up this portrayal considering what larvae do to prepare for pupation.  Our group made an error when we didn’t take into consideration the controll group would face pre-pupa symptoms.

The larvae phases of the tobacco hornworm feed on various plants in gardens.  When they attach to plant sites, they have the ability to kill the plants they attach to in a matter of days.  Because they are big in size, they would be easy to flick away from plants rather than be so microscopic they can’t be seen.  It is important to study these pests to understand how to stop and controll them.  These pests need to be controllled because they have direct impacts on crops that are necessary to keep societal processes such as consumer-producer exchange.  Experiments show that inserting larger amounts of JH will make them move slower and weigh less but they do not die.  Inserting the JH supplement will cause them to be stuck in that larval instar phase without the proper supplies to pupate.
