Title: Effect of Water Saturation in Brassica Oleracea Leaves on Photosystem II Activity

Abstract:
This experiment investigated the effect of water saturation of Brassica Oleracea (cabbage) leaves on photosystem II activity. The group hypothesized that if the cabbage leaves were saturated with water, they would show less photosystem II activity than leaves that were not saturated with water. The group tested both saturated and unsaturated cabbage leaf solutions and quantitatively measured PS-II activity using the Hill Reaction, exposing both groups to light measured at 11302 lux for two 10-minute periods. The change in solution absorbance over the period of light exposure was calculated for both groups and a two-sample t-test was conducted to determine the significance of their difference. The differences in absorbance changes between the two groups were both found to be insignificant (t=0 to t=10 p-value = 0.753, t=10 to t=20 p-value = 0.278). When considering the potential effects of leaf saturation on the gas exchange process, the group postulated that the effects of leaf saturation on photosynthetic activity might be better represented by measuring Calvin cycle activity rather than PS-II activity. Future implications on the effects of leaf saturation could become more relevant as extreme precipitation events are expected to be more common in the face of climate change.

Introduction:
Plants rely on the light dependent reactions of photosystems I and II as well as the light independent reactions, known as the Calvin-Benson cycle, of photosynthesis to generate the usable form of chemical energy known as ATP in the form of Glucose. This three-step process relies on several factors, primarily the availability of carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight; as illustrated by the equation: 

6CO2 + 12H2O + Light Energy --&gt; C6H12O6 (Glucose) + 6O2 + 6H2O. 

While there has been considerable focus on the effects of plant dehydration, recent studies have also raised questions about the cost of leaf wetting and the saturation of leaves on the efficiency of photosynthesis. Results from a study suggest that leaf saturation could have potential consequences such as reduction of gas exchange in leaf stomata (Ishibashi & Terashima, 1995). More specifically, the reduced absorption of atmospheric CO2 through stomata as gas diffusion through leaf pores is slowed. This can be detrimental to the plant’s overall photosynthetic output, as CO2 is required to make glucose during the light-independent phase of photosynthesis. Results from similar studies have shown that oversaturation of plant leaves could also have a negative effect on the absorption of light photons, as excess water in and on the leaves gives it reflective properties, which may affect the overall quality or quantity of light received by the plant chlorophyll (Gates, 1968; Egri et al., 2010). Such effects have been observed in experiments on oversaturation of bean plants and other leafy plants, showing immediate and significant reductions in photosynthetic activity (Hanba et al., 2004).

	Many experiments have used the Hill Reaction as a technique of measuring photosynthetic activity. The Hill Reaction utilizes the production of oxygen from H2O in photosystem II by introducing an artificial electron acceptor, DCIP in this experiment. The DCIP solution is blue in color in its unreduced state but loses its color as it is reduced by hydrogen during oxygen formation. This allows for both a qualitative assessment (visual color loss) and the potential for quantitative assessment by measuring change in solution absorbance before and after light exposure using a spectrophotometer (Sauer and Park, 1965).

	This experiment investigates the effects of leaf saturation in Brassica Oleracea (cabbage) leaves. This organism was selected for study for its structure, as the majority of its chlorophyll are located on its outer leaves, and its activity was expected to mimic that of spinach leaves in previous experiments. The group hypothesized that if the Brassica Oleracea leaves were saturated with water, they would show less photosystem II activity than leaves that were not saturated with excess water. The independent variable of this experiment is cabbage leaf water saturation, the dependent variable of the experiment is the difference in PS-II activity of the saturated cabbage leaf solution as indicated by the Hill Reaction assay.


Materials and Methods:
The group began the experiment by making two sample solutions, one solution contained cabbage leaves that had been saturated in a water solution for 10 minutes (experimental group) and one containing regular cabbage leaves as a reference. To make the solutions, the group used a chilled mortar and pestle to grind the cabbage leaves into a paste, adding 25mL of grinding buffer. The paste was then strained through a three-layered cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. 200 microliters of this solution were transferred into a microtube, put on ice, and labeled as “Sample A.” The solutions were then transferred into a centrifuge tube and spun at 1,200rpm for 3 minutes to separate debris in the solution. The solution was then transferred into another tube, leaving behind pellet in the centrifuge. 200 microliters of this solution were transferred into another microtube labeled “Sample B.” The solution was then centrifuged again at 2,800 for 10 minutes. The group collected a 200-microliter sample of the new “Solution C” and 200 microliters of solution containing the leftover pellet from the centrifugation of sample B combined with 20mL of grinding buffer (labeled “Sample B-Pellet”). Samples A and B-Pellet were then analyzed for the presence of chloroplasts under a hemocytometer. 
The second part of the experiment involved measuring and comparing the Photosystem II (PS-II) activity of the two groups. The group created triplicate assays for each group (refer to Table 1 for more information regarding assay contents), with the exception of the blank solution. The initial absorbances of these solutions were measured and recorded at 600nm using a spectrophotometer. The solutions were allowed to sit under a lamp measured at 11302 lux for two ten-minute periods. The absorbances were recorded after 10 minutes and 20 minutes and measured for percentage change in absorbance. Finally, the absorbance rates were graphed and compared between the saturated and unsaturated groups using a two-sample t-test to determine the significance of their difference. The group selected the two tailed two-sample t-test because the experiment required a comparison between the averages of two sample group to determine if they were significantly different from each other.


Results:
When analyzing the concentration of chloroplasts in each solution under the hemocytometer, the group observed no large debris and very low amounts of small debris in both the saturated and unsaturated cabbage solutions. Based observations by the four members, it was determined that the B-Pellet solutions of both the saturated and unsaturated solutions posessed the highest concentration of chloroplasts. It is worth noting that the group observed a higher concentration of chloroplasts in the unsaturated B-Pellet solution than the saturated B-Pellet solution. Because of their relatively high concentrations of chloroplasts, the B-Pellet solutions were used in the Hill reaction assays. 
	Contrary to the group’s hypothesis, there was no significant difference in the PS-II activities of the saturated and unsaturated cabbage solutions. The group observed a decrease in the absorption of all the solutions from zero light exposure to 20 minutes of light exposure, as shown in figure 1. The saturated and unsaturated solutions maintained similar absorbances between the initial recording with zero light exposure and after 10 minutes of light exposure However, after 20 minutes of light exposure, the absorbance readings in the group of saturated solutions yielded an outlier that was significantly lower in absorbance than the other two readings, resulting in a significant decrease in the average percentage change in absorbance of the saturated solution group (represented numerically in Table 1). The effects of this outlier are visually represented in figure 1. The p-values obtained from the two-sample t-tests during this experiment (represented in Table 2) were all greater than 0.05 and were therefore considered to be insignificant.


Discussion:
There was no evidence of decreased photosynthetic efficiency in the saturated cabbage solution in the group’s results. Although the group did observe a relatively high decrease in the average change in absorbance calculation of the saturated solution, it was speculated that the decrease was exaggerated by an outlier spectrophotometer reading after the second 10-minute exposure period, which was significantly lower than the other five readings (including both the saturated and unsaturated solutions). This outlier could be attributed to unequal light exposure amongst the seven solutions. If one solution were to have more direct light exposure, that solution might have more reduction activity than the other solutions, causing the DCIP to lose its color and have a lower absorbance as result.

Based on our results, it could be concluded that water saturation in cabbage leaves does not have a significant effect on PS-II activity. However, it would not be appropriate to draw the same conclusion for all types of plant leaves. Some experiments, when testing the effects of leaf saturation on photosynthetic activity, have observed a reduction in photosynthesis activity in organisms such as the bean plant (Hanba et al., 2004), which has a leaf structure that is similar to those of spinach and cabbage as far as the organization of chloroplasts is concerned. However, these effects have not been observed in some other plants such as the pea plant (Goldsmith et al., 2017a). It is worth noting that our methods of measuring photosynthetic activity were limited to evidence provided by the Hill reaction, which provides a PS-II activity measurement based on the passage of electrons to alternative receptors by water molecules. While this is a useful and relatively accurate measurement of photosynthesis, it does not shine any light on the potential effects of leaf saturation on light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. This is important because many of the potential effects of saturating plant leaves would be observed in the gas exchange processes that occur in the light independent stages of photosynthesis. This includes the joining of carbon dioxide molecules with ribulose phosphate to create glucose. Considering that the light independent stages of photosynthesis occur after the light dependent stages measured by the Hill reaction, the effects of cabbage leaf saturation on photosynthesis might be better represented by measuring the activity of the Calvin Benson cycle using enzyme-based assays that measure the production of 6-Carbon Glucose molecules. Other experiments investigating the effects of leaf wetting and saturation have used more direct measurements of gas exchange, often using gas‐exchange systems such as the Li‐6400 as seen in (Hanba et al., 2004) and obtained more significant results. 
	
	An improved understanding of the effects of plant leaf saturation in experimental settings could provide insight on the effects of leaf saturation on a larger scale and a greater knowledge of how some plants are likely to respond to high rainfall/humidity conditions. This understanding could become increasingly important as more variation in rainfall patterns is predicted in the face of climate change, with extreme precipitation events becoming more common in a warmer world (IPCC, 2013). An increased awareness of the effects of leaf wetting could also allow farmers and others in the agriculture industry to develop plans to temper the potential effects of high intensity rainfall on crop yield.

Figure 1: Average percentage change in absorbance from zero light exposure to 20 minutes of light exposure measured at 11302 lux. Water saturated cabbage solutions (blue bars) showed a trend similar to that of the unsaturated cabbage solutions (orange bars) from t=0 to t=10. At 20 minutes a large decrease can be observed in the average absorbance of the saturated solution (an outlier is included in this average). The control solutions (grey bars) contained no chloroplasts and were not expected to experience a change in absorbance as a response to light. Each group is an average of the data obtained from three sample solutions.
