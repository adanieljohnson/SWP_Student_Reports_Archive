Title: Temperature Does Not Influence Aggressive Behavior in Male Betta Fish

Abstract:
Through the process of intrasexual selection, male organisms may compete with one another for access to a mate. For the Betta splendens (Betta fish) this competition involves the performance of specific agonistic behaviors. We hypothesized that if male Betta splendens (Betta fish) are acclimated to warm water, they would behave more aggressively in the presence of another male beta fish. To test this, we quantified the total number of aggressive behaviors displayed by a male Betta fish in the presence of another male Betta fish. This was done at two different water temperatures, 19°C and 21°C.  The control group was tested at 19 °C and the average number of aggressive displays performed by the male Betta fish was 17.75 ± 1.5 (Fig 1). The experimental group was tested at 21°C, and we found an average of 18.5 ± 4.2 aggressive displays per trial. The number of aggressive displays exhibited by the selected fish varied more widely in the experimental group, as shown by the standard deviation of ± 4.2. 
We found no statistically significant difference in the average number of aggressive behaviors performed at each temperature (p-value = 0.3741). The average number of aggressive behaviors was higher than initially predicted. This may be because fish cannot regulate their internal body t

Introduction:
Through the process of intrasexual selection, certain behaviors and features will increase the ability of an organism to compete for access to a mate. One such way an organism might improve their reproductive success is through the performance of agonistic behaviors toward competitors. This refers to aggressive behavior and occurs frequently between males of the same species when fighting for access to a female [Sadava: 2016]. An example of this male-male competition is the agonistic behavior of male bighorn sheep, who fight for access to a female through head butting [Miller: 2014]. Such competition is found throughout the animal kingdom.
Agonistic behaviors can be influenced by multiple environmental factors, such as sex ratios in a particular habitat or the availability of resources. Temperature can also have an effect on animal aggression. For example, researchers found that Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum (convict cichlid fish) behaved more aggressively in 30°C water as opposed to 26°C water. Scientists concluded that this change in behavior occurred because convict cichlids establish a territory and reproduce at warm temperatures [Ratnasabapathi: 1992].
Betta splendens (Betta fish) also participate in intrasexual, male-male competition through agonistic displays. This may include front facing or broadside behaviors. Front facing behaviors include holding the pectoral fins erect, spreading the opercula, and expanding the branchiostegal membranes into a “red mane.” Broadside behaviors include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2019]. The species is native to Southeast Asia and prefers water temperatures of about 25.5 °C – 26.5 °C [Tropical Fish Care Guides]. 
Betta splendens are an ideal organism for studying intrasexual male-male competition because they are extremely aggressive, easy to care for, and readily available as they are popular aquarium fish. In addition, because they are so outwardly aggressive, it is easier to identify and quantify agonistic behaviors. We predicted that if male Betta splendens (Betta fish) are acclimated to warm water, they would behave more aggressively in the presence of another male beta fish.


Materials and Methods:
We first obtained two male Betta fish of approximately equal size and placed this in a fish tank separated into two compartments by both an opaque divider and a glass divider. The water in the tank was 19 °C. 
For the first trial the opaque divider between the two compartments of the tank was removed leaving only glass. Prior to beginning the experiment, we decided which fish would be used to quantify aggressive behavior. The same fish was used for every trial at this water temperature. The fish were allowed to interact through the glass for three minutes before the opaque divider was replaced. During that time the number of times the selected Betta fish performed the following aggressive behaviors: pectoral fins erect, spreading the opercula, expanding the branchiostegal membranes into a “red mane,” pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. These values were summed to determine the total number of agonistic behaviors displayed within the three-minute time frame by the selected male Betta fish. After three minutes, the opaque divider was replaced, and the fish were allowed to rest. This trial was performed eight times.
During the second stage of the experiment, one Betta fish was acclimated to 21 °C water and placed in the furthermost compartment of the warm tank. Another male Betta fish was placed in the last compartment of a tank containing 19°C water. The two tanks were placed end to end and an opaque divider was placed between them. This was done so that when the divider was moved, the fish could see each other, despite being in different tanks. During this stage of the experiment the warm water fish was used to quantify aggressive behavior. To begin the trial, the opaque divider would be removed so that the fish could see each other, and they were allowed to interact for three minutes. During this time, we recorded the number of times the warm fish performed the same six aggressive behaviors listed above. This number was totaled, and after 3 minutes the opaque divider was replaced. The fish were allowed to rest for five minutes. This trial was performed four times. 
After performing eight trials in total, the average number of aggressive behaviors per trial was calculated for both the 19°C condition and the 21°C conditions respectively. These means were then compared using a two-sample, two-tailed T-test. 


Results:
During the experiment we observed several differences in the level of aggression for our three Betta fish. For the four control trials performed in this experiment, one fish was overly aggressive and was used to count aggressive behaviors. However, the other fish was fairly submissive as it often swam away from the glass or remained motionless. In contrast, during the experimental trials we observed that both fish were fairly aggressive and performed multiple different aggressive behaviors.  

For the control group, the average number of aggressive displays performed by the male Betta fish was 17.75 ± 1.5 (Fig 1). For the experimental group, we found an average of 18.5 ± 4.2 aggressive displays per trial. The number of aggressive displays exhibited by the selected fish varied more widely in the experimental group, as shown by the standard deviation of ± 4.2. 
These averages were compared with a two-sample, two-tailed T-test, resulting in a p-value of 0.3741 (df 6, T-stat 0.3361, P 0.3741).


Discussion:
The data collected did not confirm our initial hypothesis. The p-value determined in our two-sample, two-tailed T-test was greater than 0.05, therefore our results were not statistically significant. There are several possible explanations for this result. The first is that the experimental design was flawed. Both temperatures used in the experiment were below the preferred 26 °C for Betta fish aquariums. It is possible that 21 °C was not a high enough temperature to produce a quantifiable change in behavior. In addition, the difference between the two temperatures may have been too small to produce different responses in each condition. 
There is also a possible biological explanation for these results. In one study scientist found that during an encounter with a male of the same species, the Agama savignyi and A. pallida lizards were more likely to flee. Whereas at lower temperatures, the lizards tended to perform more stationary, aggressive behaviors. Both the lizards used in this experiment and Betta fish are ectotherms, meaning they are unable to regulate internal temperature meaning they are dependent on external sources for body heat. At cold temperatures, these animals are more likely to remain stationary to conserve energy. Therefore, when the two male lizards interacted at lower temperatures, they tended to remain in place and perform relatively stationary aggressive behaviors, such as biting. These behaviors required less energy expenditure than fleeing the confrontation. However, in a warmer environment, the lizards’ body temperatures were higher, so they did not need to conserve energy and were able to run away [Hertz: 1982]. To determine if the same biological mechanism occurs in beta fish, we would need to repeat our experiment, but in a larger tank so that the Betta fish have room to flee. 
Understanding the role different environmental factors play in animal aggression is important. As global temperatures continue to rise this will impact thermoregulation and metabolism in ectotherms. This in turn, may have implications on their agonistic behaviors, intrasexual selection, and overall reproductive success.
