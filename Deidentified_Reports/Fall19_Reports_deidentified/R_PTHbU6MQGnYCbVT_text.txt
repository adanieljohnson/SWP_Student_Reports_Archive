Title: The Effects of Inhibiting 20E Hormone in Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
none

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect commonly known as the tobacco hornworm.  They are prevalent in much of North America, and are known to infest gardens, eating tomatoes, tobacco, and other crops in their caterpillar/larval phases.  For this reason, the Manduca sexta has been deemed a pest and a threat to agricultural production and the environment as a whole.  Many farmers have adopted the use of pesticides in an effort to protect their crops from the caterpillars.  Thus, it is worth investigating the effectiveness of different pesticides.  In this experiment, we will be treating the caterpillars with a pesticide that blocks/inhibits the hormone 20E.  Following the holometabolous life cycle, the Manduca sexta undergoes complete metamorphosis, and develops as such: from eggs, first through fifth instar larva, pupa, to finally an adult moth.  This process takes about 39 to 48 days.  In addition, Manduca sexta undergo 4 molts between the instar larval stages before pupating [Nijhout: 1975].  The Manduca sexta relies on the hormones 20E and juvenile hormone to properly develop from a larva, to a pupa, to an adult moth [Kingsolver: 2007].  In this experiment, the caterpillars will be treated with a pesticide that blocks or inhibits 20E.  Because we know that 20E plays a key role in proper development of Manduca sexta, we hypothesize that inhibiting 20E will delay their growth.

Materials and Methods:
We began with 8 Manduca sexta in the early instar/larval phases.  We then split them into two groups of four, one group being the control group, and the other would receive the 20E inhibitor.  For the experimental group, we dropped five drops of the pesticide into their food and mixed it thoroughly (using a dropper pipet and spoons).  For the control, we used drops of water instead.  Each group was given 10 grams of food.  We kept our caterpillars in a controlled environment to minimize confounding variables.  This included plastic containers with holes for breathing, and storing them in an incubator with constant exposure to artificial light and a controlled temperature.  In order to track growth, we massed the caterpillars everyday for seven days and recorded it.  Waste product from the caterpillars was removed everyday to ensure a healthy environment.  Food was changed every 2-3 days to avoid it drying up and becoming inedible.  The caterpillars were handled using latex gloves for sanitation purposes.  It is also worth noting that we were able to do the entire experiment twice for a total of two trials, both lasting seven days.  Additionally, we used t-tests to determine whether or not our data was statistically significant.

Results:
In both of our trials, our control group’s growth followed a positive, linear trend, while growth for our experimental group appears to model a slope close to zero (fig 1 and 3).  The experimental caterpillars’ masses, though they increased a small amount, ultimately decreased right before their deaths.  For instance, in Figure 2, the average mass initially increased from day 1 to day 2 by 0.07 grams.  Later on between days 5 and 6, however, the caterpillars experienced on average a decrease in mass of 0.048 grams.  They all died the following day.  This gave a net negative difference between their starting masses and their ending masses.  On the other hand, none of the control groups’ caterpillars died throughout either of our trials.  Not only did we see a physical difference in the caterpillars’ body sizes, our data also indicated regular growth.  This can be seen by the total difference in mass for trial two’s control group being 7.61 grams (fig 4).  Additionally, our p-values indicate that our data is statistically significant because they are both below 0.05.      


Discussion:
Our results support our hypothesis because our data is statistically significant.  Our control groups grew normally while growth was hindered in our experimental groups, which can be seen in Figures 1 and 3.  Therefore, we can conclude that inhibiting 20E hormone in Manduca sexta indeed delays growth.  However, because we also observed that both experimental groups died within seven days of each trial, there is a larger investigation regarding the need for 20E for survival.  It is well known by the physiology community that Juvenile Hormone and 20E are essential for proper development in Manduca sexta.  They rely on 20E for orchestrating larval and metamorphic molting, while they rely on specific concentrations of Juvenile Hormone for determining whether the molt is larval or metamorphic [Ishimoto: 2010].  If the goal is to use the 20E inhibitor as a pesticide, it can be concluded that 20E is effective in delaying the insect’s growth, and therefore the overall impact the insect has on its food source: a farmer’s crops, for instance.  It is also apparent in our experiment that 20E inhibitor killed our caterpillars within seven days.  However, it should be inquired if seven days is indeed the standard timeline for the pesticide to work.  Because 20E and Juvenile Hormone work together to ensure proper development, perhaps the same experiment should be performed with a pesticide that blocks Juvenile Hormone.  It is worth exploring which hormone inhibitor, 20E or Juvenile Hormone, is more effective as a pesticide so that the agricultural industry and environment as a whole can be protected from the crop-eating Manduca sexta.
