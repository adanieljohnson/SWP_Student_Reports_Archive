Title: Effects of 20E Blocker AzaGuard on the Life Cycle on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
NA

Introduction:
Farmers and gardeners continually struggle with pest destruction of their produce. Common groups of insect pests include beetles, flies, bugs, aphids, moths, butterflies, grasshoppers, and crickets [Capinera: 2001]. For example, Manduca sexta is a moth well-known to gardeners and farmers. It is most commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm or the Carolina Sphinx Moth. This organism feeds on tomatoes and tobacco, and it consumes entire leaves and often the green fruit itself. At the beginning of the life cycle, Manduca sexta eats less, resulting in less destruction of the plant. As the caterpillar form of the moth proceeds through its life cycle, it eats increasing amounts of plant material and has been shown to consume 90% of its intake in the final instar phase [Capinera: 2001]. Given the rise in plant consumption late in the organism’s developmental cycle, it would be advantageous to interrupt the moth growth cycle before the final instar phase. The life cycle of this organism ranges from 39-48 days and the stages of its life cycle are referred to as 1st Instar Larva, 2nd Instar Larva, 3rd Instar Larva, 4th Instar Larva, 5th Instar Larva, Pupa, and Adult Moth [Johnson: 2019]. To proceed from one stage to the next, the caterpillar moves through a molting process in which the old layer sheds and a new outer layer is produced. The life cycle of Manduca sexta is predominantly regulated by the hormones juvenile hormone (J.H.) and ecdysterone (20E). Juvenile hormone is produced by the insect endocrine gland corpus allatum. The main function of the hormone is to regulate the type of molt of the caterpillar. Ecdysterone is an endocrine hormone that is secreted by the prothoracic glands. The main function of this hormone is the regulation of the timing of molting. The concentration ratio of these two hormones is important in the development of the organism; manipulation of either hormone could result in major dysfunction within the organism's life cycle. [Johnson: 2019]. Ecdysterone plays an especially crucial role towards the end of Manduca sexta’s life cycle. Rises of ecdysterone indicate to the organism to molt into the final adult form before pupating. Studies have also shown that appropriate ecdysterone levels are critical in the development of the adult moth [Tublitz: 1997]. The mechanism of action of the insecticide AzaGuard is to interfere with the normal insect growth cycle. The insecticide functions as an ecdysterone blocker, preventing the production of ecdysterone by the prothoracic glands. If Manduca sexta larvae are treated with AzaGuard, they will have a shortened life cycle and exhibit a decrease in mass.


Materials and Method:
 The materials used for this experiment were the AzaGuard (1: 1250 concentration), 20 E blocker, Manduca sexta instar larva, caterpillar food, water, and 26.5°C Incubator. There were two groups of 4 caterpillars being tested. Group 1 was the controll group and Group 2 was the experimental group. Each group was placed into a four-section divided container, with 2 holes along the side for airflow. The caterpillars in Group 1 were given 8 drops of water onto 10 grams of food daily for 2 weeks. The caterpillars in Group 2 were given 8 drops of AzaGuard onto 10 grams of food daily for 2 weeks. The food was checked and changed daily to maintain its moisture, as this was the only source of water intake for the caterpillars. The caterpillars remained in the incubator unless data was being collected. To monitor the progression through the life cycle of the organisms, photos of the caterpillars were taken each day. Furthermore, to monitor the physical aspects of the organism, the weight of each caterpillar was taken daily. At the end of the two weeks, the two groups’ data were compared. The average size of the caterpillars of each day was determined. A one-tailed two-sample t_test was conducted to determine significent differences between the two groups and P values were calculated to determine if the differences were actually because of the experiment or due to random chance.


Results:
The results of this experiment showed significently lower caterpillars mass in the experimental group with the ecdysterone blocker than those in the controll group (Figure 1). The statistical tests performed on the collected data concluded showed a significent difference between the experimental groups and controll groups and indicate that the results were due to aspects of the experiment rather than random chance (t-value= 3.89, p_value= 0.000352). 
As the graph depicts, the average mass of the controll caterpillar increased steadily throughout the two weeks, while the average mass of the experimental caterpillar failed to progress beyond the onset of the experiment. In the controll group, one caterpillar died on day thirteen, while the rest of the organisms survived the entire experiment. In the experimental groups, one caterpillar died on day nine, two caterpillars died on day ten, and one caterpillar died on day eleven. The data gathered for the experimental group was terminated on day eleven as all four caterpillars had died by that point. 


Discussion:
Ultimately, the hypothesis was supported by the results of this experiment. The experiment demonstrated that when caterpillars are exposed to ecdysterone blocker AzaGuard that the organism does not progress through its life cycle, and the lack of molting and disruption of its growth cycle ultimately leads to the premature death of the caterpillars. The P-value supports the alternate hypothesis that adding 20 E Blocker will decrease and stop the growth of the caterpillars. Because the P-value was well below the acceptable range, the null hypothesis is rejected. In this experiment, it was demonstrated that the hormone ecdysterone is crucial to the survival of Manduca sexta. The caterpillars did not proceed throughout the stages of their life cycle due to the inhibitory action of the insecticide AzaGuard on ecdysterone. Because ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting in Manduca sexta, blockage of the hormone interfered with the onset of molting. Without the ecdysterone to regulate the timing of the molt, the transformations did not occur and the caterpillars did not develop beyond the beginning instar stage. Furthermore, the experimental caterpillars would not have progressed to the full adult stage and develop in the pupa, as the transition requires a substantial amount of ecdysterone to complete this process [Tublitz: 1997]. With the addition of Azaguard as an insecticide, Manduca sexta’s destructive impact on the health and yield of farm produce could be greatly reduced. This could potentially result in a higher yield of produce for farmers and gardeners. This same experiment could prove to be useful in other instances where interference in the insect life cycle would be beneficial. For instance, experiments on Bombyx mori, more commonly known as the silkworm, resulted in similar results as this experiment. In the study, the ecdysterone blocker was “extremely effective in producing pupal deformities and larval-growth inhibition in Bombyx mori”[Koul: 1987]. In the future, further studies could be developed in order to advance proficiency in this area of study. For example, studying how alteration of both J.H. and ecdysterone would affect the life cycle of Manduca sexta or the development of method to reduce the release of ecdysterone from the prothoracic glands through genetic modification of Manduca sexta in order to inhibit the growth of the insect without the use of pesticides. The knowledge that blocking ecdysterone results in the altering of the life cycle of multiple pests could be used to better create method of protecting produce in the future.
