Title: The Effect of Space on Vigna radiata Growth 

Abstract:
Knowing the effect of space on the growth could prove beneficial in determining how far apart to plant Mungbean (Vigna radiata) seeds in order to get the best growing Mungbean seedlings. In this study it was predicted that Mungbean seeds that were spaced out would have better survival rates and would have longer root lengths than those grown clumped together. In each of the six flowerpots, fifteen seeds were planted. In three of the pots all fifteen seeds were put in the same hole and in the other pots, three seeds were placed in five evenly spaced holes. After daily watering for two weeks, the six pots were compared and the survival percentage and root to shoot length ratio was compared between the two groups of Mungbean seeds. This study found that there was no statistical difference between the two groups’ survival rate and size after two weeks. Therefore, according to this study, the planting distance has no effect on how well a Mungbean seedling grows. 

Introduction:
The legume Mungbean (Vigna radiata) is a common food source throughout Southeast Asia and India. The sprout and the bean are used in many different dishes including pancakes, soups and stir-fries. More uses of Mungbean plants consist of being included in maize and wheat crop systems. When included in such systems, the overall crop yields have increased the water-use efficiency has improved [Parihar: 2017]. This study by Parihar et al. shows the importance of Mungbean plants around the world especially as the amount of world’s arable land decreases. With the constant increase of the global population, this decrease of global space could have an effect on the yield of the Mungbean crops around the world. Previous studies have shown that the planting distance between maize (Zea mays indurate) seeds has had a significant impact on its growth [Lihiang: 2017]. According to Lihiang et al., the greater the distance between the maize seeds and the fewer seeds planted in the same spot, the better the plant would grow as a result. This study will look to apply the concepts in Lihiang et al. to Mungbean plants to see how the Mungbean plant responds to a change in allotment of space. Therefore, the control group for this study will be the flowerpots that have the Mungbean seeds planted in one location and the experimental group consist of the Mungbean seeds in five evenly spaced holes. The hypothesis of this experiment is that the Mungbeans seedlings that are planted with more space between them will have less competition for root space and nutrients, therefore they will be more likely to survive and will have a bigger root to shoot ratio than the Mungbean seedlings that are planted clumped together. 

Materials and Methods:
Ninety seeds of Vigna radiata were soaked in water for thirty minutes before being planted. Six pots of vermiculite were prepared and labeled as group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Furthermore, groups 1-3 were labeled as “spaced” and group 4-6 as “clumped.” In each “clumped” flowerpot, one hole was dug in the center of the pot and fifteen seeds were place into the hole and covered. In the “spaced” pots, five holes were dug, one in the center and four at each corner. In each hole three seeds were placed and then covered. Each pot was then watered until saturated. All six pots of Vigna radiata were placed in a greenhouse. Each day for two weeks the pots were watered with 150 mL of tap water via a beaker. After two weeks the pots were removed from the greenhouse. The percent survival rate and the length root to shoot ratio was determined. The data was then recorded in the lab notebook. A two-sample t-test was then used to test the hypothesis and to see if it had any statistical validity. 

Results:
The survival rate of the Mungbean seedlings planted clumped together were 73.3% for Group 1, 93.3% for Group 2 and 80% for Group 3. The mean survival rate for the three pots of clumped Mungbean seedlings was 82.2%. For the Mungbean seedlings that were spaced out the survival rate was 73.3% for Group 4, 93.3% for Group 5 and 100% for Group 6. The mean survival rate for the spaced out Mungbean was therefore 88.9%. This data is shown in Table 1. The statistical test between the experimental and the control groups show that the t-stat = 0.76, the df = 4 and the P-value is 0.27. The length root to shoot ratio (R:S) was also calculated. Group 1 had a mean R:S of 0.79, while Group 2 had a R:S of 0.51 and Group 3’s R:S was 0.65. For the Mungbean seedlings planted in spaced out conditions, the R:S was 0.82 for Group 4, 0.65 for Group 5 and 0.74 for Group 6. This data is presented in Figure 1. The two-sample t-test for the R:S results was t-stat = 0.92, df = 4, P = 0.21. 

Discussion:
The goal of this experiment was to test the effect of space on the growth of Mungbean seedlings. The hypothesis of the study was that the seedlings that were given more space would survive at a higher rate, and they would have experienced more growth during the two week timeframe. This hypothesis was rejected since the survival percentage and the root to shoot ratio of the experimental group and the control group were indistinguishable. The statistical tests show no statistical differences between Mungbean seedlings that were planted clumped together and those that were spaced apart. Based on the results of this study, there is no consequence in planting Mungbean seeds close together as they will survive at the same rate and grow to be the same size as Mungbean seeds planted with space between them. This conclusion differs from that of similar studies. A previous study showed that more intra and inter-row spacing between Mungbean seeds does increase the overall size of the plant [Wubetu: 2018]. Thi1s discrepancy between out study and theirs could be due to the timeframe of the experiments. Our study was conducted over a two week time frame while Wubetu’s study lasted an entire growing season. Further studies will have to explore this issue to see if time has an effect on Mungbean seedlings planted in different spatial environments. Furthermore, a possible error within our experiment is that the flowerpots used were too small to provide an actual difference between our control and experimental groups. However, if further tests support our results then this could be a major breakthrough in how we plant Mungbean seeds in the future. If space does not inhibit the growth of Mungbeans then the decreasing amount of arable land in the world may have little to no affect as Mungbeans could be planted closer and closer together.
