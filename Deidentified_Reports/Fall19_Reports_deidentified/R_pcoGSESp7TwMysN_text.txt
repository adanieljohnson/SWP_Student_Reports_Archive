Title: Increasing the Temperature of the Water Causing No Change to the Amount of Agonistic Behaviors Displayed by Betta Splendins

Abstract:
The water temperature of a habitat of male Betta splendins was increased in order to understand the relationship between an altered environment and aggression levels of these Siamese fighting fish. We predicted that the agnostic behavior would increase with an increased water temperature due to the preference of mating during warmer temperatures, causing a heightened male-male competition and evoke more aggressive behavior. We had two males in each tank separated from each other with clear glass and placed opaque dividers between them during rest periods. Their aggressive actions were averaged over five trials. The relationship between these variables contributes to the study of ethology to understand the motivations and nature of different animal behavior. It is valuable to be able to predict how an individual may react in a specific environment. We can possibly gain insight of humans from understanding what causes animals specific behavior under different circumstances. The results, however, did not support our hypothesis, and our two sample t_test did not indicate any statistical significance. Our results seem to misalign with similar previous studies. We hypothesize we may have obtained desired results if we used the same male in both groups or increased the temperature more

Introduction:
There is an abundance of evolutionary, genetic, and psychological explanations of different animal behavior, as determined by ethology. Intraspecific behavior is how an individual interacts with a member of its own species. Betta splendins, more commonly referred to as Siamese fighting fish, are native to southeast Asia and found in various small bodies of sluggish freshwater and they have adaptive accessory labyrinth organ which allows them to extract oxygen from air and not rely on the quality of the water. This species of fish was used in our experiment because they display different colors and aggressive behaviors when in contact with other members of the species. Broadside movements, when turned to the side of another fish, and facing movements, when directed toward the opponent, are the two principle types of agnostic, or aggressive, intraspecific behavior of bettas. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements include erecting its pectoral fins, spreading its gill covers, and protruding its branchiostegal membranes, called the red mane.  [Johnson: 2016]. In this experiment we are attempting to understand potential factors that could cause an increase of displayed aggressive behavior in this organism. Aggressive behavior was quantified by amount, so an organism was said to be more aggressive if it displayed more instances of the list of behaviors. A similar study was conducted on fresh water fish Cichlasoma paranaese, or cichlid fish to determine their aggressive interactions in different temperatures of water. The experimenters concluded that the maximum aggressive occurred at 39C for isolated fish, and at 37C mortality increased within the group due to increased aggressive behaviors. This was determined by increasing the 1C each day and recording aggressive behaviors [Brandão: 2018]. This experiment can contribute to understanding the behavior of different organisms interacting with members of their own species with manipulated environmental aspects. It is valuable to be able to predict how organisms act and what causes them to do so. Due to the preference of Betta splendins to mate in higher temperature water, we hypothesized that the bettas will display more aggressive behavior in warmer water since it mimics their mating conditions and evoking the males to be more competitive and aggressive towards each other.


Materials and Method:
We observed fish betta aggression in two different temperatures. The independent variable was the water temperature and the dependent variable was the amount of aggression displayed. Our first tank contained one male fish in which we were observing the aggressive behavior which represented the controll group. The tank also contained another male fish that was used to instigate our target fish. The water of the controll group was 19C. The two bettas were not in direct contact with each other; we used a glass divider in between them and used an opaque divider in between each trial. We had five trials where the fish were able to see each other each for 3 minutes followed by a 5-minute rest period where they could not see each other to separate the trials. Aggressive behaviors were counted for 5 trials in both the controll and experimental group. For the experimental group, we used a different male that was acclimated at the slightly higher water temperature, 21C. Similarly to the controll group, we had one fish we observed the aggressive behaviors of and another still in cooler water that provoked aggressive behavior from the male we were watching and repeated the same steps as the controll group each trial. Each aggressive behavior was recorded and counted for each trial and averaged for a number of aggressive behaviors for both groups. We then conducted a two sample t_test to understand if there was a relationship between water temperature and displayed aggression of betta fish.


Results:
The results of our experiment reveal that there is not a relationship of an increased water temperature causing a greater amount of agnostic behavior in Betta splendins because there was no trend. The mean amount of aggressive behaviors per trial of the controll group was 17.75 +/- 1.30 and the mean of the experimental group was 18.50 +/- 3.64 (Figure 1). Our p_value was 0.37, demonstrating no statistical significance. Our degree of freedom was 6, and t_stat was .34.


Discussion:
The data we obtained from our experiment does not support our hypothesis. We originally predicted that increasing the temperature of the habitat of Betta splendins would increase their aggressive behavior. However, our results did not indicate a relationship between these two variables. The mean of the experimental group was less than one behavior different from the controll and the standard deviation reveals a significent overlap in the data. The p_value of the two sample t_test also validates the lack of statistical significance of our data. A similar study was conducted to understand the relationship between temperature and boldness of Betta splendins. Recording their latency to leave the release area, spending time in certain areas, and activity, was used to determine their “boldness level.” The findings determined that an increased temperature increased boldness [Forsatkar: 2016]. This relates to our study and determining whether increased temperatures changes the behavior of Siamese fighting fish. While aggression and boldness are different traits, they are similar in that they are greater animations than regular, unexcited behavior and can potentially be altered with a different environment. We could repeat our procedure with changes in attempt to determine whether there is a significent relationship between our two variables. Perhaps the male in the experimental group was generally less aggressive than the male of the controll group. We could repeat the experiment over a longer period of time to first use a male to observe in a normal temperature, wait for the same fish to be acclimated to warmer water, and then observe it in the warmer water. We actually noticed that the first male seemed more aggressive and active in the presence of another male compared to the experimental male. Using the same fish creates a more controllled experiment and reduces variables that could have skewed our data. We could also use different temperatures over a greater range because maybe we did not include a great enough change in water temperature. The laboratory setting also could impact the behavior of the fish. However, it could be possible that aggression is completely independent of water temperature and there are other more significent factors that cause aggressive interspecific behavior. It is important to understand what factors cause different behaviors when people are trying to domesticate organisms or receive benefits from them in manipulated atmospheres and to predict how they will behave when environments change inevitably, or to gain insight about humans. We could also test how different levels of salinity and light exposure impact the aggression levels of Betta splendins.
