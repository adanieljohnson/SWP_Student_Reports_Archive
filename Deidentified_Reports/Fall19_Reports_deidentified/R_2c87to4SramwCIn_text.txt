Title: The disruption of larval development induced by methoprene in Manduca sexta caterpillars 

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
	Manduca sexta, otherwise known as the “tobacco hornworm” is a common garden pest that can be found throughout the United States, parts of Canada, Central America and the Caribbean [Cranshaw 2014]. From 1980 until present day, the hornworm became one of the most extensively investigated organisms in the field of endocrinology and has since helped us better understand the effects of hormones on the body [Bollenbacher: 1981]. Due to the fact that it is a pest, it’s important to gain an understanding of how to best control the population of Manduca caterpillars. The tobacco hornworm undergoes five larval stages until it molts into an adult moth. There are two hormones that control these stages. The first is the Juvenile Hormone that regulates larval development, but inhibits metamorphosis until the fifth instar larval stage when the commitment pulse is made. This commitment pulse is essentially a spike in Ecdysterone (20E), a hormone that regulates molting in the tobacco hornworm. For our experiment we are altering the timing of the distribution of 20E by adding Methoprene to the experimental group’s food during early larval stages. Methoprene belongs to the group of pesticides known as insect growth regulators (IGR), which, in general, exert their toxic effects by disrupting insect development [Horst: 1999]. We hypothesize that the caterpillars will be affected by the IGR.


Materials and Methods:
	To begin the experiment I used two 4-celled containers and lids for them as the homes for my experimental and control groups. Distinguishing which container was for the control or experimental group, I indicated that on each container in sharpie and then numerated each cell, one to four, for each container. Next, I used the “hole” tool to puncture two breathing holes in each cell of both containers for breathing holes for the caterpillar. After I finished setting up the caterpillars home, I grabbed the eight caterpillars I would be using in the experiment, weighed each of them to acquire their initial weights for data purposes and placed them in their distinct cells. The last step was acquiring their food. For the four caterpillars in the control group, I weighed 10 grams of the hornworm’s food, placed 8 drops of water in it using a transfer pipet and mixed the water into the food using a spoon in a square container. The same was done for the four caterpillars in the experimental group, but instead of using water, 1:1250 IGR was used, which is the independent variable of the experiment. To test the experiment, a T-test was used to compare the outcomes of experimental to those of the control.


Results:
The general trends of our data showed that the average weight of the control group steadily trended upwards with exception of the time frame from the fifth day to the tenth day, where there was more of an increase in that intervallic time frame than any other day. Each caterpillar in the control group tended to steadily deviate from the mean weight of all of the caterpillars showing that the caterpillars are growing steadily at their own their own rates. 
	In terms of the experimental group, these caterpillars started around the same mean weight of control group, trended downwards slightly up until day five when their mean weight dramatically increased and surpassed the weights of the control group. This resulted in them continually increasing in weight until the end of the experiment. In terms of the standard deviation, the error bars show that the experimental groups incrementally deviated from the mean weight more and more as the experiment went on. 
According to our one-tailed P value, the control and experimental groups were statistically different from one another. 


Discussion:
Although our statistical results indicate that methoprene did not have an effect on the weight and therefore the growth of the caterpillars, our qualitative results say the opposite. On the fifth day, we documented there was gray dead skin around one of the caterpillars in the experimental group, which may indicates disrupted cuticle formation. A study done on the blue crab indicated that when methoprene was used, there was “profound ultrastructural changes in the cuticular epithelial cells of post-molt adult blue crabs studied in vitro” [Horst: 1999]. This supports our findings in that the caterpillars were in fact affected by methoprene. Additionally, on the tenth and fifthteenth day, the caterpillars were turning a pale blue color in comparison to the normal, blue-green external hue of the control group. Furthermore, the results of our experiments indicate that the caterpillars in the experimental group grew abnormally large from the fifth to the tenth day compared to the control group. This ultimately accentuates the proposition that the experimental caterpillars were in fact affected by the insect growth regulator.
	An alternative explanation of why our statistical results differed from the results of our experiment, is that there may have been genetics involved in how the caterpillars’ bodies reacted to the methoprene and therefore showed a statistical difference in weight. For future experiments, I recommend modifying the days in which the experimenter records the information from five day intervals to everyday to fully gain an understanding as to the effects the IGR has on the caterpillar. The experimenter may also consider measuring length as an alternate way of validating the hypothesis and producing different statistical results.
	In conclusion, although statistically speaking the Manduca caterpillars were not affected by the incorporation of methoprene into their diet, our experimental results indicate the opposite and therefore support our hypothesis that the hornworm was indeed affected.
