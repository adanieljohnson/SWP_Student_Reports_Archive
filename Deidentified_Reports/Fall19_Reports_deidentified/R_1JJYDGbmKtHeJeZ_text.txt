Title: Monochromatic light color’s effect on Spinacia oleracea PSII Activity

Abstract:
Photosystem II occurs through a series of electron transfers and proton transports that result in a proton gradient, with these protons being used in the assembly of ATP. Monochromatic light color is thought to induce a change in this process, altering photosystem II activity. In the conducted experiment, chloroplasts from Spinacia Oleracea were subject to blue, red, and white light to see if it had an impact on photosystem II activity. The expectation was that white light would produce the highest amount of activity, chloroplasts under blue light would produce a lower amount, and chloroplasts under red light would produce the lowest amount. Our data showed that there was not a statistical difference in the comparisons using white and blue light, but there was a statistical difference in all comparisons using red light. This insignificance suggests that the results could have been subject to chance. However, previous studies state that other factors could be involved that would cause this result to happen, or that the conclusion could be wrong entirely. Understanding the effect of light color on photosystem II could lead to huge breakthroughs in the studies of ecologists and biologists, and even improve crop farming.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis activity in Spinacia oleracea (spinach) has been studied for many years. However, little is known about the effect of light color on photosynthesis activity in this particular organism [Yorio: 2001]. Spinacia oleracea was chosen as the tested organism because it conducts photosynthesis in a very typical fashion, as well as being easily accessible [Gibbs: 1958]. Light is the driving force of photosynthesis, making it essential for plant survival. It is even more crucial to photosystem II, a process of light-dependent reactions. This process takes place in the large protein complex that is found in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and is vital to a plant’s ability to successfully conduct photosynthesis [McEvoy: 2006]. This system enables energy from absorbed photons of light to cause electrons to leave chlorophyll and move to plastoquinone. After this takes place, oxidized chlorophyll is reduced by hydrolysis of water, producing molecular oxygen (O2) and other restoring electrons that replace ones previously lost from chlorophyll. The protons produced from this hydrolysis are then pumped across the thylakoid membrane. A series of electron transfers take place between plastoquinone and cytochrome b6f which ultimately result in the transfer of electrons to plastocyanin. During this electron transport process, the cytochrome b6f complex is pumping protons across the membrane, adding to the established proton gradient. Ultimately, the generated protons are used to make ATP synthase, which assembles ATP [Barber: 2006]. Altogether, each step in this process is crucial, meaning that if the light source is altered in any way, it could drastically affect a plant’s ability to survive. One modification to a light source is a change in its color, which is known to affect photosystem II activity [Terashima: 2009]. The experiment evaluates a Spinacia oleracea plant’s ability to conduct photosynthesis under blue, red, and white light. We hypothesized that if the chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea are allowed to conduct photosynthesis under white light (regular light), blue light (~470nm), and red light (~639nm), then photosystem II activity will be optimal under white light, lower under blue light, and the lowest under red light. This is because white light has the most energy because it has all wavelengths of light from ~400nm-700nm. This will allow PSII activity to be the highest. The blue light will cause PSII activity to be lower than white light but higher than red light because the blue light wavelength has high energy, but not as much as white light because it only has one wavelength (energy) to contribute to the system. Lastly, the red light will cause PSII activity to be the lowest because it has the lowest energy wavelength.

Materials and Method:
Ten milliliters of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added to the spinach leaves. After grinding, ten more milliliters of grinding buffer was added to the green solution, ground, and strained through two layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Then, the chloroplasts were enriched by differential centrifugation, being spun for the first time in a centrifuge tube at 200 x G (1200 rpm) for three minutes This was repeated for a second time after being transferred to another tube (leaving the pellet out). The second spin was conducted at 1000 x G (2800 rpm) for ten minutes. The produced pellet contained the chloroplasts that are tested in the experiment, so twenty milliliters of the grinding buffer was added to it and suspended by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. The final part of the procedure began by preparing three replicates of each light category that were tested and a blank (no replicates). The blank contained two milliliters of reaction buffer(100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) and eight milliliters of water. There was also a category for no chloroplasts that included six milliliters of water, two milliliters of 130 mM DCIP and two milliliters of reaction buffer. The final groups (blue, red, white light at three replicates each) contained 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts, six milliliters of water, two milliliters of DCIP, and two milliliters of reaction buffer. Each tube was tested in a spectrometer set a 600nm for a time zero value, and tested again every ten minutes (three times). During these ten minute frames, the chloroplasts were placed under their source of light (blue, red, or white). After finishing the experiment, a paired t_test was conducted, giving a p_value that was used for analyzation of the data.

Results:
The average percent change for the sample without chloroplasts was 2.98 percent from its time zero value. The average percent change for the sample containing chloroplasts in white light was 20.75 percent from its time zero value. The average percent change for the sample containing chloroplasts in red light was 90.91 percent from its time zero value. The average percent change of the sample containing chloroplasts in blue light was 21.78 percent from its time zero value. Figure one shows the general trend in the percent change of each sample, with the sample with chloroplasts under red light being the only one that had a noticeable increase in its percent change. The other samples stayed around the same percent change that they had after ten minutes. The p_values for the samples under red light in comparison to no chloroplasts, white light, and blue light were 0.00001, 0.03, 0.05, meaning that they all showed a statistically significent difference in the data. The p_values for the samples under white light in comparison to no chloroplasts and blue light were 0.41 and 0.96, meaning that there was not a statically significent difference. Finally, the p_value for blue light compared to the sample without chloroplasts was 0.47, also meaning that there was not a statistically significent difference.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that photosystem II activity will be optimal under white light, lower under blue light, and the lowest under red light was not supported. The p_value that the paired t_test gave us rejects the alternative hypothesis, suggesting that the results could have been due to chance. The p_values support the opposite of the hypothesis, with the samples under red light conducting the highest amount of photosynthesis, and the samples under white light conducting the lowest amount of photosynthesis. It is possible that the small sample size could be an issue, but the conditions that the plants were tested under could likely be improved. This is because the samples received a degree of white light from the ceiling, whereas it would be better to isolate each sample in its designated light. A previous study experienced benefits from increasing the rate of time of the samples that underwent testing [Baba: 2012]. Another previous study validates the rejection of our hypothesis, finding that red light produced the highest absorbance, thus the most photosystem II activity [Yu: 2017]. However, this study experimented with C. acuminata, a different plant than what was used in our experiment. This could be the reason for the extreme difference in results. It would be beneficial to conduct the same procedure on different plant species to assess differences in absorption (if any). It is important to apply these findings to current-world situations, as alterations on photosystem II activity could prove highly beneficial for growth on various plant species. On a grander scheme, findings that certain factors increase the rate of photosystem II could be advantageous toward ecologists, plant biologists, and even crop farmers [Yorio: 2001].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. shows the average percent change in photosystem II activity of each group over a period of thirty minutes, as well as the standard error of each category. The results of the graph show that the percent change of chloroplasts under red light was substantially different from all of the other groups (90.91%), while the chloroplasts under blue and white light underwent little change (21.78% and 20.75%). *************************************************************************
