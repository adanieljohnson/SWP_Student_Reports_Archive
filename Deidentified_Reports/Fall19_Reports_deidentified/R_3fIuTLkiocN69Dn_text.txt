Title: Effects of E20 on Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The hornworm, Manduca sexta caterpillar resides in North Carolina with a short life span. The passage of one life stage to the next requires molting, resulting in 8 stages. The insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and emergence of adults are all controllled by three hormones. Prothoracicotropic is produced by the corpus cardiacum and regulates the release of ecdysterone by prothoracic glands. Ecdysterone (E20) is produced by prothracic glands and regulates the timing of molting. The juvenile hormone is produced by the corpus allata and relates the type of molt during development [Johnson: 2016]. The Manduca sexta is a pest at adolescence. Our null hypothesis was that if we inject the caterpillars' food with seven drops E20, then the caterpillars would grow at the same rate as the controllled caterpillars and would stay the same. Our alternative hypothesis was that if we inject the caterpillars' food with seven drops of E20, then the caterpillars will grow at a faster rate than the controllled caterpillars.

Materials and Method:
The independent variable was the ecdysterone hormone. The dependent variable was the mass of the caterpillars over the course of fourteen days. The controllled variables were the caterpillars who were not treated with any hormone and had seven drops of water added to their food portions. The constant variables were temperature of the environment, the mass of the food given, the seven drops of the hormone. We fed the Manduca sexta caterpillars daily and gave four of them the ecdysterone hormone seven drops daily. We gave the other four caterpillars water for their food to remain moist. We replenished the food and cleaned the containers when needed be. We observed the mass daily. Our statistical test was a one tailed t_test.

Results:
After the fourteen days, we found that the total change in mass for variable one was 0.01g, variable 2 was 0.01g, variable 3 was 0.01g, and variable 4 was 0.01g. The total change in mass for controll one was 0.12g, controll 2 was 8.5g, controll 3 was 6.47g, and controll 4 was 8.6g. The average  total change in mass for the variable was 0.01g and the average total change in mass for the controll group was 5.92g. We found a p_value of 0.012.

Discussion:
Due to the results, we found that the p_value was 0.012, so therefore we are able to reject the null hypothesis. We also thought the caterpillars would grow tremendously however the caterpillars lost weight ot remained the same weight until we lost data as they died off. The controlls grew at a quicker rate, and so we can assume the E20 hormone was a blocker and did not allow the caterpillars to pupate. This means that we also reject our alternate hypothesis as the controlls grew more than the variables.
