Title: Increased Temperature Causes a Smaller Root to Shoot Ratio in Vigna radiata (Mung Bean)

Abstract:
The Vigna radiata is a plant that uses energy allocation to grow different parts of itself in different sizes based on its surroundings. We decided to test the effect of temperature on the root to shoot ratio for Vigna radia plants. We tested this by making two groups of Vigna radiata plants and placing one in the ambient temperature of a greenhouse while the other was placed in a heated incubator. After two weeks we measured the length and mass of the roots and shoots of both treatment groups and compared them to each other. We found the average root to shoot length ratio in the greenhouse to be 1.767 while the incubator plants had a ratio of 0.961. The greenhouse plants also appeared to be much healthier than the incubator plants by the end of the experiment. This proved that there was a significant difference between the root to shoot length ratio of the plants in lower temperature compared to those in higher temperature, meaning that lower temperatures favor root growth compared to shoot growth in Vigna radiata plants.

Introduction:
Energy allocation is when an individual divides their resources to fit their specific needs in their environment. Plants use energy allocation to adapt to a variety of different environmental factors, such as temperature, light, and soil nutrient levels, that can make it difficult for the plant to survive. This causes plants to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, which is when different plants of the same species will have different sized structures based on the challenges presented by their environments. The Vigna radiata (Mung Bean) is an example of a plant that grows different sized shoots and roots, which are the parts of the plant that grow above and below the soil, respectively, based on its environment. We decided to study the effect of temperature on the root to shoot ratio of the Vigna radiata by planting two groups of seeds in different settings, and then measuring and comparing each group’s root to shoot ratio. According to a 2005 study of root to shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes, “root:shoot ratios were found to be negatively related to...mean annual temperature,” (Mokany 2005). Based on this information from a previous study, we predicted that the mung bean plants in lower temperature would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the mung bean plants in the higher temperature environment.

Materials and Methods:
We planted twelve mung bean seeds in each of six pots, then we put half of the pots in the ambient temperature of a greenhouse and we put the other in an incubator with a higher controlled temperature. The greenhouse plants were our control group while the incubator plants were our experimental group. After two weeks of caring for the plants as necessary, we measured the length and mass of the roots and shoots of ten plants from each treatment group, and used this to calculate the average root to shoot ratios for each measurement in each treatment. We used a two sample t-test to compare the average root to shoot ratios of the treatment groups.


Results:
When comparing mass, we found that the average root to shoot ratio in the greenhouse was 1.016 while the ratio for the incubator had an average of 0.974. We found that when measuring length, the root to shoot ratio in the greenhouse was 1.767 and the root to shoot ratio in the incubator was 0.961. We observed that the shoots of the plants in the greenhouse appeared to be much greener, and likely healthier, than the shoots of the experimental group. Likewise, the roots of the control group appeared much thicker and fuller than those from the experimental group. The results of our two sample t-test for mass were t=0.547, df=18, p=0.2955. The results of our two sample t-test for length were t=5.72, df=18, p=0.00001. 


Discussion:
	The extremely small p-value given by the comparison of root to shoot length ratios means that our hypothesis was strongly supported by our experiment. This means that the difference in root to shoot length ratios between the two groups was very unlikely to have happened due to chance, and that the difference in temperature was the primary cause of the difference in these ratios. While one might argue that our p-value for the comparison of root to shoot mass ratios proved that that difference was not statistically significant, our observations made clear the fact that the control group plants appeared to be healthier than the experimental plants. This could be due to other conditions, such as humidity or quality of light available in the incubator that would have to be accounted for if this experiment were to be conducted in the future. Our results show that Vigna radiata plants prefer to grow longer roots, relative to their shoots, in lower temperatures. A future study that can be conducted to build off of these results is an attempt to determine why the lower temperature favored longer roots. A study showed that, “explanations for this (energy) allocation shift include reduced N(itrogen) supply due to decreased temperature,” (Leuschner 2007). In the future, we could examine the relationship between temperature and soil nutrients to see if they go hand in hand in changing the energy allocation of a mung bean plant. In addition, we would have to test a larger variety of temperatures to find the optimal temperature for maximizing or minimizing the root to shoot ratio of a mung bean plant. This would give a real world application to someone (a farmer, for instance) who would want to naturally manipulate the root to shoot ratio of the mung bean.
