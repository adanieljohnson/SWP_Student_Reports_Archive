Title: The Reaction of Betta Fish to different shape of plastic mimic fish with and without the man-made ‘red-mane’

Abstract:
Animal Behaviors are always an interesting topic in biology, knowing the behavior of animals could not only help human understand how other animal communicate, but also help completing the evolution theory. In this experiment, Betta Splendins was chosen as the targeted species. The Betta fish is known for its obvious aggressive behavior against competitors. From previous experiments, we knew that the male Betta fish didn’t react to non-competitors like other species of fish. However, what specific character male Betta Splendins use to separate between competitors and non-competitors? In this experiment, we hypothesize that the shape is an essential character that male Betta Splendins recognize the competitors, and the red mane (which is the most aggressive behavior done by Betta fish) strengthen the male Splendins’ reaction towards the competitor. However, the result of this experiment shows that there is no significent difference among the groups of different shapes with and without red mane. This indicates that the male Betta Splendins don’t recognize the competitors based on the shape and red mane. For further research, the influence of color may have significent effect on helping the male Betta fish to recognize the competitors.  

Introduction:
Ethology, a field of study focusing on animal behavior and social organization, helps biologists to know more about animals and even human. The scientists who discovered this innovation way of learning animals were given the Nobel prize of medicine in the year of 1973. [NobelPrize.org; 1973] Unlike traditional natural science researches, ethology combines the observation and the laboratory parts of ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology. [Johnson; 2019] Animals, unlike plants or other organisms in the word, have relative strong mobility and differentiate behaviors against different stimulus, either from the environment, from other individuals or even from inside of their own bodies. Learning to share the Earth with other animals is always a challenge that human needs to focus on. Ethological research helps people to learn more about animals. Betta Splendins, a species of fish in South-Eastern Asia was known as one of the highest territorial fish in the world. They would show their aggressive behavior and even body conflictions when their territory was invaded. From previous observation and ethological experiments, scientists already knew that there are two main intraspecific aggressive movements, or agnostic behaviors, broadside movements and facing movements. [Johnson; 2019] Every time when two male fish are put together, they will fight, and doing aggressive behaviors until one escape or die. Then there raises a question that how the male Betta Splendins recognize another individual that threatens its territory and start its aggressive behaviors? Aggressive behaviors are one of the most important way that we could learn about the communications between animals. Knowing how the Betta Splendins communicate with each other, we could know more about the societies of other animals are built, thus, probably have more evidence on the theory of evolution. In nature, take human as example, recognize by shape is a common way to distinguish whether the ‘invader’ is the same species or not. Also, the aggressive behavior: ‘red-mane’ is the most aggressive movement in betta fish. Such that, red mane could be another way that male Betta Splendins recognize each other. Thus, in this experiment, the influence of the shape of the ‘invader’ and the existence of the ‘red mane’ were designed to be the independent variables, while the total time periods of doing aggressive behavior for 5 minutes were recorded as the quantitative dependent variables. The ‘invaders’ are mimic by blue plastics that are cut into different shapes. The red mane was mimicked by the red plastics stick to the front part of the blue fish-shaped plastic. We hypothesized that: As the shape of blue plastic approaches to the real shape of Betta Splendins, the total aggressive behavior time period of male Betta increases; and with the mimic red mane, the male Betta increases its aggressive behavior time period. 

Materials and Method:
The shape of the ‘invader’ and the existence of the ‘red mane’ were designed to be the independent variables; The total time periods of doing aggressive behavior for 5 minutes were recorded as the quantitative dependent variables.
To ensure the generalization of the experiment, a random Betta Splendins was chosen and raised in the transparent water tank. Cut the blue plastic into three different shapes, one was as similar to real fish as possible and with a red mane, another one was fish shaped but with no fin and with red mane, the last one was a plastic similar to fish and without a red mane. Put one shape of plastic on the other side of the transparent water tank, record the starting time and the ending time of any aggressive behavior done by the Betta Fish for 5 minutes period. After that, rest the Betta Splendins for 5 minutes to prevent overloading stimulus. Added up all the time periods of agnostic behaviors. Repeat for three times to decrease the randomness of the data collected. Change the shape of plastic hanging on the side of the transparent water tank and repeat the experiment with all shapes of the plastic, one at each time. Recorded all data from three different shape groups, compare data from these groups. 
The ANOVA statistical test was used to find out the significance among the sets of data. 


Results:
The total agnostic movement of male Betta Splendins against Realistic fish shape plastic without red mane is higher than that of the Fin-Cut shaped plastic, and higher than that of the Realistic fish shaped plastic. The Error bars over lapping between realistic fish shaped plastic and the Fin-Cut shaped plastic, and between Fin-Cut shaped plastic and Realistic fish shaped plastic without red mane attached. These error bars indicate that there are no significent differences between these two groups. However, the error bar of Realistic fish shape plastic and realistic fish shape plastic without red mane is not overlapping, which means that there is significent difference between these two groups.  
According to the Turkey-Kramer test in ANOVA test, none of the two groups are significently different with each other. P-value got from the ANOVA test is 0.957 which is much larger than 0.05, which indicates no significent different among three groups. 


Discussion:
The male Betta Splendins’s aggressive reaction to Realistic, Fin-Cut, and Realistic without red mane has a time period of 286.7, 287.7, 289.7 seconds in 5 minutes. There is no significent difference between any two groups of the shape of plastic according to the ANOVA test. So that the null hypothesis is not rejected, which is there is no significent difference in aggressive behavior frequency when male Betta Splendins reacts to different shape of ‘invaders,’ and also there is no significent difference in aggressive behavior time period between the realistic fish-shaped plastic with and without red mane. These data mean that the male Betta Fish reacts similarly against different shape of stimulus and react similarly to the stimulus with and without red mane. It may because that the visual ability of the male Betta Fish is not detailed enough to separate the shapes from each other. So that we could conclude that from this experiment, male Betta Splendins doesn’t recognize the invader according to the shape of it. [Thompson, 1965] Also, the existence of red mane may not help the Betta fish to recognize that it was another male betta fish, instead, the red mane is probably a kind of communication signal that only appears on the individual if that individual is doing aggressive behaviors. The man-made red mane may fails mimic the signal communication. There is one possible error in this experiment, there may be individual differences among the male Betta Splendins, limit to the time, the experiment was only done on one individual of the Betta fish. That would decrease the generality of this experiment. Since in this experiment, all the plastics used to mimic the Betta fish is blue. We couldn’t conclude whether the Betta Splendins recognize competitors based on color or not. So, for further researches, more attention should be focused on the influence on aggressive behaviors by different colors stimulus.[Lynn, 2007] [Bols, 1977]After discovering how Betta Splendins recognize other competitors, scientists could know more about how the Betta Splendins communicate with each other and according to the same experimental method, human could also know more about the way how other animals live in the world. Base on the observations and researches in ethology, we could know more about how the world was built up, and as more and more information are collected, the evolution theory would be more and more complete.
