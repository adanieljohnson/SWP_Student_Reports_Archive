Title: Effects of Water Temperature on Aggressive Behaviors in Betta Splendins (Siamese fighting fish)

Abstract:
The habitat in which living organisms live has constant effects on the way of life of that organism. One of such factors that influence living organisms is temperature. Temperature in most cases affects the comfort of life. In this experiment, the primary aim was to determine the effects of an increase in temperature on aggressive behaviors in male Betta Splendins (Siamese fighting fish). We hypothesized that the betta male will exhibit more aggressive behaviors towards rival males while in warm temperature water relative to when it is in room temperature water. We placed the betta male in a 19ºC water tank for the controll and a 21ºC water tank for the experimental and observed the aggressive behaviors exhibited. Our results showed that there was a significent difference in the average number of aggressive behaviors between the room temperature water and the warm temperature water. From a chronological perspective, our results show that careful temperature regulation is needed when studying behavior in the male betta.

Introduction:
All living organisms react accordingly to their environments in varying ways. Certain behaviors are distinct to living organisms and these behaviors help ethologists distinguish between species. Behaviors can range from feeding patterns to agnostic (aggressive) behaviors. We focused on agnostic behaviors for this experiment. Agonistic behavior in animals is defined as behavior exhibited during a contest, combat, escape, attack or appeasement between two animals [Johnson: 2016]. The term is often used to describe the display behaviors of male animals when they compete for mating opportunities with females. In this experiment, we will be observing the effects of a change in temperature on the aggressive behaviors exhibited by male siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins) when they have another betta fish in sight. Male Siamese fighting fishes were selected for this experiment because they are well known for being highly territorial, aggressive toward intruders and are very consistent in their responses to stimuli [Shakaura: 1997]. These reasons coupled with the fact that betta fishes are ectotherms (dependent on external sources of heat) make them the optimum organism for this experiment.  Male bettas fight to claim territory from rival males; however, physical combat is preceded by a display by the males to scare off the other. At the sight of a rival male, male bettas will exhibit several types of genetically determined aggressive behaviors. These behaviors include spreading the fins, extending the gill opercula and generally appearing larger than his resting size. We hypothesize that the betta male will exhibit more aggressive behaviors towards rival males while in warm temperature water relative to when it is in room temperature water. We believe that the betta fish will exhibit more aggressive behaviors in warm water because an increase in temperature increases the metabolic rate of animals which in turn will increase the behavioral responses of the betta fish.

Materials and Method:
We picked out a very responsive betta male amongst the other betta males for our experiment. We used one betta male for both the controll and the experimental. We initially placed the betta male in room temperature water which is about 19ºC. We then put another betta fish into the other compartment of the fish tank. The fish tank was separated into two compartments with a glass screen and an opaque screen. We removed the opaque screen to allow our betta fish to see the other betta fish through the glass screen. We observed the aggressive behaviors of our betta fish for 2 minutes and then replaced the opaque screen, so the betta fish didn’t reach a point of habituation – a decline in response to a specific, constant stimulus. We provided the betta fish with 5 minutes away from the other fish and then repeated the process for a total of 5 trials. We then moved the betta fish to the warm tank which contained water at 21ºC. We then repeated the same process of 2 minutes with the other betta and 5 minutes without the other betta for a total of 5 trials and observed the aggressive behaviors. The independent variable was the temperature of the water and the dependent variable was the number of aggressive behaviors exhibited. Finally, we run a one-tailed two-sample t_test with the data we obtained.

Results:
The average number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by the betta male toward a rival male was 16.2±1.92 in the room temperature water whereas the average number of aggressive behaviors was 29.4±3.97 in the warm temperature water as shown in figure 1. The betta male never exhibited the red mane aggressive behavior during all five trials in the room temperature water, but the betta fish exhibited the red mane several times during the trials in the warm temperature water. The p_value from the one-tailed two-sample t_test for the average number of aggressive behaviors exhibited was 0.000078. The degrees of freedom were 8 for both statistical tests. Our cut-off for the p_value to be significent was 0.05.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the number of aggressive behaviors will be higher in the warm temperature water relative to the room temperature water was supported because we got a statistically significent result. The betta male showed clear changes in behavior after exposure to the 21ºC water which is a 2ºC higher water temperature than room temperature water. The betta male was observed displaying the red mane facing behavior – the most aggressive behavior trait – only when it was in the warmer temperature water.  We believe that this drastic increase in aggressive behavior is a result of an increase in metabolic rate – the amount of energy used by the fish per unit of time – of the fish. Due to the fact that the male betta is an ectotherm, the rise in surrounding temperature allows the cells of the fish to have greater thermal energy and causes cellular enzymes to be more active. This increase in activity within the fish, in turn, causes an increase in aggressive behaviors displayed. Similar to our results, Forsatkar et al. observed a significent increase in routine activity rate of male Siamese fighting fish during their experiment when the male fighting fish was exposed to elevated temperature during a ten-day period [Forsatkar: 2016]. These findings as consistent with our own findings of the effects of temperature on the activity of the betta male. These differences in the aggressive behavior of the betta male due to temperature can prove to be important in the context of laboratory investigations depending on what questions are being asked. In conclusion, our results add to a number of literature that show that differences in temperature have huge effects on the behavior of animals. Our results clearly show that a standard of environmental conditions will be essential when estimating aggressive behaviors in Betta splendins. Moving forward, the consideration of behavioral effects could help fish farmers to assess which temperature will provide the most yield. Temperature could become a major factor in raising fishes for specific reasons.

Figure 1. The difference in the mean number of aggressive behaviors of betta male towards the rival male in 19ºC water and 21ºC water. The 19ºC water which is room temperature was the controll and the 21ºC was the experimental. Graphs were created with the average number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by the betta male and error bars represent the standard deviation. The sample size was n= 5 for each group. The average number of aggressive behaviors in room temp water was 16.2±1.92 whereas the average number of aggressive behaviors in warm temp water was 29.4±3.97. The statistical test revealed that the results were significent.*************************************************************************
