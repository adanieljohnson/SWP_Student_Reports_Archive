Title:  Saturation of Cabbage Leaves on Absorbance Effects via Photosystem II

Abstract:
Photosystem II relies on the hydrolysis of water to be able to function properly. Saturated and
unsaturated cabbage leaves were tested for differing absorbances over a time period of thirty
minutes. Our results, via a 2-sample t_test indicated no significance in absorbance between
saturated and unsaturated samples.

Introduction:
Water, of course, is a necessary component of plant function, as it aids in the process of photosynthesis via hydrolysis in Photosystem II; this phenomenon has been directly showcased in multiple experiments [Dawson:2018]. The purpose of this experiment is to test water-saturated cabbage against normal cabbage leaves and use a two-sample t_test to compare the results of light absorbance from the water saturated cabbage versus the normal/unsaturated cabbage, based off a previous study of the subject [Heber:2005]. We hypothesize that the saturated cabbage leaves will absorb less light than the normal leaves due to the functional blockage of Photosystem II. 


Materials and Method:
To prepare chloroplasts: First, three cabbage leaves were placed in water for ten minutes, then three unsaturated cabbage leaves were collected. The mortar and pestle was chilled. For each group- unsaturated and saturated- the cabbage leaves were placed in the mortar, with 10 Ml grinding buffer added, then grinded until a green “mush” had begun to form. Another 10Ml of grinding buffer was added to the saturated cabbage leaves to aid in breaking it down. Then, 10Ml of grinding buffer were added to both samples and then both volumes were strained in their entirety through three-layered cheesecloths. The strained volumes were then transferred to the chilled centrifuge tubes (A), then 200 microliters of the liquids were placed in the microtubules and spun at 200x for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Then, the supernatant was removed, transferred into chilled centrifuge tubes (B), and sun at 1000x for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Then, the supernatant was transferred to centrifuge tube C and 200 microliters of each sample were transferred to a microtubule. The B pellet was resuspended by adding 20 Ml of grinding buffer and gently stirring with the transfer pipette. Then, 200 microliters were transferred to microtubule and analyzed under a microscope for chloroplast appearance. 

For the prepared chloroplasts: 
Test tubes were created using Table 1 for measurements. The,  approximately 2 Ml of each solution were transferred to a cuvette. The absorbances were read using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm and record results for Time 0, Time 10, and Time 20. The % change between times was calculated, and a two-sample t_test was run on the resulting % changes for both the saturated and unsaturated samples. 


Results:

Our p_values between samples (% change in absorbance of unsaturated and saturated cabbage leaves) were 0.753 (Time 0-Time 10) and 0.280 (Time 10-Time 20). These are statistically insignificent. Under a microscope analysis, the saturated cabbage leaves had very little small debris, medium large debris, and moderate chloroplast numbers. The unsaturated cabbage leaves had very little small debris, no large debris, and high chloroplast numbers. 


Discussion:
There was no significance between the absorbances of the saturated and unsaturated cabbage leaves. We accept the null hypothesis, in that saturated vs unsaturated cabbage leaves see no difference in absorbance over a time period of 30 minutes. This contrasts the differences observed in past experiments [Heber:2005]. Conclusively, saturation of cabbage leaves doesn’t seem to affect absorbance across time. Possible explanations for these results could be contamination errors, or too much “squeezing” of water from the saturated leaves. The amount of time of cabbage leaf saturation (10 minutes) cannot be a factor, because the literature time was not much different (15 minutes). Although we did not run positive and negative controlls, our results of nonsignificance between the two samples regarding light absorbance in chloroplasts are consistent with that of the negative controll for a previous week’s experiment (average p_value = 0.610; two-sample T-test), giving creed to our results. It should be noted, however, that we observed higher counts of chloroplasts in the unsaturated cabbage leaves than in the saturated cabbage leaves, perhaps indicating that the difference in chloroplast numbers could be affiliated with results more linear with the literature. Future experimentation could be done with positive and negative controlls, as well as longer time periods of observation.
