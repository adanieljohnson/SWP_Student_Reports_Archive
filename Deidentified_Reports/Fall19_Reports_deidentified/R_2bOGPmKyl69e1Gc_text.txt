Title: Effects of Heat on Vigna Radiata (Mung bean) Plants with relation to Root to Shoot ratio

Abstract:
Plants respond to different environmental changes by allocating resources to different areas of the plant that are at the most need. This is known as the plant’s phenotypic plasticity. Previous studies have shown that root to shoot ratio can be affected by lack of sunlight or lack of water, thus affecting the growth of roots and shoots in a plant. Vigna Radiata, also known as a mung bean, is an herb that has a rapid growth rate. The root and shoot length and weight ratio were examined to see if heat had a significent difference on the plants’ growth over a two-week period. These results showed how Vigna Radiata’s allocated resources when put under the pressure of heat. It was found that there was no significent difference between the two plant groups, forcing us to accept the null hypothesis and rejecting the alternative hypothesis. Heat did not have a significent effect on the plant partially due to the failure to emulate full drought-like conditions. The plants still received the same amount of water and through further investigation the plants will react when placed under heat pressures and water depravity. 

Introduction:
Due to plants’ plasticity, the size of the plant can be adapted to the environment in which the plant is grown. A multitude of different factors can affect the way in which they grow. All of these factors have to do with the way in which they can best optimize their photosynthesis processes. Understanding how plants best allocate their resources in different environments and their reactions to different environmental factors can help us better analyze the impacts of these outside forces. Studies have shown that plants that grow in environments that do not have no access to sunlight while having a large water supply have a smaller root to shoot ratio than plants that have ample sunlight and less access to water. [Porter: 2012] The resources are allocated to the part of the plant that nutrients that are scarcer. Plants in the desert are more likely to have larger roots in order to find ground water while plants in the rainforest are more likely to have taller shoots in order to grasp sunlight. 
The organism we studied was Vigna Radiata, more commonly known as mung bean. Mung bean is an herb that grows rapidly and is a plant that can be easily measured when collecting results. Upon research into the effects of environmental factors, a study showed that drought and heat stresses can have a significent impact on plant growth and crop yield. [Lipiec: 2013] In this experiment, we decided to test the effect of heat on the root to shoot weight and length ratio of mung bean plants. As global temperatures rise worldwide, it could affect the way in which plants are forced to adapt to their surroundings and the success in which plants grow. Our hypothesis is that the mung bean plant exposed and grown in the higher temperature will have a higher root to shoot ratio than plants grown in normal growing temperatures. We suspect this because heat depletes the water source faster, thus forcing the roots of the plant to grow larger to gain access to groundwater, while the plants in the controll group are less likely to extend the roots as they are not faced with the increase in heat.


Materials and Method:
The mung bean seeds were provided by the Wake Forest Biology department. The beans were collected in 6 bins containing soil, with 3 of the bins placed in normal heat conditions and 3 placed on a heat pad that increased the temperature by 10° to 20° Fahrenheit. All of the beans were put in the greenhouse with the pad underneath the experimental group. The independent variable is the mung bean, the dependent is the weight and length of the bean, and the controll is the mung bean at greenhouse temperature. They were watered and observed every day for 2 weeks in the greenhouse. Following the second week, the plants from each bin were carefully removed, keeping their roots and shoots intact and patted dry. There were 18 beans removed from the controll bins and 10 beans removed from the heated group. The plants were each weighed as a whole and recorded. The roots were then separated from the shoots by cutting each plant at the root to shoot junction (the notch). The roots were then weighed in grams and recorded, along with the shoots. The root and shoot length were also measured and recorded to the nearest centimeter. The root to shoot length and weight ratios were calculated for each plant that was weighed and measured. The ratios were calculated by dividing the root length and weight by the shoot length and weight. The mean values for root to shoot weight and length ratios were found, and the standard deviation was calculated from those values. A one-tailed T-test was conducted to compare the controll group to the plants placed on the heating pad, due to the fact that our hypothesis was implied a directional difference. The p_value is over 0.05 which proves there is no significent difference between the two data sets.

Results:
In this figure, the root: shoot weight ratio produced an average of 2.407±1.47 for plants in the controll group and an average of 2.781±1.49 on the heating pad. The root: shoot length ratio produced an average of 2.483±1.331 for the plants in the controll group and 2.117±0.44 for the plants on the heating pad. While the average is higher for the root to shoot weight ratio in the heated group, the same is not true for the length. 
The results from the test showed that the difference in temperature between the two groups did not yield a significent difference in the root to shoot ratios. The one-tailed two-sample t_test concluded that there was no significent difference in root: shoot weight value between the two treatments (t-value: 0.64, d.f.: 26, p: 0.264). The test also concluded that there was no significent difference in root: shoot length value between the two treatments (t-value: 0.84, d.f.: 26, p: 0.2). 


Discussion:
Since the results were not statistically significent, our hypothesis was not supported, and heat did not have an effect on the root to shoot length ratio or the root to shoot weight ratio. The reason that our hypothesis may have not been supported due to the notion that drought-like conditions like heat stress and water depravity act in coalition with each other to affect the growth of the plant. [Lipiec: 2013] In our experiment we only studied the effect of one of those factors, being heat. The plants were not deprived of water; therefore, the roots did not need to grow longer. When acting in coalition with each other, had we placed both of these conditions on the plants, the root to shoot ratio could have had the outcome we were predicting. Another reason that our hypothesis could have not been supported was because of the timeline in which the plants were examined. The time used to grow these plants did not produce significent difference between the weight and lengths of the root and shoot ratio, but perhaps a longer period of time for growth would yield significently different results. If experiment were conducted using both of these conditions, the outcomes could provide a wider context to the effects that droughts have on plant growth and yield. To further continue this study, we could test the effects of heat and lack of water for a longer period of time. This could provide more insight into how the global temperature change, along with depletion of water can affect plant growth. Knowing how plants react to certain natural forces will help us to know what plants need when faced with drought like conditions in the natural world. We can also figure out the things that we are doing to trigger these conditions and become more educated on ways to prevent it and the dangers that come from plants losing nutrients.
