Title:  The Effects of Acidic Soil on the Phenotypic Plasticity and Growth of Polygonum fagopyrum

Abstract:
Polygonum fagopyrum, buckwheat, is a common crop grown and used in agriculture. Many farmers use buckwheat as a cover crop during the off season to suppress weed growth and improve soil conditions on agricultural farms.  In this experiment,buckwheat were grown in an acidic soil environment to determine how this condition would influence plant growth. We hypothesized that the experimental group would have a greater root:shoot ratio than the control group. Results were quantified by determining the mean root:shoot weight ratio of buckwheat grown in acidic soil (pH 3.5) vs those grown in neutral pH soil.  Data was analyzed using a two-tailed two-sample t-test. However,  the results indicated that the control group and experimental group were not statistically different (t-stat=1.12 df=16 P=0.139). Soil acidity is a growing problem in the agricultural world that affects species of plants differently. Nonetheless, it is important to understand how acidity affects buckwheat and its ability to improve soil conditions as cover crop.

Introduction:
Phenotypic plasticity is a plant’s ability to tolerate and adapt to its environment. There are numerous factors that influence plant growth i.e. nutrient, water, and sunlight availability. Plants largely receive nutrients from minerals found in soil; soil type is one of the most important factors that influence plant productivity [Macdonald:2014]. Soil acidifies naturally but is accelerated by excessive farming which increases the toxicity of soil [Bolland:2004]. Agriculture increases the concentration of hydrogen ions and aluminum ions in soil which, when in excess, is extremely toxic to plant roots, reducing growth [Bollard:2004]. Soil acidity affects approximately 30% of the world’s land area [von Uexkull:1995]. When there is an overabundance of minerals such as nitrogen, aluminum and phosphorus the pH of the soil decreases.  In the case of limited soil nutrients, plants may overcompensate for this lack of resource by lengthening roots to locate nutrient areas of soil and/or increasing shoot length to maximize photosynthetic capacity [Johnson: 2016]. Poor crop and pasture growth, yield reduction and smaller grain size occur as a result of inadequate water and nutrition [Bolland:2004].
Polygonum fagopyrum, commonly known as buckwheat, is an excellent cover crop that has been used for over 400 years to suppress weed growth and improve soil conditions [Björkman:2008]. Buckwheat were chosen as the target plant for this experiment due to its ease of growth [Björkman:2008].  Buckwheat were grown in an acidic soil environment to determine how this condition would influence plant growth. For optimal growth Buckwheat should be grown in a neutral pH environment and can only tolerate a moderate acidity (to a pH of 5) [Pavek:2016][Myers:1994]. A typical adaptation that plants use to overcome limited resources is to adjust their root and shoot length [Johnson:2016]. To determine any changes in plant phenotypic plasticity, the root:shoot weight ratio of each plant was calculated. We hypothesize that Buckwheat plants grown in acidic conditions will have a larger shoot: root ratio than plants grown in a neutral pH environment. 



Materials and Methods:
This experiment was conducted over a two weeks. Buckwheat seeds were planted in 6 containers: 3 experimental; 3 control using vermiculite is a soil substitute. Each container contained approximately 5-8 seeds. Buckwheat plants were watered every day using 200 ml of water. The plants were grown in a greenhouse and were provided the necessary temperature and sunlight for growth. 

To account for the acidic condition, the experiment group was given 50 ml of pH 3.5 each day for the duration of the two week period. At the end of the two week period a total of 9 control plants and 9 experimental plants were harvested by pulling the plants gently from tray (three plants were selected at random from each of the 6 containers for a total of 18 plants used for data analysis). The weight of each individual buckwheat plant was recorded. Then, the roots were cut at the root-shoot junction to determine the weight of the root mass and calculate the root:shoot weight ratio. We analyzed our data using a  two-tailed two-sample t-test to determine if the shoot:root ratio of the buckwheat grown in acidic soil was statistically different from the root:shoot ratio of the control group.


Results:
Data was analyzed from the experimental, acidic soil, group and the control, neutral pH, group. From the two-tailed t-test is was determined that the mean root:shoot ratio of the experimental group was not statistically different than that of the control group (t-stat=1.12 df=16 P=0.139). There was more variance in the average root:shoot ratio of the acidic experimental group than the control group. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment supports our hypothesis that the buckwheat plants grown in acidic conditions would have a greater root:shoot ratio than buckwheat plants grown in a neutral pH environment. However, the root:shoot ratio between the experimental group and control group were not statistically significant. This does not take away from the fact that the experimental group had a greater root: shoot ratio than the control group. Based on the standard deviation, there was more deviance in the experimental group (+/- 0.14m SD) than the control group (+/- 0.042 m SD) The introduction of a more acidic environment caused experimental plant roots to grow more than the roots of the control group in search of areas of neutral pH. Therefore, variance in root:shoot ratio of the experimental group could be due to some buckwheat plants finding areas of higher pH soil and others being centered within the acidic soil [Myers:1994]. However, data from this experiment is indicative of the phenotype plasticity of Buckwheat plants when resources are limited. Since buckwheat is a major crop in the agricultural industry [Bolland:2004], it would be beneficial to determine if buckwheat could be used as a way to decrease soil acidity and how it improves soil conditions.
