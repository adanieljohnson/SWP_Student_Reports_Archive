Title: The effects of salt water on leaf surface area in Raphanus sativus plants 

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of limitation of an essential resource on the phenotype of Raphanus sativus (radish) plants, based on previous studies into the effect of water limitation and salt effects on leaf surface area in experimental populations. This experiment considered a controll population, watered with regular water, and a sample population, watered with only saltwater, for a two-week duration to test the hypothesis that leaf surface area would be decreased in the sample population due to the saltwater treatment of that group effecting the plant’s intake of water, an essential resource. At the conclusion of the study, the average surface area of the leaves of each group was collected for analysis. The resulting data described the controll group as having smaller average leaf surface area than the sample group, not supporting the original hypothesis. In addition, the statistical testing revealed that the data collected was insignificent with a p_value of 0.22 from the two-sample t_test conducted. 

Introduction:
In plants, including the Raphanus sativus plant used in this experiment, water is used as an essential resource which can be used to study the response of plants when such resources are limited, such as in a drought or generally dry environment. When resources are limited, plants try to allocate their resources to focus on those weaker areas to make up for less availability [Johnson: 2019] That alteration in plant behavior is known as phenotypic plasticity. Limitation of essential resources, such as water, can prompt that change, resulting in different growth patterns of the plant. In this experiment, saltwater will be used to test the effect of water limitations on the phenotype of the Raphanus sativus (radish) plant. Salt is known to have negative impacts on the growth of the plant, specifically due to plant injury caused by an accumulation of toxic levels of chlorine in plant systems when sodium chloride is present in the soil [Perry: 2016]. Such phenotypic plasticity can be examined in multiple ways, including examining leaf surface area. According to one study, leaf surface area was decreased in response to limited water and other essential nutrients in an experimental population [Matesanz: 2018]. Based on the data from that publication, leaf surface area will be the dependent variable tested in this experiment. If the Raphanus sativus sample organisms are watered with saltwater, which is known to cause plant injury due to toxic buildups of chlorine [Perry: 2016], they will exhibit smaller leaf surface areas, change in which is shown to be a common result of resource allocation in plants [Matesanz: 2018], than those watered with regular tap water. 

Materials and Method:
Raphanus sativus seeds were planted in provided soil, separated into six different containers, with fifteen seeds in each container. Three containers were labeled as controll and watered with regular water while three were labeled as experimental and were watered with only saltwater. The independent variable in this procedure was the type of water being used and the dependent variable measured was leaf surface area. All plants were watered each day for two weeks. The controll population was watered with 150 Ml of regular tap water and the experimental organisms with 150 Ml of 6 M NaCl salt solution. At the conclusion of two weeks, three representative leaves from each tub of plants (total of nine leaves each from the controll and sample populations) were selected and their surface area measured using a 0.5 cm2 grid template. The surface area of the controll and sample populations were then compared statistically using a two-sample, two-tailed t_test. 

Results:
The average leaf surface area of the controll population watered with regular water was 3.31 cm2, which was smaller than the average leaf surface area of the experimental population watered with saltwater, which was 4.14 cm2. The error bars, representing one standard deviation of the controll and sample populations, respectively, are represented in Figure 1 and exhibit overlapping values between the two groups. The two-sample t_test resulted in 4 degrees of freedom and a t-value of 1.44. In addition, the p_value of the two-tailed t_test was 0.22. 

Discussion:
Overall, this experimental data did not support the original hypothesis. The average leaf surface area of the controll population, watered with regular water, was nearly 1 cm2 less than that of the sample population, watered with saltwater, which is opposite of the original hypothesis that predicted that the sample population would exhibit smaller leaf surface areas than the controll population. In addition, none of the data collected through this experiment could draw any definitive conclusions due to the statistical insignificance of the values. The p_value of 0.22 from the two-sample t_test between the leaf surface areas of the controll and sample populations proved any difference between the data of the two groups insignificent. The phenotypic variation predicted through the article on the decreased leaf surface area after water and other essential nutrient limitations in experimental plant populations did not occur despite the resource allocation imposed on the subjects [Matesanz: 2018]. Possibly, the 6 M NaCl solution did not provide enough of a limitation on the Raphanus sativus plants to force them to participate in resource allocation. In addition, some other uncontrollled variable could have been at play considering the conditions in which the plants were housed included other experimental groups using different chemicals and conditions and contamination easily could have occurred from watering vessels, etc. Another possible contributor to the above results could have been the condition of the third plant in the controll population. By the end of the two weeks, the leaves were yellowing indicating the plant likely dying. This easily could have skewed the results and might have been caused, again, by contamination or the fact that the particular plant received significently more sunlight each day due to its placement in the greenhouse. Possible future study could involve changing the salt concentration to impose a greater effect on the plant, possibly producing more significent results. Such study could contribute to the overall study of the effect of saltwater on phenotypic plasticity in plants, including plant injury in relation to saltwater, which is known to occur due to chlorine buildup in an exposed plant [Perry: 2016]. The study of phenotypic plasticity in resource allocation for plants can apply to a wider field than biological study, including agriculture, as well as in climate change studies as plants are exposed to different chemicals, which could help predict the responses of plants to such exposures and examine the implications for the greater environment as well as human health [Nicolopoulou-Stamati: 2016].
