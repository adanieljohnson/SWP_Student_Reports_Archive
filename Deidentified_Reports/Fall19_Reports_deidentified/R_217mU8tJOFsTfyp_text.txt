Title: Plant Allocation: Effects of Salinity on Growth of Buckwheat Plants

Abstract:
Resource allocation is employed by various biological organisms in order to obtain enough sunlight, water, and nutrients to survive in resource-limited ecosystems. This study aimed to determine if salt had a detrimental effect on the growth of buckwheat plant roots and shoots, causing the root:shoot ratio to be shorter. To test this question, six plants were watered with water and six were treated with saline solution for two weeks. Roots and shoots were then measured and weighed and results were analyzed using a two-sample t-test. It was found that there was a statistically significant difference between root:shoot ratio of the plants grown in the saline solution compared to those grown in water. The results indicated that the hypothesis was supported; that the plants treated with saline solution would have a smaller root:shoot ratio. Future studies could examine the effects of other chemical compounds, like sodium carbonate, on root:shoot ratios of plants to determine if there is a positive or negative effect on plant growth.

Introduction:
The ability of plants to allocate resources is critical for them to survive in changing ecological communities. Various living and nonliving factors in the environment affect plants’ access to sufficient water, sunlight, and nutrients. Saline is a chemical compound sometimes found in soil that impacts plant growth, causing affected plants to employ resource allocation strategies to maintain important biological processes. Stalinization of soil is an extremely serious environmental problem in agriculture all over the world because of its adverse effects on plant growth. First, salt generally decreases the photosynthesis and respiration rate of plants [Mizrahi: 1985]. It also interrupts cellular homeostasis and increases the osmotic pressure of the soil, leading to a decrease in the availability of water to the plant [Hayward: 1949]. These injurious effects can lead to ionic toxicity which in turn has a detrimental impact on plant productivity and growth [Hasanuzzaman: 2013]. Given the decrease in accessible water and increase in toxicity encountered by plants grown in saline-contaminated soil, they are forced to re-distribute their resources and adapt to their new environmental conditions in order to succeed. This concept, also known as phenotypic plasticity, is important because it influences the ability of a species to withstand environmental change and influences patterns of evolutionary diversity [Sultan: 2000].
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of salinity on plants’ resource allocation, conveyed through their root:shoot ratios. This information is pivotal to understanding changes in growth trajectories of plants in environments contaminated with salt. In this lab, the impact of salinity on faopyrum escultentum, also known as buckwheat plants, was studied. Buckwheat is an antioxidant-rich plant cultivated for its highly nutritious whole grain properties. The response of buckwheat to salinity was tested through measuring root and shoot lengths, masses, and ratios in both an experimental and a control group. In this experiment, it is hypothesized that if buckwheat are plants treated with saline solution, then they will have a smaller root:shoot ratio, compared to buckwheat plants treated with regular water. The root:shoot ratio will likely be smaller because salt typically decreases both root and shoot growth as a result of less access to necessary resources. Therefore, the length of roots and shoots in the experimental group will presumably be shorter than those in the control group, causing the ratio to minimize as well.

Materials and Methods:
48 buckwheat plant seeds were obtained and set aside while 12 plastic trays were filled with vermiculite soil. 6 trays were soaked with H2O and given 50mL of miracle grow and 6 were soaked with NaCl and given 50mL of miracle grow. In each tray, holes the size of a large thumbprint were made in the vermiculite and 4 seeds were placed in the center of each tray. Each hole was then gently covered with vermiculite and all of the trays were placed in sunlight in the greenhouse. Everyday for the next two weeks, the 6 trays were watered with clean water and 6 trays were treated with saline solution. During the following lab, all 12 plants were removed from the trays (being careful not to tear any of the thin roots) and gently washed. The 12 plants were cut where the root turned into a shoot (identified by a color change from green to white), and each individual root and shoot was measured with a ruler (in cm). Each root and shoot was also weighed using a scale (in g), and the individual masses were recorded for each plant. The root:shoot ratio was then calculated and recorded for both length and weight of the 12 plants.  The results of the experiment were then analyzed using a two-sample t-test.

Results:
The average plant root length for the buckwheat plants with the saline treatment was 8.92 ± 3.04, whereas, for the plants with water it was 22.38 ± 5.48. The average plant shoot length for the buckwheat plants with the saline treatment was 12.17 ± 1.36, whereas, for the plants with water it was 18.3 ± 3.97.  The average plant root mass for the buckwheat plants with the saline treatment was 0.13 ± 0.10, whereas, for the plants with water it was .24 ± 0.42. The average plant shoot mass for the buckwheat plants with the saline treatment was 0.42 ± 0.26, whereas, for the plants with water it was 1.05 ± 0.42. Lastly, the average root:shoot ratio length of the plant with the saline treatment was 0.72 ± 0.20, whereas, for the plants with water it was 1.23 ± 0.23 and the average root:shoot ratio mass of the plant with the saline treatment was 0.36 ± 0.28, whereas, for the plants with water it was .40 ± 0.09. These results are shown in Figure 1, 2, and 3. A two-sample t-test used to test the significance of the results suggested that root:shoot length ratio produced statistically significant results (t=3.7, 0.002, df=9), whereas the root:shoot mass ratio did not produce statistically significant results (t=0.30, p=0.38, df=9).


Discussion:
The results of this experiment indicated that the average root:shoot ratio for length was statistically significant, whereas the average root:shoot ratio for mass was not significant between the control and experimental groups. Salt has numerous adverse effects on plants, causing them to re-distribute their resources in various ways. According to one study, salinity generally reduces the growth of plant shoots more than the growth of roots [Shalhevet: 1995] and according to another study, leaf growth is more sensitive to salinity than root growth [Munns: 1986]. This supports the statistically significant results obtained for average root:shoot length, causing the shoot lengths to be disproportionate to the root lengths. It also upholds the idea that in an environment with limited access to water, the idea of resource allocation would suggest that roots would be longer in order to uptake more water and other necessary resources. In this study, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis to conclude that saline solution does in fact have an effect on root:shoot ratios in buckwheat plants. Though the average root-to-shoot mass ratios did not produce statistically significant results, the general trend was that the plants treated with salinity had smaller ratios than the plants treated with water, as shown in Figure 3. The lack of a significant p-value could be explained by human error of measuring and planting. In the control group, for example, one tray did not germinate, affecting the obtained data. This was a limitation of the study, in addition to the short time period in which data was collected. In the first week of observation, there appeared to be little difference between the plants treated with saline solution and those treated with water. In the second week of observation, however, the difference in plant growth was noticeable to the human eye. Future studies could provide more clear results by testing a higher volume of plants over a longer period of time.
The results support the idea that salinity has an effect on plant biological processes by negatively impacting growth. This is consistent with the findings of Budagovskaya that suggest that increasing concentrations of NaCl to the root area of buckwheat plants results in a rapid decrease in the growth rate of shoots [Budagovskaya 2010]. Future experiments should examine the effects of other chemical compounds, like sodium carbonate, on root:shoot ratios of plants to determine if there is a positive or negative effect on plant growth.
