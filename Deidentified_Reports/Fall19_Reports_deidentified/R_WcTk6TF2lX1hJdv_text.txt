Title: The effect of insect growth regulator on the weight of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is commonly known as the sphinx moth, hawk moth, and tobacco hornworm. The life cycle of Manduca sexta is about 32-48 days long depending on their environmental conditions. Manduca sexta has been a model organism since the 1960s to gain a better understanding of the effects of hormonal controls and developmental stages. [Kingslover:2007]. Its life cycle is described to be a holometabolous life cycle which means that includes four life stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult stages.  Manduca sexta is a known prime model organism due to the life stages being very distinguishable from one another. Insects in generally rely heavily on hormones to dictate how and when certain developmental stages are reached in their life cycles. Manduca sexta relies on multiple types of hormones to trigger the progression of life stages. Our focus will be on Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone(JH). 20E regulates timing of molting during insect development and addition functions in adult insects; it is produced in the prothoracic glands. JH is produced mainly in the corpus allata. It regulates the type of molt Manduca sexta undergoes during development and like E20, regulates multiple functions in adult insects[Johnson:2019]. Manduca sexta has 5 larval instars, each separated by molts. Depending on which stages, the Manduca sexta is in the levels of JH and E20 hormone vary. How would Methoprene, an IGR that mimics JH functions, would affect the development of Manduca sexta? Insect growth regulator (IGR) has been shown to affect the development and growth of other organisms. Manduca sexta is also commonly known as a pest and hindering its developmental process is extremely important. Why? They can be detrimental to the growth of tobacco and tomato crops. In previous experiments done by Wolfgang, state that the application of a juvenile hormone analog Methoprene prevented this change in protein synthesis and in lamellar structure by preventing the observed rise in the intermolt ecdysteroid.[Wolfgang:1985] In our experiment, we will observe if Manduca sexta reacts to certain dosages of IGR present in their environment? We hypothesize that the development of the Manduca sexta that are treated with IGR, Methoprene, will not grow and reach developmental stages that are typical for this organism. We will dictate the effect of Methoprene by recording the mass of a sample of Manduca sexta.

Materials and Methods:
We prepared containers by puncturing holes in them to allow airflow for insects. Next, the containers were labeled accordingly, 1-4 for the control and 5-8 for the treatment group. We then weighed ten grams of insect feed, added 7 pipet drops of water, and mixed thoroughly to distribute the water evenly. This was done for all four caterpillars. A similar process was done for the experimental group but drops of pre-diluted IGR were added to the insect feed. Once the insect food had been prepared for each group, the 10 grams of food for each caterpillar was clumped together to avoid dehydration. This process was done so for both the control and treatment groups accordingly. The Manduca sexta was kept in an incubator to maintain a consistent environment. Each caterpillar was monitored daily by replacing food with new food, weighing them, and taking note of their physical appearance. A one-tailed two-sample t-test was done to see if there is a significant difference between both groups.

Results:
The mean of the control group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t-stat=0.49,df=28, P=0.31). Overall there was an upward trend in terms of mass for both the control and experimental group. The control group grew as expected, the color was consistently green, and movement was observable. The experimental group grew at a slower rate than the control group. Discoloration and limited movement were observed. As seen in Figure 1, days 1-5 the control and experimental were consistently increasing in mass but on day 6, the control and experimental started to deviate in weight. During day 5-6, discoloration in the experimental group began reaching a pale blue while the control group was a more vibrant blue and green. 

Discussion:
Our results do not support our hypothesis due to our p-value being above 0.05, so we accept our null hypothesis that states that our control and experimental groups are not statistically different.  In previous experiments done by Kingslover and Wolfgang, emphasize that methoprene did inhibit Manduca sexta from pupating. There could have not been a significant difference in our results due to not adding enough Methoprene added to the Manduca sexta food. In Kingslover’s experiment, the Manduca sexta were treated with Methoprene grew about 50% larger than expected.[Kingslover:2007]. JH hormone is supposed to hinder pupation and that it did but there was not a major difference between the control and experimental. Wolfgang’s experiment it was observed that the fall of JH is necessary for them to be a switch in protein synthesis and therefore changing the lamellar structure Wolfgang:1985]. So, the increase of the JH analog would inhibit Manduca sexta from developing into the next molt and allowing it to grow in its present molt. This is what was expected to occur in our experiment. The only observable differences were apparent such as color, the Manduca sexta that were treated with Methoprene were pale green while the control group had a more vibrant green color. To determine the effects of Methoprene on Manduca sexta further experiments with varying concentrations should be conducted in order to learn more as to how much is the appropriate concentration and dosage is required to stop growth in the organism. Although our experiment was unsuccessful there is still much room for improvement to efficiently inhibit the development of Manduca sexta. There possibly could have been very little methoprene to affect the growth of the Manduca sexta, due to the finding the JH hormone does affect growth but given in large amounts that exceed 5 micrograms of Methoprene. Finding a way to control the development and growth of known pests is vital to assure the growth of crops and other vegetation that is necessary for humanity. /
