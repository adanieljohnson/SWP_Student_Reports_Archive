Title: Time Until Habituation for Betta splendins in Response to Stimuli of Different Shapes and Colors

Abstract:
 Habituation is a learned behavior that occurs when an organism shows a decline in response to a constant stimulus. It occurs in Betta splendins when they stop performing aggressive behaviors toward a given stimulus. This experiment studied how long it took for habituation to occur in Betta fish when they were placed in contact with different colored and shaped foam cutouts. Each Betta fish was placed in a tank with an empty neighboring compartment where the different stimuli were placed to observe the behavioral reaction of the Betta fish to see if it exhibited any aggression. This study found that according to the quantifiable data, there was a statistical difference between the live Betta fish controll group and the foam cutouts, but there was not any statistical difference between the foam cutouts themselves. Therefore, this study found that there was no difference in the habituation time of Betta fish when exposed to different colors or shapes. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins (Betta fish), particularly males, exhibit different forms of aggressive behavior when provoked by different stimuli [Johnson: 2019]. According to Johnson and Mallison, the aggressive behaviors of the Betta fish can be classified in two categories: broadside movements and facing movements. The time a Betta fish remains aggressive, showing various agnostic behaviors, depends on the its perceived severity of the threat. In certain instances, the Betta fish can show habituation if they no longer respond to a stimulus with any broadside or facing movements. Previous studies have presented evidence that Betta fish eventually experience habituation when exposed to other live Betta fish [Peeke: 1969] and their mirror image [Clayton: 1967]. According to Clayton and Hinde and Peeke and Peeke, when subjected to a mirror image of itself or another live Betta fish, the aggressive behavior of Betta fish will decrease over time, therefore causing habituation. This study will extend these previous studies by looking at the behavioral response of Betta fish to foam cutouts of different shapes and colors to see how long habituation takes. In order to not harm any of the Betta fish, the maximum amount of time for exposure to the stimuli was five minutes. This study will observe the reaction of Betta fish to a red foam Betta fish cutout, a red foam circle cutout, a blue foam Betta fish cutout and a blue foam circle cutout. The hypothesis of this experiment was that the blue foam cutout of a Betta fish would cause the most aggressive behavior in the Betta fish, therefore it would take the longest time to habituate in comparison to the other foam cutouts. 

Materials and Method:
Three similar Betta splendins fish were obtained and isolated into three adjacent tanks each separated by an opaque and clear partition. After five minutes, one of the opaque partitions was removed, and two of the fish were observed as they responded to each other. The fish were visually separated after five minutes and allowed to rest. This was repeated once more with the other two fish in order to get a controll of how the Betta fish respond to other Betta fish. After adequate time for the fish to rest, the middle fish was relocated to a nonadjacent fourth tank. For five minutes, each fish was then placed in visual contact with a blue foam cutout of a Betta fish to observe its aggressive response. The live Betta fish was then given five minutes to rest. The last two steps were repeated with a blue foam circle cutout, a red foam Betta cutout, and a red foam circle cutout. The amount of time it took for each Betta fish to stop showing aggressive behavior once it started was recorded for each different stimulus. Furthermore, observations of the Betta fish’s aggressive behavior during the experiment was recorded. An ANOVA test was then used to determine the statistical significance of the results.

Results:
The average time until a male Betta fish showed habituation when exposed to another male Betta fish was 233.4 seconds. When exposed to a red foam Betta fish cutout, habituation time was 32.12 seconds, and for a blue foam fish cutout, habituation took 39.6 seconds. Habituation for both the red foam circle cutout and the blue foam circle cutout took zero seconds to occur. According to the ANOVA test, there was significent difference (P=0.000336) in the difference of habituation time for Betta fish in response other Betta fish than to the foam cutouts. The ANOVA test also shows that the results between the live Betta fish and all the foam cutouts are significent, but the results between the cutouts are not significent. This data is shown in Figure 1. The observations of the Betta fish’s behavioral response to each stimulus was recorded in Table 1.

Discussion:
This study’s goal was to test the habituation rate of Betta splendins when exposed to different stimuli in order to see the effect color and shape had on determining the fish’s aggressive behavioral response. The hypothesis of this experiment was that the blue foam Betta fish cutout would take the longest time to cause habituation since the Betta fish would act the most aggressive to it. According to the statistical tests, this hypothesis was rejected. The ANOVA test showed no significance between any of the foam cutouts. However, there was a statistical significance in the habituation time between the controll group: live Betta fish, and the experimental group: foam cutouts. This statistical significance means that the Betta fish respond aggressively for a longer amount of time to other Betta fish than foam fish and circle cutouts. This result is supported by similar studies which found that another fish was a better stimulus than mirrors and models of fish [Rhoad: 1975]. According to Rhoad, Kalat and Klopfer, a Betta fish’s aggressive behavior response waned progressively from a living fish to a mirror image to a moving model and, lastly, to a stationary model. This is congruent with our study that a living Betta fish as a stimulus resulted in more aggressive behavior and took longer for habituation in Betta fish than our models. Another study found that shape alone did not have a significent effect on behavioral response [Johnson: 1973]. The results found in Johnson and Johnson’s study concur with this study’s quantitative data. Our quantitative data show that there is no statistical significance between the foam cutouts shaped like a Betta fish and the circle cutouts. However, there was a difference based on our observations. Regarding the non-quantitative, observational data, the Betta fish reacted more aggressively to the foam Betta fish cutout than to the foam circle cutout. The Betta fish made no acknowledgment of the red and blue foam circle cutouts, but they showed both extreme tail flapping and broadside movements to the look-alike cutouts. Although our observational data made it seemed as if the Betta fish responded more aggressively to the Betta cutouts than the circle cutouts, the quantifiable data is not statistically significent. Further tests will have to study the effect of shape in detail in order to confirm our results. Additionally, our results also found that there was no statistical significance between the color of the cutout. Betta fish responded similarly to blue and red cutouts. This portion of our results slightly differs from results of other studies. Other studies found that Betta fish show less aggressive behaviors to differently-colored males than similarly-colored males [Bones: 2017]. Bones and Johnson found that a different colored male caused less aggression from the Betta fish which is contrary to our results that there was no difference in response to color. Bones and Johnson did not examine the habituation time of different colored stimuli, thus further studies must be done in order to corroborate the exact results of our study. One flaw in our study could be that the foam cutouts did not look similar enough to a male Betta fish, so they were not as threatening to the tested fish. Perhaps, if our foam cutouts were more threatening, the Betta fish would have responded more aggressively to them. Nevertheless, if further studies verify our results then this could help scientist in their collection of additional data on fish. Scientists could use foam cutouts to store data sensors and get close enough to the fish without causing the fish’s stress levels to rise to a potentially deadly level. The collection of more data will only enhance our understanding of biological processes especially that of Betta splendins.
