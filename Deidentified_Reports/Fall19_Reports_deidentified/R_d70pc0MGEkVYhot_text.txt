Abstract:
Hormone regulation is an important topic in agriculture and . With ____ going on it is important to consider how _____. The prediction was that (insert hypothesis). Our data showed_____. This (significance or insignificance), in addition to observation of manduca sexta development after treatment with the JH suggests that ___. 

Introduction:
This experiment examines the effects of hormones on insect growth and development. Hormones are regulatory substances that play a critical role in the development of insects. The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco worm, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. The Manduca sexta follows the holometabolous life cycle which develops in stages: egg/ embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. Tobacco worms control growth, development, behaviors, and other processes using hormone and neuron based signaling [Johnson: 2019]. This species was selected as the model organism by reason of simplicity in the altercation of its hormone levels. A substantial portion of this species’ development is mediated by three hormones: Prothoracicotropic hormones, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone. In response to a neurological signal, endocrine cells in the brain produce prothoracicotropic hormones which are then transported to and released in the corpus cardiacum. Subsequently, Prothoracicotropic hormone stimulates the prothoracic gland to secrete ecdysone. Each time ecdysone is released, a molt is stimulated, taking the instar larva through its developmental stages: larva, pupa, and adult. Molting enables the insect to change size and continue development. The corpus allatum is responsible for producing juvenile hormone in declining amounts. Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt the Manduca sexta undergoes during development. When the juvenile hormone reaches extremely low levels, the larva creates a cocoon around it, molting into a Pupa. Due to the fact that the pupa does not produce juvenile hormone, it is able to undergo metamorphosis into an adult [Johnson: 2019]. These hormones are known as insect growth regulators as they have the ability to affect regulatory processes in insects that are integral for normal development. As stated in the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry, “an insect growth regulator does not have to be toxic to its target. Instead it leads to abnormalities that reduce insect survival” [Tunaz: 2004]. This study treats a group of Manduca sexta with juvenile hormone, in order to test the effectiveness of juvenile hormone as a “pesticide” to insects similar to Manduca sexta.The tobacco worm is considered a pest during its larval stages. Pesticides are often harmful to both the environment and its inhabitants. Their toxic composition, often eradicates not only the desired pest, but the surrounding environment and its inhabitants as well. Treating pests with hormones could serve as a viable method in maintaining a healthy environment, while disposing of plants or insects that potentially disrupt growth of plants or longevity of life. If treated with the Juvenile Hormone, the Manduca sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the control group (the group not treated with any substance). 

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta, were examined by permission of the Wake Forest University Biology department. All specimens examined were studied in their larval state. Four Manduca sexta were treated with five drops of IG Regulator 1:125 (Juvenile hormone) and four were treated with five drops of di water. Two containers with four compartments were prepared by placing holes for oxygenation, and labeled according to treatment type, lab section, group names. Each compartment of the control container and the treatment container were numbered 1-4 in order to differentiate between and identify each Manduca sexta. Ten grams of food were placed in each compartment after being treated with the reagent or di water. The initial weight of each Manduca sexta was recorded in grams, and weight recordings were measured each day for the subsequent thirteen days. Food was replaced with a new ten gram blob when dried out or when feces were present in the compartment. 

Results:
A t-test was applied to compare the data found in the experiment. The average weight of the four control and four treatment groups were calculated for each day, and the average weight change was calculated for each day. A one tailed t-test found the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat= 0.971793, df= 26, P= .170054). It was found that the null hypothesis was not rejected; the treatment group’s rate of growth was not statistically less than that of the control group. This is due to the fact that the p-value was greater than .05. Figure one depicts the average change in growth of the Manduca sexta (measured in weight) of the control and treatment groups over fourteen days. Between days seven and day eleven, the treatment group grew more than the control group. Days twelve through day fourteen showed weight loss in the control group, day thirteen showed weight loss in the treatment group. Overall, the treatment group grew at a faster rate than the control group, although the difference in the rate of growth was not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
Manduca sexta growth and development was not significantly inhibited by juvenile hormone treatment. The hypothesis that if treated with the juvenile hormone, the Manduca sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the control group was not supported. This experiment measured growth in weight, and gathered data points across fourteen days. The hypothesis, therefore, stated the weights of the Manduca sexta treated with Juvenile hormone would be overall lower than that of the Manduca sexta treated with di water. findings demonstrated, overall, that the weight of the tobacco worms treated with juvenile hormone were higher than that of the control group, although these results were not considered statistically significant. Juvenile hormone acts as an insect growth regulator by regulating the molting patterns of Manduca sexta as it undergoes development. Extremely low levels of Juvenile hormone results in pupa molting. 
Carroll Williams examines these insect growth regulators known as third generation pesticides, arguing that insect hormones, “promise to provide insecticides that are not only more specific but also proof against the evolution of resistance” [Williams: 1967]. Hormone regulators as pesticides are integral to study due to societies harmful efforts to control pests. Currently, many pesticides are toxic to other insects as well as the surrounding environment [Williams: 1967].

Figure Legends: 
This graph shows a comparison between the average growth of Manduca seat under varying conditions. The average change in growth over fourteen days for the control and treatment groups is demonstrated. The data indicates there was more growth in the juvenile hormone treatment group than the control group treated with di water. *************************************************************************
