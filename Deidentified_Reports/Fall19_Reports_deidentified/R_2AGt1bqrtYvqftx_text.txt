Title: Effects of the Addition of Juvenile Hormone on the Life Cycle of  Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
none

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is considered a pest to many crops. These worms in their juvenile form, can severely damage tomatoes and tomato like crops. The development of Manduca sexta is controllled by a variety of hormones. These hormones send signals throughout the body, which can trigger responses such as a response to the environment, or structural bodily changes. Specific hormones instrumental to the development of the tobacco hornworm are Ecdysterone(20E) and Juvenile hormone(JH)[Johnson-2019]. 20E helps to regulate the timing of molts while an insect is developing. On the other hand, JH regulates the type of molt the hornworm experiences. Both of these hormones in specific concentrations work together to controll the growth of the manduca sexta. An important example of this occurs during the 5th larval instar. During this time, levels of JH drop, marking the first time levels of 20E are higher than the levels of JH. This signal is known as the commitment pulse, and signals to the caterpillar that it is ready to pupate. Altering the concentrations of one of these 2 important hormones could potentially affect the development of the organism. We are interested specifically in the response that altering the concentration of JH has on the tobacco hornworm. We hypothesize that if treated with the Juvenile hormone, the manduca sexta will develop at a slower rate than that of the controll group. Since the lowering concentrations of JH is necessary for the hornworm to experience the commitment pulse, altering its concentration has the ability to cause a change in its life cycle.


Materials and Method:
8 tobacco hornworms were placed in individual plastic plastic containers. Two holes were poked in the side of each individual compartment to provide the hornworms with oxygen. 10 grams of food were weighed and placed in each individual compartment. 4 of the hornworms were part of the treatment group. This group received 5 drops of JH mixed in with their food. The controll group also contained 4 hornworms. This group received 5 drops of water mixed in with their food. The hornworms were weighed initially and placed in their containers. The growth of each individual hornworm was documented by weighing and recording of their individual masses every day. The food in each of the compartments was replaced once it began to dry out. The food was completely replaced, with the treatment group again receiving 5 drops of JH and the controll group receiving 5 drops of water. To determine the reproducibility of our experiment we used a two-sample t_test comparing the daily change in weight between the 2 groups.


Results:
All hornworms in both the treatment and controll groups survived the experiment. Slight variations were detected in the growth of the treatment and the controll groups. The hornworms in the treatment group grew on average 1.0569g per day. The hornworms in the controll group grew on average 0.57734g per day. The average daily growth rates of both groups are depicted in figure 1, showing the average growth experienced by each group per day.  The one-tailed p value of this data is 0.17. On average, the controll group grew faster than the treatment group until day 12. After day 12, the controll group began to lose weight. The average weight of the hornworms over time is depicted by figure 2. Both groups grew at a similar rate until around day 6, when the controll group began growing at a faster rate. By day 12, the controll group was losing weight while the treatment group was still gaining weight.


Discussion:
Overall, the addition of the Juvenile Hormone had some effect on the manduca sexta. Overall, the treatment group grew at a slower rate until day 12, suggesting that the JH could have potentially inhibited its growth Although the average daily growth favors the treatment group, this was likely due to the controll group losing weight, skewing its daily growth average. Overall,  the controll group began its weight loss around day 12. This weight loss can be explained by the life cycle of the manduca sexta. Once the hornworm reaches the commitment pulse, its growth begins to stop as it now enters the wandering stage preparing to pupate[Grunert-2015]. Our hornworms experienced a similar weight loss, potentially indicating that they had reached the wandering stage. This stage is an essential part in the development of the hornworms, indicating they are ready to move onto the next life stage. If our controll hornworms were losing weight in order to pupate, it would indicate a greater rapidity in their development in contrast to the treatment group. This means that the development of the treatment group was slowed by the addition of the JH. The slower rate of development was most likely due to the fact that the addition of JH prevented the treatment group from reaching its commitment pulse, an important signal in beginning pupation. This explanation would prove our alternate hypothesis, that the development of the manduca sexta receiving increased JH would be slower in comparison to that of the controll. To determine whether this explanation is accurate, it would be necessary in a future experiment to lengthen the duration of the experiment. If the experiment was continued over the course of another week or two, it would provide clear results on whether the controll group had reached the commitment pulse or not. If the controll group began to pupate within a few days, it would support the explanation of reaching the wandering phase. If not, another explanation such as lack of proper food could be the cause of the weight loss experienced by the controll group. Overall, the results of this experiment can help to exemplify the role that JH plays in the life cycle of manduca sexta. Studying the effects of particular hormones on insect populations has many potential benefits. Certain hormones have the potential to be used as pesticides, by keeping certain organisms in one stage of their life cycle. Further research in usage of hormones as pesticides can help prevent loss of crop leading to financial and ecological problems in the future.
