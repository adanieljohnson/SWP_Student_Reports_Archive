Title: The effects of alkaline water on resource allocation in Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the process in which plants dedicate energy to development. The plant’s growth and internal processes can be affected based on where resources are allocated, and that’s influenced by factors such as water availability and sunlight. Resource allocation can be physically seen in a plant’s roots and shoots. In this study, we hypothesized that radish plants, Raphanus sativus, would have weaker roots when exposed to alkaline water. With 36 control and 36 treatment plants, we saturated them with water everyday for 2 weeks. The treatment group received 50mL of 9.5 pH water as the treatment variable. We then measured the plants total weight, root length and weight, shoot length and weight. We used those numbers to find the root: shoot ratio, which can be used to compare where a plant dedicates its resources. A one tailed, two-sample t-test was used. Of the sample, the p-value for weight was 0.007, and the p-value for length was 0.04. Both values were of significance, meaning that we can accept the alternate hypothesis. There was a correlation between plant growth and alkaline water exposure. When observed, the treatment plants had roots that were brittle and weak. Future studies would be needed to further confirm this hypothesis, and to also see if other factors in

Introduction:
Resource allocation is the ability for a plant to dedicated energy to its development. This energy, formed from photosynthesis and metabolism, can be used to specifically target internal processes to help manage growth. Allocation can affect an individual plant’s properties, such as its structure, or an entire community’s species distribution [James: 2005]. For smaller, herbaceous plants, such as Raphanus sativus (the radish), structural growth is important for nutrient transfer. Radish plants are small plants that have herbaceous stems and grow quickly. Having plants that grow quickly enables us to capture data in a short period of time. The roots  of the plant intake water and nutrients from the soil, and the shoot helps reach sunlight. However, what were to happen if the water pH was changed? How would the plant change its growth? How can we trace this growth change back to resource allocation? For Chinese cabbage plants, when using a weak alkaline solution in soil, heavy metal concentrations, specifically cadmium, were increased. The increase rate of heavy metal consumption caused the plants to have a slower growth phase, meaning that shoots were not as tall [Ai: 2016]. In radish plants, we hypothesize that the roots will be shorter due to an alkaline solution used in soil, causing the plant to dedicate more resources to shoot growth. Because of this, the root:shoot ratios will be less than 1, since shoot values will be larger.

Materials and Methods:
In all, there were 72 radish plants that were used for the study. 36 were dedicated for control, and 36 were dedication for treatment. The seeds were planted in groups of 12, across 3 planter boxes for both control and treatment. The plants were planted in Vermiculite and held in a greenhouse for two weeks. For the two weeks, each group was watered each day until the soil was dark and moist. The treatment group received 50mL of alkaline water, at a pH of 9.5, in addition to water. The independent variable for both groups was pH of water. The dependent variable we were measuring is the root development. To determine plant growth, each plant’s total weight, root weight, shoot weight, root length, and shoot length were measured. A root to shoot ratio was used for both the weight and the length to determine the plant’s resource allocation. A one tailed, two-sample T test was used to statistically measure the data, with an alpha of 0.05 for data significance. Since we are studying root development, we will take the p values for both length and weight root: shoot ratios. Not all of the plants survived, with 26 for the control group and 29 for the treatment being used in this sample, creating a sample size that’s necessary for a T test. 

Results:
At a 0.05 alpha value, results were significant for both length and weight root:shoot ratios. For length, the p-value was 0.04, and for weight, the p-value was 0.007. General trends seen was a smaller, more concise standard deviation for the control groups, versus a large deviation for the treatment group.  In Figure 1, the averages and standard deviations are compared between the control and treatment groups. For the R:S weight, the control group had an average ratio of 0.71 +/- 0.16 and the treatment had an average ratio of 0.31 +/- 0.21. For the R:S length, the control group had an average ratio of 1.77 +/- 0.61, and the treatment had an average ratio of 1.50 +/- 0.02. Observations when handling the plants showed that physically, the roots in the treatment group were brittle. When separating the roots from the soil and from other plants, it was easy to tear. Since the roots did not take much effort to take apart, there is a loss of root mass.

Discussion:
Since the p values were of significance, we are allowed to accept the alternate hypothesis, that plant roots are shorter and less structurally sound when exposed to alkaline water. Having an alkaline water that is more basic, 9.5, than neutral, 7, puts structural stress on the plant. The plant is needing to dedicate more resources to shoot growth, in order to make up for the lack of normal nutrient exports in the roots. There is a correlation between root growth and exposure to alkaline water. Multiple experiments need to be completed in order to confirm a causation. When in contact with alkaline water, it’s harder for plants to have nutrient uptake, due to the pH corroding the structural system [James: 2005]. Plant growth is affected by resource allocation, which determines which processes or structures of the plants have the most focus during development. For our treatment plants, their shoots were taller, but their roots were shorter and had less mass. When compared to our control plants, they had roots that were longer with higher values of mass, meaning that they were able to allocate resources to their root systems more than the treatment plants. Things like water, sunlight, and nutrient access affect resource allocation. In a previous study, it was suggested that a plant’s development could be limited by nutrient availability in the soil [James: 2005]2. Future studies could do a soil toxicology sample on nutrient levels after using alkaline water, to see if there’s a correlation between the pH and chemical composition. Understanding resource allocation can lead to better conservation methods of at-risk species and improve crop production for farmers. If it’s possible to identify what resource is lacking, and how that’s affecting a plant’s development, then steps can be taken to fix the scarcity.
