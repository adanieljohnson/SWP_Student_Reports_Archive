Title: Effect of Soil Composition on Root/Shoot Ratios in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
	Understanding how soil type affects pant growth is extremely important for agricultural food production. Soils with lower nutrient content or nutrients that are more difficult to obtain require plants to allocate more energy towards growing below ground, roots. This takes away from the energy they are able to allocate towards above ground growth, shoots which are often the source of food. For this experiment we investigated the affect clay soil had on the root/shoot length and mass ratios in Vigna radiata. The expectation was that plants grown in soil would allocate more energy to root growth resulting in larger root/shoot ratios. Our data supported this expectation showing a significant increase in root/shoot ratio in plants grown in clay versus vermiculite soil. This suggests plants grown in clay soil areas, must allocate more resources to root growth than those in more fertile environments. This is important for crop production in areas with high clay content in soil such as Africa, where food is generally more difficult to obtain.

Introduction:
	Plant growth is incredibly important worldwide as agriculture is world’s source of food. Because of this farmers and agricultural scientists try to find the best conditions to grow crops in in order to produce the most food. One important aspect in this study of plant growth is soil composition. This cannot always be controlled as certain areas have limited amounts of fertile soil, particularly in Africa where much of he farm land is clay rather than traditional soil. In these areas, plants clearly show their phenotypic plasticity, differing phenotypes of the same genotype as a result of some stimuli, to adapt to various abiotic factors. The most important way this is shown is through crop yields; plants grown in more fertile soil rather than clay are able to adapt there phenotype to yield more crop rather than having to allocate more energy to resource collection like the plants in lower quality soil [Zingore: 2007]. These phenotypic changes often depend on resource allocation; the process by which plants dedicate portions of their limited resources and energy to growth in particular areas where it is needed most. One of the ways to observe, measure and compare this through the root/shoot ratio in terms of length and mass. This measurement relates the amount of energy a plant dedicates to obtaining resources below ground, roots, to the amount of energy a plant dedicates to obtaining resources above ground, shoots [Monk: 1966]. In this lab we will measure the root/shoot ratios of the species Vigna radiata commonly referred to as the mung bean plant. Mung beans grow relatively fast and do not require much care, so they are a model organism for laboratory study of plants. They also have fairly defined root/shoot junctions to help in the measurement of root/shoot ratios. We will grow them in both vermiculite (soil) and clay environments. Because the clay is more difficult to grow in, we hypothesized that plants in a clay environment would allocate more energy to root growth and would thus have larger root/shoot ratios for length and mass than those of plants grown in soil.

Materials and Methods:
	Six groups of twelve (36 total) Vigna radiata plants were grown in two different soil environments: three vermiculite (control) groups and three clay (experimental) groups. They were stored in a green house with ample sunlight and watered nearly every day for two weeks with one day missed. At the end of this two-week period, the plants were carefully removed from their soil and dried before being cut at the root/shoot junction. Plants that died over this period (mostly those in clay) were removed and not measured. Each root and shoot for each plant were weighed, measured and recorded. Then the root/shoot ratios were calculating and averaged. The results were run through a one-tailed two sample t-test to determine if the average ratios of the plants grown in clay were significantly greater than those of the plants grown in vermiculite.

Results:
The mean root/shoot weight ratio for the control group was 1.49 +/- 0.77. The mean root/shoot weight ratio for the experimental clay group was 3.15 +/- 4.09 (figure 1). After this data was run through a one-tailed two sample t-test, the p-value was 0.014 showing a statistically significant difference between the groups. The mean root/shoot length ratio for the control group was 1.63 +/- 0.67. The mean root/shoot length ratio for the experimental clay group was 2.36 +/- 1.97 (figure 2). After this data was run through a one-tailed two sample t-test, the p-value was 0.030 showing a statistically significant difference between the groups. As the experiment progressed the control group seemed to grow taller out of the soil and had fewer plants wither, but when the plants were removed from the soil, the clay group had longer or similar roots to that of the control group.

Discussion:
	Our hypothesis that the Vigna radiata plants grown in clay would have higher root/shoot ratios for length and mass was supported by our results. Our data showed a statistically significant difference at the .05 level for both ratios, suggesting clay does cause plants to allocate more energy towards root growth. This means we are able to accept our alternate hypothesis and reject the null. This conclusion makes sense because the clay environment provides less nutrients below ground than the vermiculite environment meaning plants need to grow more roots to better obtain nutrients from the clay. Our data additionally is similar to that of another study focusing on soil fertility among smallholder farms in Africa. This study found soils with a higher clay content were generally less fertile. The study explained this was due to the crops’ need to allocate more growth to roots rather than crop yield [Tittonell: 2005]. Studies like these are important for crop and plant growth across the world as certain areas do not have soil with as high nutrient content as other places. This can make food production more difficult, so understanding these processes and the relationship between soil content and crop yield is extremely important. The focus on root growth is also important in crops in which the root is the major food provider of the plant such as carrots and onions. The best ways to improve or further this experiment would be to test other types of soil or plants. Testing plant growth of common agricultural crops such as wheat and corn would be more beneficial in understanding how sol content affects specifically food production. Additionally, studying other types of soil or soil mixtures would provide more information on crop growth in other parts of the world such as areas with more sandy soil. Our results support the use of higher soil content environments for crop growth.
