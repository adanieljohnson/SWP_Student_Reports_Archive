Title: Increasing the growth of Manduca Sexta with the exposure of the Juvenile Hormone, Precor.

Abstract:
Manduca sexta are a type of insect that tend to prey on plants such as potatoes, tobacco, tomatoes [Lotts: 2017]. It is more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm; named after its food source and the protruding structure on its tail. Eventually, the hornworms will metamorphosize into moths, which is their final adult stage. In order to change into its final form, two hormones that have a significant impact on the growth cycle of caterpillars, would have to be introduced: ecdysterone,which impacts the timing of molting, and juvenile hormone, which determines the type of molting [Johnson: 2019].
 Since the insect is considered a pest to major crops, the purpose of using insecticides is to either kill the insect directly or interrupt the growth-cycle of the larvae.With only having a life-span of about 30 days, the tobacco hornworm is ideal when studying the effects of insecticides on insects, specifically methoprene.  Methoprene is categorized under a type of insecticides called Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) and is an analog of juvenile hormone meaning it mimics the effects of the hormone. In this experiment, the insecticide, Precor, was used which contains methoprene [Wick:2012]. Precor is supposed to aid in the caterpillars skin cells secreting a new outer layer and changing in

Introduction:
Manduca sexta are a type of insect that tend to prey on plants such as potatoes, tobacco, tomatoes [Lotts: 2017]. It is more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm; named after its food source and the protruding structure on its tail. Eventually, the hornworms will metamorphosize into moths, which is their final adult stage. In order to change into its final form, two hormones that have a significant impact on the growth cycle of caterpillars, would have to be introduced: ecdysterone,which impacts the timing of molting, and juvenile hormone, which determines the type of molting [Johnson: 2019].
 Since the insect is considered a pest to major crops, the purpose of using insecticides is to either kill the insect directly or interrupt the growth-cycle of the larvae.With only having a life-span of about 30 days, the tobacco hornworm is ideal when studying the effects of insecticides on insects, specifically methoprene.  Methoprene is categorized under a type of insecticides called Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) and is an analog of juvenile hormone meaning it mimics the effects of the hormone. In this experiment, the insecticide, Precor, was used which contains methoprene [Wick:2012]. Precor is supposed to aid in the caterpillars skin cells secreting a new outer layer and changing in size, without the insect surpassing the 4th level instar, in which they would change into their adult form. Instead, the Precor treated caterpillars will continue to molt into juvenile versions of themselves and grow into large caterpillars [Johnson: 2019]. This preventative technique results in the caterpillars not becoming developed enough to produce the next generation larvae. 
To further prove the impact of excess juvenile hormone on the tobacco hornworms, Precor was introduced to their diet. This will answer the question on how insecticides control pest reproduction rates. It is expected that the caterpillars who have the excess hormone will continue to grow larger, without fully maturing into their adult state. The caterpillars who do not have the excess hormone will continue to molt, grow, and mature at their regular rate.


Materials and Methods:
In conducting the experiment, eight hornworm caterpillars were obtained; four of which are used as a control and the others were to be treated with the hormone. The caterpillars were measured in centimeters using a ruler and given 10g of food. The control caterpillars received food with three drops of water and the treated caterpillars were fed food with three drops of Precor. The hornworms were placed in an incubator at 26.5 degrees Celsius, until they were fed again.
The food was changed and the caterpillars length was measured daily. After each daily procedure was performed, all of the test subjects were placed back into the incubator until the next feeding and measuring. After the 15 days were up, the lengths and growth rates of the control and treated caterpillars are illustrated using a line graph and compared by way of a one-tailed p-value t-test. 


Results:
Each average was plotted on a graph that illustrated the time in days as the independent variable and the length in centimeters as the dependent variable (Figure 1).  From the data, it was noted that the difference in measurements was not significantly statistically different (P=0.389764).  Over the course of the 15 days, the general trends of the average length of each experimental group was positive. This takes into consideration that these averages could have varied with 5.42  +/- 2.66 s.d. being the average for the control group and 5.68 +/- 2.46 s.d. being the average for the treated group. Towards the three days of the experiment, the control group was observed to have higher length averages than that of the hormone treated group, and towards the last two days, both groups showed a negative trend. 

Discussion:
In conducting this experiment it was found that the hypothesis was not supported because the data concluded that introducing juvenile hormone to the diet of the Manduca-sexta offered no significant variance in comparison to the control experiment. 
Although it is known that the molting hormone is set in place for molting to occur, the presence of the juvenile hormone determines whether the cuticular structures laid down by the epidermis are to be of larval or adult type [Wigglesworth: 1962]. 
It was expected that the hornworms that were fed food with Precor would continue to molt into larval types due to the prolonged introduction of juvenile hormone, but with each molt there was not a great difference when comparing them to the control group. After four days, the worms are supposed to have reached their fourth instar, which would mean that after the fourth day the amount of naturally occurring juvenile hormone should drop [Johnson: 2019]. After dropping the worms should either be preparing for pupation (control group) or molting into an even larger fourth instar version (experimental group). From the data collected this was not concluded. The experimental data showed no real difference in the growth patterns of the two experimental groups and when comparing the daily means of their lengths, the control group had a trend measuring higher lengths. One thing to take into consideration when observing the patterns of the averages collected is that two of the control organisms died. Control organism one died after the sixth day and control organism two died after the twelfth day. When removing their data from the averages, this skewed the data toward the control group and made the mean higher.
 To get better results, collecting another set of data over the course of 1-3 more days would be able to determine if the control group would successfully go into a pupation phase and if the hormonal treated group would continue to increase in length [Rowland: 2017]. Although there was not a significant difference in growth rates between the two groups, neither of the experimental sets began to pupate. From the observations in this experiment, it can be concluded that juvenile hormone does control reproduction rates because it prevents the insects from pupating and metamorphosing into its reproductive form.

Four hornworms were tested in each experimental group and fed their assigned diet for 15 days. Lengths were measured from the tip of the hornworm to its tail. Each line represents the mean length of the four worms from each experimental group each day, error bars are +/- 2.66 s.d. for the control group and +/- 2.46 s.d. for the treated group (P=0.389764).
