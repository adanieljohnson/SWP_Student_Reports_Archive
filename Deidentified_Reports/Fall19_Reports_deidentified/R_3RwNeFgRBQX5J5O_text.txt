Title: Manduca Sexta Caterpillar Growth Inhibition by the Juvenile Hormone

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
In laboratory experiments, insects are a perfect model for analyzing the endocrine system, specifically how the role of hormones affect growth and development [Rowland: 2017]. There are multiple hormones that affect the “molting,” development, of insects. The steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) “is the initiator hormone of the molting process” [Petryk: 2003]. This hormone, regulated by the Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), affects the timing of molting [Riddiford: 2003].  Another hormone, called the juvenile hormone (JH), affects the type of molting during the critical periods of each life cycle of an insect [Nijhout: 1982]. The juvenile hormone is present during the whole development of the larva and progresses from one stage to another until it reaches its proper weight [Rowland: 2017]. The Manduca Sexta, known as the tobacco hornworm, is a common pest, which feeds on solanaceous plants, and is affected by these molting, inducing hormones [Hussa: 2012]. The Manduca Sexta has five, larval instar stages, and both 20E and the JH occur during each of these stages, collaborating to control their growth, molting, and metamorphosis [Gillet-Kaufman: 2019]. In the early instar stages, the JH prevents the caterpillars “actions in switching genetic programs necessary for metamorphosis,” inhibiting the full effect of the PTTH and 20E [Riddiford, 2012]. However, in the last larval instar stage, the juvenile hormone declines, allowing the 20E to cause pupal commitment [Johnson, 2016]. My colleagues and I wanted to understand what the impact of the juvenile hormone is on the growth (in mass) of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars. In this experiment, the hypothesis states that if the Manduca Sexta caterpillars are treated with the juvenile hormone, Precor, then their growth, measured in mass, will be less than the growth of caterpillars that aren’t treated with juvenile hormones. 

Materials and Methods:
In the experiment, the independent variables were the duration of time for the experiment (two weeks), the amount of food given to the Manduca Sexta (ten grams per caterpillar), and the amount of the juvenile hormone (Precor) used. The dependent variables were the growth and development of the Manduca Sexta measured in grams. Our control variables were the environment for the caterpillars, the duration of the experiment, and the amount of food for the caterpillars. 
To test our hypothesis, we used two groups of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars. Each group had four caterpillars, assigned to their own, similar environment (plastic containers) with food and air holes. One group was used for our control group by having no treatment of the juvenile hormone added to their food. The other group had five drops, added to their food every time it needs to be replenished, of the Precor juvenile hormone added to their food. Every day, for two weeks, the caterpillars were monitored. They were weighed by a machine (in grams) to measure their progression of growth. Observations were also taken on the visual progression as time passes. We used a statistical paired t-test to compare the growth of caterpillars that didn’t receive juvenile hormone treatment as well as those that did receive juvenile hormone treatment. We used a p-value of 0.5 to see if our results were significant. 


Results:
From observational data, the experimental group that received the five drops of the Precor juvenile hormone appeared lighter in color with a whitish tint (Figure 1), whereas the other group was more of a vibrant green (Figure 2). However, the development of both the control and the experimental group were very consistent when it came to mass in grams. Figure 3 shows the average weight of the control and experimental group for 14 days.  In Table 1, the control group has an average mass of 12.22 grams, and the juvenile hormone had an average mass of 13.06 grams. From the paired t-test, the p-value was 0.551878 (Table 1). 

Discussion:
From our sample t-test, my group and I got a p-value of over 0.5, so we can assume that our results are not significant. We would reject the null hypothesis based on these findings. The null hypothesis states that if the Manduca Sexta caterpillars are treated with Precor, the juvenile hormone, then their mass in grams will be less than the growth of caterpillars with no treatment. Our results did not support this hypothesis. In theory, the juvenile hormone causes the Manduca Sexta to be smaller in weight, because they inhibit the insect’s molting phase from developing any further [Riddiford, 2012]. From research and our understanding, our results should’ve been significant; however, with further research, we could extend this experiment’s duration of time as well as using more of the Precor juvenile hormone to find if our results are actually. significant.
