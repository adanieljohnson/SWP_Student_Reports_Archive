Title: The Effects of precor on the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
Abstract (should be written last)

Introduction:
The scientific name for tobacco hornworms is the Manduca Sexta; it is an insect of the order Lepidoptera. Under the constant conditions in a lab, it takes the Manduca Sexta to reach an adult moth in 19-23 days. The lifecycle of the tobacco hornworm starts as an egg, five instar larva stages, pupa, and finally an adult moth. The two hormones that are focused on in the experiment is Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone, specifically in the experiment conducted precor which is an insect growth regulator. Juvenile Hormone regulates what type of molt will occur throughout development. The hypothesis for the experiment conducted is when five drops of precor is added to each insect’s food source, it is predicted that their average weight will be less than the controll group by the end of the two weeks. 


Materials and Method:
The independent variable is the amount of precor added to the food supply, the dependent variable is the average weight, and the controll is the average weight of the larvae not treated with precor. The first thing that is done in the experiment is to obtain two containers that have four compartments within them to isolate the caterpillars but keep them together based on them being the controll or the treatment group; each of the four compartments should contain a singular caterpillar. Label each compartment one through four and label each container according to if it is the treatment specimen or the controll. Each compartment should contain ten pounds of food; the controll should add five drops of water in their food and the treatment group should add five drops of precor. Before the caterpillars are placed into their compartments, they should be weighed in order to compare initial weight to final. The caterpillars should be placed randoMly in each compartment. The caterpillars should be placed in an incubator. Everyday for the next two weeks the caterpillars should be weighed and recorded to be compared at the end. 



Results:
The general trend at the beginning of the experiment was the average weight of the treatment group being lower than that of the controll group. Towards the end of the experiment the average weight started to go higher while the controll group seemed to “break even” and stop growing towards the end. There is an outlier in the controll group that would not gain weight and ended up dying. The data concluded that the treatment group in the beginning was affected by the precor added to the food, but towards the end it seemed like it did not affect the caterpillars. The statistical different began as different, then seemed to be alike to each other, only for the treatment group to seem to surpass the weight of the controll group. Table 1 shows the results that was drawn from the raw data. It contains the average of the weight of the caterpillars, number of specimens, and the standard deviation for both the treatment and controll. The degrees of freedom, t-value, and one-tailed p_value were the same value for both but reflects on both sides of the table. Figure 1 shows the error bars and the average of the caterpillars, demonstrating outliers in the controll group and the mean of the weight of the caterpillars. 


Discussion:
The experiment hypothesized that when five drops of precor was added to the food source of the caterpillar, the average weight of the caterpillar will be lower than caterpillars that did not receive precor. The mean of the treatment group was 12.18 while the mean of the controll group was 9.11. The reason why the mean of the controll group was significently lower than the mean of the treatment group could be due to an outlier we had in the controll group. This is shown through the standard deviation of the controll group which was at a +/- 6.23 s.d. while the standard deviation for the treatment group was at a +/- 0.40 s.d. which is significently lower. The outlier did not gain weight and did end up dying. The outlier did seem to have “something off” about it; there was a notable injury on the tail of the caterpillar which could be a probable cause of the caterpillar not gaining weight and dying off. It is notable in our experiment that the treatment group started off with a lower weight than the controll group but seemed to, at the end of the experiment, catch up to the controll group, while it seemed like the controll group stopped gaining weight. The controll group’s weight seem to even off and even drop, but this could be due to the caterpillars in the controll group starting to pupate (Kiguchi: 1978). The next logical step for this study is to repeat the experiment, especially due to the outlier. There is a probability in the study that was conducted, the treatment group got used to the precor, therefore no longer being affected by the initial dosage (Oliver-Williams: 2018). Thus, the study to be altered to upping the dosage every 3 days to avoid this situation. If the study was kept at the original format, the hypothesis could change to involve how the caterpillars are affected by the precor at first, but further into the experiment the caterpillars get immune to it. This study demonstrates how precor does limit the growth of the caterpillars, even if towards the end it seems like they got bigger than the controll group. It seemed as if the controll group was pupating due to the glassy physical feature that appeared on their bodies, which was not notable in the treatment group, thus concluding that the treatment group was not maturing as quickly as the controll group.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. How the caterpillars weight averaged out during the two weeks; one group being the treated group with precor in addition to their food source and the controll group getting water into their food source. One can tell the error bar was significently larger in the controll group than the treatment group, this is due to an outlier. The outlier was a caterpillar that did not gain weight for the beginning days and ended up dying. Error bars for the treatment group was +/- 0.40 s.d. and the error bar for the controll group was +/- 6.23 s.d.
