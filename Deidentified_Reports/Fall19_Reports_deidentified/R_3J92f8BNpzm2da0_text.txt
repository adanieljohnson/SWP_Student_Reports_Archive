Title: Manduca Juvenile Hormone Experiment

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Manduca sexta or Tobacco hornworm is a moth of the family Sphingidae that lives predominantly in America. Manduca is a pest that destroys plants and agriculture fields during their larvae stages of life. The growth of Manduca Sexta is being regulated by several key hormones. Ecdysterone (20E), prothoracicotropic hormone (brain hormone), and Juvenile Hormone are three of the key hormones in Manduca sexta’s life cycle. [BIO 114: 2019]20E and juvenile hormone are especially integral to the bugs’ growth as they regulate the molting process for the insect. In this experiment, we are focusing on the effect of juvenile hormone on Manducas’ growth. Juvenile hormones are long chain organic molecules that mainly regulate the type of molt during development. When juvenile hormone level is low, the insect starts the next stage of life and begins to pupate. We wonder what would happen if the insects’ juvenile hormone intake reaches an abnormal level. We hypothesize that the over-abundance of juvenile hormone in Manduca speed up the natural growth of the insect but prevent them from reaching adulthood. 

Materials and Methods:
Manduca larvae were selected randomly from the group provided by the TA. Eight Manduca larvae were selected and divided in half into a treatment group and a control group. Both groups received 10 grams of the same food provided by the TA. The treatment group’s food received 10 drops of solution containing juvenile hormone, while the control group’s food was simply moisturized by 10 drops of deionized water. The insects were placed in plastic boxes with air holes on the side; the boxes were placed in the same incubator to control growing environment. The insects’ weight was measured daily. The boxes where the insects resided for the experiment period was cleaned frequently of feces and dried food. Food was remoisturized and replaced frequently depending on the moisture of the food on each daily inspection. 

Results:
The weights of Manduca were mostly successfully collected. One day was missed during the experiment because no group member was available to measure the weights. Many of the insects perished for reasons still unclear, but replacement was found for the dead bugs from the control group. The weights of Manduca were both recorded in a table and a line chart. 

Observations:
	The treatment group Manduca appear to have paler skin color and the absence of black strips and dots on their back. 

Statistical test:
	T test statistics = -0.666
	DF = 10
	P value = 0.534


Discussion:
The data collected weren’t enough to have conclusive evidence to show the correlation between juvenile hormone intake and Manduca growth, although many interesting phenomena are observed for future studies. The lack of black strips and other features on the Manduca’s back from the treatment group shows the clear effect of juvenile hormone in that regard. In addition, it appears that the Manduca prefer the food without juvenile hormone as insects in the control group are less likely to die of starvation and have significantly more weight gain throughout the experimental period. Some Manduca from the treatment group survived the experiment without significant weight gain and, consequently, eating. The overabundance of the juvenile hormone might have contaminated the food in ways that diminished the insects’ appetite towards it. The dose of juvenile hormone should be decreased in future experiments from 10 drops to perhaps 5 drops. The lack of frequent cleaning of the container box and replacement of food source may have contributed to the high death rate in the early stages of the experiment. Experimenters should be more vigilant on the cleanliness of the Manduca’s living environment. Our hypothesize was supported by other studies. One of which by H Fredrik Nijhout and Carrol M. Williams claims the presence of juvenile hormone will prohibit PPT Hormone thus preventing the insect to reach the next stage of its life. The report, however, didn’t mention anything about juvenile hormone promoting or inhibiting growth. [Frederick, Williams: 1974]
