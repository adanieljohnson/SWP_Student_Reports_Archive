Title: Analyzing the Effects of Acidic Conditions in the Resource Allocation of Raphanus sativus Plants

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to determine if increasing the acidity of the soil which Raphanus sativus was grown in would have an effect on its resource allocation. The hypothesis for this experiment is that as the soil pH is made more acidic for the Raphanus sativus plants, then the root:shoot length ratios will be lower for the experimental groups compared to the controll. The procedure for this experiment requires three plants to be grown in each of these three conditions: controll (only water and soil), 5 Ml of HCL, and 10 Ml of HCL then measuring the length of each plants root and shoot and calculating the root:shoot ratio. In addition, an ANOVA showed there to be a statistical difference in the means of the root:shoot ratio of lengths among the groups because there was a p_value of 0.004521. Further, there was an increase in the mean of the root:shoot ratio of the 10 Ml HCL when compared to the other two groups. Lastly, some extensions of this experiment should be made like more levels of acidic conditions with more replicates and over a longer time-period to truly determine the relationship between acidic conditions and plant resource allocation. 

Introduction:
In all ecological environments, plants must interact with and adjust to the conditions surrounding them. Since every community is different in what resources it has to offer, plants must utilize their property of phenotypic plasticity to manage their growth patterns. Thus, lending them the ability to change how they allocate their resources in a way that allows them to flourish. Furthermore, this distribution of energy and metabolic resources that a plant makes can be broken down into two major categories: shoots and roots. Shoots (leaves and stems) are the above ground part of a plant and are the primary photosynthetic organ that enables plants to retrieve sugars from light capture that serve as key components in structure, organization, and biological processes. Dissimilarly, roots are below ground and are the principal absorptive organ for the uptake of essential nutrients like: water, phosphorus, potassium, and other minerals. Scientists have conducted a plethora of experiments that deal with resource allocation in plants in a variety of conditions in order to obtain a better understanding of this concept and see how plants adapt to an ever-changing environment. In particular, there was an experiment that analyzed the effects of biomass resource allocation in varying levels of acidic soil on Acer rubrum seedlings. The study found that there was a decrease in total biomass allocation in the more acidic soils meaning it negatively affected growth [Wingett: 2005]. With this being said, this investigation was performed to determine the effects of acidic soil on the resource allocation proportion of roots versus shoots in the Raphanus sativus (radish). The Raphanus sativus was chosen to see the impact of acidic conditions on a widley consumed plant that has the ability to grow in the limited two-week time frame. The hypothesis for this experiment is that as the independent variable of soil pH is made more acidic due to higher concentrations of HCL added to the soil for the Raphanus sativus plants, then the dependent variable of root:shoot length ratios will be statistically lower for the experimental compared to the controll. This is predicted because the plants in acidic soil will dedicate more resources to their shoots, in order to, compensate for the lack nutrients they are receiving from the roots. 

Materials and Method:
To determine the effects of acidic solution on resource allocation nine separate containers were acquired and filled with vermiculite (serving as soil). Then each basin was planted with two or three Raphanus sativus seeds. Next, 100 Ml of miracle grow was added to the vermiculite to encourage growth. Afterwards, the nine containers were sorted into three groups of three and labeled: controll, 5 Ml HCL, and 10 Ml HCL. Once the initial setup is complete the plants should be checked on and adequately watered once daily for two weeks. In addition, the experimental groups should have the appropriate amount of pH 3.01 HCL 
(independent variable) added to their soil daily using either a beaker of graduated cylinder to achieve an accurate measurement. Two weeks later, harvest one plant from each replicate of each group by carefully separating the plants from the vermiculite by submerging them in a washbasin filled with water. Separate the roots from the shoots by slicing each plant apart at the root-shoot junction. Collect and record all of the data for root and shoot length using a ruler, and then using this calculate the root:shoot ratio for each plant (dependent variable). To analyze the results, a one-way ANOVA was run to find significance among all the groups and a supplemental Tukey-Kramer test to see which groups were significently different from each other. 


Results:
Figure 1 shows the mean root:shoot ratio for length of the controll and experimental groups. The average root:shoot ratio for length increased as HCL concentration increased. For instance, the controll has a smaller mean mean root:shoot ratio of 0.734±0.079 cm compared to the 0.753±0.205 cm average for the 5 Ml HCL experimental group, and 1.372±0.113 cm average for the 10 Ml HCL experimental group (Figure 1). Furthermore, the standard deviation for the controll group was 0.079, 0.205 for the 5 Ml HCL, and 0.113 for the 10 Ml HCL. This means that the controll had marginally less variation in its data points then the experimental groups. A one-sided ANOVA was used to determine the relationship between the data collected for each group. The p_value obtained was 0.002451 meaning there was a significent difference in the average root:shoot ratio of lengths for the three groups tested. Further, a Tukey-Kramer test was run and indicated that the controll and the 5 Ml HCL were not significently different from each other. Moreover, there was a significent difference between the controll and the 10 Ml HCl groups, and there was a significent difference between the 5 Ml HCL and 10 Ml HCL groups.

Discussion:
After analyzing our results, the hypothesis that as the independent variable of soil pH is made more acidic due to higher concentrations of HCL in the soil for the Raphanus sativus plants, then the dependent variable of root:shoot length ratios will be statistically lower for the experimental compared to the controll cannot be statistically supported. The results show that the average root:shoot ratio for length actually increased as soil acidity increased which was the reverse of our prediction. The one-way ANOVA gave a significent result when compared to the alpha value of 0.05 meaning that there was in fact a significent difference among the groups. Moreover, a Tukey-Kramer test was to run find out which groups were statistically different from each other and it indicated that the controll and the 5 Ml HCL were not significently different from each other. However, there was a significent increase in the means of the 10 Ml HCL treatment group root:shoot ratio lengths when compared to the controll; similarly, there was a significent increase between the means of the 10 Ml HCL group root:shoot ratio lengths when compared to the 5 Ml HCL treatment group. This means that when the soil reaches a certain threshold of acidity the root:shoot ratio for length increases; thus, the plant is dedicating more resources to its roots rather than its shoots. These results correspond to a study that showed that plants are actually able to employ a few different mechanisms to adapt to acidic conditions like: the discharge of chelators for Al and greater activity of ectoenzymes that increase in root surface area through mycorrhizae [Marschner: 1991]. Thus, this experiment provides some information that plants may actually allocate more resources to the roots to cope with acidic conditions which aligns with the data we collected. Therefore, this means that plants may attempt to allocate the majority of resources too correcting a problem with its environment rather than focusing its resources on an alternative method of survival.  Conversely, another study demonstrates that under some sort of environmental stress like, for example, air pollution that root biomass is reduced more than shoot biomass in a plants resource allocation [Lechowicz: 1987]. Some possible explanations for why are results differ from the studies done by Wingett and Lechowicz are that they used different plant species which could allocate resources differently than ours, they measured mass rather than length for roots and shoots, and their experiments were able to run for a longer period of time. In the future, this experiment would be modified to where we would perform more trials testing an even greater variety pH’s with more replicates and a larger time frame for the plants to grow to see if acidic soil conditions really have an effect on resource allocation in plants.
