Title: Effects of Azaguard on the Manduca sexta Larva

Abstract:
This experiment tests the effects of the insecticide Azaguard on the insect Manduca sexta. These insects produce hormones are certain levels in order to maintain its natural life cycle, and a disruption of this leads to abnormalities. Azaguard prevents the molting of larvae, and therefore led to minimal weight gain to those larvae that were exposed to it. Those exposed also died before the end of the observation period, showing the lethal outcome that hormone disruptors can have.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera and is more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. The life cycle of this insect is about 19-23 days, which includes five instar phases as larvae and a pupa phase, before developing into an adult moth. The main hormones that assist in development, molting, and forming of the pupa include Ecdysterone, which regulates molting, and Juvenile Hormone, which at high levels, keeps the larvae from forming into a pupa. These hormones work together to time out the development of this insect with the insects being subjected to developmental abnormalities if levels are experimentally altered. For the larvae to begin its transition to a pupa, the commitment pulse must occur, which happens when the ecdysterone levels rise and the juvenile hormone drops simultaneously [Johnson: 2019].  These hormones are essential for the development of the Manduca sexta, as studies have shown that additive ecdysterone in the larvae will disrupt cell division and eventually lead to their death [Judy: 1969]. The insecticide Azaguard is a product used to prevent the molting of larvae into a pupa by preventing a drop in the Juvenile Hormone that occurs during the commitment pulse. This product acts as an insect growth regulator (IGR) that disrupts the development of the insect instead of intoxicating it with other chemicals. Since this product seeks to eliminate pests, this experiment will test whether the addiction of Azaguard in the life of the Manduca sexta will alter its development, and/or lead to its death. If it proves to eliminate the insects, it will show that toxins are not needed to eliminate unwanted pests. If IGRs can do the job just as well, the adverse effects that chemicals have on the environment and the people who distribute it will no longer occur. My hypothesis is that the larvae that receive eight drops of Azaguard in their food everyday will on average have a lower mass than the larvae that receive just food [Johnson: 2019]. 


Materials and Method:
Two groups of four individual Manduca Sexta larvae were observed in this experiment. The first group being the treatment group and the second being the controll group. Two plastic containers were used divided into four cells for each larva. Every day the treatment group would receive eight drops of Azaguard via pipet which was received mixed into 10 grams of food that was spooned out and weighed. The controll group received eight drops of water via a new pipet mixed into their 10 grams of food everyday. The independent variable was the presence of Azaguard in the food and the dependent variable was the mass of the larvae, which were weighed every day. Every day the food was changed and each larva was weighed for two weeks. The statistical test used was the two-tailed T-test, which showed if the difference in masses from the first and last day weighed of each larva between the controll group and treatment group had statistical significance or if the differences were just a coincidence. 


Results:
On average, the masses of the larvae in the treatment group that received Azaguard had lower masses than those in the controll group as seen in Figure 1. The average growth per day for the controll group was 0.67g with a standard deviation of 0.48 and for the treatment group it was 0.028g with a standard deviation of 0.010 with individual average growth charted in Table 1. In addition, the treatment group larvae were all deceased by the end of two weeks and observations proved that they got smaller and brown colored before death. The T-test was calculated by using the difference in masses from the first day it was weighed and the last day it was alive/in the two week window. The outcome of the two-tailed T-test is 2.71 with a two-tailed P-value of 0.035. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment supported the alternative hypothesis. The larvae that were treated with Azaguard had lower masses than those in the controll group, and had died before the end of the two weeks of observation. The P-value supports the alternative hypothesis and rejects the null hypothesis, proving a significance in the difference in mass between the two groups. The weight put on by the controll group larvae were significently greater than the weight put on by the treatment group between day 9/5 and day 9/18 (or until the day they died). The treatment group groups lower average mass gain per day also proved that they grew less than the controll group per day. The addition of this insecticide into the food of the larvae disrupted its natural development process, resisting the molting needed to progress into a pupa [Johnson: 2019]. The resistance to develop was only withstood for a few days before two of the treatment larvae died. The other two were deceased soon after, proving that these insects cannot stay juvenile for longer than nature provides them. This conclusion is also congruent with the results of added E20 to the Manduca sexta larvae which showed their ultimate demise [Judy: 1969]. This shows that the desired results of this insecticide Azaguard are achievable, however the exact amount needed to exterminate them was now found in this experiment because a specific amount was distributed everyday. However it is now known that when the natural hormones in the Manduca Sexta are disrupted, the normal development is negatively altered. This study shows that this IGR is capable of exterminating unwanted pests in a way that does not use harmful toxins that affect people and the environment.
