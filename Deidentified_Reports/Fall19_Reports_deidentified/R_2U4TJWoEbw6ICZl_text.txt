Title: Intraspecifc behavior of male Betta fish towards videos of other males

Abstract:
 We wanted totest how aggressive intraspecific behaviors in male betta fish are affected by color. In this case we used the colors red, blue and grey as the variables that we will expose a male Betta fish to. The variables took the form of a video of a male Betta fish played on a phone pressed against the glass of the tank. We observed the males reaction and quantifying his behavior by measuring how long aggressive intraspecific behaviors lasted for. We believed that the more vibrant colors of red and blue would elicit a more aggressive response than that of grey. However, our bettas were passive towards both videos of other male Bettas and cutouts of betta shaped fish of the same colors as the videos. Our videos displayed aggressive male betas, commiting many intraspecific acts of aggression. So the behavior of our males is puzzling. We believe that the solid color of the cutouts was either not exciting enough, or the size of them was too imposing

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior is called ethology. It combines observational skills and laboratory methods and insights from ecology to analyze animal behaviors.  Male Betta fish (B. splendens) are well known for their male aggressive intraspecific behaviors. Instra specific behavior is that between two organisms of the same species. In this case the males are often very violent with each other. Such behaviors are either broadside or facing movements. [Ecology and evolution bio113 lab manual] Broadside, in order of increasing aggressiveness include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements in order of increasing aggressiveness include pectoral fins erecting, opercula flashing, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes (Red mane). These male Betta fish were the model organism of our experiment. We would like to test how their aggressive intraspecific behaviors are affected by color. In this case we would use the colors red, blue and grey as the variables that we will expose a male Betta fish to. The variables will take the form of a video of a male Betta fish played on a phone pressed against the glass of the tank. We will be observing the males reaction and quantifying his behavior by measuring how long aggressive intraspecific behaviors last for. We believe that the more vibrant colors of red and blue will elicit a more aggressive response than that of grey. This is because grey is the color of gouramie, a fish that male bettas do not display aggressive behavior towards. Whereas red and blue are the colors of other male Betta fish. 


Materials and Methods:
The male betta will be placed in a tank and allowed to naturalize to its environment for some time. Then it will be shown videos of male betta fish of the colors red, blue and grey (The grey video will be the same red video but the phone set to grayscale mode). The videos will be played on a phone pressed against the glass and held there for the duration of the videos length. The fish will be shown the videos 3 times each, and never the same video back to back.  In between videos the fish will be given several minutes of rest in order to prevent habituation or excess stress on the fish. We will time how long it takes for the fish to become aggressive, how long it displays aggressive behavior, and any “strikes” it makes towards the glass. 


Results:
The fish were shown videos of other male betta fish and they did not display aggressive behavior towards the video fish for any color. It was confirmed that the video could be seen through the tank glass, and the content of the videos was another male betta displaying aggressive behavior. In no trials did either fish we tested display any aggressive behavior towards the videos. 


Discussion:
Our bettas were passive towards both videos of other male Bettas and cutouts of betta shaped fish of the same colors as the videos. Our videos displayed aggressive male betas, commiting many intraspecific acts of aggression. So the behavior of our males is puzzling. We believe that the solid color of the cutouts was either not exciting enough, or the size of them was too imposing. However, this does not explain the fishes behavior towards videos. Even with 2 different fish, neither was aggressive towards beta cutouts, or beta fish videos. Our data was non existent, and we recommend a repeat of our experiment with male Betta who display aggressive behavior. Perhaps a much larger sample size of 20+ male bettas. Perhaps with smaller phones the video fish may seem less imposing to our Betta fish as well, and thus our males may be enticed to act more aggressive towards the phones. We were unable to prove or disprove our hypothesis as no colors got any reaction out of the Betta fish. It is possible our fish were intimidated by the size of the video fish, and that other Bettas would be more aggressive. Perhaps in a future experiment a phone in a waterproof case could be placed in the water with the bettas so the fish could better view the videos. Though our data was not significant, this field of research still is. Animal behavior provides deeper insights into how species evolve and interact with other organisms and their environment, and research in this field helps us understand these species better. For instance, studying the behavioral patterns of migratory birds can help us better understand how local ecosystems are affected by pathogens/parasites carried by said birds.
