Title: Survivability and Resource Allocation in Mungbean Plants Based on Plant Proximity

Abstract:
This lab was completed with the intention of understanding how the proximity of plants to each other impacts survivability and resource allocation. This was done by planting mungbeans in both clumped and spread out environments and then recording their survival percentage and root-to-shoot ratio. The survival percentage was similar between the two environments and help no statistical significance with the averages being 82.2 for clumped and 88.8 for spread and the p_value being 0.539. Results for the root-to-shoot ratios were similar with the averages being similar and the data having a p_value of 0.406.

Introduction:
This lab was done in order to attempt to understand how the clumped planting of plants impacts their survivability rate. Data will also be collected to analyze how this clumping impacts the competition between these plants and attempt to observe changes in resource allocation. In this lab this will be done using mungbeans in groups of 15 to simulate clumped and spread planting environments and their survivability rate and root-to-shoot ratio will be recorded. In theory, the more severe the clumping of plants the more severe the level of competition between plants should be. “For example, plants exposed to reduced sunlight would be predicted to shift resources toward stem and leaf growth, and to pigments associated with light capture.” (McConnaughay and Coleman, 1999) This raised level of competition should also force plants to devote resources to make themselves more competitive, which should, in this case, be some increase in root and/or shoot length. For the mungbeans, it is expected that the spread group will have a higher survival percentage and a lower root-to-shoot ration due to the lesser need for competition by having more room to collect resources.

Materials and Method:
First small pots were filled with soil to one centimeter below the top. 15 mung bean seeds were then collected and planted in the soil with three pots being clumped and three pots being spread. For the clumped, a hole was dug in the center of the pot and all 15 were planted in that hole. For spread, five holes were dug in an X as far apart as possible and three seeds were planted in each hole. The holes were then covered with soil and the pots were moved into a greenhouse under identical conditions. Plants were watered everyday with 150 Ml of water for two weeks. After the two weeks the plants were taken out of the greenhouse to be measured. The number of grown/living plants in each plot was recorded as a percentage out of the 15 originally planted seeds and categorized under clumped and spread. The soil was then removed from each plot and the plants were separated out. Each plant was then cut in half, separating the root from the shoot. The lengths of the roots and shoots were then individually measured in cm to calculate root-to-shoot ratio. For both the average survivability and the root-to-shoot ration a two-sample t_test was conducted to determine statistical significance.  

Results:
The gathered results for this lab show an average survival percentage of 82.2% for clumped and 88.8% for spread with a p_value of 0.539. They also show an average root-to-shoot ratio of 0.791, 0.654, and 0.507 for clumped and 0.818, 0.653, and 0.745 for spread with a p_value of 0.406. 

Discussion:
The results from the survival percentage data lead to the conclusion that there wasn’t much difference in the two environments (clumped and spread) survival rate, 82.2% for clumped and 88.8% for spread.  The p_value for the two-sample t_test, 0.539, showed that this initial conclusion was correct, and the data had no statistical significance. The initial results from the root-to-shoot ratios showed similar results to that of the survival percentage. Again, the p_value for this set of data, 0.406, gives the results no statistical significance. As mentioned in the introduction, “plants are predicted to respond to low nutrient availability by shifting the partitioning of carbohydrates to processes associated with nutrient capture in lieu of carbon acquisition.” (McConnaughay and Coleman, 1999) This did not happen. These results then disproved our hypothesis due to there being no significent difference between the impact that the environments had on the growth of the plants. The clumping of the plants may not have been severe enough to have an impact or the other conditions could have provided too many resources to merit intense competition between the growing plants.
