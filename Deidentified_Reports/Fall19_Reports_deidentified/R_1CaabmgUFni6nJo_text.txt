Title: Effects of alkaline water on Raphanus sativus resource allocation

Abstract:
The objective of the Resource Allocation lab is to test the effect of a PH buffer solution (Alkaline water) on 72 Raphanus sativus (Radish plants) seedlings. We hypothesize that the PH buffer will decrease the overall weight and length of the 36 treatment plants due to the fact that the solution will deprive the plant of its basic nutrients. Energy allocation is essential for a plant’s survival because It allows the plant to make strategic decisions on what and where to invest in for the most beneficial future. Environmental factors play a major role in what the plant requires and depending on the factors it can be different. We will be observing and recording the growth of these plants in a controlled environment, later on calculating the shoot to root ratios of both the weight and length. Our data supported our hypothesis, showing that there was a correlation between the PH buffer and an overall decrease in size and weight. The average total weight of the experimental (alkaline water) was 0.33g, while the average total weight of the controlled was 0.27g. The ratios of the treatment both weight and length were also less than the control. However, there could have been some human error within our experiment due to the loss of some roots, thus our data should not be taken as absol

Introduction:
The Purpose of the Plant Resource allocation Lab is to test the effects of a PH buffer solution (Alkaline water) on the energy allocation of Raphanus sativus (Radish plants) in a controlled environment. Due to the plants nature of being anchored in one place, unable to search for resources, they must make strategic decisions with what and where to allocate the amount of resources available to them. Several factors go into the crucial decision’s autotrophs reach. Environmental factors such as water, sunlight, and space are the most influential. Within in this lab we focused on altering was the water factor. The lack or change of one of the 3 environmental factors can the plants properties, like structure and species distribution, while also effecting the overall function of the ecosystem with the nutrients retained. (JAMES J. J, 2005) So all of which could affect the root to shoot ratio and by analyzing said ratio, we can determine how the plant is doing in its environment. We hypothesized that the PH buffer solution would deprive the experimental group of necessary nutrients it would normally get from water, resulting in the overall root: shoot ratio suffering as a whole. 

Materials and Methods:
This lab required 72 Radish seeds, 36 for the control group and 36 for the experimental group. We then took 6 containers, filled them with soil, planted 12 seeds in each, and then saturated the soil. The first three containers would soon become the control and the other 3 the experimental. Both the control and the experimental were watered until saturated and were both in the same environment. The only differences between the two groups was that the experimental was also given 50 mL of the 9.5 H2O solution. The duration of this lab lasted two weeks therefore, each day a group member would go to the green house and water as directed. Then after the two weeks were over, we separated the plants from the soil, rinsed of the plants, and took several measurements. We weighed the plants total weigh, the shoot weight, as well as the root weight in grams on a scale. We then measured the root and shoot length in centimeters using a ruler. After all of the measurements were taken and recorded on our groups shared google sheet, we calculated the weight and length Root: Shoot ratio by dividing root value by the shoot value and then adding those values to the shared doc. Once all of the values were in the excel doc, we then calculated a one tailed two sample T test to see if our data was significant or not. 

Results:
The results of our lab concluded that the control group was overall larger in size and weight than the experimental in almost every case on average. The average total weight of the experimental (alkaline water) was 0.33g, while the average total weight of the controlled was 0.27g. Refer to figure 1 for the representation of the data stated within this paragraph. The average shoot: root weight for the experimental 0.31g, while the controlled weighed in at 0.71g. The trend continued with the average root: shoot length ratio of the experimental being 1.49 cm and the controlled being 1.77cm. Thus, the effects of the Ph buffer are substantial with effecting the shoot to root ratio. The one tailed 2 sample T-test showed that our data was significant within our experiment 

Discussion:
The results of our resource allocation experiment supported the alternative and rejected the null hypothesis, due to the fact that the Ph buffer solution decreased the overall plant size of the experimental. This is due to the correlation between the plant’s energy allocation and the lack of neutral water. In another study with Chinese cabbage and radishes, within the alkaline water there was a higher concentration of metals within the soil which effected the plant growth, sometimes resulting in death. (Ai S, 2016) Which could be why nine of our seeds not germinating into a sprout. The alkaline water also provides an excess of minerals that are unnecessary for a plants success, meaning that it doesn’t meet all of the necessary requirements to support the plants optimal growth rate.  
While we were conducting this experiment and started to measure our control and experimental, we couldn’t really tell a distinct difference. In fact, we thought at one point that the experimental group was bigger than the control due to some that stuck out from the rest. However, when we started to look at our data, we noticed that our original thoughts were wrong, and our data was significant due to the P value being less than 0.05.  Other observations that we noticed as we were extracting the plants from its soil was that the roots of the treatment were super brittle and would easily break off if we weren’t careful. Thus, there could have been some human error due to the weak roots breaking off, effecting the measurements and weights. Also, as we were extracting the plants from their containers some roots could have been loosed in the transition.
