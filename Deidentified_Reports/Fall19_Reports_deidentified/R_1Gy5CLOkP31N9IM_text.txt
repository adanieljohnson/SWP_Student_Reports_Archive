Title: Effects of Precor on Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
No abstract for this report

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is a type of moth commonly found in the Southern United States. While in its larval stage, Manduca Sexta is a small, bright green worm, known as the “tobacco hornworm”. The larva will go through a series of five instars before reaching pupation, going through a different molt each time, and throughout these instars sees fluctuation in its levels of certain hormones that help the larva throughout development. One of these hormones is known as juvenile hormone, which inhibits promotion of development in the larva and keeps it from developing into a mature adult as it goes through the molts in each instar stage before the final one [Subramanian: 2016]. Just before the final instar stage, the larva will see a decrease in the amount of juvenile hormone it secretes, as it is now ready to pupate into a full adult. The development of Manduca Sexta is important because when in its larval stage, the worm is seen as a pest [Pavuk: 2009]. It feeds off of certain farMland crops, most notably tobacco plants. In the southern US, tobacco is a staple crop and the feeding habits of Manduca Sexta are negative and harmful to the farming economy in the area. Methoprene is an analog for juvenile hormone that regulates insect growth [Arthur: 2016]. Methoprene can be found in the insecticide, Precor. The hypothesis for this experiment was that adding Precor to the diet of controllled hornworms will alter their growth and will cause the pupa to ultimately fail and the worm will not develop into a moth. 

Materials and Method:
The independent variable for this experiment was the amount of Precor put in the food of the Manduca Sexta, while the dependent variable that it altered was the development of the larva over time. The controllled variables that may have also played a part in the experiment was the amount of food given to the larva, as well as the temperature of their environment. For the first step, eight larvae were collected, and then separated into two groups. One group of four was used as the controll group, they were given ten grams of food with no Precor added. The other group was the treatment group, they were also given 10 grams of food, but with 6 drops of the Precor added and mixed in with their food. Next, the habitats for the larvae were created. Two 4-cell plastic containers were taken and had two holes punched in each cell to provide air for the subjects. The holes were punctured through the sides of the cells, not the top. The cells were then labeled to make sure to know which hornworm was which as observations were recorded over time. The larvae were then added to their assigned cells and the food was collected from the container and weighed out for each worm to receive ten grams along with their assigned amount of water or treatment, depending on the group. The food was stirred into large clumps to keep it from drying out faster, and then the drops of food or Precor were then added as it was placed in the cell. The hornworms were then weighed to get their starting weights for the experiment and start the observations. For the next fourteen days, the hornworms were checked everyday to see their progress and record observations. The subjects were taken out of their cells and weighed on scales to monitor growth. The cells were also checked to see the current condition of the food that was left. If there was no food, or if the food had dried up, it had to be replaced. The cells were also cleaned out if there was any waste inside them. In the case that a subject had died, they were not replaced unless a significent number of the hornworms had died. For example, a second controll group was introduced and observed once two of the original four were dead, but there were no more treatment hornworms introduced after the death of one. For statistical results after the experiment, a chi-squared test of independence with a 95% confidence interval was used.

Results:
Differences were observed between the controll group results and the treatment group results. The weights of the two groups were significently different, as compared in Figure 1. Looking at the weights from the final day of observations, the controll group had 6 members with a mean average of 4.86 grams with a standard deviation of 1.01 grams. The treatment group had 3 members with a mean average of 11.05 grams with a standard deviation of 8.67 grams. An observation to be noted is the drop in weight in the controll group, seen in figure 2. The treatment group did not see this downward slope but continued to grow, as seen in Figure 3. The treatment group only had three members after the death of one from the group early on, but was not replaced. A trend seen in all of the controll subjects is the drop in weight in the last few days of the experiment. On the opposite side of that, the treatment group never saw any type of drop or decline in weight the entire time of the experiment. The result of the statistical test was χ2= 9.0, d.f. = 2, and P= 0.01. 

Discussion:
After rejecting the null hypothesis, we can see there is a significent difference in the controll groups and the treatment group, meaning that the use of Precor had an impact on the development of the larva. Our group’s hypothesis seems to be proven relatively true. The effects of this treatment can be seen in both the numbers of the experiment and the physical details of our hornworms. Taking a look back at the data will show that the treatment group grew much larger than the controll groups, some of which being upwards of around twice as large as the controll ones. This shows that juvenile hormone, or in this instance a chemical agent that acts as it could potentially play a part in determining the final size when the hornworm develops into an adult [Mirth: 2014]. The controll group saw a drop in weight a few days before the end of the experiment. This drop is normal as the larva excretes some of its own body fluid to prepare for pupation [Joesten: 1981]. None of the treatment group experienced this drop, meaning none of them were ready for pupation. There were physical differences between the groups as well. All of the treatment hornworms were a different color than the controll groups. All of the treatment group was a paler shade of green than any of the controll groups. The biggest difference between them was the pupation. Some of the controll hornworms actually pupated around the time the experiment. With more time, the hypothesis could have gotten a more complete conclusion to see if the treatment group ever did pupate, but while it is unsure if the pupa failed, it was certainly delayed compared to the controll group. This experiment can directly be applied to the use of pesticides. The substance used for the treatment group was an insecticide that regulates development and growth in the larval stage. While the hornworm is only a pest in its larval state, keeping it from developing would allow for population controll [Palumbo: 1999]. More tests could be done to see if the result yielded here is still supported with larger sample sizes or to see how things are different when the experiment is given more time. However, for this experiment, it was statistically proven that Precor had an effect on the development of the Manduca Sexta larva.
