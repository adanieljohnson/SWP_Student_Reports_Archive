Title: The Effect of 20E Inhibitor on the Developement of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta also known as the Tobacco Hornworm is an insect that undergoes metamorphosis similar to that of butterflies and moths. The complete life cycle of the hornworm is around 39-48 days in which it begins as an egg that hatches into a larva then pupates into a pupa until it finally emerges as an adult moth. The short life cycle makes the Manduca Sexta a good insect to study. Additionally, the larvae Manduca Sexta destroy crops and the environment, so it is more ethical to experiment with. The larvae hornworms complete 5 instars and molt between each phase. The transition between stages of the life cycle is controllled by two hormones, 20E and Juvenile Hormone. 20E regulates the timing of molting while JH regulates the type of molting. Both hormones work together to controll the development of the hornworm. Certain levels of each hormone indicate itâ€™s time for the insect to change stages. For example, a small spike in 20E at the 5th instar, called the commitment pulse, indicates the larva is ready to pupate. It is hypothesized that feeding the larvae a 20E inhibitor will delay development of the manduca sexta because 20E is essential for hornworm developement. 


Materials and Method:
Four larvae hornworms were used for the controll group in this experiment and four were used for the experimental group. The controll hornworms were placed in a divided plastic container and the experimental ones were placed in a separate, identical container. Food was placed in each compartment of the containers. The food of the hornworms in the controll group was mixed with five drops of water and balled up. The food of the hornworms in the experimental group was mixed with five drops of 20E inhibitor and balled up. The hornworms were weighed before being placed in the containers. They were then placed in an incubator and weighed each day. When the food appeared dry, it was replaced. The hornworms were tested each day for about 2-3 weeks.


Results:
One tailed p_value: .194
One tailed p_value: .011
Figure one and two show the average weights of the controllled and treated hornworms for eight days. Figure one shows the first eight days while figure shows the subsequent eight days. Two sets of data were necessary, because the hornworms in the treated group died after eight days, so the same procedure was repeated to see if the same results occurred. As seen by the graphs the controll group hornworms grew at a faster rate than the treated hornworms. In both data sets the hornworms eventually died. The statistical test used for this experiment was a two-sample t_test. This test is used to compare the means of two groups of data. The p_value was used to determine the statistical significance of the data. The one tailed p_value specifically compares the means to see if one is statistically significently greater or less than the other. If a p_value is greater than .05, the null hypothesis is supported and if it less than .05, it is rejected and the results are statistically significent. The null hypothesis is contra to the alternative hypothesis previously proposed. For this experiment the null hypothesis is that the 20E inhibitor would have no effect of the developement of the manduca sexta. 

Discussion:
In data set one, the null hypothesis was supported and as a result the data did not provide evidence that the 20E inhibitor delayed Manduca sexta developement. In the second data set, however, the null hypothesis was rejected and therefore it was concluded that the 20E inhibitor did in fact delay development in the Manduca sexta. Because the hornworms died in both data sets, it was concluded that 20E inhibitor not only delays developement in hornworms but also leads to eventual death. Hornworms are pests at the larval stage and therefore 20E inhibitor can be used as an effective pesticide against this insect. The death, however, was gradual and therefore it would be useful to look into other substances that would be better pesticides. Further studies could involve treating the hornworms with JH inhibitor as JH is essential for hornworm developement as well as treating the hornworms with more inhibitor rather than just five drops. Potential sources of error could have effected the differences in results of the two data sets. One source of error could be the health of the hornworms used for the experiment. The healthier the hornworms used, the better they would develop. Additionally, potential variances in the incubator would effect the quality of the environment of the hornworms ultimately effecting their development.
