Title: Effects of IG Regulator on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/a

Introduction:
Manduca sexta or tobacco hornworms are pests as larva [Johnson: 2016]. They eat the leaves of tobacco plants. Tobacco hornworm pupation is controlled by two hormones, Juvenile hormone (JH) and 20E (Ecdysterone) [Johnson: 2016]. JH controls the type of molting and 20E controls the timing of the molt [Johnson: 2016]. The two hormones fluctuate throughout the organism’s life cycle. However, right before the organism pupates, there is a large drop in JH coupled with a rise in 20E [Johnson: 2016]. This is called the commitment pulse [Johnson:2016]. This experiment focuses on the effects of exposing tobacco hornworms to IG regulator. IGRs can prevent an organism’s reproduction, egg-hatch, and molting from one stage to the next [Insect: 2015]. In some cases, it can even cause death [Wright: 1976].  IGRs do this by either mimicking JH or blocking it. When given a consistent dose of JH the insects may not be able to pupate. The goal of our research is to determine the effects of IG regulator on tobacco hornworms. The independent variable is the addition of IG regulator or water to food. The dependent variable is the weight of the hornworms. Our hypothesis is that if tobacco hornworms are given eight drops of IG regulator, they will weigh less than the tobacco hornworms not exposed to IG regulator. 

Materials and Methods:
A control group of four hornworms were given ten grams of food with eight drops of water mixed in. An experimental group with four hornworms were given ten grams of food with eight drops of IG regulator mixed in. Every day for fourteen days, the experimenter measured and recorded the weight in grams of the larvae. They also included observations of the larvae. Experimenters replaced food, if dry, following the same proportions mentioned above. The average weight of the organisms in each group was compared every day.  A t-test was used to determine the statistical significance of the data. 

Results:
The larva grew every day they were measured. On average, the experimental group was smaller than the control group until day seven. After day seven, the weights of the groups did not appear to follow a trend (figure 1). The experimental group was significantly lighter in color than the control group. The p value was 0.39. Our hypothesis was one tailed. We used a two-sample t-test and our hypothesis was a paired hypothesis. 

Discussion:
The results were not statistically significant. Our hypothesis that if tobacco hornworms were given eight drops of IG regulator, they would weigh less than the tobacco hornworms not exposed to IG regulator was not supported. This means that there was not a significant difference between the weight of the larva exposed to IG regulator and the weight of the larva exposed to water. In other words, IG regulator alone is not enough to manage pests like tobacco hornworms. However, the color change in the insects is notable. Manduca Sexta responds to an abundance or lack of JH by changing color [Baker: 1985]. That means that the insect clearly was affected by the IG regulator. Further research could be done on whether IGRs that act as antagonists as opposed to agonists work more or less effective in controlling tobacco hornworms. Additionally, a future researcher could measure the effects of exposure to IG regulators on the reproductive cycle of tobacco hornworms. IGRs are said to prevent egg hatching. Larva whose mothers were exposed to IGRs may not survive into adulthood [Insect: 2015].
