Title: The Effect of Acid on Buckwheat Root to Shoot Ratio

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effect of acid on plant growth is analyzed. Buckwheat was used as the primary resource for experimentation. Some buckwheat seeds were exposed to acid, which pertained to the biological question of how acid affects plant growth. It was hypothesized that the experimental group would have less photosynthesis taking place due to acid preventing the process from occurring. The controll group was found to be more photosynthetic activity than the experimental due to the smaller root to shoot ratio. Due to the p_value of 0.262, the results are statistically insignificent and the null hypothesis is rejected.

Introduction:
In this experiment, the effect of acid on the root to shoot ratio of buckwheat seeds is analyzed. Buckwheat is a pseudocereal that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. Buckwheat is widely grown as a grain crop, bee pasture, and soil improver. Because buckwheat growth can be detected within one week of watering, they are useful for this experiment. The seeds will provide a suitable amount of data. In addition, they also grow in a wide variety of different soils including poor, fertile, peat, sand, clay, and loam, which make them an appropriate choice for experimentation [Nobili: 1997]. Buckwheat is also a highly nutritional seed that has been shown to have a wide range of health benefits attributed to plasma cholesterol level reduction, neuroprotection, and anticancer [Batista: 2015]. It is important for growers to document how these seeds are watered and treated in order to achieve optimal conditions. Significantly enough, buckwheat prefers a pH of 5.0 to 7.0, which sets up the biological question of the lab. The biological question that is asked in this experiment pertains to how acid affects the overall root to shoot ratio of the plant. One controll group is grown with only water. The experimental group is grown with water and acid with a pH of 3.5. The independent variable is the presence of acid, and the dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio. It is hypothesized that if buckwheat are given water and acid, then they will have a higher root to shoot ratio than the controll group because photosynthesis will be suppressed.


Materials and Method:
Six different empty plant containers were gathered. Then, three containers were labeled as the experimental group and three containers were labeled as the controll group. Soil and miracle grow was poured into each container. Approximately ten to fifteen buckwheat seeds were placed into each container. All containers were initially watered and then placed in the greenhouse. Stored in the greenhouse, each plant was watered once a day for two weeks. The experimental group was given 200Ml water and 50Ml 3.5pH acid each. The controll group was given 200Ml water each. Each group consisted of three containers each. At the end of the data collection period, data was collected and analyzed. The root and shoot length of three plants in each container were measured. The total weight of each of the three plants in each container was also found. The controll group were containers 1, 2, and 3. The experimental group were containers 4, 5, and 6. A statistical two sample t_test was used to analyze the data.


Results:
The data collected during experiment was clear and concise. After collecting the data and averages were found, the average total weight of the controll group was 0.26g. The average total weight of the experimental group was 0.15g. The standard deviation for the controll group was 0.025 and 0.099 for the experimental group. The root to shoot ratio of the controll group was 0.28, and the root to shoot ratio of the experimental group was 0.39. The standard deviation for the controll group was 0.117 and 0.14 for the experimental group. The p_value was 0.262 with four degrees of freedom.


Discussion:
After the results were analyzed, several observations can be made. The controll group had a smaller root to shoot ratio (0.28) than the experimental group (0.39). This fits the hypothesis of what was expected to happen. When a plant is in an acidic environment, photosynthesis ceases, so they will not grow as much. In the experiment, the experimental group plants had smaller shoots because they could not grow as much due to a decrease in photosynthesis. In addition, roots need to find a more suitable environment before shoots can grow longer. The acid halted the growth of the shoots since the roots attempted to find better soil. The controll group also had a higher total weight (0.26g) than the experimental group (0.15g). This showed that more photosynthesis took place in the controll group since they grew larger and were heavier. There was one outlier in the experimental group, as shown in container 6. Here, the buckwheat exposed to acid had similar growth to those in the controll group which were given no acid. Here, the seeds may not have been exposed to the acid when it was poured. Moreover, these roots in container 6 may have been better at allocating where to move towards when finding optimal growing conditions. In this case, they may have gravitated towards the water. The water and acid may not have mixed completely in the soil. However, the p_value of 0.262 implies that the results of the experiment are statistically insignificent. In other words, the data does not show more than 95% certainty to be significent. Because of this, the null hypothesis is accepted and the alternate hypothesis is rejected. Even though the results proved to be insignificent, the general eye can tell a difference in the data between the two groups. Because of this, future studies should be performed on the affect acid has on photosynthesis as a whole. What parts, if all, of photosynthesis do not function properly? In addition, this experiment allowed for the documentation of photosynthesis, and it is important to see when photosynthesis flourishes and ceases [Wu: 2016]. In another study documented by Trinity Hamilton in 2018, scientists experimented on the photosynthesis activity of cyanobacteria in sulfidic conditions. In this experiment, it was that hydrogen sulfide concentrations as low as one micromole inhibited oxygen production [Hamilton: 2018]. Because oxygen levels were low, the organism has less energy and water for photosynthesis. Knowing these conditions lead to greater crop yield and production.
