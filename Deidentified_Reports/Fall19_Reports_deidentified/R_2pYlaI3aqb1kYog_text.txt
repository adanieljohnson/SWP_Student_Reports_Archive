Title: Effect of Soap as a Detergent on Photosystem II Activity of Spinach Leaves

Abstract:
Detergents act as an inhibitor on plant growth. By looking at the electron transfer measurement using a concentration of DCIP on two groups of ground spinach leaves and a series of solutions to determine how soap can affect the activity of photosystem II. We measure the absorbance between the control group, being that of strictly chloroplast, and the experimental group of chloroplast with an addition of soap every 10 minutes for 30 minutes, we calculate the percent change to show the significance of the data. The results show that soap as a detergent is in fact an inhibitor of the process of photosystem II by showing a decrease in the activity level.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a base for which plants are able to use energy from light and transfer from light and transfer it into chemical energy. Within this process of photosynthesis there is a very important aspect of electron transfer through the Electron Transport Chain in plants, in having this aspect included in the process we are able to find and measure the rate of electron transfer that could lead us to figuring out how much of the electrons are being passed and/or oxidized. We can tell this by looking at the H+ protons and other electrons. In the stage of photosystems II energy from absorbed photons of light causes electrons to move from chloroplast to another location and into photosystem I. This change can be measured through the Hill reaction process that passes electrons to an alternative electron acceptor [Bio 214 Photosynthesis: 2019]. One way that you can mimic this process is by using the solution of DCIP we can measure the absorbance rate by collecting Photosystems II and transforming the color. In one study, scientists were determining the effects of detergents in photosynthetic activity in bean leaves [Jovanic:2010]. They determined that after 21 days of applying a solution of a washing powder to the leaves would result in a decrease in photosynthetic activity thus implying that this detergent can inhibit growth of plants. In a similar study on the effects of anatomical changes in bean roots in relation to detergents, they found that the influence of soaps as detergents created a mildly toxic effect on the anatomical change [Issayeva: 2015].  By using all of this, we wanted to design a study to determine the effects of soap on this electron transport process in spinach leaves. We predict that by adding a basic hand-washing soap to the spinach leaves, this detergent will destroy the chloroplast causing the electron transfer of photosystem II to decrease. 



Materials and Methods:
We started by packing a mortar and pestle, a medium sized beaker and two 50 ml centrifuge tubes in ice. After deveining four large leaves of spinach we rinsed and dried them then placed them in the mortar and added 10 ml of cold grinding buffer until it was at a thick paste. Then we added an additional 20 ml of cold grinding buffer till the spinach was at a green slurry, after reaching this stage, we strained the liquid through a cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Once strained, we poured the liquid into a centrifuge tube and placed it in the centrifuge and spun it at 200xG for 3 minutes at 4*C. We removed this liquid to a new centrifuge and spun it again to get the suspended pellet B. Then taking seven large test tubes, we labeled them: 1 blank, 3 normal and 3 soap. We turned on the spectrometer to measure the absorbance. Following the chart provided in the notebook, we added the proper solutions to each of the test tubes. These were then poured into 7 cuvettes and were correctly labeled. Each of the cuvettes were measured in nanometers of wavelength to determine the absorbance. After they were immediately placed under a lamp. We waited 10 minutes and recorded each of the absorbances again. We repeated this step two more times until we reached 30 minutes total. We calculated the percent change between the 10 minute intervals. We decided to do a two sample t-test comparing sample of chloroplast to the sample of chloroplast with addition of soap. One of the t-tests will be for the absorbance rate after 30 minutes and another will be on the percent change after 30 minutes.


Results:
Based on these results, we can see that there was a significant difference in the data of the sample chloroplast with the addition of soap. The percent change average of the sample with strictly chloroplast was 87.22% this being the control group, while the average percent change of the sample with the addition of soap was 7.04% (Fig.1). The drastic difference in this high percentage versus low percentage shows that there was in fact a change that occurred during the experiment. There is also a visible change in color from cloudy green to dark green in the sample with just chloroplast while there was little change in color with the sample of soap.


Discussion:
Based on our results shown in both Figure.1 and Table. 1, our data is statistically significant due to both p-values of absorbance 0.00861 and percent change 4.67E-6 being less than 0.05. So therefore, our hypothesis of the incorporation of a detergent, soap, did in fact destroy the chloroplast causing a decrease in absorbance. We can also conclude that soap as a detergent did decrease electron transfer activity as the results of the absorbance rates of the chloroplast with soap stayed fairly similar throughout the duration of the 30 minutes. We were able to determine  Because of this, it can also be said that the overall effects of detergents in all plants can be very harmful. Similar to the study of bean leaves, their results showed that chlorophyll in plants can be highly sensitive to detergents and these detergents cause damage of the donor aspect in photosystems II, thus creating disturbed membrane will result in loss of activity in photosystems I [Jovanic: 2010]. This study almost directly correlates to our experiment as stated earlier, there are results showing decrease in activity levels. In conclusion, we can infer that outside of the lab, there are detergents that are mostly left from human pollution, like excessive trash, incorrect placement of liquid waste that seep into the soil of the ground thus, causing damage to plant growth. There could have been experimental errors that could cause our data to be slightly incorrect like the improper use of pipetting or incorrect absorbance reading. On the other hand a future experiment that we can test could be what other types of detergents can affect a plant and how much more they are damaging than just with the addition of soap.

Figure Legends: 
Figure. 1 Average Percent Change over 30 minutes. Spinach slurry was placed into two separate groups. One with strictly chloroplast and the other had the soap detergent added. Both included a concentration of DCIP to help with color transformation of color based on photosystems II. Absorbance of the two groups was measured at 600 nm and recorded at 0 minutes to 30 minutes for every 10 minutes. Percent change was calculated in between the recorded 10 minutes.
