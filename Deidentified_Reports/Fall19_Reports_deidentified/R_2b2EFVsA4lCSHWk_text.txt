Title: Effect Juvenile Hormone has on Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

NOT NEEDED IN THIS LAB REPORT

Introduction:
In animals, the endocrine system is comprised of glands that produce and secrete hormones which regulate certain activities and development in the body. While humans are comprised of many glands and hormones, insects have three main hormones which controll development, molting, pupa formation, and adult formations. The three hormones effecting these in insects, particularly the Manduca sexta, or hornworm, are the Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Both 20E and JH have been repeatedly showing different effects on the organism. For this experiment through testing the growth and development, JH would be the appropriate hormone to test since it specifically controlls growth, development, metamorphosis, and reproduction of insects [Noriega: 2006]. When the JH levels are at the right level, it triggers the organism to go through major developmental changes which effect the type of molt.  Through the Manduca sexta life cycle of about 39-48 days long, it is reasonable to test the effects of interrupting JH through the organism’s endocrine system. If JH levels are too low, the organism will not be able to survive and grow to molt, however if the JH levels are too high, it will interfere with the organism being able to advance to the next instar, ultimately hindering the pupa. Because JH regulates growth and the type of molt during development, interfering with the organism’s normal secretions could cause notable effects. If we treat the Manduca sexta with 10 drops of JH with their food, then there will be a negative effect on the timing of their transition to the pupal stage, and they will lose weight. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we treated and observed eight Manduca sexta caterpillars over the course of two weeks. Four of the caterpillars were treated as a controll group while the other four were our experimental group. To have a baseline, we weighed each caterpillar and recorded their weight in grams the day we were given them. We separated the controll and experimental groups by placing the four of each in different containers. We then weighed about 10 grams of Manduca sexxta food for each caterpillar. The controll group’s food was treated with 10 drops of distilled water while the experimental group’s food was treated with 10 drops of JH. After putting 10 drops of either distilled water or JH with the food, we rolled the food into a neat ball and placed it in the container for the caterpillars to eat. After each of the eight caterpillars were given the right amount of food with their specific treatment, we placed them in an incubator. For the next two weeks, we measured the weight on a daily basis of each caterpillar and recorded it as well as checked for food moistness and cleaning the feces from each cube. If there was little food left, they had eaten it all, or the food was dry, we replaced it with a new 10 grams of food, with 10 drops of distilled water for the controll group and 10 drops of JH for the experimental group. We tested this experiment through a two-tailed T-test. 

Results:
The average change in weight of the experimental caterpillars treated with JH was smaller than the average change in weight of the controll caterpillars treated with distilled water. While the average change in mass for the controll group was 14.0972 grams +/-0.66 standard deviations, the  average change in mass for the experimental group was 13.16035 grams +/-1.52 standard deviations which can be seen in Figure 1. Through using a two-sample T-test, we are able to obtain more statistics which tell us more about the results of this experiment. Although the means of average change for caterpillars was higher for the controll group, this mean was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group which can be understood by the p value of .30. In the beginning, the controll group seemed to grow a lot more than the experimental group, however as the experiment progressed towards the middle to end of the second week, they caught up quicker in weight to the controll caterpillars. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that JH treated caterpillars would have a negatively timed effect on their transition to the pupal stage and that they would lose weight, was somewhat supported, but at a very slight level. Although the experimental group did not necessarily lose weight, they did not gain weight as much or as fast as the controll group, treated with distilled water, did. The p value of .30 says that the different change in growth was not statistically significent to our experiments procedures. In past studies however, JH was found to have delayed or prevent the onset of metamorphosis, type of molt, in the Manduca sexta [Williams: 1980]. This study in turn does support the claim that growth rate and transition stage timing were impacted with JH treatment. In addition, another study shows that not only could JH prevent metamorphosis of the final instar to an adult, but it has a significent effect at both the pupal and adult stage of the caterpillar [Riddiford: 2008]. These studies support our hypothesis that JH slows the growth rate in the Manduca sexta caterpillars and has negative effects on their transition stage. One way to better this experiment next time would be to obtain a group of caterpillars that were roughly the same exact starting weight to track the effects more closely. Along with equal starting weight, weighing the caterpillars at the same time every day for the two weeks rather than coming in when convenient, would benefit the observation of growth rate to closer precision.
