Title: Effects of Environment type on root to shoot ratio 

Abstract:
The goal of the experiment was to determine what soil type would give the largest mass and length root to shoot ratio in radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum). Three environments were chosen: soil, clay, and gravel. It was predicted that the soil would have the largest root to shoot ratio. Five radish seeds were planted in each environment type and the root to shoot ratio was calculated for each environment. The hypothesis was confirmed, and the soil environment type had the largest root to shoot ratio possibly because there are more nutrients in the soil for the plants to grow and acquire.

Introduction:
Plants need certain compounds, elements, and other nutrients to grow. Plants need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur from the soil in order to grow efficiently. Lack of phosphorus is the primary restraint on the production of beans in tropical environments [Xiaolong:1995]. Having a lack of nutrients causes plants to not grow as fast. Different soil types have and hold nutrients and water better than others. Such as environments that contain a lot of sand might have a lack of water in the environment. The soil type environment consisted mostly of dirt and other nutrients. The gravel type environment consisted of a mix of large and small rocks and pebbles. The clay type environment consisted of orange clay with small pebbles inside. The three environments were chosen because all three are local natural environments that plants have the potential to grow in. It was predicted that gravel would hold not hold water well and have a lack of nutrients. It was predicted that clay would not hold any usable nutrients and beneficial microbes. It was predicted soil would hold many nutrients and beneficial microbes. The plant used in this experiment is the radish or the Raphanus raphanistrum. This species was chosen because it grows fast in a variety of different environments allowing us to see how it reacts to being in varied environments. It was predicted that plants potted in the soil environment will have a longer root to shoot ratio than plants potted in the clay and gravel environments. 

Materials and Methods:
Five radishes were planted in a pot containing the soil environment type. Five radish seeds were planted in a pot containing the clay environment type. Five radish seeds were planted in a pot containing the gravel soil type. The plants were watered the same amount for two weeks. All plants were removed from their containers and their total mass was found. Next, the roots were separated from the shoots. The mass of the roots was found and then the mass of the shoots was found. The mass root to shoot ratio was found with the data found. Next, the roots and the shoots were measured for length. The lengths were used to find the length root to shoot ratio. Finally, an ANOVA statistical test was used to determine if the collected data was significant.

Results:
Table 1 shows that the soil type had a larger average root to shoot ratio for both mass and length. Figures 1 and 2 show that clay and gravel have smaller root to shoot ratios and have larger standard deviation than the soil type. An ANOVA test was used to determine statistical significance. The P-value for the mass root to shoot ratio was 0.011 with soil-clay being significant while soil-gravel and clay-gravel being insignificant. The P-value for the length root to shoot ratio was 0.003 with soil-clay being significant while soil-gravel and clay-gravel being insignificant. The average mass and length root to shoot ratio for soil were .234 (+/-0.109) g and 1.572(+/-0.416) cm. The average mass and length root to shoot ratio was .037(+/-0.018) g and .359(+/-0.102) cm. The average mass and length root to shoot ratio was .133(+/-0.121) g and 1.002(+/-0.621) cm.  

Discussion:
The hypothesis that plants potted in the soil environment would have a longer root to shoot ratio was supported. The data collected was determined to show a significant difference between the mass and length root to shoot ratios. The soil environment type had the largest root to shoot ratio for both mass and length with .234(+/-0.109) g and 1.572(+/-0.416) cm. The gravel type had the second-largest root to shoot ratios for both mass and length with .037 (+/-0.018) g and .359(+/-0.102) cm. Finally, the clay environment had the smallest root to shoot ratio with .133(+/-0.121) g and 1.002(+/-0.621) cm. Figures 1 and 2 show that the soil type environment had a larger average root to shoot ratio. The soil type could have the largest length and mass root to shoot ratio because it possibly has more nutrients and microbes in the environment would cause the roots to grow larger to gather all of the resources available. Low nutrient supply favors plants having shorter roots and more leaves while high nutrient supply favors more roots to leaves [Reynolds:1993]. The soil environment type could possibly have had a larger root to shoot ratio because it contains more nutrients. More testing in what and how much nutrients are in the soil environment would help this hypothesis. The clay and gravel environments had lower root to shoot ratios possibly because of lower nutrients in the soil and also due to issue with water. Possibly, gravel did not hold water well and only had some nutrients. Clay might have held too much water and had little to none nutrients in the environment. Possibly, having small amounts of nutrients in the environment means the plants grow smaller roots and larger shoots instead. However, in both the clay and gravel environments both the roots and the shoots were smaller compared to the soil. More research could be done into the root to shoot ratios of the gravel and clay environments to determine why they do not create root to shoot ratios as larger as the soil environment. Additionally, the research could be done into the soil environment to determine what is the best amount of nutrients in the soil to produce the optimal root to shoot ratio for plants.
