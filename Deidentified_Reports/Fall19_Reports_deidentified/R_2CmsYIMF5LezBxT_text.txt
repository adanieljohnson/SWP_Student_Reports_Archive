Title: The Effect of IGRs on Manduca Sexta Larva Growth

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
According to previous research, Manduca sexta is a kind of moth that is widespread in the Southern United States and Methoprene is a chemical analog of the Juvenile Hormone, which is used as a pesticide to controll their damage to corps [Walker, 1999]. Besides, IGR or some other Juvenile Hormone analog can prevent the larvae from adulteration if they are exposed to the hormones at the beginning of the prepupal period [Kiguchi, 1978]. Usually, before the larvae begin to form a callus, the level of Juvenile Hormone starts to drop significently and remain at a low level through the molting. The mechanism behind Juvenile Hormone analog pesticide is based on this fact.
Thus, the goal of this lab is to find out the effect of hormones (Juvenile Hormones) on the organisms (the larvae of Manduca sexta) growth. The alternative hypothesis will be that the Manduca larvae treated with extra Juvenile Hormone will experience a significent increase in weight than those treated without Juvenile Hormones. The null hypothesis will be the extra Juvenile Hormone will not introduce a significent difference in weight between the treatment groups.

Materials and Method:
Materials:
Two lids covering the boxes;
Two plastic boxes (each have four subsections) used as the cell containing the caterpillars;
Several ten-gram food blobs as the nutrition supply for caterpillars;
Five drops of water added in each food blob or five drops of IGR solvent as a source of Juvenile Hormone;
An incubator used to raise the caterpillars (providing essentially the same living condition for their living).

Method:
Eight caterpillars were selected and divided into two groups of four. They were fed with the same food (ten-gram food blob) and raised in the same incubator (growing in the condition with the same illumination, same moisture, and same temperature). One group was assigned as the controll group and the other one was assigned as the treatment group. There was no difference in the weight of the food clump (ten grams each) which was prepared with the provided food. The only difference was that five drops of water would be added to the food clumps for the controll group while five drops of IGR solution would be added to the food clumps for the treatment group. Each caterpillar was placed in one section of the plastic boxes. Two holes were poked on the wall to ensure the exchange of air. Every day, the weight of each larva was recorded in gram. As long as there was not enough food in any one of the eight sections, the food for every caterpillar would be replaced. The food was prepared as a clump to prevent the food from being dried out which would dehydrate the caterpillars.
The weight of each caterpillar was measured and documented every day. Apart from checking the food status, the dump of the caterpillars was also removed every day.
The raw data were analyzed at the end of the experiment with coupled p_value test to determine whether the null hypothesis could be rejected or not.


Results:
The experiment went on for 15 days and the graph above shows the average weight of each caterpillar group. Caterpillars in both groups had gained a lot of weight (around 1g to 14g) and there was a reduction in the activeness. Caterpillars in both groups developed horns and gained different colors over time. The caterpillars were with similar color at the start of the beginning—bright blue. But at the end of the experiment, the color of the controll group was a brighter blue, while there was a touch of green in the blue of the treatment group. On the last day of measurement, one caterpillar in the controll group was dead. As a result of which, the average weight on the last day for the controll group was calculated with three caterpillars instead of four.
The One-tailed p_value was 0.393 (analyzing the data collected with the coupled p_value test). At the beginning of the experiment, the weight of the controll group was 0.3g +/- 0.2g and that of the treatment group was 0.25h +/- 0.11g. In the end, the weight of the controll group was 13.77g +/- 0.50g and that of the treatment group was 15.35g +/- 1.05g. The largest difference in weight was on Day14: 1.925g. Based on the One-tailed p_value (0.393), the p_value was way higher than 0.05, which failed to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, I couldn’t use the experiment’s data to support the statement that the Manduca larvae treated with Juvenile Hormones will experience a significent increase in weight than those treated without Juvenile Hormones. Although, the weight of caterpillars treated with Juvenile Hormones (IGR in this case) did have a higher weight than the caterpillars treated with water.


Discussion:
There is authentic research journal showing that the Juvenile Hormone ought to impact the growth of the caterpillars with significance: if the larva is exposed to extra Juvenile, prevention for adult differentiation will occur (the growth of larva will also be impaired compared to a controll larva) [Kiguchi, 1978]. But the p-test of this experiment shows there is no significance in the difference between the weights of controll and treatment groups. In other word, the difference can be caused by chance despite that the figure shows a slightly constant higher growth rate of the treatment caterpillars.
Nevertheless, there was a difference seen in the daily growth of both groups of caterpillars (Figure 1) along with a color difference. The data and evidence are not enough to fully verify the alternative hypothesis, but they prove that the IGR does have an influence on the caterpillars as expectations. In order to obtain a more solid conclusion, more experiments and more delicate designs are necessary.
According to the method described in one journal examining the Juvenile Hormone’s effect on Manduca sexta, the larvae were allatectomized before the injection of extra Juvenile Hormone [Kiguchi, 1978]. There is a chance that due to the Juvenile Hormone that the caterpillars themselves secreted through the experiment, the IGR in the experiment group didn’t make a significent change in the hormone level.
Last but not least, the experiment ended before the larvae turned into cocoons. There was no data for if the caterpillars in the experiment group were able to undergo the adult differentiation or not. Thus, the time range of the experiment is also a reason explaining the failure of rejecting the null hypothesis.
In a word, the experiment failed to reject the null hypothesis (the extra Juvenile Hormone will not introduce a significent difference in weight between the treatment groups) despite that there were observations following the expectations of the alternative hypothesis and the conclusions to the authentic papers (the Manduca larvae treated with extra Juvenile Hormones will experience a significent increase in weight than those treated without Juvenile Hormones). More delicate design and long-time-range experiment is required to make a solid conclusion about whether extra Juvenile Hormone will prevent the adulation of the larvae or not (such as controllling the hormone secretion in the larvae bodies and extend the experiment time range).
