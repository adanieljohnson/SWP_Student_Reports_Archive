Title: Affects of Nitrate and P2O5 on Mung Bean Development

Abstract:
	The effects of nitrogen and phosphorus levels on Vigna radiata, or mung beans, was tested to see if high concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus will affect growth and development. To measure growth and development on the mung beans, the length of the roots and shoots of the plants were measured. If mung beans are grown with high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, nitrogen and phosphorus, and a controll, then the nitrate plus phosphorus pots will have a higher root to shoot ratio than the rest. The independent variables were concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus used to water each pot of mung beans. Our controll group was given just water. Our dependent variable was the root to shoot length ratio in the mung beans. The results showed that the group given Nitrate and p2o5 had the highest root to shoot ratio in comparison to the rest of the groups. Therefore the experiment did show that mung beans given both nitrate and p2o5 in equal concentrations would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the other groups. In other experiments it is important other variables are consistent across all groups, like amount of sunlight, to have reliable results.

Introduction:
	Mung beans were the focus of this experiment and were used due to availability and rate of growth. Mung beans have roots and shoots like all other plants. The plants shoots are made up of the stem and leaves of the plant. Stems are the principal supporting structure of the shoot. They are involved in light capture and competition through lifting the plant up [Johnson: 2018]. Roots not only serve as the primary absorptive organ, but they also anchor the plant to the soil [Johnson: 2018]. Part of plant growth is energy is taken in from the sun by the leaves. Leaves are the principal photosynthetic organ of the plant and increased with allocation of resources to leaves leads to plants with a high growth rate when light and soil nutrients are plentiful [Johnson: 2018]. If there is a high abundance of nutrients and a good source of sunlight, the plant will express longer root length while keeping a smaller shoot. This process of changing the allocation of resources based on environmental conditions is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson:2018]. The phenotypic plasticity is measured via root to shoot ratios of length and weight. This experiment focuses on the root to shoot ratio of length. The independent variable is different nutrients given to each group; Nitrate and p2o5. The dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio for just the length. With an abundance of soil nutrients, it can be expected that the mung beans treated with both nitrate and p2o5 will have longer root systems and shooter shoots.

Materials and Method:
First, mung beans were soaked in water for 24 hours and 8 pots, Nitrate, and p2o5 were acquired. 48 mung bean seeds were divided into 4 groups with 12 seeds and 6 seeds per pot each. 2 seeds were placed in each of the four holes made in the pots. Group 1 was treated with 50 Ml of a 20% p2o5 solution. Group 2 was treated with 50 Ml of a 32% nitrate solution. Group 3 was treated with 25 Ml of the nitrate solution and 25 Ml of p2o5. Group 1 was our controll that was watered with 50 Ml of water. After 2 weeks of treatment data was collected. The plants were removed and washed in water to remove any soil left on the roots. Then, the 4 plants that sprouted from each pot were measured. Both the shoot and root were measured. Using the measurements from each group the root to shoot ratio for length was calculated. 

Results:
In the data, it can be seen that the root to shoot ratio in the group treated with nitrate and p2o5 was significently higher than the rest of the groups. Figure 1 reveals our controll group had a root to shoot ratio lower than all of the other groups treated. Statistical testing supports this. Stats show that when an anova is done that our P value is below .05 (p=.041) and therefore we reject the null hypothesis and prove there is a difference within our data. As Figure 2 shows, the controll was given zero nutrients, and it remained the lowest root to shoot. General trends showed an increase in root to shoot ratio with an increase in nutrients.

Discussion:
The results supported the original hypothesis because the addition of both nitrate and p2o5 yielded higher root to shoot ratios in the plants treated with it. With an abundance of nutrients in the soil and plenty of sunlight, the plants grew deep into the ground, allocating much of their resources to their root growth. The controll group was just given water and could not compete with the plants given high volumes of nutrients. Group 3 in particular had an extremely high root to shoot ratio because of the concentration and combination of nutrients it was given. The root to shoot ratio in Groups 1 and 2 were much lower than group 3 but still showed an increase in root to shoot ratio versus the controll. Although, this could be due to sampling/experimental error. Another set of mung beans was added to the pots after the first week due to limited germination among the seeds. This could have affected our plants and their root to shoot ratios.
