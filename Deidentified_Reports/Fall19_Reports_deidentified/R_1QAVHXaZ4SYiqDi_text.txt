Title: Comparative analysis of length (cm) of Manduca treated with the growth hormone precorvs. untreated

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera. It lives for around 30 to 50 days and goes through four major stages of development throughout its life, from the embryo, to the larvae, to the pupa, and finally to the adult. One important aspect of Manduca sexta is that it has a holometabolous lifestyle, meaning that from the larvae to adult stages in its life, it undergoes a complete transformation in its body so that the adult stage looks completely different from the larvae stage [Johnson 2016]. The most relevant aspect about Manduca sexta in regards to this experiment is the developmental stages it undergoes throughout its life. Its four major stages are controllled by three hormones: Prothoracicotropic Hormone, Ecdysterone (E20) and Juvenile Hormone. 
This experiment will focus on the effects of Ecdysterone and Junvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta. Ecdysterone is a hormone that is secreted by groups of cells in the head and thorax called prothoracic glands. These glands regulate the timing of the molt during Manduca’s development. The other main hormone, Juvenile hormone, is produced in the corpus allata and it regulates the type of molt that occurs.
For this experiment the hypothesis states: The use of growth hormone, specifically, Precor 1: 1250, will speed up the development of Manduca sexta. Moreover, the use of Precor will make the affected Manduca longer in length than the unaffected Manduca.
The null states: The use of growth hormone will have no effect on the growth of Manduca sexta
In general, Manduca sexta is considered an agricultural pest, as it feeds on important crops such as tobacco and tomato. It is also considered to be a model organism in experiments regarding insect development and pathogenesis since they are fairly large and can be handled with ease [UFL 2018].  Working with hormones that controll and manipulate Manduca’s development allow scientists to potentially speed up its development so that the pest form can be transformed into the adult form. Moreover, the development of JH analog insecticides that target the endocrine system of the pest allow scientists to disrupt insect development and prevent egg hatching of Manduca Sexta [El-Sheihk 2016]. 


Materials and Method:
Materials: Materials included in the experiment were: water, eight Manduca sexta, Manduca food, Precor 1: 1250, containers for the Manduca, ruler, and measuring plate. 
The experiment consisted of two groups. One controll group consisting of four Manduca and the treatment group consisting of another four Manduca. Each Manduca was placed in its own box within a container. The controll group was given three drops of water each day and was placed in their food. The treatment group received three drops of Precor 1: 1250 in their food. 10g of food was provided and replenished each day along with either three drops of the controll or treatment. Each day, the Manduca were measured in cm using a ruler. The Manduca were stretched out to the farthest of their ability and their length was recorded.  After they were measured, the Manduca were placed within their container and placed within a refrigerator that maintained a constant temperature of 22.5 degrees Celsius. This procedure occurred for a total of fifteen days. In order to compare the data between the controll and treatment at the end of the experiment, a one-tailed t_test was used. A line graph was used to measure the increase in length over time comparing the controll and treatment groups. 


Results:
Since, the lengths of the Manduca were taken each day, the data for the controll group and the treatment group was averaged so that the means of both the treatment and controll groups could be compared. 
Looking at figure 1, both the controll and treatment Manduca experienced significent growth over the span of fifteen days. There were not significent differences in the lengths of the Manduca. The controll group, represented with blue, trailed the treatment group slightly until around day thirteen where it overtook the treatment group (in orange) in terms of mean length of Manduca. There does not seem to be a significent difference between the controll and treatment groups. However, on day 6, one of the controlls died. As well, on day 12, another controll died. These were the only Manduca that died. A one sample t_test was performed and a value of .00017 was recorded. 

Discussion:
The results from the experiment suggest that there is no difference between the lengths in Manduca when one is treated with Precor while the other is given just water. The data from the graph also demonstrates this point as toward the end of the experiment, the controll group mean average for length was actually greater than the treatment group. One reason for this could be because only three drops of Precor were used. If more drops of Precor were added to the food, there might have been a greater difference in lengths of the two groups. Another confounding variable is that length is hard to measure. Manduca sexta do not like to be stretched out as far as possible and try to shrink so as to protect themselves. This made data collection hard and length’s subject to error. 
In Manduca sexta, Juvenile Hormone is a mechanism that prevents PTTH from being released. Only when Juvenile hormone levels drop is PTTH released and the larvae can produce its final molt. The use of Juvenile hormone then during this stage where PTTH is supposed to release creates another bigger larval instar stage [Kiguchi 1978]. Thus, based on this information, the treatment group receiving the growth hormone should not necessarily be bigger than those that receive the treatment but rather remain in the larval stage longer than the controll group. Furthermore, the p_value of .0017 demonstrates that the results of the experiment were not random but rather demonstrative of the elements of the experiment. 
Based off of this information about Juvenile hormone and its regulation of PTTH, it would be interesting to conduct this experiment in the same manner but for a longer duration of time to see whether the final molt for Manduca occurs and at what specific point in relation to a controll group that receives no Precor. This would mean that the hypothesis would change to reflect this idea of the treatment group molting into another larval instar while the controll group enacts its final molt.

The treatment group was comprised of four Manduca who received three droplets of Precor each day. The blue line represents the controll group which received three droplets of water each day. Lengths of the Manduca were measured from the head to the end of its body. Each dot represents the mean length of the Manduca each day.
