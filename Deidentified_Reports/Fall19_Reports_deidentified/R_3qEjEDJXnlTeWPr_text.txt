Title: Effect of adding solutions of different pH on Vigna Radiata growth patterns

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an essential concept for evolutionary biologists to understand the power of resource limitation as a selective force. It is simply the pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources. The goal of this lab was to examine the allocations in mung beans and measure the growth of their roots and shoots in solutions of different pH. The hypothesis was that mung beans grown in alkaline and acidic solutions would have a higher root to shoot length ratio than when grown in water due to buffers limiting the entry of other nutrients into the mung bean roots. In a greenhouse setting, the mung beans were planted in nine pots (3 for each group). For the first 4 days, all plants received tap water, and for the remaining 10 days, the plants in pots “acidic” given pH 3 buffer solution, the plants in “basic” pH 10 buffer, and the control group tapwater. After two weeks, the lengths and weights of the roots and shoots were measured. The roots grew more than the shoots in acidic and alkaline environments than in control due to induced nutrient limitation, and their means were statistically significant (by two-sample t-tests). This supports our hypothesis and is supported by a study on acid rain, in that it inhibits the growth of shoots of plants.

Introduction:
In any ecological community in general, the essential resources for plant interaction and growth are not unlimited. Nevertheless, resource limitation affects what species are present in a community. Resource allocation is an essential concept for evolutionary biologists to appreciate the power of resource limitation as a selective force. It is simply the pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources [Johnson: 2019]. Plants vary in how they allocate energy and metabolic resources among their different plants. Additionally, they can alter how they allocate resources based on environmental conditions (phenotypic plasticity). A specific species of interest is the Vigna Radiata, more commonly known as mung beans. A resource allocation experiment was carried out a week prior to this lab, involving mung beans in sunny and shade environments, that resulted in mung beans grown in sunny conditions having a larger root to shoot length ratio than those grown in the shade in light of the fact that, similarly to plants in arid chaparrals, resources that are less limited (sunlight and carbon dioxide) help transfer sugars from photosynthesis from shoot to root which will cause the roots to grow more [Pitelka: 1980]. The primary objective of this lab was to examine the growth patterns of mung beans and measure the growth of their roots and shoots in acidic, basic, and normal conditions. The hypothesis for this experiment was that mung bean seedlings grown in solution would have a higher root to shoot ratio than when grown in water, because the solutions will limit the entry of other nutrients into the roots that were supposed to be transferred to the shoots, therefore the sugars transferred from the shoot to the root will cause the root to grow more, increasing the root to shoot ratio. 

Materials and Methods:
The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse setting with three groupings - nine 4x4 inch pots -  of plants: three pots for the acidic treatment, three for the basic treatment, and three for control. The mung bean seeds were soaked prior to being added to the pre-watered pots filled with vermiculite and 50mL Miracle-Gro. An indentation was made in the vermiculite about 2 times the size of the seeds before they were planted. The planted seeds, nine seeds per pot, were covered gently with vermiculite in all three pots and were monitored every 24 hours for two weeks. For the first four days, all plants received tap water, and for the remaining ten days, the plants in the pot labeled “acidic” received 300mL pH 3 buffer solution, the plants in “basic” received 300mL pH 10 buffer solution, and the control group received 500mL tap water daily. After two weeks, two replicates of each pot were uprooted and their roots and shoots were separated by cutting and were measured and recorded separately by length (using a cm ruler) and weight. Multiple two-sample t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of the means between each treatment group in comparison to the control group.

Results:
The results of the experiment are outlined in the figures as follows. The mean root to shoot length ratio of the mung beans in the acid group (1.38 +/- 0.29) was higher than that of the mung beans in the control group (0.93 +/- 0.22); that is, the roots of the mung beans in the acid group grew more relative to the shoot than the roots of the mung beans in the control group [Figure 1]. Additionally, the mean of the acid group was statistically significantly different than that of the control group (t-stat = 3.06, df = 10, P = 0.012). Also, the mean root to shoot length ratio of the mung beans in the alkaline group (1.24 +/- 0.10) was higher than that of the mung beans in the control group, with a statistically significant difference between them (t-stat = 3.22, df = 10, P = 0.0091).

Discussion:
After observing the Vigna Radiata growth and collecting data, it was concluded from the fact that mung beans in basic and acidic solutions had a larger root to shoot ratio than those in the control group, with statistically significant differences in their means, that the hypothesis was supported. This could be because the presence of acidic and basic solutions weeds out or limits nutrients like potassium, magnesium, and calcium that are present in the vermiculite which prevented them from entering the roots of the mung bean plants and thus prevented the potential allocation of the nutrients to the growth of the shoots [Batish: 2008]. Additionally, since this experiment was carried out in a greenhouse setting, resources like solar energy and carbon dioxide from the air were relatively abundant, resulting in increased allocation of these resources to root growth and storage, which accounted for the increased root to shoot length ratio compared to that of the replicates in the control group. This conclusion is supported by a study on an important environmental topic: acid rain. In certain parts of the northeastern United States, acid rain - rain with pH 3 or 4, similar to the acidic buffer solution used in this experiment - is falling more frequently and inhibiting the growth of numerous plant species [Likens: 1974]. The experiment done on Vigna Radiata demonstrates how serious acid rain is, and environmental pollution as a whole. For that reason, actions must be taken to prevent acid rain such as reducing the emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. In addition, future experiments have the potential to be performed on how plants could continue to grow normally, even with the presence of acidic/basic solutions.
