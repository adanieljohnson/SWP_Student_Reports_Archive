Title: Changing the environment color did not exhibit significant differences in the aggression of Betta splendens

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior is called ethology. Siamese fighting fish are good species for observing behavior because they use a lot of their energy on behaviors that display aggression. In this experiment, we tested the effects of water color on the amount of time it takes for male Betta splendens to initiate aggressive behavior. We tested three conditions: a control, a light color, and a dark color of water. The results indicate that there was not a statistically significant difference in behavior between each condition. This may have been due to habituation: keeping the fish in the presence of each other for long periods of time with little rest, which results in avoidant behavior between the fish. Furthermore, there seemed to have been no previous studies on the effect of water color on aggression, and perhaps it may not be an important factor in determining behavior in this species.

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of behavior in animals. To better understand the physiological purpose behind animal behaviors, they must first be observed. Species like Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) demonstrate different behaviors, including color changes, posture changes, and size changes to communicate something to members of the same species. Males, for example, flare their gills and move their fins in a recognizable pattern, overall displaying aggressive behavior, in the presence of males (and females). This here is called intraspecific behavior, which occurs between members of the same species. In bettas, the two main types of behaviors are broadside and facing movements. [Johnson: 2019]. Broadside behavior refers to movements in which a fish turns on its side when it perceives the presence of another fish whereas facing movements are more aggressive, in which a fish directly faces its opponent. What typically happens when two male betta fish interact, if left for a long time, is that they will cause substantial harm to each other until one establishes dominance. The subordinate one will then attempt to flee the dominant one. If the fish are physically separated but can still see each other, they will display aggressive behavior, but after a while, they experience habituation. [Meliska: 1980]. In this experiment, we will be examining aggressive behaviors in bettas under normal circumstances and under colored water. We hypothesize that because of higher visibility, the fish will display aggressive behaviors faster in normal water than in dyed water.

Materials and Methods:
In the experiment there were three environmental conditions under which the behavior of 2 blue male betta fish was observed. For each condition, the tank was filled about halfway with water. One condition was in a tank with no food dye (the control). The others were two different food dyes: yellow under one condition and blue under another one. For the tanks with food dye, 4 drops of dye were added to the tank for each color. The fish were placed in the tank separated by an opaque, plexiglass divider. This divider was then removed, and a timer was started when the fish noticed each other. The timer was stopped at the sign of the first aggressive behavior, and the time was recorded. The fish were then separated again and left to rest for 5 minutes to impede habituation. This was repeated for 3 more trials for a total of 4 trials per condition (conditions: no food dye, yellow dye, and blue dye).  Our controls included using the same 2 fish, placing the tank in the same location, and maintaining a constant water temperature. To analyze the results of the experiment, an ANOVA with a Tukey Kramer post-hoc test was used because we wanted to figure out whether there was a significant difference in the time it took to act aggressively under 3 conditions.

Results:
The mean amount of time for the fish to show aggressive behavior in the control tank was 13.5sec +/- 2.38. This value was 44.25sec +/- 27.76 in the blue dye tank and in the tank with yellow dye it was 37.25sec +/-38.0. (Figure 1). The amount of time it took for the fish to display aggression was not statistically significantly different among all three conditions (df=3, p-value=0.295). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by the results. With a p-value higher than the alpha value of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that environment color does not produce statistically significantly different result in the behavior of betta fish. While a significant difference was not seen, the control group had, on average, lower times to start aggressive behavior. The fact that it was not significant may be attributed to 1. low sample size, 2. habituation, or 3. one of the fish used was overall very submissive throughout the course of the experiment. When we first obtained our fishes, both fish were relatively calm, so we had to exchange one for a more aggressive fish. Perhaps in a future experiment, it may be important to pay attention to use fish that are aggressive. In this experiment, one had established dominance and it was clear in the way the subordinate fish swam away and got away from the dominant fish. When testing the last condition (yellow food dye), we noticed that the time the fish took to display aggression was very different for each trial, and this may have been because of habituation. To prevent this from happening next time, we will have to leave a longer rest time between each trial. In a previous study, after a few days of exposure to a male betta fish and some models, a male betta developed an avoidance response and therefore experienced habituation. [Rhoad: 1975]. There seemed to be no previous studies that observe the effect of water color on betta fish behavior. In a 2008 study on Betta splendens, fish of the same color were found to be less aggressive toward each other than to fish of different colors. [Pauers: 2008]. In future experiments, we could instead look at differences in behavior of betta fish depending on their color. Overall, this experiment helped us understand that avoidant behavior in betta fish is dependent on the amount of time it is exposed to another betta fish. The effect of environment color on this species may not be too important when it comes to behavior.
